## Question

Temiflu is metabolized by which cytochrome P450 enzyme?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cytochrome P450 enzyme metabolizes Tamiflu (oseltamivir). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "Temiflu" refers to Tamiflu and confirm the active ingredient. Then, I should verify the primary metabolic pathway and whether CYP450s are involved at all. Next, I will review which enzyme bioactivates oseltamivir and how the active metabolite is cleared. Finally, I should double-check drug–drug interaction and special population data to ensure there isn't a hidden or minor CYP route I'm overlooking [^112b5BZC] [^112Wdk6B].

> Let me first confirm the drug identity; "Temiflu" is almost certainly a misspelling of Tamiflu, which is the brand name for oseltamivir phosphate, an oral neuraminidase inhibitor for influenza A and B treatment and prophylaxis, so I should proceed using oseltamivir as the target compound [^113HkGoM] [^114Vsn6K].

> Now, I need to check the core metabolism statement from the FDA label because that is the highest-credibility source; oseltamivir is a prodrug that is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver, which indicates hydrolysis rather than oxidative CYP metabolism, so I shouldn't assume any CYP involvement here without contrary data [^112b5BZC] [^112Wdk6B] [^111CUuGt] [^112B21Gr].

> Wait, let me verify the explicit CYP language; the FDA labeling states that neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms, which directly answers the question by excluding CYP-mediated metabolism for both the prodrug and its active metabolite [^112b5BZC] [^112Wdk6B] [^111CUuGt].

> I should confirm the specific bioactivating enzyme; mechanistic and pharmacogenetic data show that human carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) catalyzes oseltamivir hydrolysis to oseltamivir carboxylate, and CES1 genetic variation can modulate the carboxylate-to-parent exposure ratio, reinforcing that the pathway is esterase-dependent rather than CYP-dependent [^115E1iaR] [^115gyFAN] [^1132ycws].

> Next, I will examine the fate of the active metabolite; oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in urine, with renal excretion accounting for essentially all clearance of the active moiety, which further argues against any secondary CYP contribution downstream of activation [^112b5BZC] [^112Wdk6B] [^114Vsn6K].

> Hold on, I should review drug–drug interaction evidence to see if any CYP-mediated signals appear; the label notes no meaningful CYP-based interactions and highlights that probenecid increases oseltamivir carboxylate exposure via inhibition of renal tubular secretion, not CYP effects, while coadministration studies with baloxavir show no clinically significant PK changes with oseltamivir, again consistent with the absence of CYP involvement [^111CUuGt] [^115V6CWB].

> Let me consider special populations to ensure no hidden CYP pathway emerges; dosing guidance emphasizes renal function adjustments due to renal elimination, while mild to moderate hepatic impairment does not require dose changes, aligning with esterase-mediated activation and negligible CYP clearance, which I should keep in mind when evaluating potential CYP inhibitor or inducer coadministration scenarios [^1173eiNS] [^115dn77P] [^1142HdTc] [^114jWuKe] [^114BNNRY] [^115KxEaa].

> I should double-check the in vitro characterization; the FDA review reports that neither oseltamivir nor its carboxylate is a good substrate for P450 mixed-function oxidases or for glucuronyl transferases, which closes the loop on possible minor oxidative or conjugative routes that could confound clinical DDI expectations [^111CUuGt].

> Conclusion: Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes; it is bioactivated by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) to oseltamivir carboxylate, which undergoes no further metabolism and is excreted unchanged in urine, so CYP450 enzymes do not contribute to the clearance of either the parent drug or the active metabolite [^112b5BZC] [^112Wdk6B] [^111CUuGt] [^115E1iaR].

---

Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is **not metabolized by any CYP450 enzyme** [^112b5BZC]. It is converted to its active metabolite by hepatic esterases [^115E1iaR], and neither oseltamivir nor its active metabolite is a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of CYP450 isoforms. Thus, there is **no clinically significant CYP450 interaction risk** with Tamiflu [^111CUuGt].

---

## Metabolic pathway of oseltamivir

Oseltamivir is a **prodrug** [^112B21Gr] that requires metabolic activation to exert its antiviral effects. The primary pathway is hydrolysis [^115gyFAN] by hepatic esterases — predominantly **carboxylesterase 1 (CES1)** [^112b5BZC] [^115E1iaR] — which converts oseltamivir to its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate [^111CUuGt]. This active metabolite inhibits influenza virus **neuraminidase** [^112kYqUT], thereby preventing the release of viral particles from infected cells.

---

## Role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in oseltamivir metabolism

Extensive in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated [^112b5BZC] that neither oseltamivir nor its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, is **a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer** of cytochrome P450 enzymes [^111CUuGt]. The relationship between oseltamivir and CYP450 enzymes can be summarized as follows:

- **No CYP450 involvement**: Oseltamivir is not metabolized by any CYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, or CYP2B6 [^112Wdk6B] [^111CUuGt].

- **No inhibition or induction**: Oseltamivir does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes, minimizing the risk of drug-drug interactions mediated by these enzymes [^112b5BZC].

- **Primary metabolism by esterases**: The conversion of oseltamivir to its active metabolite is exclusively mediated by hepatic esterases, predominantly CES1 [^115gyFAN] [^115E1iaR].

---

## Clinical implications of CYP450-independent metabolism

The **absence of CYP450 involvement** in oseltamivir metabolism has several important clinical implications:

- **Minimal drug-drug interactions**: Oseltamivir's metabolism [^112b5BZC] is unlikely to be affected by co-administered drugs that inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes, reducing the risk of clinically significant drug interactions [^111CUuGt].

- **Consistent pharmacokinetics**: Oseltamivir exhibits consistent pharmacokinetic properties across different patient populations, including pediatric, adult, and geriatric patients, due to the lack of CYP450-mediated variability.

- **No dose adjustment required**: Since oseltamivir is not metabolized by CYP450 enzymes [^112b5BZC], no dose adjustments are necessary when co-administered with CYP450 inhibitors or inducers [^111CUuGt].

## Summary of oseltamivir metabolism

| **Metabolic pathway** | **Enzyme involved** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary metabolism | Hepatic esterases (CES1) | Conversion to active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate) [^115E1iaR] |
| CYP450 metabolism | None [^112Wdk6B] | No involvement; no drug-drug interactions |
| Excretion | Renal elimination | Oseltamivir carboxylate eliminated unchanged in urine [^112b5BZC] |

---

## Conclusion

Tamiflu (oseltamivir) is **not metabolized by any CYP450 enzyme** [^112Wdk6B]. Its metabolism is exclusively mediated by hepatic esterases, specifically **carboxylesterase 1 (CES1)** [^115E1iaR]. This CYP450-independent metabolism significantly reduces the risk of drug-drug interactions and ensures consistent pharmacokinetic properties across patient populations.

- **Elimination**: Absorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90%) eliminated by conversion to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir declined with a half-life of 1 to 3 hours in most subjects after oral administration. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in urine. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate declined with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects after oral administration.

- **Metabolism**: Oseltamivir is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized. Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms.

- **Excretion**: Oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated entirely (> 99%) by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 L/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/h), indicating that tubular secretion (via organic anion transporter) occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20% of an oral radiolabeled dose is eliminated in feces.

### Carboxylesterase 1 polymorphism impairs oseltamivir bioactivation in humans [^115E1iaR]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The bioactivation of the antiviral agent oseltamivir to active oseltamivir carboxylate is catalyzed by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). After screening 860 healthy Finnish volunteers for the CES1 c.428G > A (p. Gly143Glu, rs121912777) polymorphism, a pharmacokinetic study with 75 mg oseltamivir was conducted in c.428G > A carriers and noncarriers. Heterozygous c.428GA carriers (n = 9) exhibited 18% larger values of oseltamivir area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0-∞)) (P = 0.025) and a 23% smaller carboxylate-to-oseltamivir AUC(0-∞) ratio (P = 0.006) than noncarriers (n = 12). This demonstrates that the CES1 c.428G > A polymorphism impairs oseltamivir bioactivation in humans.

### Genome-wide discovery of drug-dependent human liver regulatory elements [^114zXvP7]. PLOS Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions to drug treatment constitute a substantial health problem that is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Differential expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters is a major determinant of inter-individual drug response variability. By sequestering and metabolizing drug compounds in the liver and intestine, these enzymes and transporters effectively determine whether target organs and tissues are exposed to optimal drug dosages. Several coding mutations in these proteins have been detected, which lead to adverse outcomes and reduced drug activity. Regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancers, also likely play an important role that has so far been largely uncharacterized. The systematic identification of drug-responsive regulatory elements would thus provide a unique resource to discover novel genetic variants that lead to differences in drug response.

The vast majority of pharmaceutical compounds are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family (CYP) of enzymes. Of these, CYP3A4 is the most abundantly expressed in sites of drug disposition in the liver and is also thought to be responsible for the metabolism of at least 50% of prescribed pharmaceuticals. CYP3A4 activity can vary 5–20 fold between individuals, and its mRNA expression can vary as much as 120 fold. Only a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the immediate CYP3A4 locus have been found to be associated with CYP3A4 hepatic expression, suggesting that its variable expression could be caused by other genes and distant regulatory elements.

### Clinical studies on drug-drug interactions involving metabolism and transport: Methodology, pitfalls, and interpretation [^112yzM8N]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

The most important property of an index substrate for drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies is its sensitivity to the specific pharmacokinetic pathway being investigated. In the context of drug-metabolizing enzymes, the fraction metabolized by the enzyme should optimally exceed 80%, allowing for an over fivefold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) when the enzyme is completely inhibited. Furthermore, other disposition mechanisms of the index substrate should be known in detail, especially in cases where the perpetrator has the potential to cause interactions via other mechanisms.

The properties of the substrate should also be suitable for a thorough characterization of its pharmacokinetic parameters in a clinical study. Most importantly, the elimination half-life (t 1/2) of the probe should be sufficiently short to avoid unnecessarily long sample collection, which is needed to cover 80–90% of its total AUC, and the washout period. From this point of view, efavirenz, warfarin, and desipramine are far from ideal index substrates. If it is important to quantify a transient effect on enzyme activity, an index drug with extensive first-pass metabolism and a short t 1/2 should be preferred.

An optimal index substrate exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and has no effects on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. Tolerability and lack of toxicity are also key issues, and the safety margin should be large enough to accommodate several-fold changes in exposure.

### Systematic and quantitative assessment of the effect of chronic kidney disease on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 [^117SHQ5f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Selection of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 model drugs**: The University of Washington Metabolism and Transport Drug Interaction Database (DIDB) and the FDA's new drug application (NDA) reviews (Drugs@FDA) were searched to identify a comprehensive list of potential model drugs for individual elimination pathways. For our purposes, a model drug was defined as one predominantly cleared by a specific CYP isozyme in vivo, based on an experimentally derived area under the concentration–time curve ratio (AUCR) from DDI or pharmacogenetics studies.

The DIDB was first curated for in vitro or in vivo substrates of major CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4/5). To include newly developed drugs not incorporated in the DIDB at the time of data curation (17 Dec. 2014), NDA reviews of recently approved small molecule drugs (approved between 2014 and July 2015) were also surveyed. In total, 937 drugs were collected as potential model drugs.

For each of the 937 drugs, available DDI studies with typical inhibitors for a specific pathway, as defined below, and CYP2D6 pharmacogenetic studies were examined. Typical inhibitors used in this study were fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, and terbinafine for CYP2D6, and clarithromycin, cyclosporine, erythromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, troleandomycin, and voriconazole for CYP3A4/5. If a drug showed a predefined criterion of AUCR of ≥ 3 between the presence and absence of one of the typical inhibitors, the drug was identified as a model drug.

### The importance of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP2D6 in palliative medicine [^113rE3LQ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

The enzymes in the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system (CYP) are the major enzymes responsible for metabolizing medications. The CYP2D6 isomer is responsible for metabolizing certain opioids, neuroleptics, antidepressants, and cardiac medications. Owing to CYP2D6's low capacity and high affinity, it is easily saturated by substrate and/or inhibited, resulting in pharmacokinetic interactions. Polymorphisms of the structural gene are common, leading to wide inter-individual and ethnic differences in drug metabolism. Clinically important drug interactions, which may be anticipated in the palliative medicine population, are reviewed.

### ESMO clinical practice guideline express update on the management of metastatic pancreatic cancer [^117Y9quM]. ESMO Open (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pancreatic cancer, more specifically with respect to the management of advanced/metastatic disease, first-line therapy, ESMO 2025 guidelines recommend offering FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) or NALIRIFOX (leucovorin, fluorouracil, nanoliposomal irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with an ECOG performance status of 0–1, a bilirubin level of < 1.5 times the ULN, and no major comorbidities.

### Prostaglandins and inflammation [^1118XiMo]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

Prostaglandins are lipid autacoids derived from arachidonic acid. They sustain both homeostatic functions and mediate pathogenic mechanisms, including the inflammatory response. These compounds are generated from arachidonate through the action of cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, and their biosynthesis is blocked by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including those selective for inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2.

Despite the clinical efficacy of these drugs, prostaglandins may function in both the promotion and resolution of inflammation. This review summarizes insights into the mechanisms of prostaglandin generation and the roles of individual mediators and their receptors in modulating the inflammatory response. Prostaglandin biology has potential clinical relevance for atherosclerosis, the response to vascular injury, and aortic aneurysm.

### Identification of genetic variants of human cytochrome P450 2D6 with impaired mitochondrial targeting [^116pDqv3]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is responsible for the metabolism of approximately 20% of drugs in common clinical use. The CYP2D6 gene locus is highly polymorphic. Many of the polymorphisms have been shown to be clinically relevant and can account for inter-individual differences in the metabolism of specific drugs. In addition to the established sources of variability in CYP2D6-dependent drug metabolism, a recent study in our laboratory identified CYP2D6 in the mitochondria of human liver samples and found that it is metabolically active in this novel location.

In the present study, we show that mutations are present in the targeting signal region of CYP2D6 that may help to account for the inter-individual variability observed previously in the level of the mitochondrial enzyme in human liver samples. These mutations were identified within the ER targeting domain, the proline-rich domain, as well as the putative protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC)-specific phosphorylation sites. In vitro studies demonstrate that the mutations identified in the targeting signals affect the efficiency of mitochondrial targeting of CYP2D6.

Since the mitochondrial enzyme has been shown to be active in drug metabolism, this pharmacogenetic variation could play a role in modulating the response of an individual to drug therapy.

### Phenylketonuria [^113FrQB5]. Lancet (2010). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on phenylketonuria:

- **Definition**: Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the PAH gene, resulting in a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.

- **Pathophysiology**: Phenylketonuria is caused by a mutation in the PAH gene, most commonly a missense mutation, resulting in a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the body, causing brain dysfunction if untreated. In classic phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is absent or significantly reduced, while in mild phenylketonuria or mild hyperphenylalaninemia, partial enzymatic activity is preserved. The accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites triggers several biochemical changes involved in the pathogenesis of brain damage, including reduced activity of pyruvate kinase, HMG-CoA reductase, and monoamine oxidase B, along with impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission and hypomyelination.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of phenylketonuria is estimated at 1 in 15,000 live births in the US and 1 in 100,000 live births in Europe.

- **Disease course**: Phenylketonuria is typically detected through newborn screening, enabling early intervention. If left untreated, it can lead to seizures, eczema, intellectual disability, behavioral disturbances with autistic traits, parkinsonism, musty body odor, and reduced skin and hair pigmentation.

### Decoding the selective chemical modulation of CYP3A4 [^114MWxNm]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Drug-drug interactions are associated with the concurrent use of multiple medications. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolizes a significant portion of marketed drugs. To maintain the efficacy of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, pan-CYP3A inhibitors, such as ritonavir, are often co-administered. Although selective CYP3A4 inhibitors offer greater therapeutic benefits by avoiding the inhibition of unintended CYPs and preventing undesirable clinical consequences, the high homology between CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 has hindered the development of such selective inhibitors.

Here, we report a series of selective CYP3A4 inhibitors with scaffolds identified by high-throughput screening. Structural, functional, and computational analyses reveal that the differential C-terminal loop conformations and two distinct ligand binding surfaces disfavor the binding of selective CYP3A4 inhibitors to CYP3A5. The structure-guided design of compounds validates the model and yields analogs that are selective for CYP3A4 versus other major CYPs. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of selectively inhibiting CYP3A4 and provide guidance for designing better CYP3A4 selective inhibitors.

### Neuraminidase inhibitor resistance in influenza viruses [^112kYqUT]. Journal of Medical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Zanamivir and oseltamivir, the currently marketed influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), are prescribed for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and are being stockpiled for pandemic influenza. Oseltamivir resistance has been reported in up to 2% of patients in clinical trials of oseltamivir and in up to 18% of treated children. There are also reports in at least three patients treated with oseltamivir for influenza A (H5N1) infections. At this stage, there are no reports of resistance occurring to zanamivir in immunocompetent patients.

Zanamivir and oseltamivir bind differently at the neuraminidase catalytic site and this contributes to different drug resistance profiles. The magnitude and duration of NAI concentrations at the site of infection are also expected to be important factors and are determined by route and timing of drug administration, dose, and pharmacokinetic differences between patients. In addition, the type, strain, and virulence of the influenza strain and the nature of the immune response all appear to play a role in determining the likelihood of drug resistance arising.

The clinical significance of a particular NAI-resistant isolate from a patient is often not clear, but virus viability and transmissibility are clearly important characteristics. Early initiation of NAI treatment in suspected cases of influenza is important for maximizing efficacy and minimizing the risk of drug resistance. Higher NAI doses and longer periods of treatment may be required for patients with influenza A (H5N1) infections, but further work is needed in this area.

### The effect of cytochrome P450 metabolism on drug response, interactions, and adverse effects [^113WsG6s]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are essential for the metabolism of many medications. Although this class has more than 50 enzymes, six of them metabolize 90 percent of drugs, with the two most significant enzymes being CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Genetic variability (polymorphism) in these enzymes may influence a patient's response to commonly prescribed drug classes, including beta blockers and antidepressants.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes can be inhibited or induced by drugs, resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse reactions or therapeutic failures. Interactions with warfarin, antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and statins often involve the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Knowledge of the most important drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, as well as the most potent inhibiting and inducing drugs, can help minimize the possibility of adverse drug reactions and interactions. Although genotype tests can determine if a patient has a specific enzyme polymorphism, it has not been determined if routine use of these tests will improve outcomes.

### Fluvoxamine maleate [^112ETPWA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Multiple hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative biotransformation of a large number of structurally different drugs and endogenous compounds. The available knowledge concerning the relationship of fluvoxamine and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system has been obtained mostly from pharmacokinetic interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers, but some preliminary in vitro data are also available. Based on a finding of substantial interactions of fluvoxamine with certain of these drugs (see later parts of this section and also Warnings and Precautions [5] for details) and limited in vitro data for CYP3A4, it appears that fluvoxamine inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that are known to be involved in the metabolism of other drugs such as:

- **CYP1A2**: (e.g. warfarin, theophylline, propranolol, tizanidine)
- **CYP2C9**: (e.g. warfarin)
- **CYP3A4**: (e.g. alprazolam)
- **CYP2C19**: (e.g. omeprazole)

In vitro data suggest that fluvoxamine is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Approximately 7% of the normal population has a genetic code that leads to reduced levels of activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme. Such individuals have been referred to as "poor metabolizers" (PM) of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and tricyclic antidepressants. While none of the drugs studied for drug interactions significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine, an in vivo study of fluvoxamine single-dose pharmacokinetics in 13 PM subjects demonstrated altered ph.

Regarding the use of oseltamivir phosphate PO (also known as Tamiflu) in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30–60 mL/min:

- **Dosage for treatment**: 30 mg PO twice daily (BID) for 5 days.

### Tamiflu [^112Wdk6B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Elimination**: Absorbed oseltamivir is primarily (> 90%) eliminated by conversion to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir declined with a half-life of 1 to 3 hours in most subjects after oral administration. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized and is eliminated unchanged in urine. Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate declined with a half-life of 6 to 10 hours in most subjects after oral administration.

- **Metabolism**: Oseltamivir is extensively converted to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, by esterases located predominantly in the liver. Oseltamivir carboxylate is not further metabolized. Neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a substrate for, or inhibitor of, cytochrome P450 isoforms.

- **Excretion**: Oseltamivir carboxylate is eliminated entirely (> 99%) by renal excretion. Renal clearance (18.8 L/h) exceeds glomerular filtration rate (7.5 L/h), indicating that tubular secretion (via organic anion transporter) occurs in addition to glomerular filtration. Less than 20% of an oral radiolabeled dose is eliminated in feces.

### Mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate accounting for physiological changes to predict exposures in neonates and infants [^112A4T6o]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Estimates of structural parameters and covariate effects for the final population PK model, including interindividual variability parameters and residual model parameters, showed that oseltamivir clearance, central volume, intercompartment clearance, peripheral volume, and metabolism rate increased with weight, with the power coefficients (RSE%) of 1.03 (3.2%), 0.65 (13.2%), 1.58 (4.7%), and 1.95 (5.8%), respectively. OC clearance and central volume increased with weight, with the power coefficients (RSE%) of 0.75 (fixed), and 1.44 (7.9%), respectively. These parameters increased with weight up to 43 kg (4.2%) and were independent of weight for heavier subjects, with sex having no influence on model parameters.

The intersubject variability of oseltamivir absorption rate, oseltamivir clearance, metabolism rate, and OC clearance was moderate, ranging from 30.4% to 34.5%, and shrinkage of these random effects was low, estimated at 17.5%, 11.9%, 26.0%, and 3.9%, respectively. The residual variability of oseltamivir concentrations was high at 45.4%, whereas the residual variability of OC concentrations was low at 16.2%. Models that included hepatic maturation function were tested but were not found to be better than the final model, indicating that dependencies of oseltamivir clearance and metabolism rate on weight fully describe developmental changes in hepatic function in the pediatric population.

### Mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate accounting for physiological changes to predict exposures in neonates and infants [^115gyFAN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Oseltamivir is a prodrug that is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized to its active form, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), via high‐capacity human carboxylesterase‐1 (HCE‐1), located predominantly in the liver. After hydrolysis of oseltamivir, the poorly permeable active form OC is released slowly from the liver into the systemic circulation, leading to a relatively long OC plasma half‐life. OC is a potent, stable, and selective inhibitor of influenza A and B neuraminidase enzymes and is excreted unchanged by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion by the organic anion transport (OAT) system.

The pharmacokinetics (PKs) of oseltamivir and OC are linear and dose‐proportional over a dose range of 50–500 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) oseltamivir. Twice‐daily administration of 75 mg oseltamivir in adolescents and adults, and 2 mg/kg oseltamivir in children aged 1–12 years, led to an area under the curve from 0–12 hours (AUC 0‐12h) at steady‐state of approximately 3,000 hour*ng/mL. Oseltamivir was well tolerated at doses up to and including 500 mg b.i.d. in healthy adult volunteers. Gastrointestinal effects, such as nausea and vomiting, occurred more frequently and in a dose‐related fashion in healthy volunteers exposed to high unit doses (≥ 200 mg) of oseltamivir.

### Xofluza [^115V6CWB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interaction studies**: No clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil and its active metabolite, baloxavir, were observed when coadministered with itraconazole (combined strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor), probenecid (UGT inhibitor), or oseltamivir. Similarly, no clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs were observed when coadministered with baloxavir marboxil: midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), digoxin (P-gp substrate), rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate), or oseltamivir.

- **Animal studies**: In monkeys, a 48% to 63% decrease in baloxavir exposure was observed when Xofluza was coadministered with calcium, aluminum, magnesium, or iron. No study has been conducted in humans.

- **In vitro studies**:
	- **Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes**: Both baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6, and do not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4.
	- **Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) enzymes**: Both baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir do not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7, or UGT2B15.
	- **Transporter systems**: Both baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Baloxavir does not inhibit organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) 1, or MATE2K.

- **Mechanism of action**: Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted by hydrolysis to baloxavir, the active form that exerts antiviral effects.

### Clinical importance of the cytochromes P450 [^114MZyGf]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily comprises 57 genes. These genes code for enzymes that have roles in various processes:

- **Metabolism**: This includes the metabolism of drugs, foreign chemicals, arachidonic acid, eicosanoids, cholesterol, and bile-acid biosynthesis. Additionally, it involves steroid synthesis and metabolism, vitamin D(3) synthesis and metabolism, and retinoic acid hydroxylation.

- **Unidentified functions**: Some functions of these enzymes are still unknown.

Cytochrome P450 was once believed to be mainly a hepatic drug detoxication system. It is now understood to involve a myriad of enzymatic reactions implicated in important life processes. Mutations in many CYP genes cause inborn errors of metabolism and contribute to many clinically relevant diseases.

### Influenza virus polymerase inhibitors in clinical development [^117522gw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Formulations in development include tablets for oral administration and a solution for intravenous administration (NCT02659735). Oral pimodivir demonstrates dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, with a mean terminal plasma T 1/2elim of about 24 hours, such that steady-state levels are reached between days 3–4 of dosing. It is metabolized by CYP 3A4 but has no effect on cytochrome P450 activity. The low renal elimination (∼5%) suggests that pimodivir does not require dose adjustments for renal insufficiency. No meaningful pharmacokinetic differences were found in hospitalized influenza patients between younger (aged 18–64 years) and elderly (65–85 years) adults.

In a drug–drug interaction study, oseltamivir increased pimodivir C max by 31% with no change in C min or AUC 12 hours; pimodivir had no effect on oseltamivir.

### Baraclude [^1124E9Ki]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: The metabolism of entecavir was evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Entecavir is not a substrate, inhibitor, or inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system. At concentrations up to approximately 10,000-fold higher than those obtained in humans, entecavir inhibited none of the major human CYP450 enzymes: 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, 2B6, and 2E1. Additionally, at concentrations up to approximately 340-fold higher than those observed in humans, entecavir did not induce the human CYP450 enzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 3A5, and 2B6. The pharmacokinetics of entecavir are unlikely to be affected by coadministration with agents that are either metabolized by, inhibit, or induce the CYP450 system. Similarly, the pharmacokinetics of known CYP substrates are unlikely to be affected by coadministration of entecavir.

The steady-state pharmacokinetics of entecavir and coadministered drugs were not altered in interaction studies of entecavir with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [see Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Mechanism of action**: Entecavir, a deoxyguanosine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV reverse transcriptase (rt), is efficiently phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form, which has an intracellular half-life of 15 hours. By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir triphosphate functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV reverse transcriptase: (1) base priming; (2) reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA; and (3) synthesis of the positive s.

### Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics [^112fbXKX]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

This article introduces pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in the context of pharmacotherapy in the pediatric ICU setting. As an independent discipline, if it can be considered as such, pediatric or developmental pharmacogenetics is essentially at a neonatal stage. Available pharmacokinetic data derived from studies of drugs that are largely dependent on a single CYP pathway for their elimination provide initial assessments of the developmental profile of that particular CYP isoform.

In essence, pharmacogenetics in a pediatric context refers to the changes in phenotype that occur as a child grows and develops. Furthermore, the apparent drug biotransformation "phenotype" may be influenced by disease (infection), environmental factors (diet and environmental contaminants), and concomitant medications. However, drug response is a function of the complex interplay among genes involved in drug transport, drug biotransformation, receptors, and signal transduction processes, among others.

Therefore, optimization of pediatric pharmacotherapy necessarily requires that developmental changes in each of these areas, and not just drug biotransformation, be investigated thoroughly before the promise of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics for rational therapeutics can be realized in children.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115Q8gE9]. Chest (2022). Low credibility.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is an enzyme that plays a fundamental role in the metabolism of medications. Drugs with CYP450 activity may be inhibitors, inducers, substrates, or a combination thereof for a specific CYP450 enzymatic pathway that can change the metabolism of concurrently administered medications. Inhibitors are substances that reduce an enzymatic pathway of CYP450 and may cause increased concentrations of other drugs metabolized by the same pathway, resulting in drug toxicity. Inducers are substances that induce an enzymatic pathway of CYP450, which may increase the metabolism of other drugs by the same pathway, leading to subtherapeutic drug levels and treatment failure. Although more than 50 isoforms of CYP450 have been discovered, six of them (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19) metabolize 90% of drugs, with the two most significant enzymes being CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.

As our understanding of CYP450 metabolism continues to grow, new agents undergo extensive drug interaction studies performed before becoming available. However, not all agents have been tested in combination, and at times drug interactions are hypothesized based on known metabolic pathways. As a result, drug-drug interactions may include the magnification of known potential adverse effects. Not all cytochrome P450-mediated drug interactions are clinically significant, and thus may or may not require dosage adjustments. Active drug transporters, P-glycoprotein, and human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) also play an important role in drug elimination and affect the bioavailability.

### SPL drug information for oseltamivir phosphate [^114BNNRY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of oseltamivir phosphate PO (also known as Tamiflu) in patients with chronic liver disease, Child-Pugh A (mild), use is acceptable and no dose adjustment is required.

---

### Tamiflu [^111CUuGt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Oseltamivir is extensively converted to oseltamivir carboxylate by esterases, located predominantly in the liver. Drug interactions involving competition for esterases have not been extensively reported in the literature. Low protein binding of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate suggests that the probability of drug displacement interactions is low.

In vitro studies demonstrate that neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a good substrate for P450 mixed-function oxidases or for glucuronyl transferases.

- **Coadministration effects**: Coadministration of probenecid results in an approximate two-fold increase in exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate due to a decrease in active anionic tubular secretion in the kidney. However, due to the safety margin of oseltamivir carboxylate, no dose adjustments are required when coadministering with probenecid. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions have been observed when coadministering oseltamivir with amoxicillin, acetaminophen, aspirin, cimetidine, antacids (magnesium and aluminum hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine, amantadine, or warfarin.

- **Mechanism of action**: Oseltamivir phosphate is an ethyl ester prodrug requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase affecting release of viral particles. The median IC50 values of oseltamivir against influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2, and influenza B clinical isolates were 2.5 nM (range: 0.93–4.16 nM, N = 74), 0.96 nM (range: 0.13–7.95 nM, N = 774), and 60 nM, respectively.

### Bench to bedside: Pharmacogenomics, adverse drug interactions, and the cytochrome P450 system [^116eB4UF]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

As physicians attempt to improve the quality of health care, one area of particular concern has been preventable medical errors from adverse drug interactions. The cytochrome P450 family of enzymes has been implicated in a large number of these preventable adverse drug interactions. This report reviews the basic biochemistry and pharmacogenomics underlying the reactions catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. An emphasis is placed on the phenotypic variations within a population and the resulting clinical effects.

- **Phenotypic variations**: In addition, six members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily that are responsible for the metabolism of the majority of pharmaceutical agents are profiled in detail. These enzymes, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP1A2, are reviewed with regard to their phenotypic variation in the population and the resulting clinical and therapeutic implications.

### Decoding the selective chemical modulation of CYP3A4 [^114QDm7t]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In this work, we embarked on the challenging undertaking of developing selective CYP3A4 inhibitors and uncovered the structural basis of such selectivity. Our findings provide much-needed understanding in the design of chemicals that can be used to reduce drug-drug interactions. A growing number of patients take multiple medications concurrently to treat various and unrelated illnesses. The higher prevalence of polypharmacy can increase health risks due to drug-drug interactions, leading to unintended and potentially fatal consequences.

CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are main players in drug metabolism, responsible for the chemical modification and degradation of the majority of FDA-approved drugs. It is estimated that more than 90% of common chemicals, 66% of carcinogens, and more than half of currently marketed drugs are metabolized by CYPs. Hence, CYP3A4/5 can affect the plasma concentration of drugs or alter their chemical structure to generate toxic metabolites.

### Rapivab [^115ifmZu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Peramivir is an antiviral drug with activity against the influenza virus [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: At twice the maximum recommended dose, Rapivab did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The pharmacokinetics of Rapivab was evaluated in Phase 1 trials in adults. The pharmacokinetic parameters following intravenous administration of Rapivab (0.17 to 2 times the recommended dose) showed a linear relationship between dose and exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC). Following intravenous administration of a single dose of Rapivab 600 mg over 30 minutes, a maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of 46,800 ng/mL (46.8 μg/mL) was reached at the end of the infusion. AUC0-∞ values were 102,700 ng•hr/mL.

	- **Distribution**: In vitro binding of peramivir to human plasma proteins is less than 30%. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the central volume of distribution was 12.56 L.

	- **Metabolism and elimination**: Peramivir is not a substrate for CYP enzymes, does not affect glucuronidation, and is not a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein mediated transport. Peramivir is not significantly metabolized in humans. The elimination half-life of Rapivab following IV administration to healthy subjects of 600 mg as a single dose is approximately 20 hours. The major route of elimination of Rapivab is via the kidney. Renal clearance of unchanged peramivir accounts for approximately 90% of total clearance. Negligible accumulation was observed following multiple doses, either once or twice daily.

### Fluvoxamine maleate [^115C3NV9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Multiple hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative biotransformation of a large number of structurally different drugs and endogenous compounds. The available knowledge concerning the relationship of fluvoxamine and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system has been obtained mostly from pharmacokinetic interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers, although some preliminary in vitro data are also available. Based on findings of substantial interactions of fluvoxamine with certain drugs [see later parts of this section and also Warnings and Precautions (5)] and limited in vitro data for CYP3A4, it appears that fluvoxamine inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, which are involved in the metabolism of other drugs such as:

- **CYP1A2**: Involved in metabolism of drugs like warfarin, theophylline, propranolol, and tizanidine.
- **CYP2C9**: Involved in metabolism of drugs like warfarin.
- **CYP3A4**: Involved in metabolism of drugs like alprazolam.
- **CYP2C19**: Involved in metabolism of drugs like omeprazole.

In vitro data suggest that fluvoxamine is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Approximately 7% of the normal population has a genetic code leading to reduced levels of activity of CYP2D6. These individuals are referred to as "poor metabolizers" (PM) of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and tricyclic antidepressants. While none of the drugs studied for drug interactions significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine, an in vivo study of fluvoxamine single-dose pharmacokinetics in 13 PM subjects demonstrated altered pharmacokinetic properties.

### Worldwide distribution of cytochrome P450 alleles: A meta-analysis of population-scale sequencing projects [^1133DR2V]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Drug response is highly variable between individuals, resulting in 40–70% of patients exhibiting a lack of efficacy of pharmacological treatment or adverse drug reactions. Importantly, it is estimated that 15–30% of this variability is caused by genetic polymorphisms. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and their roles in drug metabolism have been extensively studied and constitute major determinants of drug response, as they are responsible for 80% of phase 1 drug metabolism and 65–70% of drug clearance. Furthermore, metabolism by polymorphic phase 1 enzymes, primarily CYPs, has been implicated in an increased risk of drugs to cause adverse drug reactions.

The human CYP supergene family consists of 57 genes; however, 12 of the encoded enzymes are responsible for more than 75% of all phase 1 drug oxidation reactions. Importantly, these CYP genes are highly polymorphic and harbor a large repertoire of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations. This diversity is primarily based on low evolutionary constraints due to the lack of essential endogenous functions of the encoded gene products and genetic drift. Yet, although the vast majority of such polymorphisms are rare with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) < 1%, pharmacogenetic testing in the clinics is currently restricted to validated and experimentally characterized variants for the derivation of qualified predictions about phenotypic consequences of the observed genetic variation patterns.

### The role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in endogenous signalling pathways and environmental carcinogenesis [^115Rgp45]. Nature Reviews. Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Some cytochrome P450 (CYP) heme-thiolate enzymes participate in the detoxication and, paradoxically, the formation of reactive intermediates of thousands of chemicals that can damage DNA, as well as lipids and proteins. CYP expression can also affect the production of molecules derived from arachidonic acid and alters various downstream signal-transduction pathways. Such changes can be precursors to malignancy. Recent studies in mice have changed our perceptions about the function of CYP1 enzymes. We suggest a two-tiered system to predict an overall inter-individual risk of tumorigenesis based on DNA variants in certain 'early defence' CYP genes, combined with polymorphisms in various downstream target genes.

### Differential effects of traumatic brain injury on the cytochrome p450 system: a perspective into hepatic and renal drug metabolism [^11233C19]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2003). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is known to cause several secondary effects, one of which is altered drug clearance. Given that patients who sustain TBI are subsequently treated with a variety of pharmacological agents for neuroprotection or physiological support, it is imperative to clarify changes in expression and/or activities of enzymes involved in clearing drugs. The mixed function oxidase system, which consists of cytochrome P450 and cytochrome P450 reductase, plays a vital role in phase I drug metabolism.

This paper addresses the extent to which TBI affects the levels and activity of various rat CYP450 subfamilies. Our results show that TBI induces tissue-specific and time-dependent alterations. Total hepatic CYP450 content showed a biphasic response with a decrease at 24 hours followed by an increase at 2 weeks. CYP450 reductase, in contrast, showed an opposite temporal profile. Immunoblot analyses and marker substrate metabolism demonstrated a clear decrease in hepatic CYP1A levels, while a significant increase in the kidney was observed at both 24 hours and 2 weeks.

A dramatic induction of CYP3A was evident at 2 weeks in the liver, while no changes were noticed in the CYP2B or CYP2D subfamilies. The CYP4F subfamily showed induction in the kidney only. Collectively, the data reveal the differential effects of TBI on hepatic and renal drug metabolism.

### Akeega [^111tU7fs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Drug interactions:

- **Strong CYP3A4 inducers**: Avoid coadministration.

- **CYP2D6 substrates**: Avoid coadministration of Akeega with CYP2D6 substrates for which minimal changes in concentration may lead to serious toxicities. If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate.

- **Effect of other drugs on Akeega**:

	- **Effect of CYP3A4 inducers**: Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4. Strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease abiraterone concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce the effectiveness of abiraterone.

- **Effects of Akeega on other drugs**:

	- **CYP2D6 substrates**: Avoid coadministration unless otherwise recommended in the prescribing information for CYP2D6 substrates for which minimal changes in concentration may lead to serious toxicities. If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug. Abiraterone is a CYP2D6 moderate inhibitor. Akeega increases the concentration of CYP2D6 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.

	- **CYP2C8 substrates**: Monitor patients for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate for which a minimal change in plasma concentration may lead to serious or life-threatening adverse reactions. Abiraterone is a CYP2C8 inhibitor. Akeega increases the concentration of CYP2C8 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions.

### Improved prediction of CYP2D6 catalyzed drug metabolism by taking variant substrate specificities and novel polymorphic haplotypes into account [^1139FsXD]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

The polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of approximately 25% of clinically prescribed drugs. However, the impact of specific genetic variants on the interindividual variability in CYP2D6-mediated drug metabolism remains insufficiently quantified. This translational study sought to address this gap by analyzing the genotypes and phenotypes of patients in two large clinical cohorts, focusing on the metabolism of the CYP2D6 substrates risperidone and desmethyltamoxifen. The analysis incorporated novel polymorphic haplotypes and substrate-specific differences among the CYP2D6.1, CYP2D6.2, and CYP2D6.35 enzyme variants.

The study revealed that CYP2D6.2 and CYP2D6.35 exhibit reduced metabolic capacity for these substrates, both in vivo and in an in vitro expression model. This was evidenced by decreased catalytic turnover (Kcat), decreased substrate affinity, and altered substrate docking. Furthermore, novel polymorphic haplotypes on the CYP2D6*1, CYP2D6*2, and CYP2D6*35 backgrounds were identified, each associated with a 30–40% increase in CYP2D6 activity.

Incorporating these findings into prediction equations significantly improved the genetic prediction accuracy (R²) for CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of desmethyltamoxifen from 59% to 71% and risperidone, also metabolized by CYP3A4, from 42% to 46%. These results highlight the importance of accounting for drug-specific interactions with enzyme variants and integrating distinct polymorphic haplotypes into CYP pharmacogenomic models and guidelines for better translation into clinical practice.

### Mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate accounting for physiological changes to predict exposures in neonates and infants [^1132ycws]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of this modeling work was to describe the PK properties of oseltamivir, including the formation rate kinetics of oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), administered to subjects from birth to 40 years old. This includes describing developmental physiological changes taking place during the first two years of life and identifying the covariates that influence oseltamivir PK in the target population. All available PK data from 317 pediatric patients enrolled in 13 studies were included in the dataset, together with data from 119 young adults (aged 18–40 years) with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL/minutes/1.73 m²).

Different population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models have been developed previously [14, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The same structural model as applied to adult patients, with and without renal impairment, was used [14], as it accounts for physiological aspects of the PK of oseltamivir. The absorption part of the model includes three first-order processes and a compartment that describes the oseltamivir to OC conversion. From this compartment, representing the liver, OC is relatively slowly released into systemic circulation, leading to a prolonged half-life (flip-flop kinetics). This model was modified to address maturational changes.

The metabolism of oseltamivir to OC is mediated via the HCE-1 enzyme, located predominantly in the liver and at low levels in the intestine [24]. A surge occurs in the expression of HCE-1 during the postneonatal stage, such that the hydrolytic capacity of HCE-1 is gained rapidly after birth [25]. Age-dependent hydrolysis via the HCE-1 enzyme could, in theory, affect exposure to oseltamivir.

### Tremfya [^1136bVbp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**:
	- **CYP450 substrates**: The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, interferon) during chronic inflammation. Results from an exploratory drug-drug interaction study in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis suggested a low potential for clinically relevant drug interactions for drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2; however, the interaction potential cannot be ruled out for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. The results were highly variable due to the limited number of study subjects.

Upon initiation of Tremfya in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and consider dosage adjustment as needed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^113nd9Kf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

It should not be surprising that treatment for uncomplicated influenza will only produce a modest effect because influenza virus replication precedes symptoms by 1–2 days. This means that the viral load in the patient may have peaked by the time the patient begins antiviral treatment. Given that most antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir, act by reducing viral replication, the effect of treatment will therefore be minimal in otherwise healthy persons when immune responses are already reducing viral titers. It is therefore plausible that community-based randomized controlled trials are not capturing critical information about the mode of action of oseltamivir that is beneficial to severely ill patients.

It is possible that benefit to severely ill patients may be related to the increased duration of viral shedding and higher viral loads found in this group of patients. Elevated cytokine levels, sometimes referred to as a cytokine storm, have been detected for patients infected with highly pathogenic A(H5N1) virus and for severely ill patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza viruses. A randomized controlled trial study of 117 healthy adults experimentally infected with seasonal influenza virus A(H1N1) reported that oseltamivir treatment significantly reduced interleukin-6, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α cytokine responses in patients compared with responses in placebo-treated patients. Although these results do not clarify whether the decreased cytokine response was the result of effective viral treatment or a (postulated) immune modulation mechanism, it suggests potential pathways for further investigation.

### Tamiflu [^112B21Gr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug with activity against influenza virus [see Microbiology (12.4)].

- **Mechanism of action**: Oseltamivir is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) and is extensively converted predominantly by hepatic esterases to oseltamivir carboxylate. At least 75% of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation as oseltamivir carboxylate, and less than 5% reaches the systemic circulation as oseltamivir (see Table 6).

- **Absorption and bioavailability**: Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate are proportional to doses up to 500 mg given twice daily (about 6.7 times the maximum recommended Tamiflu dosage) [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Coadministration with food has no significant effect on the peak plasma concentration (551 ng/mL under fasted conditions and 441 ng/mL under fed conditions) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (6218 ng∙h/mL under fasted conditions and 6069 ng∙h/mL under fed conditions) of oseltamivir carboxylate.

- **Distribution**: The volume of distribution (Vss) of oseltamivir carboxylate, following intravenous administration in 24 subjects (Tamiflu is not available as an IV formulation), ranged between 23 and 26 liters. The binding of oseltamivir carboxylate to human plasma protein is low (3%). The binding of oseltamivir to human plasma protein is 42%, which is insufficient to cause significant displacement-based drug interactions.

### Mini-series: II. Clinical aspects. Clinically relevant CYP450-mediated drug interactions in the ICU [^1175bE9p]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

In the critically ill, multiple drug therapies for acute and chronic conditions are often used simultaneously, and adverse drug events occur frequently. Many pharmacological and disease-related factors, such as altered renal and hepatic function, catecholamine-related circulatory changes, altered drug volume of distribution, enteral versus parenteral feeding, and morbid obesity, along with concomitant multiple drug regimens, may account for the wide inter-individual variability in drug exposure and response in critically ill patients. This variability contributes to the high risk of drug-drug interactions occurring.

The practicing intensivist must remain aware of the major mechanisms for drug-drug interactions, with the drug-metabolizing enzyme inhibitory or induction potential of associated chemical entities being paramount. Metabolism-based drug-drug interactions largely result from changes in levels of drug-metabolizing enzymes caused by one drug, leading to changes in the systemic exposure clearance of another. Among the numerous drug-metabolizing enzymes identified at the time of writing, the activity of cytochrome P450s (CYP450) is a critical determinant of drug clearance and appears to be involved in the mechanism of numerous clinically relevant drug-drug interactions observed in critically ill patients.

- **Discussion**: This manuscript will cover a practical overview of clinically relevant CYP450-mediated drug-drug interactions. Medications frequently used in the intensive care unit, such as benzodiazepines, immunosuppressive agents, opioid analgesics, certain anticonvulsants, azoles, and macrolides, are included in this discussion.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes are remarkably diverse oxygenation catalysts found throughout nature. Although the pharmaceutical industry has primarily focused on their role in drug development, these enzymes also present significant potential in the discovery of not only drugs but also other valuable chemicals. Potential applications range from using cytochrome P450s as drug targets to employing randomly generated mutants of cytochrome P450s to produce libraries of new chemicals and drugs.

### Oseltamivir for influenza in adults and children: Systematic review of clinical study reports and summary of regulatory comments [^1154zUsR]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

We included randomized controlled trials testing the effects of oseltamivir for treatment, prophylaxis, and post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. Treatment involved the use of oseltamivir in individuals displaying influenza-like symptoms potentially caused by influenza A and B viruses. Prophylaxis referred to the use of oseltamivir when there was an expectation of possible future exposure to influenza. Post-exposure prophylaxis involved the use of oseltamivir after probable exposure to influenza but before symptom manifestation. Studies that were open-label or did not involve naturally occurring influenza were excluded.

Due to discrepancies between published and unpublished trial reports, we chose to include only those trials for which we had access to unabridged clinical study reports. Two authors (PD and TJ) reapplied the inclusion criteria for the full clinical study reports received in 2013 and resolved any disagreements through discussion.

Randomized controlled trials were required to include children and adults who were either healthy before exposure to respiratory agents or had a chronic illness (such as asthma, diabetes, or hypertension) but excluded individuals whose immune systems were compromised by diseases such as malignancy or HIV infection. Exposure had to be naturally occurring influenza, with or without symptoms.

We analyzed the intention to treat and safety populations, as our previous review had found compelling evidence regarding the intention to treat influenza-infected subpopulations.

### Prediction of the impact of cytochrome P450 2C9 genotypes on the drug-drug interaction potential of siponimod with physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling: A comprehensive approach for drug label recommendations [^1169va7J]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Effect of inhibitors**: In the presence of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole, predicted siponimod AUC inf inhibition ratios tended to increase with reduced CYP2C9 metabolic activity in the different genotypes. The AUCRs increased from 1.24 in CYP2C9*1/*1 up to 1.49 in CYP2C9*2/*3. The CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype population showed a significantly higher DDI risk, with a predicted AUCR of 4.20.

- **Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (erythromycin)**: In the presence of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor erythromycin, an increase in predicted siponimod AUC inf inhibition ratios was observed, increasing from 1.14 in CYP2C9*1/*1 to 1.30 in CYP2C9*2/*3. The AUCR was larger for the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype (2.42), suggesting a higher DDI risk.

- **Weak CYP3A4/2C9 inhibitors (fluvoxamine)**: In the presence of the weak CYP3A4/2C9 inhibitor fluvoxamine, the predicted AUCRs ranged between 1.42 in CYP2C9*1/*1 genotype and 1.31 in CYP2C9*2/*3 genotype. A further decrease in the AUCR was predicted in the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype (1.12) due to the dual inhibition of the metabolic pathways.

- **Effect of inducers**: In the presence of strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C9 inducer (rifampin), the predicted AUCR ranged between 0.32 (CYP2C9*1/*1) and 0.21 (CYP2C9*3/*3), and the C max ratios ranged between 0.5 and 0.27, respectively. Both metabolic pathways of siponimod were impacted, and only a small difference in the induction effect was predicted between CYP2C9 genotypes.

### Tamiflu [^111kiNij]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Lactation**:

	- Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tamiflu and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.

- **Treatment of influenza**:

	- The safety and efficacy of Tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in pediatric patients 2 weeks old to 17 years of age has been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)] and is based on:

	- **13 to 17 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in adolescent patients 13 to 17 years of age was supported by adequate and well-controlled trials in adults and adolescents and younger pediatric patients, as well as safety data in adolescents treated with Tamiflu in a study of treatment and prophylaxis.

	- **1 year to 12 years of age**: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients 1 year to 12 years of age was supported by results of one double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 452 pediatric patients with influenza in whom Tamiflu 2 mg per kg twice daily or placebo was administered within 48 hours of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Prediction of the impact of cytochrome P450 2C9 genotypes on the drug-drug interaction potential of siponimod with physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling: A comprehensive approach for drug label recommendations [^117Nj9EM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

The predicted geometric mean AUC inf ratios of siponimod (0.25 mg, single dose on day 5) with coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (100 mg b.i.d.) in CYP2C9*1/*2 (1.18) and CYP2C9*1/*3 genotypes (1.29) differed from clinical observations (0.90, 0.76, respectively; unpublished data), indicating an apparent induction potential of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of siponimod rather than an inhibition effect.

A potential explanation for the mispredictions could be the involvement of another metabolizing enzyme of siponimod (i.e. CYP1A1), which was identified in the in vitro enzyme phenotyping study as a minor pathway. CYP1A1 was not considered for the physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model due to its low abundance in the noninduced state. However, additional investigations indicated that the potential involvement of CYP1A1 was unlikely to be the root cause of the decreased siponimod exposure in the presence of itraconazole (unpublished data), as the itraconazole in vitro CYP1A1 inhibition effect is stronger than its induction potential.

The underlying mechanism leading to these clinical observations is currently unknown. However, it is considered that the effect observed was specific to itraconazole. It is concluded that other CYP3A4 inhibitors, which do not share the effect observed with itraconazole (e.g. clarithromycin), should act as strong and selective CYP3A4 inhibitors. This is expected to result in increased AUCRs of siponimod greater than 1 when coadministered. The basis for this assumption is the good correlation between observed and predicted drug-drug interaction (DDI) results of the dual perpetrators (CYP2C9/CYP3A4).

### Frequencies of clinically important CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 alleles are graded across Europe [^113HD9NJ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

Interindividual variability in therapeutic drug response can result in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or lack of efficacy and constitutes a key challenge for health care systems. Notably, 40–70% of patients experience insufficient drug response or drug toxicity, and ADRs account for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, of which up to 30% are life-threatening in at-risk subpopulations. Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, or drug targets explain around 20–30% of these interindividual differences.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes constitute a polymorphic superfamily, consisting of 57 functional members in humans, that metabolize over 80% of all clinically used medications. Among these, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are of particular clinical relevance, as they are highly polymorphic and implicated in the metabolism of numerous widely prescribed drugs. CYP2C19 substrates include the tricyclic antidepressants amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, and imipramine; the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram and sertraline; the antifungal voriconazole; as well as the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel. CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285) is the most common allelic variant in Caucasians and results in aberrant splicing and loss of enzyme activity. In contrast, the regulatory polymorphism rs12248560 defining CYP2C19*17 increases transcriptional activity and causes ultrarapid CYP2C19 metabolism.

### Tamiflu [^1118yKeR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been evaluated in pediatric subjects. In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study involving pediatric subjects aged 5 to 16 years (n = 18) and a small number of subjects aged 3 to 12 years (n = 5) enrolled in a clinical trial, younger pediatric subjects (1 to 12 years of age) cleared both the prodrug and the active metabolite faster than adult subjects, resulting in a lower exposure for a given mg/kg dose. For oseltamivir carboxylate, apparent total clearance decreases linearly with increasing age up to 12 years. The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir in pediatric subjects over 12 years of age are similar to those in adult subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

For pediatric subjects aged 2 weeks to less than 1 year, the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate were evaluated in two open-label studies involving subjects less than one year of age (n = 122) infected with influenza. Apparent clearance of the active metabolite decreases with decreasing age in subjects less than 1 year of age; however, the oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate exposure following a 3 mg/kg dose in subjects under 1 year of age is expected to be within the observed exposures in adults and adolescents receiving 75 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

In geriatric patients, exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate at steady-state was 25 to 35% higher compared to young adults given comparable doses of oseltamivir.

### Mechanistic population pharmacokinetic model of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate accounting for physiological changes to predict exposures in neonates and infants [^116FN7vg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Orally administered oseltamivir has been approved for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in adults and children. The treatment of influenza includes infants from 2 weeks of age onward according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and from birth onward as stated in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) summary of product characteristics. However, dosing recommendations are not intended for premature infants (i.e. those < 38 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA)) due to insufficient data available for these patients, and different dosing may be required due to the immaturity of physiological functions.

Acosta et al. collected data from premature infants, and results suggested that an oseltamivir dose of 1 mg/kg b.i.d. produced oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) exposures similar to those observed in older infants and children receiving a 3 mg/kg b.i.d. dose. To make exposure predictions for infants, including neonates, and for untested doses, developmental physiological changes affecting the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of oseltamivir and OC should be considered. Key factors include human carboxylesterase 1 (HCE‐1) levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and tubular secretion. The expression of HCE‐1 increases rapidly until the end of the first year of life. Analysis of liver samples from three different age groups indicated that adults (≥ 18 years) expressed significantly higher HCE‐1 levels than children (0–10 years) or fetuses (82–224 gestational days). Furthermore, adult (≥ 18 years) liver microsomes were ~4 times more active than child (0–10 years) microsomes and 10 times more active than fetal (82–224 gestational days) microsomes.

### Briviact [^111D7CJn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Elimination**: Brivaracetam is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis of the amide moiety to form the corresponding carboxylic acid metabolite and secondarily by hydroxylation on the propyl side chain to form the hydroxy metabolite. The hydrolysis reaction is mediated by hepatic and extra-hepatic amidase, while the hydroxylation pathway is mediated primarily by CYP2C19. In human subjects possessing genetic variations in CYP2C19, production of the hydroxy metabolite is decreased 2-fold or 10-fold, while the blood level of brivaracetam itself is increased by 22% or 42%, respectively, in individuals with one or both mutated alleles. CYP2C19 poor metabolizers and patients using inhibitors of CYP2C19 may require dose reduction. An additional hydroxy acid metabolite is created by hydrolysis of the amide moiety on the hydroxy metabolite or hydroxylation of the propyl side chain on the carboxylic acid metabolite (mainly by CYP2C9). None of the three metabolites are pharmacologically active.

- **Excretion**: Brivaracetam is eliminated primarily by metabolism and by excretion in the urine. More than 95% of the dose, including metabolites, is excreted in the urine within 72 hours after intake. Fecal excretion accounts for less than 1% of the dose. Less than 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Thirty-four percent of the dose is excreted as the carboxylic acid metabolite in urine. The terminal plasma half-life (t1/2) is approximately 9 hours.

### Decoding the selective chemical modulation of CYP3A4 [^115UpUa1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Drug-drug interactions are associated with the concurrent use of multiple medications. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolizes a large portion of marketed drugs. To maintain the efficacy of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, pan-CYP3A inhibitors such as ritonavir are often co-administered. Although selective CYP3A4 inhibitors have greater therapeutic benefits as they avoid inhibiting unintended CYPs and undesirable clinical consequences, the high homology between CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 has hampered the development of such selective inhibitors. Here, we report a series of selective CYP3A4 inhibitors with scaffolds identified by high-throughput screening. Structural, functional, and computational analyses reveal that the differential C-terminal loop conformations and two distinct ligand binding surfaces disfavor the binding of selective CYP3A4 inhibitors to CYP3A5. Structure-guided design of compounds validates the model and yields analogs that are selective for CYP3A4 versus other major CYPs. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of selectively inhibiting CYP3A4 and provide guidance for designing better CYP3A4 selective inhibitors.

Drug-metabolizing enzyme activity is one of many factors affecting patient response to medications. The objective of this review is to highlight the potential for genetic variability in cytochrome P450 enzyme activity that can lead to interperson differences in response to drugs. Awareness and application of this knowledge will improve drug use in clinical practice and provide the physician with further appreciation that standard drug dosing may not be appropriate in all patients.

### Relationship between drug-induced interstitial lung diseases and cytochrome P450 polymorphisms [^1172um45]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to explore interstitial lung disease, particularly drug-induced interstitial lung disease, which can occur due to drug(s) or drug-drug interactions. We summarize the possible role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in drug-induced interstitial lung disease.

Recent findings indicate that the CYP enzyme family plays an important role in the metabolism of various ingested, injected, or inhaled xenobiotic substances. Although the liver is considered the major site for CYP enzyme metabolism, recent years have seen the detection of more CYP isoforms in lung tissue. Polymorphisms in these CYP genes can influence the metabolic activity of the subsequent enzymes, potentially leading to localized (toxic) reactions and tissue damage.

Drug toxicity can result from no or very poor enzyme activity, especially if no alternative metabolic route is available. In cases of reduced enzyme activity, dose reduction or prescribing an alternative drug metabolized by a different, unaffected CYP enzyme is recommended to prevent toxic side effects. Knowing a patient's CYP profile before drug prescription could thus prevent drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Additionally, it might help explain serious adverse effects from inhaled, injected, or ingested xenobiotic substances.

### Reduced sensitivity of influenza A (H5N1) to oseltamivir [^113geqkR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Two different strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) have been circulating since 2003. Clade 1 has been found in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and Malaysia. Clade 2 subsequently emerged and spread from the People's Republic of China to Indonesia, Europe, and Africa during 2004–2005. Because of its systemic availability, oseltamivir is the drug of choice for treating infected persons.

### Tamiflu [^114Vsn6K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug with activity against the influenza virus [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Absorption of oseltamivir occurs in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) and is primarily converted by hepatic esterases to oseltamivir carboxylate. At least 75% of an oral dose reaches the systemic circulation as oseltamivir carboxylate, while less than 5% reaches the systemic circulation as oseltamivir itself.

Plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate are proportional to doses up to 500 mg given twice daily, which is about 6.7 times the maximum recommended Tamiflu dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Coadministration with food showed no significant effect on the peak plasma concentration or the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of oseltamivir carboxylate.

The volume of distribution (Vss) of oseltamivir carboxylate after intravenous administration in 24 subjects ranged between 23 and 26 liters, although Tamiflu is not available as an IV formulation. The binding of oseltamivir carboxylate to human plasma protein is low (3%). Similarly, the binding of oseltamivir to human plasma protein is 42%, which is not sufficient to cause significant displacement-based drug interactions.

### The role of cytochrome P450 in tumour development and progression and its potential in therapy [^117Km5aW]. The Journal of Pathology (2000). Low credibility.

The cytochromes P450 (P450) are a large group of constitutive and inducible haem-containing enzymes, which have a central role in the oxidative metabolism of a diverse range of xenobiotics. Many P450 substrates are carcinogenic, while other substrates are anti-cancer drugs; the P450s thus have various potentially important roles in tumour biology. Several P450 genes are polymorphic and are associated with the increased risk of cancer development in specific tissues. Individual P450s, especially CYP1B1, are overexpressed in different types of tumours. The increased expression of P450s in tumours is highly significant and is important for understanding tumour development and progression. The tumour-specific expression of P450 provides the basis for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
