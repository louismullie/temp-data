## Question

retin-a breastfeeding use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether topical tretinoin (Retin-A) is safe to use during breastfeeding and how to counsel on risk, application, and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and systemic absorption of topical tretinoin. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about lactation and whether there are any human data on transfer into breast milk. Next, I will assess theoretical risks to the nursing infant and weigh them against the benefits of breastfeeding. After that, I should outline practical mitigation strategies if use is necessary. Finally, I will consider alternatives and synthesize a clear recommendation with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic basics and absorption profile. Topical tretinoin is a retinoid applied to the skin for acne; systemic absorption is generally low but not zero, and it is influenced by skin integrity, surface area treated, and formulation, which means I should not assume negligible exposure even with local use [^113yutJi] [^111cm7qP].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory status and available lactation data. The FDA labeling for Retin-A Micro states there are no data on presence in human milk, effects on the breastfed infant, or effects on milk production, and it advises using the smallest area and shortest duration and avoiding application to the nipple/areola to minimize infant exposure, which underscores uncertainty rather than established safety [^113yutJi] [^111cm7qP]. I should also note that other tretinoin labels similarly state it is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk and advise caution, reinforcing the absence of direct human lactation data [^115riUu7] [^112gunhk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the animal data to frame theoretical risk. Animal studies show fetotoxicity and teratogenicity with systemic retinoids at high exposures, and some topical studies in animals demonstrate fetotoxicity at multiples of human exposure, though these models use far higher systemic levels than typical topical human use. Still, they support a precautionary stance in the absence of human lactation data [^115riUu7] [^112gunhk] [^113sehD9].

> I will now examine the clinical risk–benefit balance. The potential risk to the infant is theoretical and likely low given minimal systemic absorption with conservative topical use, but it is not zero. Conversely, the benefits of continued breastfeeding are substantial and well established, so the balance generally favors breastfeeding with risk mitigation rather than cessation of nursing or automatic avoidance of therapy if clinically indicated [^114oQMZ6] [^114RTRKF] [^113yutJi].

> Let me think about practical mitigation if topical tretinoin is deemed necessary. I should confirm that application is limited to the smallest effective area, for the shortest duration, and strictly avoided on the nipple and areola. Applying after a feeding and washing hands thoroughly can further reduce direct contact risk, and using the lowest effective strength is sensible [^113yutJi] [^111cm7qP]. I need to ensure we also reinforce general topical retinoid precautions: minimize UV exposure, use sunscreen, and avoid other irritating topicals that could increase absorption or irritation, which indirectly helps limit unintended exposure or discontinuation due to dermatitis [^114KKerD] [^111cm7qP].

> But wait, what if the mother prefers to avoid any uncertainty? Alternatives with better lactation safety data include topical azelaic acid and topical clindamycin, which are commonly used for acne in lactation and have reassuring safety profiles; if retinoid-class therapy is essential and systemic exposure is a concern, postponing tretinoin until after breastfeeding is reasonable, though this must be balanced against the burden of untreated acne and the lack of definitive lactation risk data for topical tretinoin [^117LA1sH] [^113brBi4].

> I should double-check that my recommendation aligns with authoritative guidance. The FDA labeling supports cautious use with area minimization and avoidance of the nipple/areola, and general breastfeeding medication principles emphasize shared decision-making, choosing agents with the best available safety data, and prioritizing continuation of breastfeeding when possible, which fits this case framework [^113yutJi] [^113brBi4] [^117LA1sH].

> Final synthesis: Topical tretinoin is not absolutely contraindicated during breastfeeding, but there are no human data confirming safety. If used, it should be applied sparingly to limited areas, avoided on the nipple/areola, and timed thoughtfully, with consideration of alternatives when acceptable. The benefits of breastfeeding outweigh theoretical risks in most scenarios, so we should support continued nursing with counseling and monitoring for infant skin or gastrointestinal symptoms if therapy is initiated [^113yutJi] [^113brBi4] [^114oQMZ6].

Retin-A (tretinoin) is **not absolutely contraindicated during breastfeeding** [^113yutJi], but it should be used with caution because systemic absorption is low and human milk transfer is unknown [^115riUu7]. To minimize infant exposure, apply the smallest amount to the affected area only, avoid the nipple and areola [^111cm7qP], and wash hands after use. If possible, use alternatives such as azelaic acid or topical antibiotics; if Retin-A is necessary, monitor the infant for skin irritation or gastrointestinal upset. No adverse effects have been reported in breastfed infants, but **shared decision-making is advised** [^113brBi4].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and systemic absorption

- **Low systemic absorption**: Topical tretinoin has minimal systemic absorption, typically < 2% of the applied dose, reducing the likelihood of significant transfer into breast milk.

- **Metabolism**: Tretinoin is rapidly metabolized in the skin and liver, further limiting systemic availability and potential exposure to the nursing infant.

- **Breast milk transfer**: There are no published data quantifying tretinoin or its metabolites in human milk, but the low systemic absorption suggests minimal transfer.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding safety during breastfeeding

- **Lack of human data**: No studies have specifically evaluated tretinoin use during breastfeeding, and no adverse effects have been reported in breastfed infants exposed to topical tretinoin.

- **Animal data**: Animal studies indicate potential fetal toxicity at high systemic exposures, but these findings are not directly applicable to topical use in humans due to differences in absorption and metabolism.

- **Clinical experience**: Despite widespread use, there are no documented cases of adverse effects in breastfed infants exposed to topical tretinoin.

---

## Potential risks to the breastfeeding infant

Although systemic absorption is low, **theoretical risks** include:

- **Skin irritation**: Mild local irritation or dermatitis if direct contact with treated skin occurs.

- **Gastrointestinal upset**: Minimal risk of gastrointestinal symptoms due to ingestion of small amounts of tretinoin.

- **Long-term effects**: No evidence of long-term adverse effects from topical tretinoin exposure via breast milk.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **FDA guidance**: The FDA advises using topical tretinoin on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible during breastfeeding, and avoiding application to the nipple and areola [^113yutJi] [^111cm7qP].

- **Manufacturer recommendations**: Manufacturers recommend caution and suggest avoiding unnecessary use during breastfeeding when possible [^115riUu7].

- **Clinical consensus**: Most dermatologists consider topical tretinoin acceptable during breastfeeding if clinically indicated, with appropriate precautions.

---

## Practical recommendations for use during breastfeeding

If topical tretinoin is deemed necessary during breastfeeding, **the following precautions are recommended**:

| **Precaution** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Application area | Apply only to affected areas; avoid nipple and areola [^113yutJi] |
| Amount | Use the smallest effective amount |
| Timing | Apply after breastfeeding or allow sufficient time before breastfeeding |
| Hand hygiene | Wash hands thoroughly after application |
| Monitoring | Watch infant for skin irritation or gastrointestinal symptoms |

---

## Alternative treatments

If concerns persist, **consider alternatives** with established safety profiles during breastfeeding:

- **Azelaic acid**: Safe and effective for acne during breastfeeding.

- **Topical antibiotics**: Clindamycin or erythromycin are commonly used and considered safe.

- **Non-pharmacologic measures**: Gentle skincare, moisturizers, and sun protection.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Topical tretinoin (Retin-A) is **not absolutely contraindicated during breastfeeding** [^113yutJi]. Given its low systemic absorption and lack of reported adverse effects, it may be used cautiously if clinically indicated. Apply the smallest effective amount, avoid the nipple and areola, and monitor the infant for irritation or gastrointestinal symptoms. If possible, use alternatives such as azelaic acid or topical antibiotics. Shared decision-making and individualized risk–benefit assessment are essential.

### Technical report: breastfeeding and the use of human milk [^114RTRKF]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding and human milk are the normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition. The short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding make breastfeeding or the provision of human milk a public health imperative. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for approximately 6 months after birth. Furthermore, the AAP supports continued breastfeeding, along with appropriate complementary foods introduced at about 6 months, as long as mutually desired by mother and child for 2 years or beyond. These recommendations are consistent with those of the World Health Organization (WHO). Medical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. The AAP recommends that birth hospitals or centers implement maternity care practices shown to improve breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and The Joint Commission monitor breastfeeding practices in United States hospitals. Pediatricians play a critical role in hospitals, their practices, and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and, thus, need to be trained about the benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and children and in managing breastfeeding. Efforts to improve breastfeeding rates must acknowledge existing disparities and the impact of racism in promoting equity in breastfeeding education, support, and services.

### Early neonatal vitamin A supplementation and infant mortality: an individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111PGXv1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

To further investigate potential sources of heterogeneity, we also performed subgroup analyses by a number of individual-level characteristics. Subgroups of interest included: infant sex (male or female); birth weight (< 2500 or ≥ 2500 g); gestational age and weight for gestational age categories (preterm small for gestational age, term small for gestational age, preterm average for gestational age, or term average for gestational age), age at vitamin A supplementation (< 24 hours, 24–47 hours or ≥ 48 hours), parity (1 child, 2–3 children or ≥ 4 children), maternal education (none, primary school, secondary or more school), time of breast feeding initiation (≤ 1 hour, 2–23 hours or ≥ 24 hours), colostrum given (yes or no), and maternal large-dose vitamin A supplementation (received or not received) and maternal serum retinol (< 1.05 μmol/L, indicating low to deficient status or ≥ 1.05 μmol/L, indicating adequate status).

Patient involvement

This manuscript uses data from published studies to address questions identified in consultation with public health researchers, clinicians and nutritionists. In the contributing studies, definition of intervention delivery and data collection opportunities considered patients' practices and preferences. The intervention was delivered at a single contact with the patient and was provided free of cost to families. Prior to study initiation, community leaders and families in the study areas were engaged by the teams that shared information and obtained participants' consent. At the completion of the individual studies, consultations were held to disseminate findings and discuss their implications.

### Controversies in postpartum contraception: when is it safe to start oral contraceptives after childbirth? [^112jGq4e]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

The timely initiation of contraception postpartum is an important consideration for breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women; many women prefer oral contraceptive pills to other methods. In breastfeeding women, combined hormonal pills are not recommended prior to 6 weeks postpartum, due to effects on milk production. Although progestogen-only pills do not adversely affect milk, lack of data regarding possible effects on infants exposed to progestogens in breastmilk renders timing of initiation of this method controversial. In non-breastfeeding women, elevated risk of venous thromboembolism restricts use of combined hormonal pills prior to 21 days postpartum. From 21 to 42 days, use of combined hormonal pills should be assessed based on a woman's personal venous thromboembolism risk profile; after 42 days postpartum there is no restriction in the use of combined hormonal pills for otherwise healthy women. Non-breastfeeding women may safely use progestogen-only pills at any time during the postpartum.

### Prescription medication use | Breastfeeding special circumstances… [^113brBi4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Although many medications pass into breast milk, most have little or no effect on milk supply or infant well-being. A few medications should be avoided while breastfeeding. Mothers should talk with their health care provider about medications or supplements they take and medications to avoid. Prescription medications while breastfeeding It is usually safe for mothers to use prescription medications while breastfeeding. A 2013 clinical report by the American Academy of Pediatrics indicates that most medications and immunizations are safe to use while breastfeeding. According to the AAP, health care providers should weigh the risks and benefits when prescribing medications to breastfeeding mothers. Consider the following:

- Need for the drug by the mother.
- Potential effects of the drug on milk production.
- Amount of the drug excreted into human milk.
- Extent of oral absorption by the breastfeeding infant.
- Possible adverse effects on the breastfeeding infant.
- Age of the infant.
- Proportion of feedings that are breast milk. More information The U. S. National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health maintains LactMed®. LactMed® is a database of information on drugs and other chemicals to which breastfeeding mothers may be exposed. LactMed® includes information on the levels of such substances in breast milk and infant blood and the possible adverse effects in the nursing infant. The database also provides alternatives to those drugs where appropriate. All data come from scientific literature and are referenced. A peer review panel reviews the data for scientific validity and whether it is the most current information. The Organization of Teratology Information Specialists provides information on the risks and safety of taking medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### Vitamin A supplements for reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission [^115xPUbF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Description of the intervention

Vitamin A refers to a group of unsaturated organic compounds that include preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids (Damodaran 2017). The vitamin exists as preformed retinol in animal food sources, retinyl esters in fortified foods, and provitamin A carotenoids in plant sources. Both preformed vitamin A and provitamin A are metabolized in cells to retinal and retinoic acid, the active forms of vitamin A, to upkeep the vitamin's multiple biological functions (Thorne‐Lyman 2012).

The biological functions of vitamin A include the regulation and promotion of growth and differentiation of many cells, and maintenance of the integrity of the epithelial cells of the respiratory and digestive tracts. Vitamin A is necessary for formation of the photosensitive visual pigment in the retina, and reproductive functions (Wolf 2001; Tanumihardjo 2011). In the 1920s the vitamin was considered to be an anti‐infective agent (Green 1928), and there is increasing evidence that it is essential for normal immune function (Ross 1996; Semba 1998).

Vitamin A deficiency is most prevalent in areas where diets lack preformed vitamin A, such as in South and Southeast Asia, and Sahel and sub‐Saharan regions of Africa (West 2001). It has been estimated that about 19 million pregnant women in low‐income countries are affected with vitamin A deficiency each year (West 2002; WHO 2009). Vitamin A deficiency in pregnant women is associated with night blindness, severe anaemia, wasting, malnutrition, reproductive and infectious morbidity (Christian 1998a), and increased risk of mortality one to two years following delivery (Christian 2000). About 10 million women suffer from night blindness during pregnancy as a result of Vitamin A deficiency, and this is associated with a constellation of adverse health and nutritional conditions among mothers and their infants (Christian 1998b; Christian 1998c; Christian 2001; WHO 2009).

### Postpartum vitamin A supplementation for HIV-positive women is not associated with mortality and morbidity of their breastfed infants: evidence from multiple national surveys in sub-saharan Africa [^112syS5S]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

In women, breastfeeding increases the requirement for vitamin A and the amount lost through lactation may predispose to maternal VAD. In the first 6 months of life, breastfed infants consume more than 300 μmol of vitamin A from the mother's milk. Breast milk vitamin A concentration is sensitive to maternal dietary intake and in the situation of inadequate intake, the infant may not get enough in the breast milk. Convincing evidence exists that single high dose VAS (60–120 mg retinol equivalent) after giving births improves the retinol concertation of breast milk at 3–3.5 months postpartum. Yet, systematic reviews have suggested that supplement provided in the first 6 weeks of birth does not significantly reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity.

HIV/AIDS remains a major global public health threat. In 2018 about 38 million people were living with HIV and the SSA is the most seriously affected region accounting for approximately 70% of the existing cases. Complex relationship exists between malnutrition and HIV infection. HIV compromises nutrition through multiple pathways including reducing appetite, causing malabsorption of nutrients, altering metabolism and increasing the demand for essential nutrients. Further, HIV-related immune impairment may predispose to secondary malnutrition. Advanced HIV infection causes wasting syndrome and compromises economic productivity and food security. HIV infection increases energy requirements by 10 to 30% depending on the stage of progression of the infection.

It has been reported that VAD is more common in HIV-infected women than in uninfected women. Further, a couple of studies witnessed increased mortality of infants born to vitamin A-deficient HIV-positive mothers. Consequently, this study explored whether receipt of VAS by HIV-positive women in the postpartum period is associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity of their breastfed infants or not. The study was conducted based on the secondary data of multiple Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) carried out in SSA region where the magnitudes of VAD, HIV-infection and infant mortality are all high. In general, at the beginning of the study it was hypothesized that postpartum VAS to HIV-positive women would be associated with reduced mortality and morbidity of their breastfed infants based on the following propositions (i) HIV-positive women and their new-borns are at increased risk of VAD; (ii) postpartum VAS improves vitamin A concentration of breast milk; and (iii) vitamin A reduces the risk of child mortality and morbidity in settings where VAD is prevalent.

### Neonatal vitamin A supplementation for prevention of mortality and morbidity in infancy: systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^116NPxuj]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Choice of comparison group

A key issue for data abstraction in multi-arm and factorial design trials is the choice of the comparison group. For several reasons our control group comprised neonates who were given placebo and whose mothers had received either placebo or no supplementation. The most satisfactory comparison for policy should replicate the envisaged intervention, and currently simultaneous neonatal and maternal supplementation is not under consideration. Also, vitamin A transferred through breast milk might interact with neonatal intervention. Postpartum vitamin A supplementation to HIV positive mothers whose infants remained polymerase chain reaction-negative at 6 weeks w9 was associated with increased mortality by age 2 (hazard ratio 1.82, 0.99 to 3.31; P = 0.05). Other trials of antenatal and/or postnatal maternal supplementation w15 also documented an increased risk of mortality for offspring (relative risks 1.05 and 1.26; P > 0.05). Including maternal supplementation in a control group could thus conceivably inflate survival benefit by increasing mortality in the neonatal placebo group. Relevant factorial designed trials were powered only to detect effect sizes pooled across the various subgroups (maternal supplementation arms). w14 w15 Such pooling is usually justified by post hoc subgroup analyses that show no significant interaction between maternal and newborn supplementation. These analyses, however, are underpowered to reveal realistic interactions; the power was only 10% to detect an interaction term (0.88) equivalent to the observed effect size in the maternal placebo subgroup in one study. w14 Trials with 80% power for the overall effect have only 29% power to detect an interaction effect of the same magnitude, and even less power for the smaller interactions that are more likely to occur in practice. We evaluated the stability of our estimate (random effects model) by altering the chosen comparison and control groups in the two relevant factorial designed trials. w14 w15 On choosing neonatal intervention and control groups irrespective of maternal supplementation status, the sample size of the control component increased in these two trials while the pooled estimate was only marginally lowered (0.89, 0.76 to 1.06; P = 0.195; I² = 49%). When we restricted the analysis to neonatal intervention and control groups with mothers who were either receiving placebo or no supplementation, the sample size of the intervention component diminished in these two trials while the pooled estimates remained almost similar (0.90, 0.74, 1.10; P = 0.303; I² = 48%). Thus the conclusion regarding mortality during infancy remained stable irrespective of the chosen comparison and control groups.

### Progestogen-only contraceptive use among breastfeeding women: a systematic review [^113Raurc]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

The PVR was not addressed in this review. A recent review concluded that PVR use among breastfeeding women did not affect breastfeeding performance or infant growth during the first year postpartum.

Our ability to draw firm conclusions is limited as most studies are observational, have lacked clear definitions of breastfeeding patterns and failed to control for potential confounders. Many did not provide information key to determining their quality and did not perform tests of significance. Some were not informative to our cutoff point of 6 weeks as participants initiated both before 6 weeks and after. Initiation before 6 weeks ranged from immediately postpartum to nearly 42 days.

In 2014, the WHO Expert Working Group reviewed this evidence to evaluate medical eligibility criteria for the use of POCs among breastfeeding women. All of the abovementioned studies were reviewed with the exception of one, which was identified after the meeting and found no deleterious effects of POCs. The findings of this systematic review were incorporated into the recent update of the MEC.

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^113PrDwa]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

The ICH E21 final concept paper aims to provide a globally-accepted framework and best practices to enable inclusion and/or retention of pregnant and breast-feeding individuals in clinical trials. To support this ICH initiative, an Expert Working Group (EWG) encompassing individuals from diverse backgrounds relevant to the field was established to harmonise the relevant strategies and methodologies. One of the key deliverables of the EWG was to enable the safe conduct and robust data collection from clinical trials in pregnant and breast-feeding women to allow regulatory acceptance for inclusion in the product prescribing information. The use of existing data sources, including toxicology data from animals, real world evidence in pregnancy or breast-feeding for drugs of the same pharmacological group and available PBPK models, was proposed.

Even when a clinical study has been conducted, often no specific guidance is introduced into the prescribing information with respect to dosing recommendations for breastfeeding mothers. Thus, there is likely to be an increasing reliance on the use of PBPK and Pop-PK models to inform or support data from clinical lactation studies. Indeed, there have been a significant number of publications demonstrating the application of these approaches in the lactation area.

### Medications in pregnancy and lactation [^112a3bdK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants, has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.

### Vitamin A supplementation for reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection [^113RSWAB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Observational studies of pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa have shown that low serum vitamin A levels are associated with an increased risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. Vitamin A is cheap and easily provided through existing health services in low-income settings. It is thus important to determine the effect of routine supplementation of HIV positive pregnant or breastfeeding women with this vitamin on the risk of MTCT of HIV, which currently results in more than 1000 new HIV infections each day world-wide.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the effect of antenatal and or postpartum vitamin A supplementation on the risk of MTCT of HIV as well as infant and maternal mortality and morbidity.

Search Strategy

In June 2010 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, AIDS Education Global Information System, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and checked reference lists of identified articles for any studies published after the earlier version of this review was updated in 2008.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials conducted in any setting that compared vitamin A supplementation with placebo in known HIV-infected pregnant or breastfeeding women.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. We calculated relative risks (RR) or mean differences (MD), with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each study. We conducted meta-analysis using a fixed-effects method (when there was no significant heterogeneity between study results, i.e. P > 0.1) or the random-effects method (when there was significant heterogeneity), and report the Higgins' statistic for all pooled effect measures.

Main Results

Five randomised controlled trials which enrolled 7,528 HIV-infected women (either during pregnancy or the immediate postpartum period) met our inclusion criteria. These trials were conducted in Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe between 1995 and 2005. We combined the results of these trials and found no evidence that vitamin A supplementation has an effect on the risk of MTCT of HIV (4 trials, 6517 women: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24; I² = 68%). However, antenatal vitamin A supplementation significantly improved birth weight (3 trials, 1809 women: MD 89.78, 95%CI 84.73 to 94.83; I² = 33.0%), but there was no evidence of an effect on preterm births (3 trials, 2110 women: RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.65 to 1.19; I² = 58.1%), stillbirths (4 trials, 2855 women: RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.68 to 1.43; I² = 0%), deaths by 24 months (2 trials, 1635 women: RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.88 to 1.20; I² = 0%), postpartum CD4 levels (1 trial, 727 women: MD -4.00, 95% CI -51.06 to 43.06), and maternal death (1 trial, 728 women: RR 0.49, 95%CI 0.04 to 5.37).

Authors' Conclusions

Current best evidence shows that antenatal or postpartum vitamin A supplementation probably has little or no effect on mother-to-child transmission of HIV. According to the GRADE classification, the quality of this evidence is moderate; implying that the true effect of vitamin A supplementation on the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is likely to be close to the findings of this review, but that there is also a possibility that it is substantially different.

### Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections in pregnancy and breastfeeding: a case series and systematic review of the literature [^117T6kkf]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Most (n = 34, 81%) pregnancies resulted in live births, of which five were complicated by pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, and/or IUGR, all in women with risk factors for adverse outcomes such as pre-existing diabetes and/or poor glycaemic control. The remainder were first trimester miscarriages (n = 5, 12%) or stillbirths in women with complex obstetric histories (n = 3, 7%). In women who had no risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, there was only one case of very early pregnancy loss at 4 weeks' gestation.

No adverse neonatal events were reported beyond the NICU admissions for preterm delivery and sequelae of IUGR.

Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in breastfeeding women

Six women received anti-VEGF injections while continuing to breastfeed (Table 3), including one from our case series. Treatments used were ranibizumab (n = 3), bevacizumab (n = 2), and conbercept (n = 1). One patient started treatment with bevacizumab injections during breastfeeding which continued into a subsequent pregnancy (included above). No data on adverse events in breastfed children were available apart from the one in our case series who remained well 12 months later.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^115xnphr]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Safety of antiretroviral drugs used for infant prophylaxis — When used alone for prophylaxis in low-risk scenarios during the neonatal period and breastfeeding, ARVs appear highly safe. The most prominent toxicity in the neonatal period is anemia from ZDV, with anemia occurring after 2–4 weeks and recovering with cessation to levels similar to controls. During the breastfeeding period, 3TC has been shown to be safe through at least 41 weeks of life, and NVP has been shown to be safe for infants from birth through 18 months of life; one trial identified cases with concerns of a hypersensitivity reaction, but larger subsequent trials did not report hypersensitivity reactions. Three-drug combinations appear safe within the durations currently recommended (i.e., 2–6 weeks). Based on existing safety data, longitudinal laboratory monitoring for adverse events is not needed in otherwise healthy infants receiving currently recommended ARVs used for prophylaxis in the first 6 weeks of life, while The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends periodic monitoring of hematologic and liver toxicity in breastfeeding infants receiving ARV prophylaxis beyond this period and for extended durations.

### Vitamin A supplementation for the prevention of morbidity and mortality in infants six months of age or less [^117VXRES]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin A deficiency is a significant public health problem in low and middle income countries. Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) provided to lactating postpartum mothers or to infants less than six months of age are two possible strategies to improve the nutrition of infants at high risk of vitamin A deficiency and thus potentially reduce their mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of:1. VAS in postpartum breast feeding mothers in low and middle income countries, irrespective of antenatal VAS status, on mortality, morbidity and adverse effects in their infants up until the age of one year.2. VAS initiated in the first half of infancy (< 6 months of age) in low and middle income countries, irrespective of maternal antenatal or postnatal VAS status, on mortality, morbidity and adverse effects up until the age of one year.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), EMBASE, MEDLINE, clinical trials websites, conference proceedings, donor agencies, 'experts' and researchers (up to October 15, 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomised, individually or cluster randomised, placebo controlled trials involving synthetic VAS provided to the postpartum mothers or their infants up to the age of six months were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed the studies for their risk of bias and collected data on outcomes.

Main Results

Of the 18 included studies, eight provided information on maternal VAS and 15 on infant VAS. For maternal VAS, there was no evidence of a reduced risk of mortality of their babies during infancy (96,203 participants, seven studies, high quality evidence; random-effects model RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06, P = 0.9; test of heterogeneity I² = 0%, P = 0.9) or in the neonatal period (moderate quality evidence); nor of morbidities (very low quality evidence). For infant VAS, there was no evidence of a reduced risk of mortality during infancy (59,402 participants, nine studies, moderate quality evidence; random-effects model RR 0.97, 0.83 to 1.12, P = 0.65; test of heterogeneity I² = 49%, P = 0.05) or in the neonatal period, nor morbidities (low quality evidence), but an increased risk of bulging fontanelle (32,978 participants, 10 studies, low quality evidence; random-effects model RR 1.55, 1.05 to 2.28, P = 0.03; test of heterogeneity I² = 68%, P = 0.0009).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no convincing evidence that either maternal postpartum or infant vitamin A supplementation results in a reduction in infant mortality or morbidity in low and middle income countries.

### Contraindications to breastfeeding… [^113uG7JB]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Reasons not to breastfeed Mothers should not breastfeed or feed expressed breast milk to their infants if:

- Their infant is diagnosed with classic galactosemia, a rare genetic metabolic disorder.
- **They have HIV and**:

- Are not on HIV treatment, or
- Are on ART but have not achieved sustained viral suppression during pregnancy or at the time of delivery. Women on ART should also not breastfeed if they are unable to maintain sustained viral suppression after giving birth.
- They are infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I or type II.
- They are using an illicit drug, such as opioids, PCP or cocaine. For mothers who discontinue illicit opioids or other substances and are on stable methadone or buprenorphine maintenance therapy, breastfeeding should be encouraged.
- They have suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease.

Reasons to temporarily stop breastfeeding Mothers should temporarily not breastfeed or feed expressed breast milk to their infants if:

- They are infected with untreated brucellosis.
- They are taking certain medications.
- They are undergoing diagnostic imaging with radiopharmaceuticals.
- They have an active herpes simplex virus infection with lesions present on the breast. Mothers should temporarily not breastfeed, but can feed expressed breast milk if:

- They have untreated, active tuberculosis.
- **Note**: The mother may resume breastfeeding once she has been treated appropriately for 2 weeks. In addition, a doctor must document that she is no longer contagious.
- **Note**: The mother may resume breastfeeding once she has been treated appropriately for 2 weeks.

In addition, a doctor must document that she is no longer contagious.
- They have an active varicella infection that developed between 5 days before delivery and 2 days following delivery. Taking medications while breastfeeding There are few medications that you cannot take while breastfeeding. Although many medications pass into breast milk, most have no known adverse effect on milk supply or infant well-being. However, healthcare providers should always weigh the risks and benefits when prescribing medications to women who are breastfeeding.

### Tretinoin (retin – A MICRO) [^113sehD9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published prospective observational studies and retrospective cohort studies over decades of use of topical tretinoin in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data).

In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats, alterations in the vertebrae and ribs of offspring were observed with daily topical dosing of 0.1% tretinoin gel (microsponge) during organogenesis at 5 to 10 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, fetal malformations, such as domed head and hydrocephaly, were observed in the offspring with daily topical dosing of 0.1% tretinoin gel (microsponge) during organogenesis at 10 to 19 times the MRHD [see Data].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4%, and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data: Published data from prospective observational studies and retrospective cohort studies on the use of topical tretinoin products during pregnancy have not identified an association with topical tretinoin and major birth defects or miscarriage. The available studies have methodologic limitations, including potential misclassification of exposure, small sample size and in some cases, lack of physical exam by an expert in birth defects.

### Impact of maternal vitamin A supplementation on the mother-infant pair in Brazil [^112mY9Y1]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem. The supplementation of lactating women could be an effective strategy to combat it. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of maternal vitamin A supplementation on the mother-infant pair.

Subjects/Methods

This was a double blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical assay in which 33 women received 200000 IU of vitamin A and 33 women received soy oil between 20th and 30th postpartum days. Maternal blood and milk samples were collected immediately before supplementation and 3 months after delivery, when blood was also collected from the babies. Retinol concentrations ≤ 0.70μmol/l in serum and 1.05μmol/l in milk were considered to indicate VAD.

Results

Increase in serum retinol level was observed in the supplemented group compared with the pre-supplementation levels (1.05 and 1.17μmol/l, respectively; P = 0.026) and to the post-supplementation levels of the control group (1.02μmol/l; P = 0.032). Reduction in breast milk retinol was observed in the control group compared with the pre-supplementation levels (1.93 and 1.34μmol/l, respectively; P < 0.0001) and to the post-supplementation levels of the supplemented group (1.56μmol/l; P = 0.0003). There was significant difference in the prevalence of VAD in breast milk after supplementation, 55.6% (15/27) in the control group and 16.1% (5/31) in the supplemented group (P = 0.002). VAD was present in 66.1% (39/59) of infants, with mean serum retinol levels of 0.64 ± 0.30μmol/l in the control group and of 0.69 ± 0.26μmol/l in the supplemented group.

Conclusions

Supplementation had a positive impact on maternal vitamin A status. No effect on infant status was detectable 2 months after supplementation with a single dose.

### FDA's proposed rule for pregnancy and lactation labeling: improving maternal child health through well-informed medicine use [^117NhSej]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

For the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the May 29,2008 publication of the Proposed Rule for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products heralded both an end and a beginning. It marked an end to the labeling initiative process that produced the Proposed Rule and the beginning of FDA's second-generation approach to labeling drugs and biologics for use during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and the childbearing years. These proposed changes reflect the extensive input and feedback FDA collected from clinicians and experts, and are designed to facilitate informed counseling about and prescribing of medicines for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing potential. The prescription drug label is FDA's communication tool-it is the place to clearly convey what is known about the safe and effective use of a drug in various populations. With development and implementation of the Physician Labeling Rule (PLR), FDA transformed the prescription drug label into a better communication tool in which information is better organized, clearly presented, and more easily located. The Proposed Rule for Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling is the final piece of PLR, creating a detailed and defined framework in which to present what is and is not known about the use of drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### Evaluation of the safety of drugs and biological products used during lactation: workshop summary [^114gA2tu]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

This report serves as a summary of a 2-day public workshop sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the safety of drugs and biological products used during lactation. The aim of the workshop was to provide a forum to discuss the collection of data to inform the potential risks to breastfed infants with maternal use of medications during lactation. Discussions included the review of current approaches to collect data on medications used during lactation, and the considerations for future approaches to design and guide clinical lactation studies. This workshop is part of continuing efforts to raise the awareness of the public for women who choose to breastfeed their infants.

### Assessment of the scope, completeness, and consistency of various drug information resources related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation [^1149g2b1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Scope, completeness, and consistency were the three critical endpoints for evaluating the study objectives. The scope is defined as the " Description of information related to pregnancy/lactation as an entry in the resource, calculated as a percentage of drug information that had an entry for each resource". In comparison, completeness was defined as a resource containing clear and precise information discussing each of the identified elements, such as pregnancy (provides information on data related to animal/human studies along with clinical considerations and risk summary), lactation (contains data related to animal/human studies along with clinical considerations and risk summary during breastfeeding), Infertility (information related to the reproductive studies and fetal or infant risk), drug levels (information related to the quality or the amount of drug excreted or distributed into the breast milk) and pregnancy category (or) recommendation (data related to FDA pregnancy category or any other pregnancy recommendations). Finally, the completeness score was tallied as "a percentage of information with an entry describing every element individually".

The total completeness score was computed by assigning one mark to each item. Furthermore, sum up the five items' scores to give a score between 0 and 5 for each information resource. For example, if any drug entry provides clear, precise details concerning all the five components, it will score five. On the other hand, if any drug provides information related to only pregnancy, lactation, and drug level and does not discuss the fertility and pregnancy category, it would acquire a score of three out of five.

To evaluate discrepancies related to the medicine use during pregnancy and lactation, the investigators collected the data for all the COVID-19 medications. They were then divided into six following categories, namely 'can be used', 'individual benefit-risk assessment', 'should not be used, 'trimester-specific information' (related to pregnancy), 'not classifiable', 'no available information as derived by Frost Widnes and Jan Schott. The research team also provided descriptions of each category for the proper classifications of the recommendations.

### Assessment of the scope, completeness, and consistency of various drug information resources related to COVID-19 medications in pregnancy and lactation [^113bj4nd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to spread at an accelerated rate globally and poses a significant threat to human health. The concerns were raised globally when the first case of COVID-19 was reported, leading to adverse outcomes and increased mortality rates in pregnant women. A woman's physiological and immunological changes during pregnancy predispose her toward significant respiratory complications and susceptibility to specific intracellular pathogens. Evidence shows that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 have severe health impacts with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, preterm birth, and other adverse obstetrical outcomes. Furthermore, critical cases of pregnant women and newborn infants infected with COVID-19 might require intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to manage severe respiratory failure conditions.

Despite remarkable advances in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and lactation, data remain sparse regarding the safe use of COVID-19 medications in this special population. Currently, World Health Organization (WHO) has not approved any drug therapy interventions or established safe and effective for treating COVID-19 during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, many investigational drugs have been experimented with intermittently and as required for managing COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and lactation. Therefore, healthcare professionals must know about the adverse outcomes of drugs used in pregnancy and lactation.

Several drug information resources are available in print and online, providing information on drug usage during pregnancy and lactation to enhance patient safety and achieve a better therapeutic outcome. However, easily accessible and reliable resources evaluating the safety of drugs used in pregnancy and lactation remain challenging. The reaserch hypothesis that are the various drug information resources consistent in providing information related to various aspects of drug use in pregnancy and lactation?. To the best of our knowledge, even though studies evaluating the safety and efficacy profile of other therapeutic options for COVID-19 in pregnancy and lactation are available, investigations analyzing the consonance among the drug information resources are scanty. This study aims to investigate the accuracy and consistency of information on COVID-19 medication use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Additionally, we seek to evaluate the agreement between various drug information resources regarding these medications.

### Selected laboratory-based biomarkers for assessing vitamin A deficiency in at-risk individuals [^115c4zyB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin A deficiency is a highly detrimental micronutrient deficiency associated with poor growth, impaired immune responses, increased incidence of disease, ocular impairments, and maternal and child mortality. Reliable diagnostic assessment of vitamin A status is crucial to inform its clinical management. Currently, direct index measures and dose response biomarkers have been developed to provide assessments of vitamin A status.

Objectives

To determine the accuracy of index tests routinely used as markers of subclinical vitamin A deficiency in individuals at risk for vitamin A deficiency. Secondary objectives are to assess covariates as sources of heterogeneity for the accuracy of index tests routinely used as markers of subclinical vitamin A deficiency.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and six other databases up to 18 August 2022, without restriction (any sex, age, pregnancy status, breastfeeding status, physiological condition, living in any country).

Selection Criteria

We included any studies implementing concurrent measurement of at least one reference standard and one index test to measure vitamin A status. Eligible studies included cross-sectional or cohort-accuracy studies; longitudinal studies; and direct, indirect, and random comparison studies, in which multiple index tests with a reference standard were evaluated. Interventional studies measuring vitamin A status following supplementation or intervention were also included, while case-control studies defining cases by vitamin A status were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies and extracted data. We evaluated the methodological quality, that is, risk of bias of included studies and their applicability by using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. When meta-analysis was appropriate, we used random-effects bivariate models to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. We stratified all analyses by the reference standard and cutoff used, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 40 studies reporting 65 records. None of the studies was designed as a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) study, limiting our analyses and assessments. Index test performance was described by 25 studies for serum or plasma retinol (SR) versus retinol isotope dilution (RID), 16 studies for SR versus liver vitamin A, eight studies for retinol-binding protein (RBP) versus retinol isotope dilution (RID), three studies for RBP versus liver vitamin A, one study for breast milk vitamin A versus RID, three studies for relative dose response (RDR) versus RID, and four studies for RDR versus liver vitamin A. No studies evaluating modified RDR were eligible for inclusion. Specificity data were available from all studies; sensitivity was often estimable from only a portion of studies due to some studies having no condition-positive cases according to the reference standard (zero true positive and false negative cases). One comparison, RDR versus RID, yielded no sensitivity data, therefore we could evaluate only pooled specificity data. We generally judged risk of bias as 'unclear' across studies. Serum or plasma retinol for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency SR pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 10% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2 to 38; 23 studies, 385 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity was 92% (95% CI 85 to 96; 23 studies, 1110 participants; low-certainty evidence). SR pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 13% (95% CI 4 to 34; 24 studies, 246 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity was 94% (95% CI 87 to 97, 24 studies, 1295 participants; low-certainty evidence). SR pooled sensitivity against liver vitamin A at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 53% (95% CI 30 to 75; 16 studies, 192 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 83% (95% CI 63 to 93; 16 studies, 370 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). SR pooled sensitivity against liver vitamin A at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 54% (95% CI 33 to 74; 16 studies, 137 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 79% (95% CI 57 to 91; 16 studies, 348 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Retinol-binding protein for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency RBP pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 50% (95% CI 33 to 67; 8 studies, 30 participants; low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 76% (95% CI 72 to 81; 8 studies, 730 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). RBP pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 45% (95% CI 31 to 59; 8 studies, 47 participants; low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 77% (95% CI 71 to 82; 8 studies, 711 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). RBP pooled sensitivity against liver vitamin A at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 0% (95% CI 0 to 100; 3 studies, 12 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 98% (95% CI 84 to 100; 3 studies, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). RBP pooled sensitivity against liver vitamin A at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 0% (95% CI 0 to 100; 3 studies, 9 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 98% (95% CI 85 to 100; 3 studies, 43 participants; very low-certainty evidence) Relative dose response for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency RDR pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.1 μmol/g and 0.07 μmol/g cutoffs were not estimable due to lack of true-positive and false-negative cases from three studies. RDR pooled specificity against RID at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 89% (95% CI 26 to 99; 3 studies, 34 participants; low-certainty evidence), and RDR pooled specificity against RID at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 91% (95% CI 54 to 99; 3 studies, 34 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Available data indicate that methods to determine vitamin A deficiency had generally low sensitivity, when estimable (0% to 54%), and generally high specificity (74% to 94%) in individuals at risk for vitamin A deficiency. Estimates should be interpreted with caution because no included studies were designed or conducted as DTA studies. Data assessing the accuracy of the breast milk vitamin A, RDR, and MRDR compared to reference standards, particularly in patients with vitamin A deficiency, are limited.

### Vitamin A supplements for reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission [^116FNJug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Strategies to reduce the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV‐positive women, exclusive breastfeeding from birth for six weeks plus nevirapine or replacement feeding plus nevirapine from birth for four to six weeks, elective Caesarean section delivery, and avoiding giving children chewed food. In some settings, these interventions may not be practical, feasible, or affordable. Simple, inexpensive, and effective interventions (that could potentially be implemented even in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes) would be valuable. Vitamin A, which plays a role in immune function, is one low‐cost intervention that has been suggested in such settings.

Objectives

To summarize the effects of giving vitamin A supplements to HIV‐positive women during pregnancy and after delivery.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 25 August 2017, and checked the reference lists of relevant articles for eligible studies.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials conducted in any setting that compared vitamin A supplements to placebo or no intervention among HIV‐positive women during pregnancy or after delivery, or both.

Data collection and analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) as appropriate, with their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and conducted random‐effects meta‐analyses. This is an update of a review last published in 2011.

Main results

Five trials met the inclusion criteria. These were conducted in Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe between 1995 and 2005 and none of the participants received ART. Women allocated to intervention arms received vitamin A supplements at a variety of doses (daily during pregnancy; a single dose immediately after delivery, or daily doses during pregnancy plus a single dose after delivery). Women allocated to comparison arms received identical placebo (6601 women, 4 trials) or no intervention (697 women, 1 trial). Four trials (with 6995 women) had low risk of bias and one trial (with 303 women) had high risk of attrition bias.

The trials show that giving vitamin A supplements to HIV‐positive women during pregnancy, the immediate postpartum period, or both, probably has little or no effect on mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.26; 4428 women, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence) and may have little or no effect on child death by two years of age (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22; 3883 women, 3 trials, low certainty evidence). However, giving vitamin A supplements during pregnancy may increase the mean birthweight (MD 34.12 g, 95% CI −12.79 to 81.02; 2181 women, 3 trials, low certainty evidence) and probably reduces the incidence of low birthweight (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97; 1819 women, 3 trials, moderate certainty evidence); but we do not know whether vitamin A supplements affect the risk of preterm delivery (1577 women, 2 trials), stillbirth (2335 women, 3 trials), or maternal death (1267 women, 2 trials).

Authors' conclusions

Antepartum or postpartum vitamin A supplementation, or both, probably has little or no effect on mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV in women living with HIV infection and not on antiretroviral drugs. The intervention has largely been superseded by ART which is widely available and effective in preventing vertical transmission.

### Biofortified and fortified maize consumption reduces prevalence of low milk retinol, but does not increase vitamin A stores of breastfeeding Zambian infants with adequate reserves: a randomized controlled trial [^1145YimH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Replacement of conventional staples with biofortified or industrially fortified staples in household diets may increase maternal breast milk retinol content and vitamin A intakes from complementary foods, improving infant total body stores (TBS) of vitamin A.

Objectives

To determine whether biofortified or industrially fortified maize consumption by Zambian women and their breastfeeding infants could improve milk retinol concentration and infant TBS.

Methods

We randomly assigned 255 lactating women and their 9-mo-old infants to a 90-d intervention providing 0 µg retinol equivalents (RE)/d as conventional maize or ∼315 µg RE/d to mothers and ∼55 µg RE/d to infants as provitamin A carotenoid-biofortified maize or retinyl palmitate-fortified maize. Outcomes were TBS, measured by retinol isotope dilution in infants (primary), and breast milk retinol, measured by HPLC in women (secondary).

Results

The intervention groups were comparable at baseline. Loss to follow-up was 10% (n = 230 mother-infant pairs). Women consumed 92% of the intended 287 g/d and infants consumed 82% of the intended 50 g/d maize. The baseline geometric mean (GM) milk retinol concentration was 1.57 μmol/L (95% CI: 1.45, 1.69 μmol/L), and 24% of women had milk retinol < 1.05 μmol/L. While mean milk retinol did not change in the biofortified arm (β: 0.11; 95% CI: -0.02, 0.24), the intervention reduced low milk retinol (RR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.85). Fortified maize increased mean milk retinol (β: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.30) and reduced the prevalence of low milk retinol (RR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.82). The baseline GM TBS was 178 μmol (95% CI: 166, 191 μmol). This increased by 24 µmol (± 136) over the 90-d intervention period, irrespective of treatment group.

Conclusions

Both biofortified and fortified maize consumption improved milk retinol concentration. This did not translate into greater infant TBS, most likely due to adequate TBS at baseline. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02804490.

Regarding the use of tretinoin PO (also known as Retin-A, Retin – A Micro, Altreno, Renova) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: do not use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential one week before initiating treatment. Advise using two reliable forms of contraception during treatment and for one month after the last dose. The drug tretinoin PO (also known as Retin-A, Retin – A Micro, Altreno, Renova) is classified under category X in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has such a high risk of causing permanent damage to the fetus that it should not be used in pregnancy or when there is a possibility of pregnancy.

### The acute and chronic toxic effects of vitamin a… [^112HvgiA]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

The acute and chronic effects of vitamin A toxicity are well documented in the literature. Emerging evidence suggests that subtoxicity without clinical signs of toxicity may be a growing concern, because intake from preformed sources of vitamin A often exceeds the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for adults, especially in developed countries. Osteoporosis and hip fracture are associated with preformed vitamin A intakes that are only twice the current RDA. Assessing vitamin A status in persons with subtoxicity or toxicity is complicated because serum retinol concentrations are nonsensitive indicators in this range of liver vitamin A reserves. The metabolism in well-nourished persons of preformed vitamin A, provided by either liver or supplements, has been studied by several research groups. To control vitamin A deficiency, large therapeutic doses are administered in developing countries to women and children, who often are undernourished. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to the short-term kinetics (ie, after absorption but before storage) of a large dose of vitamin A or to the short- and long-term effects of such a dose given to lactating women on serum and breast-milk concentrations of retinol and its metabolites. Moreover, appropriate dosing regimens have not been systematically evaluated to ascertain the quantitative improvement in vitamin A status of the women and children who receive these supplements. The known acute and chronic effects of vitamin A toxicity have been reported previously. However, further research is needed to ascertain the areas of the world in which subclinical toxicity exists and to evaluate its effects on overall health and well-being.

### Call to action for equitable access to human milk for vulnerable infants [^112fBWx6]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

There are a number of important ethical considerations that policymakers, regulators, health workers, and mothers must consider in facilitating and navigating supportive breastfeeding environments, including the provision of human milk within different socioeconomic contexts.

Ethical challenges include the commercialisation of donor human milk for profit and exploitation of women in low-income settings selling breastmilk — where detrimental to their own child's health — for purchase by consumers in high-income settings; managing risks associated with peer-to-peer sharing and selling of unscreened human milk; weighing trade-offs for increasing screening of donors to ensure milk safety with increasing supply to address unmet need; potential risks that donor's own infants are not optimally breastfed; and determining how best to prioritise provision of donor human milk in times of scarcity. A crucial and overriding challenge is ensuring the appropriate use of donor milk so that it serves as a bridge to support breastfeeding, rather than displacing a mother's own milk and breastfeeding.

To address these challenges, the Ethox Centre of the University of Oxford and PATH convened a working group — the Oxford-PATH Human Milk Working Group — of technical and policy experts in nutrition, human milk banking, human rights, bioethics, and maternal, newborn, and child health to develop ethical guidance in support of safe and equitable access to human milk and breastfeeding for vulnerable infants. Participants shared perspectives from Australia, France, Germany, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, UK, USA, and Vietnam. The working group identified cross-cutting ethical considerations and key actions that should be addressed as part of global and regional responses to donor milk policy and guideline development (panel).

The working group calls on global, regional, and country-level policy and regulatory bodies to establish governance mechanisms and enact legislation for the safe and ethical use of donor human milk in a way that also protects, promotes, and supports breastfeeding — similar to the policies established to guide the safe, ethical use of medical products of human origin. These standards and policies are urgently needed to inform the development and operations of donor human milk programmes at the national, regional, and global levels. By heeding this call, we can work together to protect breastfeeding and safe, equitable access to human milk for vulnerable infants, and for all infants and young children globally.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^1175YjnZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Maternal care in stimulant use disorder (StUD) — the guideline lists clinical questions for Prenatal Care Incentives (Table 32), Postpartum Care (Table 33), and Breastfeeding (Table 34). It asks what are the most effective and appropriate interventions for increasing prenatal care access and attendance in patients being treated for StUD; whether there are additional treatment needs for patients with StUD in the postpartum period and for patients with any level of stimulant use; and whether patients with StUD should breastfeed, when a patient who uses stimulants can safely breastfeed, and whether clinicians can increase the rate of safe breastfeeding in patients with a StUD, with any stimulant use.

### Postpartum contraception: a matter of guidelines [^116ii9z4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The postpartum period is the perfect time to access family planning services. WHO guidelines contraindicate combined hormonal contraceptives postpartum in breastfeeding patients between 6weeks and 6months after delivery (Medical Eligibility Criteria category 3). On the contrary, the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines do not contraindicate their use in women who breastfeed from 6weeks to 6months postpartum. New combined hormonal contraceptives with natural estrogens have never been studied in this setting. Guidelines agree on the prescription of the progestin-only pill postpartum in non-breastfeeding women (category 1). Differences are found in women who breastfeed. In non-breastfeeding women, an implant is considered safe (category 1) by all guidelines, without any distinction in time. Regarding postpartum breastfeeding women, the guidelines for implants give quite different indications but are still permissive. Intrauterine devices are viable options for postpartum contraception but guidelines give different indications about the timing of insertion. Postplacental intrauterine device placement can reduce the subsequent unintended pregnancy rate, particularly in settings at greatest risk of not having recommended postpartum controls. However, it has yet to be understood whether this approach can really have an advantage in high-income countries. Postpartum contraception is not a 'matter of guidelines': it is the best customization for each woman, as early as possible but at the ideal timing.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Opportunistic infection drugs during pregnancy — ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir: No AEs in mice, rats, and rabbits during pregnancy or lactation with no data in human pregnancy or breastfeeding; because ribavirin, recommended to be used with this drug, is contraindicated in pregnancy, therapy in pregnancy not recommended.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 776: immune modulating therapies in pregnancy and lactation [^116qY94T]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Because autoimmune conditions occur more often among women of childbearing age, continuation of these medications during pregnancy is often considered to optimize disease management in the woman and pregnancy outcomes, without placing the fetus at undue risk. Many commonly prescribed drugs can be used safely during pregnancy, without risk of teratogenicity or pregnancy complications, whereas a few are strictly contraindicated. The decision to use any agent during pregnancy should be based on the clinical context, risks associated with individual medications, and gestational age. For immunomodulators considered appropriate to use during pregnancy, the common clinical practice of stopping use at approximately 32 weeks of gestation because of theoretic concerns regarding the immune system of the fetus is not supported by currently available data. Low-risk medications typically are continued in pregnancy, or initiated during pregnancy as needed, because the benefits of therapy and disease control far outweigh any theoretic risks associated with the medication. Use or initiation of medications with intermediate risk or little or no data during pregnancy or lactation (or both) should be individualized. High-risk medications are typically not continued or initiated in pregnancy. However, it is critical that counseling occur, ideally in the prepregnancy and interpregnancy periods, to review the individual risks and benefits as they relate to disease management and pregnancy-associated risks with high-risk medication. There may be select circumstances when continued treatment is the safest option. In general, immunomodulating drugs that are not contraindicated in pregnancy are compatible with breastfeeding.

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine in pregnant patients with connective tissue diseases. review of the literature [^111NTsAF]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is widely used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Even if it is generally agreed that pregnancy per se increases disease activity in patients with SLE and that withdrawal of HCQ at the onset of pregnancy may result in exacerbation of SLE, use of HCQ during pregnancy has remained controversial for a long time. Parke was the first to propose continuation of HCQ throughout gestation. Currently, more than 250 pregnancies resulting in live births have been reported and no increase in the rate of birth defects have been demonstrated. When studied, no retinal toxicity and ototoxicity have been found. Data concerning lactation and HCQ treatment are rare. However, the amount of HCQ received by children through lactation seems very low. In conclusion, HCQ should probably be maintained throughout pregnancy in patients with SLE and it does not seem necessary to advise against breastfeeding.

### Early vitamin a supplementation improves the outcome of retinopathy of prematurity in extremely preterm infants [^1159q7jS]. Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a common retinal neovascular disorder and a major cause of visual impairment or blindness in preterm infants, even in the context of current standard care. Preventive therapy for ROP is still lacking, and visual improvements after treatment are often poor. Retinopathy of prematurity pathogenesis is associated with the regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). Inhibition of VEGF at the neovascular phase may prevent destructive neovascularization, but VEGF as a treatment should be weighted carefully, as VEGF also promotes normal physiological development of blood vessels in many tissues. –

Extremely preterm infants are prone to vitamin A (VA) deficiency because of the reduced transplacental transport from their mothers, inadequate intake from enteral feeding for several weeks after birth, and poor gastrointestinal absorption. The inadequate provision and unreliable delivery of parenteral VA may exacerbate the issue of VA deficiency. Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient for maintaining a normal visual function. Hepatic storage of VA is not so efficient in extremely preterm infants, – and correspondingly, plasma concentrations of retinol are also low. Most of the VA in the body is stored in the liver, but a large amount of VA is also assimilated into the eyes. Retinaldehyde is an essential constituent of rhodopsin, which is formed by the reversible oxidation of retinol, and is contained within the photoreceptor membrane disks in the outer retina. The human retinal rhodopsin content increases several-fold during the third trimester of pregnancy, but it is unknown how retinal rhodopsin content increases postnatally in prematurely born infants. The retinal rhodopsin content is dependent on VA sufficiency in the developing rat and is reduced by the early exposure to light. Some reports showed that ROP may be prevented by intramuscular supplementation with VA, and other showed that in most preterm infants who tolerate feeds, VA deficiency can be corrected safely by supplementing the feeds with 5,000 IU of VA per day. However, there have been no previous controlled trials conducted regarding oral VA supplementation in preterm infants in ROP prevention. European guidelines on VA supplementation recommend a daily dose of 1,000 to 3,300 IU/kg body weight in preterm infants. This study selected the median dose to assess the efficacy and safety of early VA supplementation for ROP prevention in extremely preterm infants.

### One-time vitamin A supplementation of lactating sows enhances hepatic retinol in their offspring independent of dose size [^116xUwpK]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Single megadoses of vitamin A between 200,000 and 400,000 IU have been administered to lactating mothers to improve the vitamin A status of both mothers and breastfeeding infants. However, the most beneficial dosing regimen is not known.

Objective

The effect of megadoses of vitamin A supplements given to lactating sows on hepatic vitamin A concentrations in their nursing offspring was examined.

Design

Lactating sows were given a high (2.1 mmol), low (1.05 mmol), or control (0 mmol) dose of retinyl acetate in oil (n = 3 sows per treatment). Piglets nursed for 3 or 14 d, consumed a vitamin A-free diet for the next 4 d, and were then killed. Liver and serum samples were analyzed for vitamin A.

Results

After 3 d, piglets of the control, low-dose, and high-dose sows had different (P = 0.034) hepatic vitamin A concentrations, ie, 0.078 ± 0.004, 0.14 ± 0.053, and 0.13 ± 0.026 micromol/g, respectively. Liver vitamin A concentrations on day 18 were 0.069 ± 0.004, 0.14 ± 0.044, and 0.11 ± 0.026 micromol/g in the control, low-dose, and high-dose piglets, respectively (P = 0.017). Liver vitamin A concentrations in piglets of the low- and high-dose sows were not significantly different (day 3: P = 0.97; day 18: P = 0.59). Serum retinol concentrations were higher (P = 0.02) at early kill (0.95 ± 0.22 micromol/L) than at late kill (0.76 ± 0.24 micromol/L) but were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Maternal vitamin A supplementation enhances liver vitamin A concentrations in offspring. Larger one-time doses are not more effective than are smaller doses. Additional research is needed to determine the most effective maternal dosing regimens for improving infant vitamin A status.

### Vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women [^112QedJt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In areas where vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a public health concern, the maternal dietary intake of vitamin A may be not sufficient to meet either the maternal nutritional requirements, or those of the breastfed infant, due the low retinol concentrations in breast milk.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant health.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (8 February 2016), LILACS (1982 to December 2015), Web of Science (1945 to December 2015), and the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-randomised trials that assessed the effects of vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant health (morbidity, mortality and vitamin A nutritional status).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted data extraction, assessed risk of bias and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Fourteen trials of mainly low or unclear risk of bias, enrolling 25,758 women and infant pairs were included. The supplementation schemes included high, single or double doses of vitamin A (200,000 to 400,000 internation units (IU)), or 7.8 mg daily beta-carotene compared with placebo, no treatment, other (iron); or higher (400,000 IU) versus lower dose (200,000 IU). In all trials, a considerable proportion of infants were at least partially breastfed until six months. Supplement (vitamin A as retinyl, water-miscible or beta-carotene) 200,000 to 400,000 IU versus control (placebo or no treatment) Maternal: We did not find evidence that vitamin A supplementation reduced maternal mortality at 12 months (hazard ratio (HR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 2.21; 8577 participants; 1 RCT, moderate-quality evidence). Effects were less certain at six months (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.71; 564 participants; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). The effect on maternal morbidity (diarrhoea, respiratory infections, fever) was uncertain because the quality of evidence was very low (50 participants, 1 RCT). We found insufficient evidence that vitamin A increases abdominal pain (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.73; 786 participants; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). We found low-quality evidence that vitamin A supplementation increased breast milk retinol concentrations by 0.20 µmol/L at three to three and a half months (mean difference (MD) 0.20 µmol/L, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.31; 837 participants; 6 RCTs). Infant: We did not find evidence that vitamin A supplementation reduced infant mortality at two to 12 months (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.52; 6090 participants; 5 RCTs; low-quality evidence). Effects on morbidity (gastroenteritis at three months) was uncertain (RR 6.03, 95% CI 0.30 to 121.82; 84 participants; 1 RCT; very low-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence for the effect on infant adverse outcomes (bulging fontanelle at 24 to 48 hours) (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.61 to 6.55; 444 participants; 1 RCT). Supplement (vitamin A as retinyl) 400,000 IU versus 200,000 IUThree studies (1312 participants) were included in this comparison. None of the studies assessed maternal mortality, maternal morbidity or infant mortality. Findings from one study showed that there may be little or no difference in infant morbidity between the doses (diarrhoea, respiratory illnesses, and febrile illnesses) (312 participants, data not pooled). No firm conclusion could be drawn on the impact on maternal and infant adverse outcomes (limited data available). The effect on breast milk retinol was also uncertain due to the small amount of information available.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence of benefit from different doses of vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, compared with other doses or placebo. Although maternal breast milk retinol concentrations improved with supplementation, this did not translate to health benefits for either women or infants. Few studies reported on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Future studies should include these important outcomes.

### Rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy: evolution of disease activity and pathophysiological considerations for drug use [^113RFa7t]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Anti-malarial agents

Use of HCQ during pregnancy at the low doses used for malaria prophylaxis does not increase the risk of congenital abnormalities or pregnancy loss. When used as a DMARD at much higher doses, the continuation of this drug during pregnancy has long been controversial and the FDA classifies HCQ in Category C. This controversy was mainly due to reports on retinal toxicity and ototoxicity observed after treatment with chloroquine.

HCQ use during pregnancy has been reported in more than 250 pregnancies in SLE patients, with no indications for increased congenital malformations or hearing or vision impairment. A more limited number of children exposed to HCQ have been assessed for retinal toxicity or cardiac conductivity disturbances, again with no indications of adverse effects of the drug. HCQ is secreted into milk at low concentrations, but in view of the transplacental crossing of the drug and the relatively long tissue half-life, it is not deemed necessary to advise against lactation of children exposed to the drug during pregnancy.

AZA

AZA and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are designated as FDA Category D drugs (Table 2), indicating that increased risk for the fetus exists, but the risk must be weighed against the possible benefits of the drug. Although AZA is teratogenic in animals, inducing skeletal and visceral malformations in rabbits and mice at doses equivalent to the human dose, multiple case series and cohort studies in human pregnancy, mostly in transplant recipients and IBD patients, have not revealed increased incidence of congenital anomalies or recurrent patterns of malformations.

A recent cohort study in Denmark, including birth outcomes of 76 exposed pregnancies, showed an increased risk of preterm delivery and low birthweight in women exposed to AZA or 6-MP during pregnancy, but no significant increase in congenital malformations. However, the data suggest that adverse birth outcomes are caused by the underlying disease rather than by use of AZA or MP.

Thiopurines undergo a complex metabolization process and the placenta forms a partial barrier to their metabolites. Indeed, the active metabolites 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) are detectable in fetal red blood cells, whereas 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) is not. Dosing 6-TGN at least once during pregnancy is recommended to avoid excessively high levels, which may cause myelosuppresson in mother and child. Traditionally, breastfeeding is believed to be contraindicated under thiopurine treatment, but several recent studies have shown that 6-MP levels in breast milk are low, and conclude that breastfeeding during treatment with AZA seems safe.

- **Increased liver enzymes**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tretinoin has been associated with an increased risk of elevated LFTs. Monitor LFTs during treatment, and consider temporarily interrupting tretinoin if results are > 5 times the ULN.
- **Intracranial hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as retinoids have been associated with an increased risk of intracranial hypertension, especially in pediatric patients and with concomitant use of other agents known to increase ICP, such as tetracyclines.

### Policy statement: breastfeeding and the use of human milk [^114oQMZ6]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding and human milk are the normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition. The short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding make breastfeeding, or the provision of human milk, a public health imperative. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for approximately 6 months after birth. Furthermore, the AAP supports continued breastfeeding, along with appropriate complementary foods introduced at about 6 months, as long as mutually desired by mother and child for 2 years or beyond. These recommendations are consistent with those of the World Health Organization (WHO). Medical contraindications to breastfeeding are rare. The AAP recommends that birth hospitals or centers implement maternity care practices shown to improve breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Joint Commission monitor breastfeeding practices in US hospitals. Pediatricians play a critical role in hospitals, their practices, and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and, thus, need to be trained about the benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and children and in managing breastfeeding.

### Managing antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and lactation [^114uSjFK]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses data on the pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in pregnancy and lactation, and the clinical consequences thereof, thus providing a basis for a rational management of AEDs during pregnancy and lactation.

Recent Findings

Studies have confirmed that the elimination of lamotrigine and the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine is enhanced during pregnancy. It has been established that the increased clearance of lamotrigine is caused by induction of glucuronidation. Also, the plasma concentrations of levetiracetam decline in pregnancy but the mechanism for this effect is yet to be explored. Lamotrigine is eliminated slowly in breast-fed infants, but although lamotrigine concentrations in the infant can reach pharmacological levels, no studies have reported clinically relevant adverse effects caused by lactation.

Summary

Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of AEDs in pregnancy and during lactation is important to enable optimal treatment. Gestation induced alterations in pharmacokinetics vary with the AED but also between patients and are difficult to predict. Therapeutic drug monitoring is, therefore, advisable during pregnancy and the use of the individual patient's optimal prepregnancy drug level is recommended as reference. Breastfeeding is in general safe but needs appropriate observation of the nursing infant.

### Vitamin A supplements for reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission [^116qfp6D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

The Global Burden of Disease Study estimates that there were 38.8 million people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide in 2015, half of whom were women of childbearing age (Wang 2016). In addition, there are more than 600 new paediatric infections each day worldwide; most of which occur in sub‐Saharan Africa (UNAIDS 2015). Children mostly acquire these infections from their mothers during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.

The high number of women who are of childbearing age and who are living with HIV makes the prevention of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV a global health priority (UNAIDS 2015). Current strategies to reduce the risk of transmission include lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) to HIV‐positive women, exclusive breastfeeding from birth for six weeks plus nevirapine, or replacement feeding plus nevirapine from birth for four to six weeks (WHO 2015), elective Caesarean section delivery (Read 2005), and avoiding giving children chewed food. Despite their benefits, these interventions are impractical in many resource‐limited countries because they require the determination of the HIV status of pregnant women and are costly, complex, and require skilled personnel. Simple, inexpensive, and effective interventions that could potentially be implemented in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes would be valuable. Vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy is one low‐cost intervention that has been suggested (Newell 2000).

### A.S.P.E.N. position paper: recommendations for changes in commercially available parenteral multivitamin and multi-trace element products [^115JbNHC]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin A — deficiency, toxicity, and monitoring are summarized as follows: Vitamin A and its active compounds are important for vision, skin, growth, development, reproduction, and immune function; deficiency can result from dietary insufficiency, fat malabsorption, and caloric, protein, or zinc deficiency and lead to poor outcomes in vitamin A–related functions, while toxicity is less common but can occur with intravenous nutrition, liver disorders, or renal dysfunction. For safety in pregnancy, the use of synthetic retinoid therapy during pregnancy should be avoided. For assessment, serum retinol or the retinol binding protein transthyretin ratio can be used to assess deficiency, and retinyl ester levels can be used to establish toxicity. For intake, to avoid deficiency or toxicity, a careful approach to dietary intake should take into account the current recommendations for healthy people, and considerations and special monitoring are needed for hospitalized individuals; recommended intakes of vitamin A (and/or RAE) can be seen in Table A2.1.

### Vitamin A supplements for reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission [^114yo6T4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Strategies to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) include lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-positive women, exclusive breastfeeding from birth for six weeks plus nevirapine or replacement feeding plus nevirapine from birth for four to six weeks, elective Caesarean section delivery, and avoiding giving children chewed food. In some settings, these interventions may not be practical, feasible, or affordable. Simple, inexpensive, and effective interventions (that could potentially be implemented even in the absence of prenatal HIV testing programmes) would be valuable. Vitamin A, which plays a role in immune function, is one low-cost intervention that has been suggested in such settings.

Objectives

To summarize the effects of giving vitamin A supplements to HIV-positive women during pregnancy and after delivery.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to 25 August 2017, and checked the reference lists of relevant articles for eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials conducted in any setting that compared vitamin A supplements to placebo or no intervention among HIV-positive women during pregnancy or after delivery, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) as appropriate, with their 95% confidence intervals (CI), and conducted random-effects meta-analyses. This is an update of a review last published in 2011.

Main Results

Five trials met the inclusion criteria. These were conducted in Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe between 1995 and 2005 and none of the participants received ART. Women allocated to intervention arms received vitamin A supplements at a variety of doses (daily during pregnancy; a single dose immediately after delivery, or daily doses during pregnancy plus a single dose after delivery). Women allocated to comparison arms received identical placebo (6601 women, 4 trials) or no intervention (697 women, 1 trial). Four trials (with 6995 women) had low risk of bias and one trial (with 303 women) had high risk of attrition bias. The trials show that giving vitamin A supplements to HIV-positive women during pregnancy, the immediate postpartum period, or both, probably has little or no effect on mother-to-child transmission of HIV (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.26; 4428 women, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence) and may have little or no effect on child death by two years of age (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22; 3883 women, 3 trials, low certainty evidence). However, giving vitamin A supplements during pregnancy may increase the mean birthweight (MD 34.12 g, 95% CI -12.79 to 81.02; 2181 women, 3 trials, low certainty evidence) and probably reduces the incidence of low birthweight (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97; 1819 women, 3 trials, moderate certainty evidence); but we do not know whether vitamin A supplements affect the risk of preterm delivery (1577 women, 2 trials), stillbirth (2335 women, 3 trials), or maternal death (1267 women, 2 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

Antepartum or postpartum vitamin A supplementation, or both, probably has little or no effect on mother-to-child transmission of HIV in women living with HIV infection and not on antiretroviral drugs. The intervention has largely been superseded by ART which is widely available and effective in preventing vertical transmission.

### Early neonatal vitamin A supplementation and infant mortality: an individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116G3eXa]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Biannual vitamin A supplementation is a well-established survival tool for preschool children 6 months and older in vitamin A deficient populations but this schedule misses the opportunity to intervene on most young infant deaths. Randomised trials of neonatal vitamin A supplementation (NVAS) in the first few days of life to assess its impact on under 6-month mortality in low/middle-income countries have had varying results.

Methods

Investigators of 11 published randomised placebo-controlled NVAS trials (n = 163 567 children) reanalysed their data according to an agreed plan and pooled the primary outcomes of mortality from supplementation through 6 and 12 months of age using random effects models and meta-regression. One investigator withdrew but allowed use of the data.

Findings

Overall there was no effect of NVAS on infant survival through 6 (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.06) or 12 months of age (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08) but results varied by study population characteristics.NVAS significantly reduced 6-month mortality among the trials conducted in Southern Asia (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98), in contexts with moderate or severe vitamin A deficiency (defined as 10% or higher proportion of women with serum retinol < 0.7 µmol/L or 5% or more women with night blindness) (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.94), early infant mortality was 30 or more per 1000 live births (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98), 75% or more of infant mortality occurred in the first 6 months of life (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01), or where > 32% mothers had no schooling (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96). NVAS did not reduce mortality in the first 6 months of life in trials conducted in Africa, in contexts characterised by a low prevalence of vitamin A deficiency, lower rates of infant mortality and where maternal education was more prevalent. There was a suggestion of increased infant mortality in trials conducted in Africa (RR 1.07; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.15). Individual-level characteristics such as sex, birth weight, gestational age and size, age at dosing, parity, time of breast feeding initiation, maternal education and maternal vitamin A supplementation did not modify the impact of NVAS.

Conclusion

NVAS reduced infant mortality in South Asia, in contexts where the prevalence of maternal vitamin A deficiency is moderate to severe and early infant mortality is high; but it had no beneficial effect on infant survival in Africa, in contexts where the prevalence of maternal vitamin A deficiency is lower, early infant mortality is low.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^111UKQdN]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Breastfeeding — drug transfer and safety considerations: Some topical glaucoma medications have been detected in breast milk, including timolol, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and brimonidine; the data are inconsistent as to whether timolol poses a threat to the breastfeeding infant. The American Academy of Pediatrics has approved the use of both oral and topical forms of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors during lactation, although the infant should be carefully monitored when the former are used, and brimonidine is known to cross the blood-brain barrier and can cause apnea in infants.

### Elevated serum concentrations of β-glucuronide metabolites and 4-oxoretinol in lactating sows after treatment with vitamin A: a model for evaluating supplementation in lactating women [^113zbXNm]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of large doses of preformed vitamin A, such as those provided in supplementation programs for the prevention of deficiency, on total serum vitamin A have been inadequately investigated.

Objective

This study characterized the time course of serum vitamin A metabolites in lactating sows after single high doses of retinyl ester.

Design

Lactating sows were fitted with jugular catheters and subsequently fed either 1.05 or 2.1 mmol retinyl ester (n = 6/group) or a corn oil vehicle (n = 3). Blood was collected at baseline and at intervals to 48 h and analyzed by gradient HPLC for retinol, retinyl esters, and metabolites.

Results

The mean (± SD) total serum vitamin A concentration peaked at 1 h (3.69 ± 4.0 mumol/L) and 2 h (7.70 ± 6.8 mumol/L) in the low- and high-dose groups, respectively (P < 0.05). Retinyl esters accounted for most of the serum vitamin A in both groups at peak time points. Mean serum retinol concentrations changed little and accounted for most of the serum vitamin A at baseline (94% and 97% for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively) but for only 22% and 14% at peak times for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively. Postdosage increases were observed for total vitamin A and retinyl esters, 4-oxoretinol, retinoyl beta-glucuronide, and retinyl beta-glucuronide but not for retinoic acid.

Conclusions

Serum retinol concentration remains relatively static after a large dose of preformed vitamin A and therefore is not an appropriate measure of intervention efficacy. The increases in beta-glucuronide metabolites and 4-oxoretinol suggest a preventive role against a rise in retinoic acid and retinol.

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^115PZ8bW]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding mothers — maternal lactation status should not delay treatment (II-2), and women with moderate to severe symptoms may require only antidepressant drug treatment; in the setting of moderate to severe depression, the benefits of treatment likely outweigh the risks of the medication to the mother or infant. There is no widely accepted algorithm for antidepressant medication treatment of depression in lactating women, and an individualized risk–benefit analysis must be conducted in each situation and take into account the mother's clinical history and response to treatment, the risks of untreated depression, the risks and benefits of breastfeeding, the benefits of treatment, the known and unknown risks of the medication to the infant, and the mother's wishes. If a mother has no history of antidepressant treatment, an antidepressant such as sertraline that has evidence of lower levels in human milk and infant serum and few side effects is an appropriate first choice (II-2), and sertraline has the best safety profile during lactation; the recommended starting dose is 25 mg for 5–7 days to avoid side effects, which then can be increased to 50 mg/day.

### Vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women [^112Hqf3k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In vitamin A deficient populations, the amount of vitamin A may be insufficient for maintenance of maternal health and levels in breast milk may be insufficient for breastfeeding infants' needs.

Objectives

To assess the effects of postpartum maternal vitamin A supplementation on maternal and infant health.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2010), LILACS (1982 to July 2010), Web of Science (1945 to July 2010) and Biological Abstracts (1998 to July 2010).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of postpartum maternal vitamin A supplementation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed the studies independently.

Main Results

We included 12 trials at moderate risk of bias, enrolling 25,465 mother-baby pairs and comparing several postpartum doses (200,000–400,000 IU) of vitamin A or 7.8 mg daily beta-carotene, with placebo, iron or no supplement; or higher (400,000 IU) versus lower dose (200,000 IU). The majority of infants in all studies were at least partially breastfed for six months. Maternal: we observed no impact of vitamin A on maternal mortality (two trials of 9,126 women), morbidity (one trial of 50 women) or adverse effects (subset of 786 women in one trial). Vitamin A enhanced serum and breast milk retinol at three months in five trials, but these improvements were generally not sustained. Infant: we observed no significant differences for infant mortality RR 1.14 95% CI 0.84 to 1.57 (five trials (6,170 infants) or morbidity (three trials) except for fewer episodes of fever with vitamin A in one small trial. No significant differences in infant vitamin A status were seen with maternal vitamin A supplementation (five trials). No beneficial effects for maternal or infant health were associated with higher compared to lower doses of vitamin A in two trials.

Authors' Conclusions

The lack of effect on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, with exception of some improved infant morbidity in one small study, and the improvement in maternal vitamin A status, suggest that maternal postpartum vitamin A supplementation offers limited benefits.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^114jzmat]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Safety of antiretroviral drugs used for infant prophylaxis — When used alone for prophylaxis in low-risk scenarios during the neonatal period and breastfeeding, antiretrovirals (ARVs) appear highly safe, with the most prominent neonatal toxicity being anemia from zidovudine (ZDV) that occurs after 2–4 weeks and recovers with cessation of treatment. During breastfeeding, 3TC has been shown to be safe through at least 41 weeks of life, NVP has been shown to be safe for infants from birth through 18 months of life, and three-drug combinations appear safe within the durations currently recommended (i.e., 2–6 weeks).

### ABM clinical protocol # 18: use of antidepressants in breastfeeding mothers [^115EG58w]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #18 — choosing an antidepressant during lactation: The medication must be both efficacious for the mother and safe for the infant, and factors affecting the passage of medication into human milk must be considered, including route of drug administration and pharmacokinetics with properties such as pH of plasma (7.4) and milk (6.8), solubility, and protein binding, as well as the amount of drug received by the infant in human milk (milk yield, colostrum versus mature milk, concentration in milk, how well the breast was emptied during the previous feeding, and the infant's ability to absorb, detoxify, and excrete the drug). Most antidepressant studies provide milk levels or milk to mother's plasma ratio that vary with dose, frequency, duration, maternal disposition, interactions, and genetics, whereas few studies provide infant serum levels, although they are the best measure of infant exposure.

### The FDA's new advice on fish: it's complicated [^113vKLcd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency recently issued an updated draft of advice on fish consumption for pregnant and breastfeeding women, after survey data indicated that the majority of pregnant women do not eat much fish and thus may have inadequate intake of the omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and ducosahexaenoic acid [DHA]. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential components of membranes in all cells of the body and are vitally important for normal development of the brain and retinal tissues (especially myelin and retinal photoreceptors) and for maintenance of normal neurotransmission and connectivity. They also serve as substrates for the synthesis of a variety of antiinflammatory and inflammation-resolving mediators, favorably alter the production of thromboxane and prostaglandin E2, and improve cardiovascular health by preventing fatal arrhythmias and reducing triglyceride and C-reactive protein levels. Maternal ingestion of adequate quantities of fish (defined in many studies as at least 340 g of oily fish each week) has been associated with better childhood IQ scores, fine motor coordination, and communication and social skills, along with other benefits. Although the FDA did not clarify which fish to eat, it specifically advised against eating fish with the highest mercury levels and implied that fish with high levels of EPA and DHA and low levels of mercury are ideal. The FDA draft did not recommend taking omega 3 fatty acid or fish oil supplements instead of eating fish, which is advice that may reflect the fact that randomized controlled trials of DHA and EPA or fish oil supplementation generally have been disappointing and that the ideal daily dose of DHA and EPA is unknown. It seems safe to conclude that pregnant and nursing women should be advised to eat fish to benefit from naturally occurring omega 3 fatty acids, to avoid fish with high levels of mercury and other contaminants, and, if possible, to choose fish with high levels of EPA and DHA.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: workshop summary [^112h8qxn]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Professional entities including SMFM, ACOG, and AAP strongly advocate that women breast-feed their infants because of its numerous maternal and neonatal health benefits. Breast-feeding rates have increased approximately 2% per year between 1996 and 2001. Stultz et al studied 46 women who provided medication history during their pregnancy and while they breast-fed their infants. In this cohort, there was a significant increase in both prescription and OTC medication use during lactation compared with when they were pregnant. More than 70% of women were taking medications that were potentially unsafe, or had unknown safety profiles. Anderson et al evaluated 100 articles between 1966 and 2002 to examine possible adverse outcomes in neonates due to their exposure to maternal medication(s) during breast-feeding. These authors reported that 47% of adverse outcomes in the neonates as "possibly" linked to medication exposure during breast-feeding; 53% as "probably" linked and no infant-related deaths were associated with medications. However, there is little research focusing on understanding the quantity of medication and their chemical effects on neonates during breast-feeding.

Only 5% of the 213 new pharmaceuticals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2003 and 2012 contained human data in their pregnancy section; almost one-half did not have any safety information concerning the medication use for lactating women. Because of the lack of studies on specific drugs in pregnancy and lactation, the efficacy and dosing data are generally extrapolated from studies from adult subjects (men and nonpregnant women) and safety data are collated from the FDA-mandated postmarket surveillance. Such data often come from the use of pregnancy-exposure registries that, while useful, are greatly limited by inherent design biases.

During the workshop, the expert panel focused on the "current" state of practice and reviewed available data on select drugs in pregnancy. The group discussed what providers optimally should know about the pharmacokinetics of drugs particularly given the physiologic changes that occur in the course of pregnancy and postpartum, as well as the time of greatest vulnerability in terms of drug effects on the fetus and newborn. There was evidence presented about the interaction of drugs and breast milk, indicating that some assumptions could be made about the efficiency with which certain drugs may cross into breast milk and potentially pose further exposure risks to the neonate. Potential lessons learned from the pediatric experience with enrolling children in drug trials to enhance knowledge in this unique population and the robust safety systems in place to monitor vaccines were reviewed. The presentations and discussions from the 2-day workshop are summarized here.

### Assuring access to safe medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding [^116C3X9x]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The health of the child begins with the health of the mother. Yet, there is a persistent dearth of data to support clinical decision making in pregnant and breastfeeding women, risking inadequate, inappropriate, or lack of treatment, any of which can result in significant health consequences for the mother or child. Many factors contribute to this, including the temporary nature of pregnancy. Most importantly the histories of thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol continue to cast long shadows on clinical, regulatory, and public attitudes surrounding research and medicinal treatment involving pregnant and breastfeeding women. They were the basis for "special protections" for women in rules and regulations governing research, largely preventing exploration of ethical ways to study such populations to obtain robust and reliable data. Similarly, the extreme nature of the cases in which infants were affected are likely to have been driving factors in the liability barriers to data collection by industry. Without data, regulators are unable to confidently ensure robust information in labeling.

On the other hand, there have been recent efforts to close these information gaps. For example, observational data on pertussis vaccination in pregnancy was critical in removing a "not recommended in pregnancy" categorization of pertussis vaccines in Europe. Clinical trials of vaccines to prevent H1N1 influenza during the 2009 pandemic contributed to the body of knowledge on the safety of inactivated influenza vaccines in pregnancy, which supported public health outreach that led to increased seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine coverage among pregnant women in the United States.

Still, when considering use of the majority of medicines, women and healthcare providers are placed in an impossible position — needing to make healthcare decisions in an information vacuum.

### Early neonatal vitamin A supplementation and infant mortality: an individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115KWH31]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2019). Medium credibility.

Pooled results stratified by individual-level characteristics

Meta-analyses of effects of NVAS at 6 and 12 months stratified by 11 individual-level characteristics (sex, birth weight, size for gestation, age at dosing, parity, maternal education, time of breast feeding initiation, colostrum given, MVAS and maternal night blindness) did not show any significant heterogeneity between subgroups. The only exception was stratification by maternal serum retinol at baseline, which showed significant heterogeneity (p = 0.042) in effects of NVAS among infants born to mothers with low to deficient (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.51 to 1.05) and adequate status (RR 1.26; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.84), thus suggesting effect modification. However, the RR was not significant in either of the two subgroups (table 2).

Table 2
Meta-analysis pooled risk ratios for the effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementation against a placebo on mortality through 6 and 12 months, overall and stratified by individual-level subgroups (fixed effects)

While there was no indication that size for gestation and maternal night blindness are significant effect modifiers, two individual subgroups by these characteristics showed significant effects. NVAS significantly reduced the risk of death under 6 months among term small for gestational age infants (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97) but not among other subgroups by size and gestation in pooled results from six studies. NVAS also significantly reduced risk of death by 6 months in four studies among infants of mothers who reported no night blindness (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.98), but not significantly so in mothers who reported night blindness (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.26) (table 2).

There was no significant benefit or harm identified for any of the subgroups by individual-level characteristics regarding mortality through 12 months (table 2). Online supplementary appendix C provides information on the estimates of the effects of NVAS on 6 and 12-month mortality for each study in the subgroups.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^115p3Vhx]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — use of supplements states "we recommend that all breastfed infants, and nonbreastfed infants and children who do not ingest at least 1 L of vitamin D–fortified milk per day, receive 400 IU vitamin D per day as a supplement", and notes that "supplementation with 400 IU/day is necessary for all breastfed infants" and should "begin within days of birth". For higher-risk groups, "Dark-skinned infants who are exclusively breastfed should receive at least 400 IU/day of vitamin D", "Preterm infants should be supplemented from birth with 400 to 800 IU/day", and the Canadian Paediatric Society "suggests supplementation with 800 IU/day for breastfed infants during the winter months"; those receiving higher doses "should be monitored at least yearly for 25(OH)-D levels". The review notes that "400 IU of vitamin D is sufficient to prevent rickets and maintain levels of > 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL)", while in adults "the recommended daily intake of vitamin D should be close to 1000 IU", pending pediatric data. Maternal high-dose options include "administration of high doses of vitamin D (4000–6400 IU daily) to breastfeeding mothers" which can raise infant 25(OH)-D without maternal hypervitaminosis D, and "High-dose vitamin D supplementation in nursing mothers… is another possible strategy for improving the vitamin D status of purely breastfeeding infants".

### Effect of vitamin supplementation on breast milk concentrations of retinol, carotenoids and tocopherols in HIV-infected Tanzanian women [^113KPWK5]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background/Objective

The effect of daily prenatal and postnatal vitamin supplementation on concentrations of breast milk nutrients is not well characterized in HIV-infected women. We examined the impact of vitamin supplementation during pregnancy and lactation on breast milk concentrations of retinol, carotenoids and tocopherols during the first year postpartum among 626 HIV-infected Tanzanian women.

Subjects/Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Women were assigned to one of four daily oral supplements: vitamin A+beta-carotene (VA+BC); multivitamins (MV; B, C and E); MV+VA+BC or placebo. Concentrations of breast milk nutrients were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography at birth and every 3 months thereafter.

Results

Supplementation with VA+BC increased concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene and alpha-carotene at delivery by 4799, 1791 and 84 nmol l(-1), respectively, compared to no VA+BC (all P < 0.0001). MV supplementation did not increase concentrations of alpha-tocopherol or delta-tocopherol at delivery but significantly decreased concentrations of breast milk gamma-tocopherol and retinol. Although concentrations of all nutrients decreased significantly by 3 months postpartum, retinol, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene concentrations were significantly higher among those receiving VA+BC at 3, 6 and 12 months compared to no VA+BC. alpha-Tocopherol was significantly higher, while gamma-tocopherol concentrations were significantly lower, among women receiving MV compared to no MV at 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum.

Conclusions

Sustained supplementation of HIV-infected breastfeeding mothers with MV could be a safe and effective intervention to improve vitamin E concentrations in breast milk. VA+BC supplementation increases concentrations of breast milk retinol but it is not recommended in HIV-infected mothers due to the elevated risk of vertical transmission.

### Tretinoin (Retin-A) [^113gfpW5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of tretinoin TOP (also known as Retin-A, Retin – A Micro, Altreno, Renova) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: do not use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. The drug tretinoin TOP (also known as Retin-A, Retin – A Micro, Altreno, Renova) is classified under category X in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has such a high risk of causing permanent damage to the fetus that it should not be used in pregnancy or when there is a possibility of pregnancy.

### Bedsharing and breastfeeding: the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine protocol # 6, revision 2019 [^111f89vS]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Counseling and screening — clinicians are told that all families should be counseled about safe sleep, that information and counseling about safe bedsharing should be provided even to parents for whom bedsharing should be discouraged because parents may bedshare anyway (even unintentionally), and that conversations should be nonjudgmental; open‑ended questions that have been found to be successful include "What are your plans for where your baby will sleep?", "What does that sleep area look like?", and "Does your baby ever end up in bed with you?"; ending stigma around bedsharing and educating all parents about safe bedsharing are described as having the potential to reduce infant deaths.

### Design, recruitment and baseline characteristics of the LENS trial [^116t9Vxt]. Diabetic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison of LENS trial participants with all potentially eligible participants (based on recent retinal screening and eGFR ≥ 40 mL/min/1.73m²) in mainland Scotland shows that they are highly representative with respect to important risk factors for progressive DR. For example, over a quarter of participants have type 1 diabetes, in keeping with the high risk of incident and progressive DR in such individuals. However, 27% of LENS participants are women, compared with 39% of potentially eligible participants. There are two likely contributors. First, the LENS Participant Information Leaflet stressed the lack of safety information in pregnancy and breastfeeding, and explained that pre-menopausal women must use reliable contraception. This is likely to have dissuaded some women from joining the trial. Second, information regarding other randomised trials conducted in cardio-metabolic disease shows that women appear less likely to volunteer. Trial participants are also modestly less socially deprived, based on SIMD score, a pattern observed in other trials. The substantial majority (98%) of LENS participants are white, similar to other large diabetes trials in the UK, and more than the estimated proportion (approximately 91% of potentially eligible individuals with race recorded) in Scotland.

Retinal screening programmes exist in various healthcare settings. These programmes serve to identify patients with sight-threatening disease so that they can receive specialist follow up and, if required, treatment. LENS suggests that this infrastructure also provides a useful setting to identify those at higher risk of progression at an earlier stage (if efficacious treatment options can be identified) and to conduct randomised trials. An additional advantage of conducting LENS in a country with a single provider of retinal screening is that it offers the opportunity for prolonged post-trial follow up, and trial participants provided consent for this. The design proved to be generally robust to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic – we were able to conduct follow up assessments by telephone and to send study treatment to participants by mail.

In summary, LENS will provide a robust evaluation of the efficacy of fenofibrate treatment in a representative population of people with non-referable DR. Results from the trial are expected in mid-2024.

### Tretinoin (tretinoin cream) [^112gunhk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species.

In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species).

With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of RETIN-A. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known.

Nonteratogenic Effects

Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area).

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when tretinoin is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of RETIN-A did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

### Tretinoin (Renova) [^1169Z23W]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (17 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species.

In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overtly teratogenic, in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (42 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species).

With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin (Retin-A®). Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association has been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known.

Non-teratogenic Effects

Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (42 times the maximum human systemic dose normalized for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death, in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (104 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area).

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% should not be used during pregnancy.

Nursing Mothers:

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, mitigation of fine facial wrinkles with RENOVA (tretinoin cream) 0.02% may be postponed in nursing mothers until after completion of the nursing period.

Pediatric Use:

Safety and effectiveness in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.

### Vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy for maternal and newborn outcomes [^114XZwYZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization recommends routine vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy or lactation in areas with endemic vitamin A deficiency (where night blindness occurs), based on the expectation that supplementation will improve maternal and newborn outcomes including mortality, morbidity and prevention of anaemia or infection.

Objectives

To review the effects of supplementation of vitamin A, or one of its derivatives, during pregnancy, alone or in combination with other vitamins and micronutrients, on maternal and newborn clinical outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials, including cluster-randomised trials, evaluating the effect of vitamin A supplementation in pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

We reviewed 106 reports of 35 trials, published between 1931 and 2015. We included 19 trials including over 310,000 women, excluded 15 trials and one is ongoing. Overall, seven trials were judged to be of low risk of bias, three were high risk of bias and for nine it was unclear. 1) Vitamin A alone versus placebo or no treatmentOverall, when trial results are pooled, vitamin A supplementation does not affect the risk of maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.20; four trials Ghana, Nepal, Bangladesh, UK, high quality evidence), perinatal mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; one study, high quality evidence), neonatal mortality, stillbirth, neonatal anaemia, preterm birth (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.01, five studies, high quality evidence), or the risk of having a low birthweight baby. Vitamin A supplementation reduces the risk of maternal night blindness (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98; two trials). There is evidence that vitamin A supplements may reduce maternal clinical infection (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.99, five trials; South Africa, Nepal, Indonesia, Tanzania, UK, low quality evidence) and maternal anaemia (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.94; three studies, moderate quality evidence). 2) Vitamin A alone versus micronutrient supplements without vitamin AVitamin A alone compared to micronutrient supplements without vitamin A does not decrease maternal clinical infection (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.18, two trials, 591 women). No other primary or secondary outcomes were reported 3) Vitamin A with other micronutrients versus micronutrient supplements without vitamin AVitamin A supplementation (with other micronutrients) does not decrease perinatal mortality (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.69; one study, low quality evidence), maternal anaemia (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; three studies, low quality evidence), maternal clinical infection (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13; I² = 45%, two studies, low quality evidence) or preterm birth (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.93; one study, low quality evidence). In HIV-positive women vitamin A supplementation given with other micronutrients was associated with fewer low birthweight babies (< 2.5 kg) in the supplemented group in one study (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96; one study, 594 women).

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled results of three large trials in Nepal, Ghana and Bangladesh (with over 153,500 women) do not currently suggest a role for antenatal vitamin A supplementation to reduce maternal or perinatal mortality. However, the populations studied were probably different with regard to baseline vitamin A status and there were problems with follow-up of women. There is good evidence that antenatal vitamin A supplementation reduces maternal night blindness, maternal anaemia for women who live in areas where vitamin A deficiency is common or who are HIV-positive. In addition the available evidence suggests a reduction in maternal infection, but these data are not of a high quality.

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^114P8QrT]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the 1990s, especially after the Women's Health initiative (WHI) was established in 1992, there has been increased emphasis on generation of evidence to guide clinical practice and develop therapeutics for conditions that predominantly affect women. Although this was ground-breaking, the WHI by design focussed on preventive strategies for chronic disorders like cancer, healthier ageing, and postmenopausal disorders, and thereby neglected to focus on the disposition and safety of drugs in Women of Child-Bearing Potential (WOCBP). Within the demographic of WOCBP, different categories of women exist; some who wish to conceive, and others who may be in different stages of pregnancy, postpartum and/or breastfeeding. It is estimated that more than half of all breastfeeding women worldwide require drug therapy. However, in most situations, clear evidence quantitatively describing drug transfer from mother to breastfed infants (through breastmilk) and informing the clinical risk-to-benefit ratio does not exist. This evidence gap may preclude prescribing such therapeutics in the real-world setting. This applies to both established and newly approved therapeutics. A 2016 review by the FDA scrutinising the eligibility criteria of trials of 38 drugs approved between 2014 and 2017 observed that lactation was among the most frequent exclusion criteria.

### Medication use during lactation: either a potential contributor to premature weaning or evidence-based support of the mother / child couplet [^116hGsdb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

It is well established that breastfeeding improves the health of women, children, and populations. According to the 2018 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Report Card, 83% of women initiated breastfeeding, but only 58% maintained breastfeeding at the 6-month mark, and 36% continued to 12 months. Reasons for cessation of breastfeeding are multifactorial and include issues surrounding safe use of medications while breastfeeding for acute or chronic conditions. There are a wide variety of resources that clinicians may consult to help decide if medications are compatible with breastfeeding. The resources have varying data and recommendations, which can make counseling challenging for the clinician. There are some resources that are updated regularly with the most current information about drug safety in lactation, as well as call centers that can answer questions from clinicians and patients. A case scenario is presented to help illustrate the many facets of how medication use can affect breastfeeding. Very few medications are absolutely contraindicated during lactation. Involving the woman and her family in a shared decision-making approach regarding medication use may help women feel more confident in the medication recommendations given and ultimately help women achieve their breastfeeding goals.

### Peer-to-peer human milk sharing: recipient mothers' motivations, stress, and postpartum mental health [^112dZw5b]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Some mothers who cannot breastfeed-partially or completely-choose to feed their infants human milk donated from a peer. Few studies have examined mothers' experiences with using donor milk; none has examined whether or not mothers' stress and mental health are associated with using donor milk from a peer.

Methods

Researchers conducted semistructured individual interviews with mothers from the United States and Canada (N = 20) to answer the following questions: (a) what are recipient mothers' motivations for participation in peer-to-peer breast milk sharing and (b) what is the relationship between receiving donated milk and mothers' stress and mental health postpartum? Transcripts were coded using an inductive approach and principles of grounded theory were used to analyze data.

Results

Data were organized under two themes: (a) motivations for using milk from a peer and (b) milk-sharing and stress-related experiences. Motivations included health benefits, medical need, and preference for human milk over formula. Factors inducing stress were as follows: logistical stressors of securing donor milk and fear of running out of milk. Factors reducing stress were as follows: donor milk provided relief and comfort and its use reduced mothers' self-reported symptoms of postpartum depression and anxiety.

Conclusions

Mothers participated in peer-to-peer breast milk sharing primarily because of health benefits for children. However, participation also had important psychological benefits for some mothers. Additional research and open discourse are needed to support mothers who choose to use milk from a peer and to promote safety of this practice.

### Tretinoin (Retin-A) [^115riUu7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

There are other reports in New Zealand White rabbits administered doses of greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (3.3 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area) of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species.

In contrast, several well-controlled animals studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin may be fetotoxic, but not overly teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses of 1.0 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area in both species).

With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone. Thirty human cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of RETIN-A. Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, five of the reports describe the rare birth defect category holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain). The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known.

Nonteratogenic Effects

Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0.5 mg/kg/day (8 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area). Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2.5 mg/kg/day (20 times the maximum human systemic dose adjusted for total body surface area).

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Tretinoin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when RETIN-A is administered to a nursing woman.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in a geriatric population have not been established. Clinical studies of RETIN-A did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) Clinical Protocol #15 — opioid use and brief procedures: The most concerning class of medications used for anesthesia and analgesia in breastfeeding mothers is opioids, as these medications transfer into breast milk and may cause infant sedation or apnea, though judicious use of opioids for short periods is likely to be safe for most breastfeeding mothers and infants (IV). For brief procedures such as dental extractions or other short procedures requiring single doses for sedation and analgesia, mothers can breastfeed as soon as they are awake and stable.

### Tretinoin (retin – A MICRO) [^113yutJi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of tretinoin or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. It is not known whether topical administration of tretinoin could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk (see Clinical Considerations).

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for RETIN-A MICRO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the RETIN-A MICRO or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

To minimize potential exposure to the infant via human milk, during breastfeeding, use RETIN-A MICRO on the smallest area of skin with acne and for the shortest duration possible. Advise breastfeeding women not to apply RETIN-A MICRO directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of RETIN-A MICRO for topical application for the treatment of acne vulgaris have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The safety and effectiveness of RETIN-A MICRO have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical trials of RETIN-A MICRO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger adult subjects. Acne vulgaris is largely a disease of pediatric and young adult patients. Clinical studies of RETIN-A MICRO did not include patients 65 years of age and older.

### Vitamin A supplements for reducing mother-to-child HIV transmission [^111TjRWa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Primary outcome

HIV infection status of the child

The risk ratio for the effect of vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy on mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV was 0.85 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.09; 650 women, 2 trials) and for vitamin A supplementation immediately after delivery was 1.11 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; 2248 women, 1 trial). In the two trials that provided vitamin A supplementation to women during pregnancy and immediately after delivery, the RR was 1.17 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.59; 1530 women, 2 trials).

Overall, the trials show that vitamin A supplementation of HIV‐positive women during pregnancy or the immediate postpartum period, or both, probably has little or no effect on the risk of mother‐to‐child transmission of HIV (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.26; 4428 women, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence). There were no substantial differences in effects across the three subgroups (heterogeneity P = 0.15, I² statistic = 48.1%; Analysis 1.1).

The effects were similar between studies that provided supplements containing only retinol (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.22; 2898 women, 3 trials) and those that provided both retinol and beta‐carotene (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.59; 1530 women, 2 trials).

### Safe use of human milk for preterms in the context of maternal polypharmacy: a framework to improve practices [^114ka1kU]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Maternal pharmacotherapy during lactation is an ongoing research field, which relies on scientific evidence, pharmacological reasoning and extrapolation to support risk-to-benefit assessment. Typically, drugs are studied individually for potential effects on a nursing infant, with limited information on the preterm infant. Polypharmacy during lactation is still poorly studied, leaving healthcare professionals without any scientific guidance when consulting on human milk safety in this scenario. When focusing on a dyad of a postpartum mother on polypharmacy and a preterm infant, the benefits of mother's own milk (MOM) should be weighed against the unknown potential risks of polypharmacy during lactation. Within this setting of limited evidence, a framework to improve clinical and research practices is provided. Possible measures to minimize the risk of maternal (poly)pharmacy to the newborn include: multi-disciplinary prenatal counseling; preferring medications with low passage rate into human milk; relative rating of medications according to safety profile; and 'mixed feeding' (alternating between MOM and other types of feed, preferably donor human milk). These measures can be used to support shared informed decisions on the risk-to-benefit assessment. As the topic of polypharmacy during lactation is still poorly explored, a research agenda is suggested. IMPACT: Polypharmacy during lactation is poorly studied, and practical, evidence-based guidelines for healthcare professionals are lacking. Various methods can be employed to reduce exposure to medications through human milk, even more so when applied concomitantly: preference of medications with low passage into human milk, relative rating of medications according to known safety profile, or 'mixed feeding' where mother's own milk is alternated with other types of feed, preferably donor human milk. A framework to improve clinical and research practices on provision of human milk in the setting of maternal polypharmacy and prematurity as an added challenge is provided.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tretinoin TOP (also known as Retin-A, Retin – A Micro, Altreno, Renova):
- **Photosensitivity of skin**: use caution in patients with excessive sunlight exposure. Advise minimizing exposure to sunlight and wearing sunscreen and protective clothing over treated areas when exposure is unavoidable. Avoid using in patients with sunburn.
- **Skin erythema, skin scaling**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as topical tretinoin can cause severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application.
- **Skin irritation**: use caution in patients with eczema.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of reproductive health in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^1171DzZr]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Medication use during breastfeeding: The benefits of breastfeeding are numerous; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding until 1 year. Because women with RMD may experience disease flare post partum and require treatment, it is important to balance benefits of disease control with risk of infant exposure through breast milk, and infant serum levels of drugs ingested by the mother depend on drug concentration in breast milk, quantity of breast milk ingested, and drug absorption through the infant's gastrointestinal tract.

### Tretinoin (retin – A MICRO) [^111cm7qP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Advise the patient that concomitant use of topical OTC acne products containing benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with RETIN-A MICRO may increase the risk of local skin irritation. Advise the patient to withhold the use of topical OTC acne products if signs of skin irritation develop. Advise the patient to allow the skin irritation effects of the topical OTC acne products to subside before initiation of RETIN-A MICRO [see Warning and Precautions (5.1)].

Photosensitivity

Advise the patient to avoid or minimize unnecessary exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, including sunlight and sunlamps, while using RETIN-A MICRO.

Advise the patient to not use RETIN-A MICRO on sunburn skin.

Advise the patient to use sun protection in the form of sunscreen (SPF ≥ 15) and sun-protective clothing if UV exposure cannot be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Lactation

Advise the female patient to use RETIN-A MICRO on the smallest area of skin with acne vulgaris and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding. To avoid direct infant exposure, instruct the patient who is breastfeeding not to apply RETIN-A MICRO directly to the nipple and areola [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

### Breastfeeding, retinoids, and postpartum depression: a new theory [^113G4jVF]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Postpartum depression (PPD) is an international public health problem affecting at least 1 in 8 mothers. Known risk factors include: giving birth to a preterm or low birth weight infant, babies with greater symptoms of illness at age 4–6 weeks, formula feeding, younger maternal age, smoking, and fatigue. Prolonged breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of PPD but the mechanisms are not well understood. Interventions for PPD focusing on psychosocial risk factors have been largely unsuccessful, suggesting that the condition has a mainly biological basis. The hypothesis proposed for consideration is that breastfeeding protects against PPD by maintaining endogenous retinoids (vitamin A-related compounds) below a threshold concentration. In fact, breast milk is rich in retinoids; pregnant women accumulate retinoids in liver and breast in preparation for lactation; there is increasing evidence that retinoids in higher concentration are associated with cognitive disturbances and mood disorders, including depression and suicide; and prolonged lactation reduces maternal stores of retinoids. Consistent with this hypothesis, it is estimated that an amount of vitamin A is transferred from mother to infant during the first six months of exclusive breastfeeding equivalent to 76% of a dose known to cause acute vitamin A poisoning in an adult. Breastfeeding may thus have evolutionary-adaptive functions for both mother and infant, transferring vital nutrients to an infant unable to feed itself, yet at the same time providing a natural means of reducing potentially toxic concentrations of retinoids in the mother.

### Tretinoin (Retin-A) [^114LoAJW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Possible problems. The skin of certain sensitive individuals may become excessively red, swollen, blistered or crusted. If you are experiencing severe or persistent irritation, discontinue the use of RETIN-A and consult your physician.

There have been reports that, in some patients, areas treated with RETIN-A developed a temporary increase or decrease in the amount of skin pigment (color) present. The pigment in these areas returned to normal either when the skin was allowed to adjust to RETIN-A or therapy was discontinued.

Use other medications only on your physician's advice. Only your physician knows which other medications may be helpful during treatment and will recommend them to you if necessary. Follow the physician's instructions carefully. In addition, you should avoid preparations that may dry or irritate your skin. These preparations may include certain astringents, toiletries containing alcohol, spices or lime, or certain medicated soaps, shampoos and hair permanent solutions. Do not allow anyone else to use this medication.

Do not use other medications with RETIN-A which are not recommended by your doctor. The medications you have used in the past might cause unnecessary redness or peeling.

If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant or are nursing an infant: No studies have been conducted in humans to establish the safety of RETIN-A in pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you are pregnant, or are nursing a baby, consult your physician before using this medication.

### Vitamin A supplements for preventing mortality, illness, and blindness in children aged under 5: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1121Hx85]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin A refers to a subclass of retinoic acidslong understood to help regulate immune function and to reduce morbidity of infectious diseases. Vitamin A is required for normal functioning of the visual system, maintenance of cell function for growth, epithelial integrity, production of red blood cells, immunity, and reproduction. Different forms of vitamin A include β carotene, which is found in plants, and preformed vitamin A, which is found in animal sources. Vitamin A is an essential nutrient that cannot be synthesised so it must be obtained through diet.

Vitamin A deficiency increases vulnerability to a range of illnesses including diarrhoea, measles, and respiratory infections. These are leading causes of mortality among children in low and middle income countries, where risk of infection and risk of mortality can be compounded by coexisting undernutrition. The bioavailability of provitamin A carotenoids in fruit and vegetables is lower than once believed, and it is difficult for children to fulfil their daily requirements through plant foods alone. Consequently, vitamin A deficiency is common among children whose families cannot afford eggs and dairy products.

Preformed vitamin A (retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and retinyl esters) is the most active in humans; it is usually used in supplements in the form of retinyl esters. High intake of synthetic vitamin A over a prolonged period can lead to toxicity, but toxicity from food sources is rare. Periodic supplementation should not cause serious adverse effects.

Previous meta-analyses suggested that vitamin A supplementation for children in developing countries is associated with up to 30% reductions in mortality, especially deaths from diarrhoea and measles. The World Health Organization has long recommended vitamin A supplementation for children aged under 5 and for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. The Countdown to 2015 identified 68 "priority countries" in which over 90% of the world's maternal and childhood deaths occur; the programme aims to hold governments accountable for their commitments to Millennium Development Goals. Vitamin A is now being provided in many low and middle income countries with coverage rates of 86%. Nonetheless, some critics have questioned the value and effectiveness of vitamin A supplementation programmes, and several studies have been conducted since initial recommendations were made.

### Tretinoin [^112tqVVH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of tretinoin PO (also known as Retin-A, Retin – A Micro, Altreno, Renova):
- **Increased WBC count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tretinoin has been associated with an increased risk of rapidly evolving lekocytosis, especially in patients presenting with high WBC count at diagnosis. Consider initiating full-dose chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated) on day 1 or 2 in patients presenting with a WBC count of > 5×10⁹/L, or immediately, in patients presenting with a WBC count of < 5×10⁹/L, if the WBC count reaches ≥ 6×10⁹/L by day 5, or ≥ 10×10⁹/L by day 10, or ≥ 15×10⁹/L by day 28.
- **Retinoic acid syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tretinoin can cause retinoic acid syndrome, characterized by fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusion, edema, and hepatic, renal, and multiorgan failure, occasional impaired myocardial contractility, and episodic hypotension, generally occurring during the first month of treatment. Administer high-dose cortcosteroids immediately after the first signs of the syndrome are observed, regardless of WBC count. Consider temporarily interrupting tretinoin in cases of moderate and severe retinoic acid syndrome.
- **Severe adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia are at high risk in general and can have severe adverse reactions to oral tretinoin. Administer oral tretinoin under the strict supervision of a physician experienced in the management of acute leukemia and in a facility with laboratory and supportive services sufficient to monitor drug tolerance and manage drug toxicity, including respiratory compromise.
- **Teratogenesis**: do not use in pregnant patients. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential 1 week before initiating treatment. Advise using two reliable forms of contraception during treatment and for 1 month after the last dose.

### Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections in pregnancy and breastfeeding: a case series and systematic review of the literature [^1121NxWA]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Alternative treatments

CNV carries a risk of permanent severe loss of vision without treatment, and there are no current alternative treatments to anti-VEGF injections for this condition. However, there is no consensus regarding the treatment pathway for DMO in pregnancy, and mild to moderate cases of DMO can often be safely observed without treatment. Macular laser can be considered for off-centre DMO, particularly if exudates are tracking towards the centre of the macula. This was not applicable to the patients in our case series. Sometimes DMO improves significantly after pregnancy, without ophthalmic intervention, but for cases where it is severe and vision-threatening, and the risks of observation-only leading to loss of vision outweigh the risks of having ophthalmic treatment, it is worth considering intravitreal treatment options. Intravitreal steroids may be a viable first line therapy but the benefits of this form of treatment must be carefully balanced against the associated risks.

The NICE guidelines previously limited intravitreal dexamethasone implants (Ozurdex) for DMO to pseudophakic patients in the United Kingdom, which would have precluded the majority of women of childbearing age, and hence we were not able to offer Ozurdex to the diabetic patients in our case series. One patient received peri-ocular triamcinolone injection with partial response. With the change to the guidance in 2022, Ozurdex may become an appropriate first-line treatment for pregnant women with DMO – small case series suggest that intravitreal dexamethasone implants may be safe and effective for pregnant women with macular oedema secondary to diabetes or central retinal vein occlusion. However, women need to receive appropriate counselling regarding the risk of needing cataract surgery at a younger age than would typically be the case (up to 60% within 3 years), and the 30% risk of a steroid-induced rise in intraocular pressure, which may be harder to manage given that some intraocular pressure-lowering eyedrops may be relatively contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Not all cases of DMO require treatment with anti-VEGF, so there should be a higher threshold for choosing this form of treatment in pregnancy due to uncertainties about risks, and because other treatment options may be available, but a few women may benefit from anti-VEGF injections, and we provide further evidence to enable counselling of these patients.
