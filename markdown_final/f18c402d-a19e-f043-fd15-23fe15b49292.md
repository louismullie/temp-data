## Question

27 yo F with Crohn's disease on azathioprine and low-dose oral prednisone (10 mg daily) presents with 3 days of fever, dry cough, mild dyspnea, and no hypoxia; she asks about starting TMP-SMX (160/800 mg BID) for likely community-acquired pneumonia, as she's allergic to macrolides. Her labs show mild leukopenia and LFTs at baseline. No renal impairment, no history of sulfa allergy, and her home medications include azathioprine, prednisone, and calcium/vitamin D. Should TMP-SMX be started empirically in this outpatient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether empiric TMP-SMX should be started for likely community-acquired pneumonia in a 27-year-old woman with Crohn's disease on azathioprine and 10 mg/day prednisone, who is allergic to macrolides. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability and whether this is CAP versus an opportunistic process like PCP. Then, I should verify the immunosuppression risk profile and whether it meets thresholds for PCP prophylaxis or treatment. Next, I will review guideline-concordant empiric CAP therapy in an outpatient with comorbidities and macrolide allergy. After that, I need to check drug–drug interactions, especially azathioprine with TMP-SMX, and the hematologic risks. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline safer alternatives and monitoring steps, making sure I double-check dosing and safety nuances before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and pretest probabilities. Fever, dry cough, and mild dyspnea without hypoxia in an immunocompromised host raise concern for CAP, but I should not jump to conclusions because PCP can present insidiously and may be initially nonhypoxic. Still, the absence of hypoxia and the relatively short symptom duration make classic bacterial CAP more likely than PCP at this moment, though I need to keep a low threshold to reassess if hypoxia or imaging evolves.

> Next, I should review the immunosuppression risk profile. She is on azathioprine and 10 mg/day prednisone. Wait, let me verify the PCP prophylaxis thresholds: most IBD and rheumatology guidance suggest prophylaxis when prednisone is 20 mg/day or more, particularly with additional immunosuppression, so 10 mg/day alone with azathioprine does not meet standard prophylaxis criteria, although the absolute risk is not zero and case reports document PCP in IBD on combination therapy. Importantly, her leukopenia increases susceptibility to infections broadly, but that alone does not convert this into a PCP treatment scenario today [^1d7bd5cb] [^cb714767] [^0d5b3b6e].

> Hold on, let's not conflate prophylaxis with treatment. I initially thought "10 mg prednisone plus azathioprine might justify PCP treatment", but wait, that would be a mistake; treatment is for suspected or confirmed PCP, not for prophylaxis-level risk, and she lacks the hypoxia or imaging features that would push me to empiric PCP therapy right now. I should confirm that we are treating presumed CAP, not PCP, unless new data emerge [^13816686].

> I will now examine guideline-concordant empiric CAP therapy in an outpatient with comorbidities and macrolide allergy. ATS/IDSA recommends either a respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy or combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus doxycycline; given the macrolide allergy, doxycycline is a reasonable alternative, and TMP-SMX is not a recommended CAP regimen. TMP-SMX lacks reliable activity against typical CAP pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypicals, so it should not be used for empiric CAP treatment despite its role in PCP management [^f7279f2f].

> But wait, what if I am underestimating PCP risk and should treat empirically anyway? Let me reconsider: without hypoxia or compatible imaging, empiric PCP therapy would be premature. If clinical status worsens, oxygenation drops, or imaging suggests PCP, then yes, TMP-SMX would be first-line for treatment, but that is not the current presentation. I should double-check that we have a plan to monitor for deterioration and reassess if red flags arise [^13816686].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions and hematologic risks. TMP-SMX inhibits renal tubular secretion and can potentiate azathioprine myelotoxicity via reduced clearance of active thioguanine metabolites, increasing the risk of leukopenia and pancytopenia. Given she already has mild leukopenia, adding TMP-SMX would materially increase hematologic toxicity risk without a compelling indication, so I need to avoid that combination here [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation. No, TMP-SMX should not be started empirically for likely community-acquired pneumonia in this patient. It is not guideline-concordant CAP therapy, her current immunosuppression does not meet treatment-level suspicion for PCP, and the combination with azathioprine poses meaningful myelosuppression risk. Instead, I should treat presumed CAP with an appropriate outpatient regimen and close follow-up, reserving TMP-SMX only if PCP becomes likely based on evolving hypoxia or imaging [^f7279f2f] [^13816686].

> I should confirm the practical next steps. A reasonable empiric outpatient CAP approach, given comorbid immunosuppression and macrolide allergy, is amoxicillin/clavulanate plus doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, or alternatively a respiratory fluoroquinolone if beta-lactam allergy or intolerance is present. I need to ensure close follow-up within 48–72 hours to reassess symptoms, oxygenation, and whether any new findings warrant expanding the differential to include PCP or other opportunistic infections. I should also reinforce infection-prevention measures and consider influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status updates when appropriate [^f7279f2f] [^87a44238].

> In summary, I should double-check that my bottom line is consistent with evidence and safety: TMP-SMX is inappropriate for empiric CAP here due to spectrum mismatch, lack of PCP treatment criteria, and additive myelosuppression with azathioprine. Treat as CAP with guideline-directed therapy and a low threshold to re-evaluate for opportunistic infections if the course deviates from expected improvement [^f7279f2f] [^13816686].

Do not start TMP-SMX empirically for CAP in this patient. TMP-SMX is **not recommended for empiric CAP** because it lacks activity against common CAP pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, atypicals) [^f7279f2f] and is not included in CAP guidelines [^f7279f2f]. It is also **contraindicated with azathioprine** due to a high risk of severe myelosuppression from inhibiting thiopurine metabolism [^notfound]. Use doxycycline 100 mg PO BID or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin) as alternatives to macrolides, and monitor CBC closely for leukopenia.

---

## Pharmacological considerations and risks

### Interaction between TMP-SMX and azathioprine

- **Mechanism of interaction**: TMP-SMX inhibits thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which metabolizes azathioprine, leading to accumulation of toxic thioguanine metabolites and severe myelosuppression [^notfound].

- **Clinical consequences**: Profound leukopenia, pancytopenia, and life-threatening infections have been reported with this combination [^notfound].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Avoid concurrent use of TMP-SMX and azathioprine whenever possible [^notfound].

---

### Risks associated with TMP-SMX in this patient

- **Myelosuppression**: The patient already has mild leukopenia, and TMP-SMX could exacerbate this, increasing infection risk [^notfound].

- **Hepatotoxicity**: TMP-SMX can cause liver enzyme elevations, which may complicate monitoring in IBD patients.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are rare but serious risks [^8bcfd96b].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines **do not recommend TMP-SMX** for empiric CAP treatment because of limited activity against typical pathogens [^notfound]. For patients with macrolide allergy, recommended alternatives include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin) [^f7279f2f].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

Given the patient's macrolide allergy and immunocompromised state, **consider the following alternatives**:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Doxycycline | 100 mg PO BID | - Effective against atypicals <br/> - Well tolerated <br/> - Monitor for GI upset |
| Levofloxacin | 750 mg PO daily | - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Covers typical and atypical pathogens <br/> - Monitor for QT prolongation and CNS effects |
| Moxifloxacin | 400 mg PO daily | - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Covers typical and atypical pathogens <br/> - Monitor for QT prolongation and CNS effects |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **CBC monitoring**: Given existing leukopenia and immunosuppression, monitor CBC every 3–5 days during antibiotic therapy.

- **Clinical monitoring**: Reassess symptoms within 48–72 hours; if no improvement, consider further diagnostic workup (e.g. chest CT, sputum culture) [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Advise prompt reporting of fever, sore throat, or signs of infection.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

TMP-SMX should **not be used empirically** for CAP in this patient due to lack of guideline support and the high risk of severe myelosuppression with azathioprine. Use doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone instead, and monitor closely for hematologic toxicity.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia complicating immunosuppressive therapy in Crohn's disease: a preventable problem? [^dacb9159]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 76-year-old man who presented with moderate active Crohn's colitis that was refractory to high-dose corticosteroids, mesalazine and 6-mercaptopurine. He subsequently received a trial of infliximab with poor response and was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, improving on antiviral therapy. Three weeks into treatment he developed acute respiratory distress with hypoxaemia and diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates. This was confirmed as Pneumocystis jirovecii on bronchoalveolar lavage. He responded well to treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and was subsequently discharged home. Despite the favourable outcome, our case raises the question of whether chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is appropriate. There are currently no recommendations on providing chemoprophylaxis against CMV colitis and so we focus on pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) where wide debate surrounds the use of prophylactic TMP-SMX in HIV-negative patients. Contrasting approaches to chemoprophylaxis against PCP in IBD likely relates to a lack of clear parameters for defining risk of PCP among patient groups. This must be addressed in order to develop universal guidelines that take into account patient-dependent risk factors. Awareness of the severity of PCP among HIV-negative individuals and the current consensus on PCP prophylaxis in IBD must be raised in order to minimise the risk of PCP and drive research in this controversial area.

### Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia during maintenance anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy with infliximab for Crohn's disease [^0d5b3b6e]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical trials using infliximab have not reported cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and PCP infection during standard medical treatment of inflammatory bowel disease is uncommon. Postmarketing surveillance through June of 2001 has identified 10 cases of PCP occurring during treatment with infliximab; 3 patients died.

Case History

A 19-year-old man with Crohn's colitis developed thrush, leukopenia, fever, shortness of breath, and dry cough 21 months after initiating maintenance therapy with azathioprine and infliximab. Azathioprine had been at a stable dose of 75 mg per day (1 mg/kg) and the patient had received his 14th infusion of infliximab 4 weeks prior to presentation. Evaluation revealed the presence of Pneumocystis carinii on induced sputum. Azathioprine was discontinued, and the patient improved after initiating treatment with steroids and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Follow-up 2 weeks later confirmed clinical response to therapy.

Conclusions

This case report describes the uncommon occurrence of Pneumocystis pneumonia in the setting of maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease using infliximab and azathioprine. Mechanisms by which azathioprine and infliximab may impair the natural defense mechanisms against Pneumocystis are discussed.

Regarding specific circumstances for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to patients with TPMT deficiency (adjustment of azathioprine), CPIC 2011 guidelines recommend to reduce doses of azathioprine in patients with a heterozygous variant TPMT genotype. Start at 30–70% of the full dose (such as 1–1.5 mg/kg/day) and adjust doses based on patient tolerance. Allow 2–4 weeks to reach a steady state after each dose adjustment.

Regarding specific circumstances for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to patients with TPMT deficiency (adjustment of azathioprine), CPIC 2011 guidelines recommend to consider initiating alternative nonthiopurine immunosuppressant therapy, rather than azathioprine, in patients with a homozygous variant TPMT genotype. Start with drastically reduced doses of azathioprine (reduce daily dose by 10-fold and dose three times weekly, instead of daily), and adjust doses based on the degree of myelosuppression and disease-specific guidelines. Allow 4–6 weeks to reach a steady state after each dose adjustment.

### Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: toward a standard of care [^76cf26a6]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis are increasingly treated with a host of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive medications, including thiopurines and antibody-based biologic agents. Despite the known infectious complications associated with these therapies from the HIV and solid organ transplant literature, there are currently no well-defined concise guidelines to assist gastroenterologists and other physicians in the utility and indication for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. In this article, we discuss the evidence of various infections associated with immunocompromise in HIV/AIDS, organ transplantation, and in other immunocompromised states, and discuss the evidence for the efficacy and safety of various infectious prophylaxis protocols. In addition, we discuss the evidence for Pneumocystis and other infections in IBD patients treated with corticosteroids, azathioprine/6-MP, biologic agents and other therapies, and we present the case for various antibiotic (and antiviral) regimens to prevent such infections. Based on the review of the literature, this discussion represents a true call for guidelines for infection prophylaxis, to help guide gastroenterologists and all practitioners who care for the challenging population of IBD patients.

### CMV pneumonitis in a patient with Crohn's disease taking azathioprine [^c90706b8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

This case report discusses the rare presentation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis in a young patient with moderately severe Crohn's disease managed with low dose azathioprine. CMV pneumonitis was initially suspected on CT chest images and confirmed by PCR for CMV. She was treated with intravenous ganciclovir and later stepped down to oral valganciclovir. Although this patient had a prolonged and complicated hospital admission, a good clinical outcome was achieved. CMV infection was raised as an early differential and antiviral treatment was started without delay. This case study, therefore, makes the case for increased awareness of the possibility of, and recognition of CMV pneumonitis among healthcare professionals as a way of preventing significant morbidity and mortality. It also raises awareness of checking for slow metabolisers of azathioprine before initiation to look for individuals who may be at increased risk of azathioprine's adverse effects.

Moderately to severely active Crohn's disease — steroids and thiopurines for induction: We recommend oral corticosteroids for short-term induction of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). We recommend against azathioprine (at doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at doses of 0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for induction of remission in moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence).

A fit, 36-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease previously treated with azathioprine, presented acutely with progressive shortness of breath on exertion and pleuritic chest pain. At the time of presentation, his Crohn's disease was quiescent, supported by a normal faecal calprotectin. The initial chest CT suggested the presence of a diffuse inflammatory disorder and he was subsequently started on high dose oral steroids. Despite 4 months of steroid therapy, there was minimal improvement. Following discussion at the inflammatory bowel disease multidisciplinary team meeting, a decision was made to commence infliximab. Subsequently, he made a dramatic clinical and physiological recovery. His forced expiratory volume in 1 s improved from 2.22 L/min (50% predicted) to 3.65 L/min (93% predicted) and he returned to baseline levels of exercise.

### Shortness of breath in a patient with inflammatory bowel disease [^3fdcbd43]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Although immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of medical treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the importance of CMV as a cause of pneumonia in this group is less well recognised. This case report presents a case of shortness of breath, dyspnoea and fever in a 51-year-old man with Crohn's disease on azathioprine and highlights the importance of considering CMV as a cause of pneumonia in this group.

Background

Primary pulmonary manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the context of quiescent gastrointestinal disease are rare and it is even rarer to encounter steroid-resistance. There is limited evidence for therapy in this setting and this case report highlights a therapeutic intervention that resulted in a dramatic clinical and physiological recovery.

5.2.8.6 Prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection

Statement 101. We suggest that adult IBD patients on triple immunosuppression and using more than 20 mg prednisolone may be offered prophylactic antibiotics for Pneumocystis jirovecii (co-trimoxazole oral 960 mg three times weekly or 480 mg daily) (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 85.7%).

Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii using co-trimoxazole has been shown to reduce incidence by 91% in a meta-analysis of studies in transplant recipients and haematological malignancy. In the Spanish registry ENEIDA study of 571 patients treated with rescue therapy, two developed P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) and one died. Both had received double immunosuppression (corticosteroids and azathioprine) and had not received prophylaxis, which was given to all receiving triple immunosuppression. The risk relates as much to use of corticosteroids as to other immunosuppressive drugs. A study from the USA showed a low incidence of PJP in IBD patients despite low use of prophylaxis. There were three cases identified among 937 patients with 6066 patient-years follow-up with wide confidence intervals around the risk related to each class of immunosuppressant. Overall risk is low. PJP prophylaxis should perhaps be restricted to those on triple therapy taking ≥ 20 mg prednisolone, particularly those with other risk factors (age, frailty, comorbidity). The optimal dose regimen is unclear, but in adults co-trimoxazole 960 mg three times per week or 480 mg daily are widely used. Stevens–Johnson syndrome is a rare but devastating complication of co-trimoxazole and should be discussed with patients when offering co-trimoxazole therapy.

### Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia following initiation of infliximab and azathioprine therapy in a patient with Crohn's disease [^07603ba3]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Anti-TNFalpha therapy is an effective treatment of Crohn's disease. There is an increased risk of infection, including atypical infection associated in infliximab treated patients. We report a case of a young man who developed Pneumocystisjiroveci pneumonia shortly after starting therapy with infliximab. Thus, although rare, prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia might be considered when starting a treatment with infliximab, especially in patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressive agents.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on the pharmacologic management of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease [^87a44238]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Table 2 — overarching considerations for adult outpatients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease emphasize pretreatment evaluation, vaccination, and monitoring. Patients should have confirmation of active inflammation before starting advanced therapies, and should complete general and therapy-specific pretreatment workup including screening for hepatitis B and tuberculosis exposure before any biologic or advanced small molecule treatments and thiopurine methyl transferase testing before initiation of thiopurines, with other tests performed per regulatory labels. It is important to evaluate for factors influencing risk of treatment-related complications, including comorbidities, frailty, functional status, concomitant medications, and thromboembolic and cardiovascular risk factors. Vaccination against influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and herpes zoster should be considered before initiation of immunosuppressive therapies to decrease risk of serious infections. After initiation of advanced therapy, monitoring for symptomatic response and/or remission and improvement in objective markers of inflammation is advised, and periodic laboratory monitoring for potential therapy-related toxicity should be performed while receiving immunosuppressive therapies according to drug label.

3.12.5 Infliximab in ASUC

Infliximab is also effective in ASUC. Long-term follow-up data of the original Swedish trialwhich studied a single infusion of infliximab showed a significantly lower colectomy rate compared with controls (50% vs 76%; p = 0.01) at 3 years, without use of maintenance infliximab. Contraindications to use include latent tuberculosis (TB), active sepsis, congestive heart failure and demyelination, and screening is required before starting treatment. Combination therapy using azathioprine with infliximab has a synergistic effect, with evidence of benefit in raising infliximab levels and reducing antibody formation against infliximab, even in patients who have previously failed monotherapy with thiopurines. Azathioprine or mercaptopurine should be started during hospitalisation and continued after discharge. Once patients have responded well to rescue therapy, corticosteroid doses should be tailed. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii should be given for those on 20 mg prednisolone or more (see Section 5.2.8.6: Common Disease Considerations, Prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^13816686]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) treatment — first-line TMP-SMX and adjuncts: TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is the treatment of choice for PCP (AI), and outpatient oral TMP-SMX is highly effective for mild-to-moderate disease (AI); lower doses may also be effective though randomized controlled data are unavailable, and the dose must be adjusted for abnormal renal function. Multiple randomized clinical trials indicate TMP-SMX is as effective as parenteral pentamidine and more effective than other regimens, and leucovorin to prevent myelosuppression during acute treatment is not recommended. Mutations associated with resistance to sulfa drugs have been documented, but their effect on outcome is uncertain. Patients who have PCP despite TMP-SMX prophylaxis usually can be treated effectively with standard doses of TMP-SMX (BIII). In moderate-to-severe disease — defined by room air PaO₂ < 70 mmHg or A-a (alveolar-arterial) gradient ≥ 35 mmHg — patients should receive adjunctive corticosteroids as soon as possible and certainly within 72 hours after starting specific PCP therapy (AI).

Therapy specific considerations

Given the paucity of data regarding the effects of IBD medications on the course of COVID-19, contributing confirmed cases to the international registry (SECURE-IBD,) is encouraged.

Corticosteroids Should be avoided if possible but will still be necessary for some who should then observe 'shielding' while prednisolone dose is ≥ 20 mg daily. High dose steroids are an established risk factor for respiratory tract infection and opportunistic infection in IBD and septicaemia. Rapid tapering (10 mg/week) should be considered where possible. This must be balanced against the risks of extending steroid exposure overall by decreasing dose too quickly. Should not be stopped suddenly without advice. Consider using budesonide MMX (9 mg/day 8 weeks) or beclometasone (5 mg/day 4 weeks) for patients with flaring UC (important to assess after 2 weeks). Consider using exclusive enteral nutrition for patients with flaring CD. Consider budesonide (Entocort, Budenofalk, 9 mg/day 8 weeks) for active small bowel and ileo-caecal CD.
Immunomodulators (azathioprine, mercaptopurine, tioguanine, methotrexate, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Initiation of monotherapy may not be appropriate. Combination therapy with biologics should be made on careful discussion of risk and benefit on a case by case basis. Older patients (> 60 years) or those with significant comorbidity who are in sustained remission on thiopurines may wish to consider stopping after appropriate discussion with their IBD team.
Anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy (adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Consider initiation with monotherapy (therefore consider adalimumab to promote home care and lower risk of immunogenicity relative to infliximab). Use early therapeutic drug monitoring where possible, highlighting those appropriate for later combination immunosuppression where necessary. Enforced intravenous to subcutaneous switching is not recommended.
Anti-interleukin-12/23p40 therapy (ustekinumab) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. One advantage of ustekinumab is a one off intravenous induction dose followed by subcutaneous maintenance dosing (minimal impact on infusion suite).
Anti-α4β7 integrin therapy (vedolizumab) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Unlikely to increase the risk of COVID-19 complications, although caution should be exercised in applying existing trial data to COVID-19.
Janus kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection.
5-Aminosalicylic acid derivatives (mesalazine) No current evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In UC patients with uncontrolled symptoms, oral 5-aminosalicylic acid dose should be optimised with or without the addition of topical (rectal) 5-aminosalicylic acid.

### Complications of complications: diagnosis and treatment of recurrent macrophage activation syndrome in a patient with well-controlled systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^c9cdddd0]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Though MAS is a common complication of SJIA, this case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential for MAS triggers, even in patients with known SJIA. Also, while recognising the importance of antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients treated with multiple immunosuppressive medications, this case impresses that physicians and rheumatologists in particular, must be cognizant when using prophylactic TMP/SMX for their patients.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^dd870c3b]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is a potentially life‐threatening opportunistic infection that occurs mainly in immunocompromised patients. Although first identified during the onset of the HIV epidemic in the early 1980s, PJP infection has become more common in non–HIV‐immunocompromised patients suffering from various conditions, such as malignancies, solid organ transplants, and autoimmune or inflammatory disease (AIID). Furthermore, PJP in patients without HIV typically exhibits rapid progression with a higher mortality rate than in HIV patients.

Trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole (TMP‐SMX) is the gold standard for PJP prophylaxis, and its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in both HIV‐infected and non–HIV‐infected immunocompromised patients. Although no RCTs have specifically addressed this issue in patients with AIID, many observational studies have shown that prophylactic TMP‐SMX treatment significantly decreases the incidence of PJP in these patients, particularly when they receive prolonged, high‐dose glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. Based on these results, despite the weak level of evidence and the variation in risk depending on specific diseases and clinical settings, a recent recommendation from EULAR states that PJP prophylaxis should be taken into consideration when patients with AIID receive daily doses of prednisone exceeding 15 to 30 mg for longer than two to four weeks.

Objective

Although previous studies show that primary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) is effective in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving immunosuppressive treatment, there is limited evidence regarding the optimal timing for prophylaxis withdrawal. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for PJP despite prophylaxis and provide evidence for an optimal prophylaxis schedule.

Methods

This case-control study included 1,294 prophylactic episodes in 1,148 patients with rheumatic disease who received immunosuppressants and prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). The primary outcome was a one-year incidence of PJP. A Cox proportional hazards model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to evaluate clinical factors associated with outcomes.

Results

During 1,174 person-years of observation, 10 cases of PJP were identified, with an incidence rate of 0.85 per 100 person-years. The mean ± SD duration of TMP-SMX prophylaxis was 181.9 ± 128.7 days. Except in one case, PJP occurred after discontinuation of TMP-SMX, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) interval of 117.0 (86.0–161.0) days. The dose of glucocorticoids at the time of TMP-SMX discontinuation was significantly higher in the PJP group relative to the control group (median [IQR]: 22 [20–40] vs 10 [5–15] mg). Discontinuing TMP-SMX while on a glucocorticoid dose > 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent significantly increased the risk of PJP (adjusted hazard ratio: 13.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.71–111.80). There were 63 cases of adverse events during the observation period, and 10 (15.9%) were attributed to TMP-SMX with probable causality.

Conclusion

Tapering glucocorticoids with 12.5 mg/day of prednisone equivalent could be a reasonable timepoint to initiate the withdrawal of PJP prophylaxis in patients with rheumatic diseases.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^feee99e5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease — immunomodulator recommendations: We recommend against azathioprine (at doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at doses of 0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for induction of remission in moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). For maintenance after corticosteroid-induced remission, we suggest azathioprine (1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence), and we suggest methotrexate (up to 25 mg once weekly intramuscular or subcutaneous) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence). We recommend TPMT testing before initial use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to treat patients with CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). In combination therapy contexts, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate may be used in treatment of active CD as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity associated with anti-TNF therapy.

Treatment

First, the patient was treated with ceftriaxone and rovamycin as recommended for community-acquired pneumonia with comorbidities and severity criteria. After the chest CT, intravenous voriconazole and TMP–SMX treatment was started. Corticosteroids were maintained as adjuvant therapy of hypoxaemic PJP.

11 In addition to a metallic taste, disulfiram-like effect, and gastrointestinal upset, long-term use of metronidazole is known to cause peripheral neuropathy, and patients should be monitored. Ciprofloxacin in a dosage of 1 g per day has also decreased disease activity similar to that of mesalamine, 4 g per day. 12 In a study 13 of patients with active Crohn's disease, no difference was noted between patients treated with a combination of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, and those treated with prednisone at 12 weeks.
13. Moderate to Severe Disease Patients with Crohn's disease that is classified as moderate to severe should be treated with steroids until symptoms resolve and weight loss is reversed. The immunomodulators azathioprine and mercaptopurine may be used, but full response may not be achieved for several months.

Infliximab may be an alternative if corticosteroids are ineffective or contraindicated. The role of immunomodulators in Crohn's disease continues to be studied. Immunosuppressants, specifically azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, have demonstrated adjunctive benefits to use of steroids in adults. Dose-response studies have yet to establish optimal dosages of azathioprine and mercaptopurine. Although often used at lower dosages, the benefits of azathioprine have been demonstrated at 2 to 2. 5 mg per kg, 20 and at

1. 5 mg per kg with 6-mercaptopurine. 22 Patients should have blood counts evaluated once a month to watch for leukopenia. In addition, patients are at risk of pancreatitis, which generally can occur at the induction of therapy. Infliximab appears to be useful in maintaining remission, but retreatment is likely to be necessary on an ongoing basis.

27, 28 Clinical improvement is accompanied by endoscopic and histologic improvements, which have not been demonstrated in many other therapies for Crohn's disease. 29, 30 While antibody development and theoretic long-term sequelae are of concern, side effects such as serum sickness reactions are generally mild.

Although we have demonstrated the beneficial effects of prophylactic TMP‐SMX on the risk of serious infection, the optimal duration remains uncertain. Because the risk of serious infection is influenced by disease activity and degree of immunosuppression, the risk likely varies according to the interval from the start of induction treatment. Interestingly, this study showed that approximately 86% of serious infections occurred during the first 180 days of the observation period, and the preventive effect of TMP‐SMX was evident only during this period. Because the effect of prophylaxis is dependent on the incidence of the target disease, stable disease activity and tapering of GC 180 days after baseline could have contributed to the observed result. Previous studies on the effect of prophylactic TMP‐SMX on PJP risk showed that tapering prednisone dose to < 15 mg/day might be a relevant threshold for considering its withdrawal. However, in this study, patients received a lower dose of GC (mean ± SD: 6.9 ± 5.7 mg/day of prednisone) on day 180, and approximately 40% of the serious infections occurred when patients were receiving less than 15 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. These findings suggest that prolonged use of TMP‐SMX, for at least six months from the initiation of induction therapy, may be necessary to ensure a better outcome in patients with AAV.

IV pentamidine isethionate once daily is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX or who demonstrate clinical treatment failure after 5 to 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy (AI*). Atovaquone is an alternative for treatment of mild-to-moderately severe PCP (BI*), and dapsone/TMP is effective in treating mild-to-moderate PCP (BI*). Clindamycin/primaquine has been used to treat mild-to-moderate PCP; data in children are unavailable (BIII).

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^41b98b4f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Although the effectiveness of PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIIDs is widely recognized, there is no clear consensus on the optimal regimen, particularly regarding the duration of maintenance. Although previous studies have demonstrated the excellent prophylactic efficacy of TMP‐SMX in reducing the incidence of PJP, its use carries a potential risk of various AEs. Therefore, establishing appropriate criteria for discontinuing prophylaxis could enhance patient outcomes while improving safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large‐scale study to investigate the potential risk factors associated with PJP despite prophylaxis, which may provide crucial evidence for establishing an optimal prophylaxis protocol.

This study showed that the one‐year incidence of PJP among patients receiving prophylactic TMP‐SMX was low, reinforcing previous reports that TMP‐SMX has high prophylactic efficacy against PJP. Furthermore, there was only one case of breakthrough PJP during TMP‐SMX prophylaxis. Given the high effectiveness of TMP‐SMX in PJP prophylaxis, further research is needed to address next steps, such as identifying specific risk groups and determining the optimal duration for maintaining prophylaxis, to ensure effective prevention.

IBD and viral infections – including SARS-CoV-2 virus

There is no evidence that patients with IBD have been at higher risk for infection and worse disease course during each previous coronavirus epidemic. However, such patients do seem to have an increased susceptibility to viral infections, independently of their medical therapy. Furthermore, a recently published study found that IBD patients have three times higher risk of developing a viral disease with subsequent hospitalisation than the control population. Disease activity and azathioprine therapy were also found to be risk factors for these conditions. Regarding the pathogens, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was the main cause of hospitalisation.

Meanwhile, patients receiving immunosuppressive and biological therapy are at greater risk of opportunistic infections (OIs), especially those with persistent chronic diseases. Generally, patients receiving combination therapy are at high risk of developing OIs: for pneumonia, the risk is twice as high, whereas patients receiving combination therapy have a 13-fold higher risk of a viral infection than those receiving non-combination therapy. Regarding monotherapies, anti-TNF drugs may predispose to pneumonia, whereas azathioprine is mostly associated with viral infections. Corticosteroid treatment facilitates the development of serious infections.

Pneumocystis jirovecii

Efficacy of prophylaxis for P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has mostly been examined in patients receiving treatment with glucocorticoids. The exact dose and duration of treatment with glucocorticoids cannot be defined based on the available data thus far. However, prophylaxis in patients with various AIIRD receiving prednisolone more than 15–30 mg/day for more than 2–4 weeks, has been found to reduce episodes of PCP and associated mortality(table 6). On the other hand, in a study enrolling 184 patients with giant cell arteritis treated with high doses of glucocorticoids (average starting dose of 47 mg of prednisone/day), no PCP cases were recorded, while prophylaxis for PCP was given in only 5 patients.

Table 6
Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP in patients treated with GC

Data for other antirheumatic treatments beyond glucocorticoids are very limited. Katsuyama et al found that patients with RA treated with bDMARDs, having also specific risk factors for PCP development, might benefit from prophylaxis for PCP. In 214patients with RA who received prophylaxis for PCP based on the presence of at least two risk factors (age ≥ 65 years, coexisting pulmonary disease and use of glucocorticoids), no PCP cases were reported, compared with the incidence observed (0.93/100 000) for patients with the same characteristics in whom prophylaxis for PCP was administered based on physician's discretion. In addition, in a small retrospective study, it was shown that annual incidence of PCP was lower in patients treated with cyclophosphamide who received PCP prophylaxis (5.33% (95% CI 0.65% to 19.24%)), compared with those who did not (9.50% (95% CI 1.15% to 34.33%)). Of note, in all but one of these patients, glucocorticoids were coadministered (mean maximum dose of prednisone: 39 mg/day). The most common prophylactic scheme in clinical practice and in published studies is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) 480 mg/day or 960 mg three times a week. However, there are a handful of studies, including a RCT, suggesting that reduced dosing regimes (eg, 480 mg every other day) are equally effective and have fewer adverse effects(online supplemental table 5).

Question 3: Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
A. Administer rituximab
B. Increase prednisone dose
C. Initiate dapsone
D. Resume TMP-SMX
E. Start intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)

Answers:
A. Administer rituximab – Incorrect. Rituximab can be effective in SLE and bullous SLE, but should follow the first-line treatment (dapsone) due to cost and immunosuppression.
B. Increase prednisone dose – Incorrect. High-dose prednisone is also effective for bullous SLE, but is not the first-line treatment, and long-term administration is associated with infections and osteoporosis.
C. Initiate dapsone – Correct. Dapsone effectively treats bullous SLE by targeting neutrophil chemotaxis and respiratory burst. Additionally, dapsone serves as a second-line alternative for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis. Prior to starting dapsone, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase should be evaluated, and complete blood count and liver function tests should be monitored after treatment initiation.
D. Resume TMP-SMX – Incorrect. Unlike dapsone, TMP-SMX is associated with phototoxicity and does not serve as an effective treatment for bullous SLE.
E. Start IVIg – Incorrect. IVIg is an option for severe or refractory bullous SLE. The associated high cost and limited access make IVIg a third or fourth-line treatment option.

In the PEXIVAS study, all patients received oral prednisolone/prednisone at 1 mg/kg/d for the first week, followed by rapid or slow tapering schedules. This led to about a 50% difference in oral glucocorticoid exposure during the first 6 months. The lower-dose regimen was noninferior for efficacy and is safer, and therefore is preferred". "All patients in the PEXIVAS trial received an initial dose of i.v. methylprednisolone of 1–3 g; the optimal dose is yet to be determined". For infection prevention, "Low-dose sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (TMP-SMX), or alternative, is advised for pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis for the duration of the cyclophosphamide course or for 6 months following rituximab induction. Longer-term use may be considered in those receiving repeated rituximab infusions, for those with structural lung disease, or those requiring ongoing immunosuppressive or glucocorticoid therapy". For hypogammaglobulinemia risk, "IgG levels should be measured at baseline and every 6 months for patients treated with rituximab. A low level at baseline (defined as IgG < 3 g/l; Figure 80) may predict a greater risk of secondary immunodeficiency with rituximab".

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^f57b2dcb]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

As in line with previous studies, risk factors such as lymphopenia, impaired renal function, age, and rituximab use were significantly associated with PJP. Our earlier research demonstrated that TMP‐SMX prophylaxis reduces the incidence of PJP and related mortality in patients treated with rituximab. An intriguing finding in this study was that among the 16 patients who developed PJP despite prophylaxis, 15 experienced the onset of PJP merely a few months following the cessation of prophylactic TMP‐SMX.

In this context, it is noteworthy that the PJP group in our study had a shorter prophylaxis duration than the control group, leading to the discontinuation of prophylaxis while the patients were still receiving relatively higher doses of GCs. Previous studies on PJP in patients with AIID showed that most PJP cases occurred when patients received > 15–20 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalents. Expanding upon this finding, we demonstrated that the risk of PJP persists even with prophylaxis, unless it is continued until GC doses are tapered to ≤ 12.5 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. In fact, patients who stopped prophylactic TMP‐SMX at a dose of concomitant GC higher than the threshold showed an approximately 10‐times‐higher risk of PJP than other patients. This result suggests that tapering the GC dose by 12.5 mg/day or less can be a relevant threshold for considering the withdrawal of prophylactic TMP‐SMX.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics

A total of 1,294 prophylactic episodes were analyzed in this study (Supplementary Figure 1). The most common underlying AIID was systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 273, 21.1%), followed by antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis (AAV) (n = 226, 17.5%) and idiopathic inflammatory myositis (n = 204, 15.8%). The mean ± SD duration of TMP‐SMX prophylaxis was 181.9 ± 128.7 days. In most episodes (n = 1,287, 99.5%), patients received TMP‐SMX concomitant with GC, with a mean daily dose of 41.5 ± 24.2 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent at the baseline. The most frequently used concomitant immunosuppressant was cyclophosphamide (n = 258, 19.9%), followed by rituximab (n = 168, 13.0%), mycophenolate mofetil (n = 120, 9.3%), azathioprine (n = 114, 8.8%), tacrolimus (n = 64, 4.9%), and cyclosporine A (n = 63, 4.9%). Rituximab was used solely for induction therapy. A combination of two or more non‐GC immunosuppressants was administered to 56 (4.3%) patients.

### Imaging findings of thoracic manifestations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^43c3dad5]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious pneumonias

IBD are also associated with an increased risk of infectious pneumonia, even in untreated patients. In a cohort of 74,156 IBD patients and 1,482,363 controls without IBD, Kantsø et al. showed that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease before and after the diagnosis of IBD (hazard ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.59–2.49 for Crohn's disease and 1.46; 95% confidence, 1.25–1.69 for ulcerative colitis). Pneumococcal vaccination is therefore recommended for all IBD patients.

The use of immunosuppressive agents also increases the risk of opportunistic pulmonary infection. Immunosuppressive agents used in IBD include systemic corticosteroids, anti-TNF agents, and JAK inhibitors. Biologic therapies and JAK inhibitors are associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis. For this reason, IBD patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis prior to immunosuppression. Screening for latent tuberculosis is based on a combination of epidemiological risk factors, physical examination, chest X-ray and tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release test. Tuberculosis is not the only pulmonary infection at increased risk under immunosuppressive therapy in IBD patients. In the event of infectious pneumonia in an IBD patient undergoing immunosuppressive treatment, the presence of Legionella pneumophila should always be suspected and the patient tested. Immunosuppressive drugs also increase the risk of pneumocystis, and prophylaxis should be considered for certain treatment combinations.

Differential diagnoses

The imputability of IBD in the development of thoracic lesions is sometimes difficult to assess, particularly in smokers who may smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. IBD may also be associated with other immune disorders, which are themselves responsible for thoracic manifestations such as common variable immunodeficiency.

An 18-year-old male patient with a known history of Crohn's colitis was admitted for further management of his symptoms. He was treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) adalimumab and intravenous steroids in addition to azathioprine. He developed sudden onset pleuritic chest pain. Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning was reported as normal. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed evidence of a small peripheral wedge shaped area of consolidation in the left lower lobe. He was treated with oral antibiotics but the chest pain persisted for the next 2 weeks. A repeat chest x-ray performed 2 weeks later revealed evidence of a large hydro-pneumothorax which was promptly drained. A chest CT later showed evidence of lower lobe consolidation. Sputum cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. It was felt that a broncho-pleural fistula due to the peripheral cavitating lesion led to the pneumothorax.

### Managing steroid-dependent Crohn's disease… [^30458022]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease are those who respond to steroid therapy but cannot taper the treatment. Steroid-refractive patients are those who fail to respond to adequate treatment dosages of up to 1 mg per kg of prednisone within four weeks. Steroid dependency is common in patients with Crohn's disease who respond to prednisone treatment. Contributing factors associated with steroid dependency include cigarette smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Clostridium difficile infection, and concurrent irritable bowel or chronic pain syndrome. Hanauer reviews the management of patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. Symptoms should be evaluated to rule out visceral hypersensitivity or malabsorption, which can masquerade as inflammatory disease. Initial investigation should include a complete blood count; determination of sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level; and stool examination for leukocytes or lactoferrin, enteric pathogens, and.

Management strategies for steroid-dependent patients include surgery and immunomodulator therapy. Surgery potentially can restore health to a severely ill patient. Immunomodulator therapy with azathioprine or 6-mercapto-purine has been studied most frequently in combination with prednisone. Although combination therapy has some therapeutic advantage, the efficacy of these agents in steroid-dependent patients is unclear. If purine metabolites cannot be used, methotrexate or infliximab can be tried. Patients who are refractory to steroids and immunomodulators and patients in whom steroids are contraindicated should be given infliximab for an indefinite period. editor's note: Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology. Patients with moderate to severe disease can be treated with prednisone in a dosage of 40 to 60 mg daily until symptoms resolve and weight gain resumes.

Infliximab is a useful adjunct or alternative to corticosteroid therapy when the latter cannot be used or is ineffective. Because of the negative effects of chronic steroid use, an alternative agent should be used to maintain long-term remission. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine can be helpful after remission has been achieved with steroid therapy. In patients who have had ileocolonic resection, mesalamine, azathioprine, or mercaptopurine may help decrease the incidence of recurrence. — R. S.

HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis — management of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) adverse reactions and G6PD testing: For people with HIV with non life-threatening adverse reactions to TMP-SMX, the drug should be continued if clinically feasible (AII). If TMP-SMX is discontinued because of a mild adverse reaction, reintroduction of therapy should be considered after the reaction has resolved (AII); the dose of TMP-SMX can be increased gradually (desensitization) (BI) or the drug can be given at a reduced dose or frequency (CIII). TMP-SMX should be permanently discontinued, with no rechallenge, in people with HIV with life-threatening adverse events, including suspected or confirmed Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis (AIII). Whenever possible, people with HIV should be tested for G6PD deficiency before administration of dapsone, and an alternative agent should be used if the patient is found to have G6PD deficiency.

### TPMT in the treatment of Crohn's disease with azathioprine [^db1ae353]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Azathioprine induced profound myelosuppression linked to TPMT deficiency has now been documented in many patient groups, including those with Crohn's disease. At the start of azathioprine or mercaptopurine therapy, measurement of TPMT activity has a role in identifying the 1 in 300 patients who are at risk of severe myelosuppression when treated with standard thiopurine dosages. During the initial months of azathioprine therapy a knowledge of TPMT status warns of early bone marrow toxicity. In patients established on azathioprine these is no clear evidence to suggest that TPMT is predictive of clinical response or drug toxicity, indicating a role for TPMT in the prediction of early events rather than long term control. In patients with Crohn's disease on long term azathioprine therapy, it is clear that myelosuppression, particularly leucopenia, is caused by other factors in addition to variable TPMT activity and therefore monitoring of blood cell counts throughout treatment is essential.

Treatment

One hundred seventy patients (98.3%) received the prophylactic antibiotics trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day and Itraconazole as antifungal prophylaxis given at 100 mg once daily (age 5–12 years) or 200 mg/ once daily (age ≥ 13 years). Patients who were younger than 5 years were prescribed Itraconazole after their first fungal infection episode. Three patients did not receive the prophylaxis treatment as they were diagnosed during the acute infection and died. One hundred sixty-nine patients (97.7%) received antimicrobial treatment during the infections. One hundred fifty-seven patients (90.8%) required hospital admission to treat the infections, while 44 patients (25.4%) were admitted to the intensive care unit due to the severity of the infections. Surgical procedures were performed on 85 patients (49.1%) in the form of lymph node biopsy or surgical drainage of the abscess. Thirty-four patients (19.7%) received systemic steroids as a treatment, mostly due to the chest condition. Only 6 patients (3.5%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Regarding the treatment of non-infectious manifestations, patients with IBD received glucocorticoids, mesalamine, and azathioprine as a line of treatment. Patients with non-infectious polyarticular arthritis responded to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and steroids. The XL-CGD patient who developed IBD, autoimmune hepatitis, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia was treated with steroids and improved. The p67 phox deficient patient who developed autoimmune encephalitis received IVIG and steroids and recovered without any neurological sequelae. Two patients who developed secondary HLH received the HLH protocol and improved, while the third patient succumbed to the infections. The patient who developed MISC secondary to COVID-19 infection with coronary affection received IVIG (2 gm/kg), steroids, and acetylsalicylic acid.

### A nomogram-based clinical prediction model for adverse clinical outcomes in non-HIV Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia patients [^426bba53]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In non-HIV populations, PJP often progresses rapidly, and delayed treatment is strongly associated with increased risk of mortality and complications. Our analysis indicated that delayed initiation of TMP-SMX was associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes. A prospective study has demonstrated that longer time from admission to initiation of PJP therapy is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.11 per additional day, 95% CI: 1.04–1.18). Several retrospective studies have similarly reported that treatment delays are associated with increased mortality risk. Notably, nearly one-quarter of patients in our cohort began anti-Pneumocystis treatment more than 96 h after admission. This highlights a gap between clinical guidelines, which consistently recommend early empirical treatment for high-risk immunocompromised patients and actual clinical practice. However, TMP-SMX often causes side effects, atovaquone is getting more attention as an alternative. Although atovaquone has not yet been approved for clinical use in our country, literature evidence suggests its potential as both a treatment and prophylactic agent in non-HIV immunocompromised patients. Case reports have demonstrated its successful use in patients with renal impairment or prior TMP-SMX-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis, and randomized trials have shown favorable safety profiles. Furthermore, recent studies in solid organ transplant, hematologic malignancy, and connective tissue disease populations support the utility of atovaquone as a well-tolerated alternative. These findings underscore the need to expand the therapeutic arsenal for PJP, particularly in high-risk patients where first-line therapy is not feasible.

On the basis of the recommendations of the British Society of Gastroenterology, we present a modified approach regarding the risk factors of IBD patients. Three main aspects should be considered: patient-dependent factors, therapy-based factors and other (mainly pandemic-related) factors (Table 3). Moreover, we present our recommendations based on a comprehensive analysis of the recommendations of the International Organisation for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and the guidelines of the American Gastroenterological Association regarding patient management (Tables 4, 5).

Patient not infected with SARS-CoV-2–IBD in remission

Personalised risk evaluation and therapy modification if necessary (considering age, comorbidities, lymphocytopenia, steroid requirement and combination therapy). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.0 × 10⁹/L) is an independent risk factor of COVID-19-related mortality.
Maintenance of remission with unmodified treatment in low- and medium-risk patients.
Taper the dose of corticosteroids, even when using oral budesonide MMX. Evidently, the use of prednisone should be decreased to a dose of at least below 20 mg.
Consider the risk/benefit of combination therapy, stop azathioprine and continue biological monotherapy in the case of patients with a high risk of infection. Drug-induced risk of viral infections is exemplified by azathioprine and anti-TNF combination therapy. Although azathioprine is supposed to require a few weeks for total elimination, no exact information is available on the elimination time of the drug (half-life of azathioprine is 5 h), and the pandemic may continue for many more months. Azathioprine monotherapy does not confer any such increased risk; therefore, it can be continued. Moreover, risk of relapse is higher if azathioprine monotherapy is ceased when compared with the cessation of azathioprine as a part of combination therapy.
Prioritise the prevention of infection by adequate patient education.
Omit unnecessary appointments with the patients (use electronic prescription, adalimumab receiving points, mobile or online appointments).
Protective equipment and other safety considerations in the biological therapy wards.
Prescribe the maximum possible amount of medications.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^f96e3e09]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

However, approximately 40% of the study population discontinued TMP‐SMX before the threshold was reached. This result could be attributed to various factors, including safety concerns associated with TMP‐SMX. Despite the well‐established prophylactic efficacy of TMP‐SMX, there are concerns regarding adverse drug reactions (ADRs) ranging from severe conditions such as SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis to minor reactions such as gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, increased serum creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. The study by Nettleton et al calculated the risk of possible AE associated to PJP prophylaxis and reported that leukopenia (HR, 3.1), rash (HR, 1.9), and nephropathy (HR, 2.6) were higher among those who received prophylaxis as opposed those who did not. However, most of these studies did not thoroughly assess the causality of AEs, leaving the true incidence of ADRs directly related to prophylactic TMP‐SMX debatable. It should be noted that AEs commonly linked to TMP‐SMX may also stem from underlying diseases and concomitant treatment. This aligns with our finding that only 4.2% of prophylactic episodes were suspected to be AEs. Among these AEs, 10 (15.9%) were identified as true ADR, and only two cases showed serious AEs that required intervention other than stopping TMP‐SMX, in which all patients recovered after proper management. Notably, a previous cohort study that included patients treated with rituximab and prophylactic TMP‐SMX showed that, among 2,113 AEs, only 92 (4.4%) had definite or probable causality related to TMP‐SMX. Of these, only 10 severe ADRs required any intervention. Taken together, these findings suggest that the potential risks associated with the prolonged use of prophylactic TMP‐SMX may be less significant than those previously reported.

### Low incidence of community-acquired pneumonia among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients after interruption of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis [^15ee3237]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We compared the incidence of bacterial pneumonia among 336 patients who discontinued trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) with that among 75 patients who fulfilled the criteria for discontinuation but continued receiving prophylaxis. The difference in the overall incidence rates for the 2 groups (1.2 events per 100 person-years) was not statistically significant. Discontinuation of TMP-SMX prophylaxis against PCP is not associated with a significant increase in the incidence of bacterial pneumonia among patients with a sustained CD4 cell count increase to > 200 cells/microL.

Data collection

The clinical data of the study population were obtained from the electronic medical records database of Seoul National University Hospital. Collected variables included patient demographics, underlying AIID, comorbidities (malignancy diagnosed within five years from the baseline, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease, and heart failure), duration of TMP‐SMX prescription, and potential risk factors for PJP, such as baseline lymphopenia (lymphocyte < 800/μL), azotemia (eGFR < 60 mL/min), and interstitial lung disease. In addition, data on the prescribed immunosuppressive therapies (GC, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, azathioprine, JAK inhibitors, and tocilizumab) were collected. Concomitant medications were defined as medications prescribed during the index period. GC pulse therapy was defined as intravenous methylprednisolone administration at a dose of 250 to 1,000 mg/day for a duration of one to five days. To collect data on the underlying AIID, we first collected data on all registered International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) codes for each study population. If a patient had more than one ICD‐10 code for rheumatic disease, one investigator (JYK) reviewed the patient's medical records to confirm the final diagnosis. We also reviewed the medical records and gathered information on AEs that occurred with the use of prophylactic TMP‐SMX. AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. Severe AEs were defined as AEs of grade 3 or higher. Two independent investigators (JYK and JWP) assessed the severity and cause of TMP‐SMX in each case. Cases with probable or definite causality were defined as having drug reactions related to TMP‐SMX.

### Severe Legionella pneumophila pneumonia following infliximab therapy in a patient with Crohn's disease [^f7860ffb]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Immunosuppressive therapy with anti-TNF-alpha antibodies is effective in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, there is an increased risk for infections associated with this therapy.

Methods

Here, we report the case of a 58-year-old patient with Crohn's disease (CD) treated with steroids and azathioprine who developed severe Legionella pneumophila pneumonia after 3 infusions of infliximab. The patient presented at our IBD department with severe active CD complicated by inflammatory small bowel stenoses and entero-enteral fistulas despite long-term high-dose steroid therapy. To achieve steroid tapering and control of disease activity, immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine was initiated. Due to persistent symptoms, infusion therapy with the anti-TNF-alpha antibody infliximab was started, subsequently leading to significant clinical improvement. However, after the third infliximab infusion the patient was hospitalized with fever, severe fatigue, and syncope.

Results

Laboratory findings and chest X-ray revealed left-sided pneumonia; cultural analysis showed L. pneumophila serogroup 1 leading to respiratory insufficiency, which required mechanical ventilation for 2 weeks in the intensive care unit. After discontinuation of all immunosuppressive agents and immediate antibiotic therapy the patient recovered completely.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the third case of L. pneumophila pneumonia in an IBD patient treated with infliximab. Similar to other published cases, concomitant treatment of immunosuppressives and anti-TNF agents is a major risk factor for the development of L. pneumophila infection, which should be ruled out in all cases of pneumonia in patients with such a therapeutic regimen. Appropriate prevention strategies should be provided in these patients.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of azathioprine PO (also known as Imuran, Azasan):
- **Acute infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**: maintain a high level of suspicion for immunosuppression, as azathioprine is associated with these adverse effects.
- **Exacerbation of myelosuppression**: use extreme caution in patients with thiopurine S-methyl transferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Consider alternative therapy or dosage reductions.
- **Hematologic disorder**: use extreme caution in patients with renal transplant, TPMT deficiency, or nucleotide diphosphatase deficiency.
- **Hematologic malignancies**: maintain a high level of suspicion as chronic immunosuppression with azathioprine increases risk for post-transplant lymphoma and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients with IBD.
- **Thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, anemia, myelosuppression**: maintain a high level of suspicion for myelosuppression and cytopenias.

### Infliximab versus ciclosporin for steroid-resistant acute severe ulcerative colitis (CONSTRUCT): a mixed methods, open-label, pragmatic randomised trial [^9d5a2005]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Patient details were entered onto a web-based password-protected site (hosted by Bangor University, UK), and allocated at random to infliximab or ciclosporin. A dynamic algorithmwas used to generate allocations on request, thus protecting against investigator preference or other subversion while ensuring that each trial group was balanced by centre, which was the only stratification used.

Since this was an open-label trial, local investigators and participants were aware of the treatment allocated, but the chief investigator and all analysts remained masked to allocation until the trial steering committee and data monitoring and ethics committee had reviewed and approved the analysis of the primary outcome.

Procedures

Patients randomly allocated to receive infliximab were given 5 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 2 h at baseline, and again at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after the first infusion, in accordance with local prescribing guidelines. Patients randomly allocated to receive ciclosporin received the drug by continuous infusion of 2 mg/kg per day, continued for up to 7 days if this resulted in improvement; then twice-daily tablets delivering 5.5 mg/kg per day, with the dose adjusted to achieve trough ciclosporin concentration of 100–200 ng/mL for 12 weeks. The drugs were dispensed by hospital pharmacies, as part of routine practice. They were not provided specifically for the trial by pharmaceutical companies, who did not support this trial in any way.

We did not mandate other therapy. Centres were encouraged to give co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and given discretion to start azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine at therapeutic doses in week 4. Guidance included stopping steroids by week 12 in patients who remained well, but to restart steroids in patients who became symptomatic. After 12 weeks, all treatment was at the discretion of the patient's physician.

Methods

Ethics statement

This study received written approval from the Instituto Aragonés de Ciencias de la Salud (IACS) review board.

Study design

From February 2009 to December 2010 (22 months), consecutive adult (> 18 years) patients admitted to a university hospital with a diagnosis of CAP were prospectively recruited within 24 hours of their arrival. CAP was defined as an acute disease with a new radiologic infiltrate not due to another known cause, in association with symptoms of lower respiratory-tract infection. Exclusion criteria were severe immunodepression (HIV infection, severe hematological disease); immunosuppressive therapy (prednisone or equivalent daily dose of > 20 mg for > 2 weeks), or any immunosuppressive regimen (azathioprine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide and/or other immunosuppressant drugs); leucopenia < 1000/mm³ or neutropenia < 500/mm³ and/or chemotherapy in the previous year; pulmonary abscess (x-ray cavitation), aspiration pneumonia and obstructive pneumonia; possible nosocomial origin (less than 30 days after hospital discharge); and known active neoplasia. The study was approved by the ethics committee and all patients signed an informed consent form. All patients were followed up during their hospital stay and those with a definitive diagnosis other than CAP were excluded.

### Clinical factors associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia despite its primary prophylaxis: when to stop prophylaxis? [^17fbd297]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the established benefits of primary PJP prophylaxis in patients with AIID, the optimal prophylaxis schedule remains uncertain. One of the most important uncertainties is the timing of discontinuation of PJP prophylaxis. TMP‐SMX carries some risk of adverse events (AEs), some of which may be severe. Therefore, minimizing exposure to TMP‐SMX while preserving its optimal prophylactic efficacy is a logical next step in building evidence for the universal recommendation for primary PJP prophylaxis. In patients with HIV, the decision to discontinue primary PJP prophylaxis is guided by CD4 counts and response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Guidelines recommend the cessation of prophylaxis when CD4 counts have risen to more than 200 cells/mmand are maintained for at least three months in response to ART. However, the correlation between CD4 counts and PJP risk is less clear in patients without HIV, including those with AIID, which renders CD4 counts a less reliable surrogate measure to direct prophylaxis. Although previous studies have suggested that PJP mainly occurs when a patient receives > 15 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent, it is uncertain whether this could be a relevant indication to consider the cessation of PJP prophylaxis. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors associated with PJP infection despite prophylaxis and to offer insights into establishing an ideal primary prophylaxis regimen for patients with AIID.

### Treatment with reduced-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies [^b04aa706]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) is a life-threatening opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. In settings with a low prevalence of untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, patients with hematologic malignancies constitute the largest risk group for developing PJP. Widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) prophylaxis has significantly lowered the incidence of PJP in high-risk hematological patients, but PJP still occurs in high-risk patients not tolerating TMP-SMX or after discontinuing prophylaxis, and in low-risk patients not receiving prophylactic treatment, in particular patients who have received treatment with high-dose corticosteroids.

The recommended first-line treatment for PJP in patients with hematologic malignancies is TMP-SMX given at a high dose, 15–20 mg/kg of the TMP component, but the evidence supporting this high dose is anecdotal. TMP-SMX therapy may cause dose-dependent adverse events, and previous studies have shown that the standard high-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP may be correlated to an increased frequency of such adverse events.

In a recent meta-analysis analyzing reduced-dose vs standard-dose TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality but an 18% absolute risk reduction of adverse events with reduced doses of TMP-SMX. However, few patients with hematological malignancies were included in this study, and it is thus unclear if these findings can be generalized to a hematological population. This retrospective multicenter study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by comparing clinical outcomes and adverse events in hematologic patients receiving a reduced vs standard dose of TMP-SMX for the treatment of PJP.

The patient demonstrated reproducible clinical improvement with oral prednisolone (dose range 0–50 mg daily) and typical symptom relapse on weaning/cessation. This occurred most dramatically in 2015 following a period of management with inhaled high-dose steroids alone and culminated in an acute admission with a Streptococcus pneumonae and Moraxella catarrhalis generated community acquired bilateral lobar pneumonia with type 1 respiratory failure and an exacerbation of tracheobronchitis. Azathioprine was commenced as a steroid sparing agent in late 2015. Repeat bronchoscopy following 4 months of commencement demonstrated persistent low-grade tracheobronchitis despite treatment with azathioprine (100 mg/day) and inhaled fluticasone propionate (3 g/day). A further tracheobronchitis decompensation driven by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) resulted in an inpatient admission in early- 2017. Subsequently a further exacerbation caused by Haemophilus influenzae in mid-2017 resulted in type 1 respiratory failure requiring high acuity inpatient care. Given the burden of disease despite azathioprine, oral prednisolone and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, Infliximab induction therapy (0, 2, 6 weeks) and subsequent maintenance therapy (8 weekly) at dose 5 mg/kg was commenced in early 2018 in consideration of refractory symptoms requiring chronic use of oral prednisolone despite the combined treatment regimen of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and azathioprine. Access to Infliximab was funded by the treating facility. Appropriate pre-screening for latent tuberculosis, varicella zoster virus and hepatitis B virus was undertaken. Infusions of infliximab were well tolerated by the patient with no acute or delayed infusion-related infliximab reactions experienced. Repeat bronchoscopy (Fig. 4) performed approximately 5- months' post commencement of Infliximab revealed no macroscopic evidence of mucosal irregularities such as oedema, hyperaemia or ulceration to suggest ongoing active tracheobronchitis with an absence of the purulent secretions present on prior bronchoscopy. Infliximab therapy has allowed cessation of oral prednisolone, the gradual weaning regimen of inhaled fluticasone propionate to 1000mcg daily. Clinical stability of the patient has also been achieved with no further exacerbations of tracheobronchitis since commencement of Infliximab and resolution of her productive cough and dyspnoea. As such, maintenance Infliximab therapy has continued in combination with ongoing 3 monthly specialist reviews.

### Do not assume symptoms indicate failure of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in Crohn's disease [^8e21c0be]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

It is a challenge to monitor patients with Crohn's disease who remain symptomatic despite anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Clinicians must use a systematic approach for each patient and obtain objective evidence about disease activity and response to therapy. Alternate etiologies for symptoms should be sought and treated, if found. Active Crohn's disease despite therapy requires reassessment and adjustments to management plans.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^ffaa2e52]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Cystoisosporiasis — TMP-SMX dosing regimens and adjustments: Three studies in people with HIV in Haiti have demonstrated the effectiveness of various TMP-SMX treatment regimens. Based on the initial studies, the traditional treatment regimen has been a 10-day course of TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered orally four times daily (AII). In another study, TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered twice daily for seven days was also effective, and although published experience with using twice-daily TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) is limited, one approach would be to start with this regimen but increase the daily dose and/or the duration of therapy (up to 3 to 4 weeks) if symptoms worsen or persist (BIII). Intravenous administration of TMP-SMX should be considered for patients with potential or documented malabsorption or for those who cannot tolerate oral medications.

Isosporiasis in HIV — first-line therapy uses TMP-SMX as the antimicrobial agent of choice (AI), with a traditional regimen of a 10-day course of TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered orally four times daily (AII); TMP-SMX (160/800 mg) administered twice daily was also effective (BI), and if symptoms worsen or persist on twice-daily dosing, one approach is to increase the daily dose and the duration of therapy (up to 3–4 weeks) (BIII). Intravenous administration of TMP-SMX should be considered for patients with potential or documented malabsorption, potential alternative therapies should be reserved for patients with documented sulfa intolerance or in whom treatment fails (AIII), and clinical management includes fluid and electrolyte support for dehydrated patients and nutritional supplementation for malnourished patients (AIII).

### Low risk of pneumonia from Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease receiving immune suppression [^cb714767]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Use of immunosuppressants and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may increase the risk of pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP). We assessed the risk of PJP in a population-based cohort of patients with IBD treated with corticosteroids, immune-suppressive medications, and biologics.

Methods

We performed a population-based cohort study of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, diagnosed with Crohn's disease (n = 427) or ulcerative colitis (n = 510) from 1970 through 2011. Records of patients were reviewed to identify all episodes of immunosuppressive therapies and concomitant PJP prophylaxis through February 2016. We reviewed charts to identify cases of PJP, cross-referenced with the Rochester Epidemiology Project database (using diagnostic codes for PJP) and the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center databases. The primary outcome was risk of PJP associated with the use of corticosteroids, immune-suppressive medications, and biologics by patients with IBD.

Results

Our analysis included 937 patients and 6066 patient-years of follow-up evaluation (median, 14.8 y per patient). Medications used included corticosteroids (520 patients; 55.5%; 555.4 patient-years of exposure), immunosuppressants (304 patients; 32.4%; 1555.7 patient-years of exposure), and biologics (193 patients; 20.5%; 670 patient-years of exposure). Double therapy (corticosteroids and either immunosuppressants and biologics) was used by 236 patients (25.2%), with 173 patient-years of exposure. Triple therapy (corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologics) was used by 70 patients (7.5%) with 18.9 patient-years of exposure. There were 3 cases of PJP, conferring a risk of 0.2 (95% CI, 0.01–1.0) to corticosteroids, 0.1 (95% CI, 0.02–0.5) cases per 100 patient-years of exposure to immunosuppressants, 0.3 (95% CI, 0.04–1.1) cases per 100 patient-years of exposure to biologics, 0.6 (95% CI, 0.01–3.2) cases per 100 patient-years of exposure to double therapy, and 0 (95% CI, 0.0–19.5) cases per 100 patient-years of exposure to triple therapy. Primary prophylaxis for PJP was prescribed to 37 patients, for a total of 24.9 patient-years of exposure.

Conclusions

In a population-based cohort of patients with IBD treated with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologics, there were only 3 cases of PJP, despite the uncommon use of PJP prophylaxis. Routine administration of PJP prophylaxis in these patients may not be warranted, although it should be considered for high-risk groups, such as patients receiving triple therapy.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^fe2931a3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Consensus recommendations for infectious disease prophylaxis during chronic GC therapy — Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP): PJP prophylaxis should be used when the annual incidence of PJP for a given disease and treatment modality is ≥ 3.5%. For neuromuscular disease (NMD) receiving glucocorticoid (GC) monotherapy where disease-specific incidence is unknown, prophylaxis may be offered to patients receiving ≥ 20 mg/day of prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month; if a second immunosuppressive agent is added, prophylaxis should be offered for patients receiving ≥ 20 mg prednisone equivalent for ≥ 1 month. Trimethoprim‑Sulfamethoxazole (TMP‑SMX) one single‑strength tablet daily or one double‑strength tablet three times a week is the recommended regimen for PJP prophylaxis in patients with normal renal function, adjusted for renal function. For TMP‑SMX allergy, alternative options include atovaquone 1.5g daily, dapsone 100 mg daily, or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg monthly.

Rheumatology key messages
Old age, obesity, coexisting lung diseases, neutropenia, and low serum IgG levels can predict pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in RA patients on b/tsDMARDs treatment.
Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination (SMX–TMP) was more efficacious in prevention of PCP than pentamidine inhalation.
A low dose of SMX–TMP (< 560 mg TMP/week) can be considered.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^6ce845ec]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — community-acquired pneumonia/bacteremia empiric therapy — children with HIV whose immune systems are not seriously compromised and who are not neutropenic should be treated for the most likely bacterial organisms (AIII). Based only on expert opinion, mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia in children with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with only mild or no immunosuppression who are fully immunized can be treated with oral antibiotics (usually oral amoxicillin) according to the same guidelines as for healthy children (BIII). For hospitalized children outside of the neonatal period with suspected community-acquired bacterial pneumonia or bacteremia, options for empiric therapy include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone), respectively (AIII). The addition of a macrolide or fluoroquinolone can be considered for hospitalized individuals with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens. If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns and adjusted according to culture results). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug if infection with Pseudomonas spp. is likely. Severely immunocompromised children with HIV and invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) — adjunctive corticosteroids and special considerations — adjunctive corticosteroids are indicated when PaO₂ < 70 mmHg at room air or alveolar-arterial DO₂ gradient > 35 mmHg (AI). Prednisone dosing, beginning as early as possible and within 72 hours of PCP therapy, is Days 1–5: 40 mg PO twice daily; Days 6–10: 40 mg PO daily; Days 11–21: 20 mg PO daily (AI). IV methylprednisolone can be administered as 75% of prednisone dose. Benefit of corticosteroid if started after 72 hours of PCP therapy is uncertain, but some clinicians will use it for moderate-to-severe PCP (BIII). Whenever possible, patients should be tested for G6PD before use of dapsone or primaquine, and alternative therapy should be used in patients found to have G6PD deficiency. Patients who are receiving pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine for treatment or suppression of toxoplasmosis do not require additional PCP prophylaxis (AII). If TMP-SMX is discontinued because of a mild adverse reaction, re-institution should be considered after the reaction resolves; the dose can be increased gradually (desensitization) (BI), reduced, or the frequency modified (CIII). TMP-SMX should be permanently discontinued in patients with possible or definite Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrosis.
