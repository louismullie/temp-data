## Question

What are the potential causes of ketones being detected on a urine test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what conditions and situations can cause ketones to be detected on a urine test. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about ketone physiology and what urine dipsticks actually measure. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies, prioritizing life-threatening causes like DKA and euglycemic DKA. Next, I will consider physiologic states, medication effects, and testing artifacts that cause false positives or negatives. After that, I need to review pediatric and inborn error considerations. Finally, I should confirm the optimal laboratory approach, clinical decision points, and summarize key takeaways with appropriate references and caveats for SGLT2 inhibitor scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the physiology and test principle before drawing conclusions. Urine ketone dipsticks rely on the nitroprusside reaction and primarily detect acetoacetate (and variably acetone), not beta-hydroxybutyrate, which predominates in most ketoacidoses; this means a positive urine test reflects acetoacetate presence but can miss early or severe ketonemia when beta-hydroxybutyrate is high, and during recovery from DKA urine ketones may paradoxically rise as beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized back to acetoacetate, so I need to be cautious interpreting trends [^113eLXyY] [^114o9ADe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should prioritize the most urgent etiologies first. Diabetic ketoacidosis is the life-threatening cause to exclude, typically with hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia/ketonuria; however, euglycemic DKA can occur with normal or mildly elevated glucose, particularly in the context of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, missed insulin, acute illness, surgery, or reduced intake, so the absence of marked hyperglycemia does not rule it out and should trigger serum beta-hydroxybutyrate testing and full acid–base assessment when suspicion is high [^117SrKhk] [^1113QQiV] [^112adUHE] [^114jc5ss] [^114EzAFr].

> Next, I will examine common physiologic or benign states so I do not overcall pathology. Starvation or prolonged fasting, low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets, and pregnancy can produce ketonuria in otherwise stable patients; for example, up to 30% of first-morning urine samples in pregnancy may show ketones, and nutritional ketosis from very-low-carbohydrate intake can appear within 1–2 days, sometimes accompanied by natriuresis and osmotic diuresis, while alcoholic ketoacidosis classically presents with positive ketones but normal or low glucose, which I should keep in mind when blood glucose is not elevated [^114o9ADe] [^115x4jMq] [^112ZueNY].

> Wait, let me verify medication-related mechanisms and their clinical implications. SGLT2 inhibitors promote glucosuria, lower circulating insulin-to-glucagon ratio, and favor ketogenesis, increasing risk for euglycemic DKA and sometimes causing prolonged glucosuria and persistent ketonemia/ketonuria for days after discontinuation, which can lead to relapse if insulin is reduced too early; other drugs like valproic acid, salicylates, niacin, and acetylcysteine can raise serum ketones and should be considered in the history [^112B6qW7] [^1163RMNH] [^1174HhCj] [^115sDkrf] [^114jc5ss] [^116qnri7].

> But wait, what if the positive urine ketone is spurious; I need to check for test interferences. Nitroprusside-based urine tests can yield false positives with highly pigmented urine and with sulfhydryl-containing compounds such as ACE inhibitors, levodopa/carbidopa, and mesna, and cefiderocol has also been reported to cause false-positive ketones; conversely, false negatives may occur with strip deterioration from air exposure, highly acidic urine, ascorbic acid, microbial degradation, or loss of volatile acetone if the container is not sealed, so verifying pre-analytic quality and potential drug interferences is essential before anchoring on ketosis [^113eLXyY] [^1146VvrK] [^112CTDSo] [^116FgpG8].

> I will now examine pediatric and rare metabolic causes because missing them can be consequential. In young children, idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia presents with fasting hypoglycemia and ketonuria, while inborn errors such as organic acidemias and defects in ketogenesis or ketolysis may present with high anion gap acidosis and ketosis or, in ketogenesis defects, hypoketotic hypoglycemia; rare entities like hepatic glycogen synthase deficiency can cause ketotic hypoglycemia and warrant consideration when recurrent or severe episodes occur, prompting targeted metabolic testing during decompensation [^116YNykK] [^116HbY9W] [^116oKfK7] [^111oud9X].

> Let me double-check the diagnostic accuracy and optimal laboratory approach to avoid misclassification. Compared with urine dipsticks, capillary or serum beta-hydroxybutyrate provides similar sensitivity but substantially better specificity for DKA at triage, which reduces unnecessary workups; major guidelines recommend measuring serum beta-hydroxybutyrate when available for diagnosing and monitoring DKA, and importantly, a negative urine dipstick should not be used to exclude DKA because beta-hydroxybutyrate may predominate early, necessitating blood ketone measurement and full acid–base analysis when clinical suspicion persists [^111GPjM9] [^111N7noh] [^11423GKR] [^112H9My1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also address the paradox seen during DKA treatment so clinicians do not misinterpret recovery. During successful therapy, beta-hydroxybutyrate declines while it is oxidized to acetoacetate, and because urine dipsticks detect acetoacetate, the urine ketone signal may rise or lag despite clinical improvement, which is why serial blood beta-hydroxybutyrate or venous blood gas and anion gap closure are preferred for monitoring resolution rather than relying on urine ketone trends alone [^116xm6bK] [^114o9ADe].

> I need to ensure practical decision-making ties ketonuria to context. When urine ketones are positive, I should integrate symptoms, vital signs, glucose level, electrolytes, anion gap, and medication history; prioritize DKA or euglycemic DKA if acidosis and symptoms are present, particularly with SGLT2 inhibitor exposure, and follow label guidance to hold SGLT2 inhibitors in acute illness, perioperative states, or reduced intake while promptly evaluating and treating suspected ketoacidosis, recognizing that glucosuria and ketosis may persist beyond drug cessation [^112adUHE] [^1113QQiV] [^1163RMNH].

> Hold on, I should verify one more nuance regarding pregnancy and special populations. Positive urinary ketones in pregnancy are common and often reflect fasting or hyperemesis rather than DKA, but given the risk of both starvation ketoacidosis and euglycemic DKA in susceptible individuals, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acid–base assessment remain prudent when symptoms or metabolic derangements are present, especially if concomitant SGLT2 inhibitor exposure or significant vomiting is reported [^114o9ADe] [^117SrKhk].

> Let me reconsider and summarize the key takeaways to solidify the clinical flow. Positive urinary ketones can arise from life-threatening DKA or euglycemic DKA, from physiologic states like fasting, ketogenic diets, and pregnancy, from medications that increase ketogenesis or interfere with testing, and from pediatric inborn errors; because urine dipsticks miss beta-hydroxybutyrate and are prone to false positives and negatives, serum beta-hydroxybutyrate and acid–base status should guide diagnosis and monitoring, especially in SGLT2-associated presentations where glucosuria and ketosis can persist despite drug cessation [^111N7noh] [^111GPjM9] [^113eLXyY] [^112B6qW7] [^112adUHE].

Ketones in urine (ketonuria) reflect **increased fatty acid metabolism** when glucose is unavailable or insulin is deficient [^116xm6bK]. The most clinically significant cause is **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** [^111N7noh], but ketonuria also occurs with **fasting, low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets, prolonged exercise, pregnancy, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and alcohol use** [^114o9ADe]. Medications such as **SGLT2 inhibitors**, valproic acid, and aspirin can trigger ketosis [^114jc5ss] [^116qnri7]. Inborn errors of metabolism (e.g. glycogen storage diseases, organic acidemias) may also cause persistent ketonuria [^111oud9X] [^116HbY9W]. Urine ketone tests can yield false-positive or false-negative results due to interfering substances or improper storage [^113eLXyY]; therefore, confirmatory blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is recommended when DKA is suspected [^111N7noh].

---

## Physiological and dietary causes

Prolonged fasting or caloric restriction increases **fatty acid oxidation and ketone production** [^116qnri7]. Low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diets similarly induce **ketosis** to meet energy needs [^112ZueNY]. Sustained, intense exercise can increase reliance on **fatty acid oxidation**, yielding measurable urinary ketones [^116xm6bK]. Pregnancy increases metabolic demands and relative insulin resistance, leading to **ketonuria** — especially when nausea and vomiting reduce caloric intake [^114o9ADe].

---

## Pathological conditions

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)**: A life-threatening complication of insulin deficiency, mainly in type 1 diabetes, with hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonuria [^111N7noh].

- **Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis**: DKA with normal/near-normal glucose, often with SGLT2 inhibitors [^114EzAFr] [^111N7noh].

- **Alcoholic ketoacidosis**: Chronic alcohol use with poor nutrition causes ketosis and metabolic acidosis [^114o9ADe].

- **Starvation ketosis**: Prolonged caloric deprivation increases ketone production [^116qnri7].

- **Inborn errors of metabolism**: Disorders such as glycogen storage diseases and organic acidemias cause persistent ketonuria [^111oud9X] [^116HbY9W] [^116oKfK7].

---

## Medications and substances

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin increase ketosis risk [^114jc5ss] and can cause euglycemic DKA [^1113QQiV] [^111N7noh].

- **Valproic acid**: Associated with hyperammonemia and ketosis [^116qnri7].

- **Aspirin (salicylates)**: Overdose can cause metabolic acidosis and ketosis [^116qnri7].

- **Levodopa/carbidopa**: May cause false-positive urine ketone tests [^116FgpG8].

- **Cefiderocol**: May cause false-positive urine ketone tests [^1146VvrK].

---

## Clinical significance and interpretation

For DKA diagnosis and monitoring, urine ketones are adjunctive; **blood β-hydroxybutyrate is preferred** [^111GPjM9] for both diagnostic accuracy and trend monitoring [^111N7noh]. In patients on SGLT2 inhibitors with compatible symptoms, assess for euglycemic DKA even when glucose is normal or near-normal [^112adUHE] [^111N7noh]. During pregnancy, ketonuria is common and may indicate inadequate caloric intake or an increased risk of gestational diabetes.

---

## Limitations and potential errors in urine ketone testing

- **False positives**: Highly colored urine, sulfhydryl-containing drugs, and improper storage can cause false positives [^113eLXyY].

- **False negatives**: Highly acidic urine, ascorbic acid intake, and microbial degradation can cause false negatives.

- **Delayed detection**: Urine ketones reflect past levels, potentially delaying recognition of acute ketosis [^116bcBjA].

- **Limited sensitivity**: Urine tests detect acetoacetate/acetone but not β-hydroxybutyrate, the predominant ketone in DKA [^114YBuYr] [^114o9ADe].

---

## Clinical approach to ketonuria

When DKA is suspected, **obtain confirmatory blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing** [^111N7noh] [^11423GKR]. Always interpret ketonuria in clinical context — alongside glucose level and acid–base status — and educate patients on SGLT2 inhibitors or insulin therapy to recognize symptoms of ketosis or DKA and to seek prompt medical attention [^1113QQiV]. Ketones in urine reflect increased fatty acid metabolism from insulin deficiency, carbohydrate restriction, or metabolic stress; while DKA is the most clinically significant cause, ketonuria also occurs with fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, prolonged exercise, pregnancy, and certain medications [^116qnri7].

### Case report: Liver glycogen synthase deficiency — a cause of ketotic hypoglycemia [^111oud9X]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Glycogen synthase deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism, characterized by fasting hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic seizures, and ketonuria. Only seven families with 14 affected children have been reported. Here, we report an additional patient with this deficiency. Findings in this patient were clinically and biochemically consistent with those reported in patients with ketotic hypoglycemia and may alert the clinician to consider glycogen synthase deficiency.

- **Interpretation**: Ketones measured in urine or blood in the home setting by patients with diabetes and in the clinic/hospital setting should be considered only an adjunct to the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) GPP.

- **Urine ketone measurements**: The presence of positive urine ketone readings in a patient with known diabetes or a patient not previously diagnosed with diabetes but who presents with typical symptoms of diabetes and hyperglycemia suggests the possibility of impending or established DKA. Although DKA is most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, it may occur rarely in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis will have positive urine ketone readings, but hyperglycemia is not usually present. Positive urine ketone readings are found in up to 30% of first morning urine samples from pregnant women (with or without diabetes), during starvation, and after hypoglycemia.

- **Blood ketone measurements**: Blood ketone measurements that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used with caution for DKA diagnosis because the results do not quantify β-hydroxybutyrate (βHBA), the predominant ketone in DKA. The test should not be used to monitor the course of therapy because acetoacetate and acetone may increase as βHBA decreases during successful therapy. Specific measurement of βHBA in blood can be used for diagnosis and monitoring of DKA.

### Inborn errors of metabolism with acidosis: Organic acidemias and defects of pyruvate and ketone body metabolism [^116HbY9W]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

When a child presents with high-anion gap metabolic acidosis, pediatricians can proceed with confidence by recalling some basic principles. Defects of organic acid, pyruvate, and ketone body metabolism that present with acute acidosis are reviewed. Flowcharts for identifying the underlying cause and initiating life-saving therapy are provided. By evaluating electrolytes, blood sugar, lactate, ammonia, and urine ketones, the provider can determine the likelihood of an inborn error of metabolism. Freezing serum, plasma, and urine samples during the acute presentation for definitive diagnostic testing at the provider's convenience aids in the differential diagnosis.

### Glyxambi [^1174HhCj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, empagliflozin, a component of Glyxambi, significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo, and fatal ketoacidosis has occurred with empagliflozin. Glyxambi is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Glyxambi.

- **Precipitating conditions**: Contributors to diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

- **Signs and symptoms**: These are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typical.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^115sDkrf]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

A total of 273 unique patient records were identified and reviewed for inclusion. Reasons for exclusion included: no inpatient or emergency room admission for DKA (249 cases) and not on SGLT2i prior to admission (13 cases). The remaining 11 cases were analyzed for this study.

Data for the 11 cases are summarized in Table 1. Patients with type 2 diabetes tended to be older and have more comorbidities than those with type 1. Among all patients, the average time to resolve DKA, as defined by closure of the anion gap (AG), was 37.8 hours. The ICU stay averaged 4.5 days, and the total length of stay was 9.5 days.

- **Prolonged ICU courses and glucosuria**: Our investigation reveals a subset of six patients who had prolonged ICU courses of four or more days, were on an IV insulin infusion for over 40 hours, had glucosuria for at least 3 days following admission, and in three cases, had relapse of DKA while admitted. Glucosuria persisted for up to 10 days after discontinuing the SGLT2i despite adequate glycemic control in most cases, suggesting that glucosuria is evidence of continued drug action.

For one case (#5), urine glucose concentration was quantified during hospitalization (see Figure 1) and demonstrated significant elevation of urine glucose for several days after discontinuation of the drug despite normal plasma glucose levels. Of note, two cases (#7 and #8) had recently initiated a ketogenic diet.

Table 1
Clinical data for patients admitted with DKA in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use

Urine and plasma glucose concentration for patient 5

Our study suggests not only that the time to close the anion gap may be longer in cases involving SGLT2 inhibitors, but also highlights the interplay between prolonged glucosuria and the relapse of DKA.

- **Urine ketones**:

	- **Preanalytical**: The concentrations of ketones in the urine of healthy individuals are below the detection limits of commercially available testing materials. False-positive results have been reported with highly colored urine and in the presence of several sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine test reagents deteriorate with exposure to air, giving false-negative readings; therefore, testing materials should be stored in tightly sealed containers and discarded after the expiration date on the manufacturer's label. False-negative readings have also been reported with highly acidic urine samples, such as after large intakes of ascorbic acid. Loss of ketones from urine attributable to microbial action can also cause false-negative readings. Because acetone is a highly volatile substance, samples should be kept in a closed container. For point-of-care analyses in medical facilities and for patients in the home setting, control materials (that give both negative and positive readings) are not commercially available but would be desirable to ensure accuracy of test results.

	- **Analytical**: Several assay principles have been described. The most commonly used is the colorimetric reaction that occurs between AcAc and nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide) to produce a purple color. This method is widely available in the form of dipsticks and tablets and is used to measure ketones in both the urine and blood (either serum or plasma). Several manufacturers offer dipsticks for measuring glucose and ketones.

### Jardiance [^1113QQiV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Jardiance significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo, and fatal ketoacidosis has occurred with Jardiance. Jardiance is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including Jardiance.

- **Precipitating conditions**: Conditions such as under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse can precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis or other forms of ketoacidosis.

- **Signs and symptoms**: These are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: β-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^115AoRxm]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate identification of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is critical but is complicated by the fact that DKA only affects a small percentage of the total number of patients with hyperglycemia. Clinical practice in the emergency department involves screening hyperglycemic patients with a urine dipstick for ketones and conducting a laboratory evaluation for DKA on patients whose results screen positive.

Although the urine dipstick is easily accessible, inexpensive, rapid, and has excellent sensitivity for DKA, its poor specificity (estimated at < 50%) results in a large number of false-positive tests and unnecessary work-ups. This has led the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to discourage using the urine dipstick and encourage using serum ketones for DKA screening. The development of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) devices has made following these ADA recommendations feasible in the emergency department. The goal of this prospective study was to compare the test characteristics of a point-of-care β-OHB meter with the urine dipstick for screening for DKA at emergency-department triage.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^115XfTJk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

To address the limitations associated with approaches to ketone testing, we propose the following characteristics for the ideal ketone monitor:

- **Dynamic range**: The device should measure ketones over a relevant dynamic range (we suggest 0‐10 mmol/L) with automated alerts that do not require the user to initiate a measurement.
- **Precision**: Measurements need to be precise, especially at the lower end of the range, to prevent false alerts and alarm fatigue.
- **Display**: The display should remain unobtrusive unless necessary.
- **Integration**: The technology should integrate with the user's usual glucose-management system to eliminate the need for an additional device. For example, ketone levels and trend information could be displayed on a smartphone or insulin pump screen.

Ideally, the device should minimize discomfort and the psychological, financial, and physical burdens on the user while maintaining reliability and durability. A further level of refinement, while not essential, could include instructions regarding the most appropriate response to the information provided. Current methods like urine, blood, and breath ketone testing do not meet these criteria; hence, alternative approaches should be explored.

### Point-of-care capillary blood ketone measurements and the prediction of future ketoacidosis risk in Type 1 diabetes [^116oyT6h]. Diabetes Care (2023). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Rather than during illness while diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is developing, we aimed to determine if levels of routine point-of-care capillary blood ketones could predict future DKA.

- **Research design and methods**: We examined previously collected data from placebo-assigned participants in an adjunct-to-insulin medication trial program that included measurement of fasted capillary blood ketone levels twice per week in a 2-month baseline period. The outcome was 6- to 12-month trial-adjudicated DKA.

- **Results**: DKA events occurred in 12 of 484 participants at a median of 105 (interquartile range 43, 199) days. Maximum ketone levels were higher in patient cases compared with control patients (0.8 [0.6, 1.2] vs. 0.3 [0.2, 0.7] mmol/L; P = 0.002), with a nonparametric area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66–0.88). Ketone levels ≥ 0.8 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 64%, a specificity of 78%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 2.9 and 0.5, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: This proof of concept that routine capillary ketone surveillance can identify individuals at high risk of future DKA implies a role for future technologies including continuous ketone monitoring.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: β-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^111GPjM9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) using a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, we compared the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis with the urine dipstick.

- **Research design and methods**: Emergency-department patients with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL underwent urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

- **Results**: Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB had a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

- **Conclusions**: Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6% vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Breath acetone is a reliable indicator of ketosis in adults consuming ketogenic meals [^112ZueNY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Ketogenic diets are used therapeutically to treat intractable seizures. Clinically, it appears that the maintenance of ketosis is crucial to the efficacy of the diet in ameliorating seizures. To understand how ketosis and seizure protection are related, a reliable, noninvasive measure of ketosis that can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort is needed.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine which index, breath acetone or urinary acetoacetate, is more strongly related to the plasma ketones acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

- **Design**: After fasting overnight for 12 hours, 12 healthy adults consumed 4 ketogenic meals over 12 hours. Blood, breath, and urine samples were collected hourly. Blood was analyzed for plasma acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, breath for acetone, and urine for acetoacetate.

- **Results**: By the end of the 12-hour dietary treatment, plasma acetoacetate, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and breath acetone had increased 3.5-fold, whereas urinary acetoacetate increased 13-fold when measured enzymatically and 25-fold when measured with urinary ketone dipsticks. Plasma acetoacetate was best predicted by breath acetone (R² = 0.70, P < 0.0001). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate was equally predicted by breath acetone and urinary acetoacetate (R² = 0.54, P = 0.0040).

- **Conclusions**: Breath acetone is as good a predictor of ketosis as urinary acetoacetate. Breath acetone analysis is noninvasive and can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort to patients. As an indicator of ketosis in epilepsy patients consuming a ketogenic diet, breath acetone is valuable.

### Preventing diabetic ketoacidosis [^111APJLn]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This article examines the factors associated with DKA in children with T1DM, both at first presentation and in recurrent cases. The challenge for future research is to find effective ways to improve primary care physician and general community awareness of T1DM to reduce DKA at presentation and develop practical, cost-effective programs to reduce recurring DKA.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^115uU7Uc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Blood ketones**: Serum/plasma ketones can be measured with the tablets or dipsticks routinely used for urine ketone measurements. Although samples can be diluted with saline to "titer" the ketone concentration, usually reported as "positive at a 1/x dilution", βHBA, the predominant ketone body in DKA, is not detected as with urine ketone testing.

For specific βHBA measurements, sample requirements differ among methods. In general, blood samples can be collected into tubes containing heparin, EDTA, fluoride, citrate, or oxalate. Ascorbic acid interferes with some assay methods. AcAc also interferes with some assay methods unless the samples are highly dilute. Sample stability differs among methods, but whole-blood samples are generally stable at 4°C for up to 24 hours. Serum/plasma samples remain stable for up to 1 week at 4°C and for at least several weeks at −20°C, although long-term stability data are not available for most assay methods.

- **Analytical**: Several different assay methods, including colorimetric, gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and enzymatic, have been described for blood ketones, including specific measurement of βHBA. Enzymatic methods appear to be the most widely used for the quantification of βHBA for routine clinical management. The principle of the enzymatic methods is that β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, in the presence of NAD+, converts βHBA to AcAc and NADH. Under alkaline conditions (pH 8.5–9.5), the reaction favors the formation of AcAc from βHBA. The NADH produced can be quantified.

### Jardiance [^114mmSiF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, consider ketone monitoring in other individuals at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who exhibit signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Jardiance, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Patients should be monitored for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Jardiance.

Withhold Jardiance, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Jardiance when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis. Instruct patients to discontinue Jardiance and seek medical attention immediately if these signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Jardiance can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Jardiance. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Jardiance in patients with one or more of these characteristics, caution is advised.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis following traumatic brain injury [^112twAqq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower glucose levels by reducing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, which can lead to ketogenesis. Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of SGLT2 inhibitors that can be triggered by trauma. However, the absence of significant hyperglycemia can delay its diagnosis and treatment, which may lead to detrimental consequences. Herein, we report a case of euglycemic DKA following traumatic brain injury in a patient with type 2 diabetes who was taking an SGLT2 inhibitor. Delayed recognition of euglycemic DKA in this case led to progressive metabolic deterioration. This report emphasizes the importance of promptly suspecting, diagnosing, and treating euglycemic DKA in patients with traumatic injuries who exhibit high anion-gap metabolic acidosis, ketonuria, and glucosuria — even if they do not have significant hyperglycemia.

### Key European guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with phenylketonuria [^1158zrd7]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for phenylketonuria, specifically with respect to clinical and laboratory follow-up, the ESPKU 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining an annual nutritional review with clinical examination. This should include the measurement of weight, height, and BMI, as well as laboratory assessments covering plasma amino acids, plasma homocysteine or MMA, hemoglobin, MCV, and ferritin, in all patients on a low phenylalanine diet or those self-restricting high-protein foods. Consider assessing other micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals including calcium, zinc, and selenium, or hormones like PTH if clinically indicated.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^116JHDXY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Inpatient therapy for SGLT2i‐related DKA must prioritize adequate insulin and dextrose administration, independent of serum glucose concentrations, due to ongoing glucosuria even after metabolic acidosis resolves. Monitoring urine glucose concentration can assist in assessing the risk of DKA relapse in this context. A larger, prospective multicenter study comparing patients with DKA on SGLT2i to a control group of DKA without SGLT2i — focusing on urine glucose concentrations and other relevant clinical factors — is necessary to establish recommended monitoring and management strategies. Guidelines for treating SGLT2i‐related DKA should acknowledge that patient characteristics and progression may differ from classical DKA, requiring vigilance to prevent relapse and prolonged hospitalization.

### Inborn errors of ketogenesis and ketone body utilization [^116oKfK7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Ketone bodies, including acetoacetate and 3-hydroxy-n-butyric acid, are metabolites derived from fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids such as leucine. They are primarily produced in the liver through reactions catalyzed by the ketogenic enzymes mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase. After prolonged starvation, ketone bodies can provide up to two-thirds of the brain's energy requirements.

- **Mechanism of ketone body utilization**: The rate-limiting enzyme of ketone body utilization (ketolysis) is succinyl-coenzyme A:3-oxoacid coenzyme A transferase. The subsequent step of ketolysis is catalyzed by 2-methylacetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase, which is also involved in isoleucine catabolism.

- **Inborn errors and clinical outcomes**: Inborn errors of metabolism affecting those four enzymes are presented and discussed in the context of differential diagnoses. Disorders of ketogenesis can present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, whereas inborn errors of ketolysis are characterized by metabolic decompensations with ketoacidosis. If these diseases are considered early and appropriate treatment is initiated without delay, patients with inborn errors of ketone body metabolism often have a good clinical outcome.

### Update on measuring ketones [^116xm6bK]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Low credibility.

Ketone bodies are an energy substrate produced by the liver and used during states of low carbohydrate availability, such as fasting or prolonged exercise. High ketone concentrations can be present with insulin insufficiency and are a key finding in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). During states of insulin deficiency, lipolysis increases, and a flood of circulating free fatty acids is converted in the liver into ketone bodies — mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate.

During DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone in blood. As DKA resolves, beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which becomes the predominant ketone in the urine. Because of this lag, a urine ketone test might be increasing even as DKA is resolving. Point-of-care tests are available for self-testing of blood ketones and urine ketones through measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, which are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Acetone forms through spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate and can be measured in exhaled breath, but currently, no device is FDA-cleared for this purpose. Recently, technology has been announced for measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate in interstitial fluid.

Measurement of ketones can be helpful to assess compliance with low carbohydrate diets; assessment of acidosis associated with alcohol use, in conjunction with SGLT2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, both of which can increase the risk of DKA; and to identify DKA due to insulin deficiency. This article reviews the challenges and shortcomings of ketone testing in diabetes.

### Steglujan [^114PixxV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and other ketoacidosis**: In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Steglujan significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses. Steglujan is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

	- Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g. history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors.

	- Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

	- Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for four days.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^115x4jMq]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The connection between low carbohydrate diets and reductions in body water composition has been previously documented. Under physiological conditions, ketones are not present to an appreciable degree in urine in either the postprandial or overnight fasting state. Yet, once a ketogenic diet is initiated, the presence of urinary ketones may be detectable within two days. Furthermore, in some individuals undergoing a very-low-carbohydrate diet, the amount of urinary ketones measured during the first three days of a fast was found to be proportional to the amount of natriuresis observed. Other studies have similarly shown that decreases in total body, intracellular, and extracellular water were correlated with the greatest levels of ketosis during ketogenic diets. Therefore, it is likely that the initiation of a ketogenic diet results in an osmotic polyuria driven by elevations in serum and urinary ketones. Furthermore, it is likely that the increased natriuresis is sufficient to change body water composition, although the clinical significance and mechanism by which this occurs are not fully known. At the time of this publication, it is also not fully known to what extent different ketogenic diets may induce polyuria in pediatric versus adult populations. Increased metabolic demands in pediatric populations and significant variation in the different types of low carbohydrate diets likely complicate this factor, and further work on this topic is required.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^114QEcyy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

- **Blood testing for ketones**: Best practice in Australia advises that ketone levels should be checked on finger-prick capillary blood using a handheld meter and ketone testing strips. Blood ketone testing measures β-hydroxybutyrate, which constitutes the major circulating ketone body. There is no clear consensus in the literature regarding thresholds of blood ketone levels that should be considered significantly elevated. In general, levels below 1.0–1.5 mmol/L are considered to exclude diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), while those above 2.5–3.0 mmol/L suggest the diagnosis or indicate when an urgent medical review should be obtained.

	- Blood testing for ketones has greater sensitivity and specificity for DKA than urine testing. A blood sample is usually readily available, and because it provides a measurement quickly, it minimizes delays in diagnosis. Although ketone meters may vary in their accuracy depending on their manufacturer, these devices generally represent mature technology. Many combine blood glucose and ketone testing, meaning that an additional device is not required. Conversely, ketone meters and their blood strips are expensive. Ketone strips have a short shelf-life, typically 12 months, and testing is painful and involves blood exposure. As with urine ketone measurements, interfering substances may impact specificity.

- **Real-world experience with ketone testing options**: Although there is evidence that continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provision has resulted in a reduction in DKA, this is probably because insulin has been administered.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116cdNdL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The standard management of established DKA has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin, and addressing precipitating factors, all of which should occur in a hospital environment where the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters, who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances, to late presenters, who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid–base balance, volume status, and electrolyte abnormalities, requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery, and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires that the person recognizes that they are at an increased risk of DKA and proactively initiates a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and thirst occur late, and hyperglycemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

### Bedside detection of urine beta-hydroxybutyrate in diagnosing metabolic acidosis [^114YBuYr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The rapid identification of the etiology of metabolic acidosis (MA) is critically important but can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Alcoholic, starvation, and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (AKA, SKA, and DKA, respectively) may produce beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) in marked excess of acetone (ACET) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Unfortunately, urine dipstick technology poorly detects ACET and cannot measure BOHB. The inability to detect BOHB might delay therapy for ketoacidoses or provoke unnecessary evaluation or empiric treatment of other causes of MA, such as toxic alcohol poisoning. The authors tested the assertion that commonly available hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) would improve BOHB detection. The effectiveness of alkalinization and use of a silver nitrate (AgNO₃) catalyst was also assessed.

- **Methods**: Control and urine test specimens containing from 0.5 to 800 mmol/L ACET, AcAc, and BOHB were prepared. Urine specimens were oxidized with H₂O₂ (3%) at a 1:9 ratio (H₂O₂:urine), alkalinized with potassium hydroxide (KOH; 10%), exposed to AgNO₃ sticks, or altered with a combination of these methods in a random fashion. Three emergency physicians (EPs) blinded to the preparation technique evaluated urine dipsticks (Multistix, Bayer Corp.) placed in the specimens for "ketones".

- **Results**: Multistix detected AcAc appropriately; ACET was detected only at high concentrations of ≥ 600 mmol/L. Multistix failed to measure BOHB at all concentrations tested. H₂O₂ improved urinary BOHB detection, although not to clinically relevant levels (40 mmol/L).

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116414cU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Although not widely available clinically, ketones can also be measured by breath testing. The predominant ketone measured is acetone, which is volatile and exhaled. Advantages include the painless assessment of ketone levels and no necessity for blood exposure or urine collection. Additionally, changes in acetone are dynamic and may provide an early signal of change in a person's metabolic state. Conversely, breath ketone meters are expensive; the test needs to be user‐initiated, and the person is required to carry an additional device.

A proof‐of‐concept study evaluating a breath ketone analyser (Ketonix, Varberg, Sweden) in 10 adults and nine children with T1D concluded that the device could be used to rule out ketosis in adults, but not in children. However, in general, there is a lack of an evidence base for the accuracy and dynamic range of these devices for those with T1D because they have generally been developed for those pursuing ketogenic diets instead of for medical use.

### Sick day management using blood 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) compared with urine ketone monitoring reduces hospital visits in young people with T1DM: a randomized clinical trial [^116LErv3]. Diabetic Medicine (2006). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening acute complication of Type 1 diabetes, may be preventable with frequent monitoring of glycaemia and ketosis along with timely supplemental insulin. This prospective, two-centre study assessed sick day management using blood 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) monitoring compared with traditional urine ketone testing, aimed at averting emergency assessment and hospitalization.

One hundred and twenty-three children, adolescents, and young adults aged 3–22 years and their families received sick day education. Participants were randomized to receive either a blood glucose monitor that also measures blood 3-OHB (blood ketone group, n = 62) or a monitor plus urine ketone strips (urine ketone group, n = 61). All were encouraged to check glucose levels ≥ 3 times daily and to check ketones during acute illness or stress, when glucose levels were consistently elevated (≥ 13.9 mmol/l on two consecutive readings), or when symptoms of DKA were present. Frequency of sick days, hyperglycaemia, ketosis, and hospitalization/emergency assessment were ascertained prospectively for 6 months.

There were 578 sick days during 21,548 days of follow-up. Participants in the blood ketone group checked ketones significantly more during sick days (276 of 304 episodes, 90.8%) than participants in the urine ketone group (168 of 274 episodes, 61.3%) (P < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalization/emergency assessment was significantly lower in the blood ketone group (38/100 patient-years) compared with the urine ketone group (75/100 patient-years).

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^1141ZnRR]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering medications that increase the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption and promote glucosuria. Treatment with these agents raises serum ketone levels, and cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during therapy have been reported. The duration of glucosuria and the inpatient course of SGLT2i-related DKA, however, are not well characterized. We report 11 inpatient cases of SGLT2i-related DKA, including a subset of patients who experienced prolonged glucosuria and relapse of DKA during their hospitalization.

### Farxiga [^112adUHE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Farxiga, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for the resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Farxiga.

Withhold Farxiga, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis and resume Farxiga when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Farxiga and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Farxiga can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Farxiga. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or those on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Farxiga in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function.

### Mesnex [^112CTDSo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Laboratory test interferences**: A false-positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with Mesnex when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). Mesnex may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This interference may result in a falsely low CPK level. Additionally, Mesnex may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid.

- **Use in patients with a history of adverse reactions to thiol compounds**: Mesnex is a thiol compound, i.e. a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Mesnex.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: β-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^117PnUxn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, we compared the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis with the urine dipstick.

- **Research design and methods**: Emergency-department patients with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL had urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

- **Results**: Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB had a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

- **Conclusions**: Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6 vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^117JvfCe]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The rationale behind the use of a continuous ketone monitor (CKM) in an ambulatory setting is to pre-empt diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) rather than to recognize and manage the fully established condition. In support of this approach, Song et al. reported that maximum fasted blood ketone levels of 0.8 mmol/L or higher, as determined by point-of-care testing, predicted future DKA.

It should also be noted that in the EASE, DEPICT, and TANDEM studies, levels of up to 0.8–1.0 mmol/L were not uncommon. Indeed, these minor elevations in ketones may provide part of the protective effect of SGLT inhibitor therapies. Therefore, we suggest that responses to CKM data should be initiated early at ketone levels of either 1.0 or 1.5 mmol/L, as levels below these thresholds effectively exclude DKA. Conversely, ketone levels of more than 3.0 mmol/L are consistent with a diagnosis of DKA. Levels between 1.5 and 3.0 mmol/L represent an intermediate 'transition zone' providing a window of opportunity to avert DKA.

It should be noted that until these CKM devices are approved for non‐adjunctive use, confirmation with a finger-prick ketone measurement is recommended.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^114Y6xhZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a significant acute life-threatening complication of diabetes, predominantly seen in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and less commonly in those with type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is typically characterized as a metabolic state where the glucose concentration at presentation exceeds 11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) or the individual has a prior diagnosis of diabetes. In such cases, a plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 3.0 mmol/L or higher, or urine ketones greater than 2+ on a standard urine ketone test-stick, and a pH less than 7.3, or a serum bicarbonate under 15.0 mmol/L, is observed. It should be noted that blood glucose levels may not always be elevated in DKA, a condition known as euglycemic ketoacidosis.

DKA arises from a relative or absolute deficiency in circulating insulin, coupled with elevated glucagon levels. These factors promote the uncontrolled release of free fatty acids, which are then converted into ketone bodies, leading to an anion gap acidosis. Acetoacetate, the primary ketone body, is enzymatically converted to β-hydroxybutyrate, the predominant circulating ketone body, and non-enzymatically to acetone, which is exhaled. The reduced peripheral uptake of glucose, alongside increased endogenous glucose production, results in significant hyperglycemia and dehydration. The metabolic acidosis, hypovolemia, electrolyte disturbances, and hyperosmolar state trigger a counter-regulatory hormone response, which heightens insulin resistance and ketogenesis, further aggravating the metabolic disturbance and contributing to a downward spiral.

### Peri-operative management of the surgical patient with diabetes 2015: Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland [^1113b9YX]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The patient should be checked for ketonaemia (> 3.0 mmol.l −1) or significant ketonuria (> 2+ on urine sticks) if the CBG exceeds 12 mmol.l −1. If the patient has DKA and requires emergency surgery, the involvement of senior multidisciplinary input from intensivists, anaesthetists, surgeons, and diabetologists should be considered to agree on optimal peri-operative management. Operating on a patient with DKA carries significant mortality and should be avoided if at all possible.

- **Discussion points**:
	- The requirement for surgery, because DKA can be associated with abdominal pain (negative laparotomies have been reported)
	- The area in which the patient should be resuscitated before theatre
	- Whether saline 0.9% with pre-mixed potassium chloride or Hartmann's solution should be the main resuscitation fluid
	- Whether a VRIII or a fixed-rate infusion should be used to treat DKA in theatre
	- The area in which the patient will be recovered after surgery

Recent guidelines and evidence suggest that a fixed-rate intravenous insulin infusion is superior to a VRIII in treating DKA in a ward environment. However, use of a fixed-rate infusion is associated with hypoglycaemia and requires administration of glucose 20% if the CBG is under 14 mmol.l −1. Early involvement of the diabetes inpatient specialist team should be sought.

If possible, long-acting insulins (Levemir, Lantus, Tresiba) should be continued in all patients at 80% of the usual dose. This is to avoid rebound hyperglycaemia when intravenous insulin is stopped.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^115iVi1a]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

- **Background**: The study examines the potential side effects of using SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes, specifically focusing on prolonged glucosuria and the relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Methodology**: Data was collected and analyzed to understand the relationship between SGLT2-inhibitor therapy and the prolonged excretion of glucose in urine, as well as instances of diabetic ketoacidosis relapse.

- **Results**: The findings suggest a correlation between the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and prolonged glucosuria, which may contribute to a relapse in diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Conclusion**: It is crucial for healthcare providers to monitor patients on SGLT2 inhibitors for signs of prolonged glucosuria and potential ketoacidosis relapses. Further research is needed to establish guidelines for the safe use of these medications in diabetes management.

### Diagnostic accuracy of fingerstick β-hydroxybutyrate for ketonuria in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting [^116k4dB6]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a rapid, fingerstick β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) test predicts ketonuria in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting.

A convenience sample of 82 pregnant women who presented to the Barnes-Jewish Hospital emergency department (ED) with complaints of nausea or vomiting were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved, prospective, observational study. Exclusion criteria included a temperature of > 38.3°C, altered mental status, prisoners, and > 1 L of any intravenous (IV) fluid before screening. Subjects underwent fingerstick β-OHB tests, with results reported in increments of 0.1 mmol/L. Urine ketone results were made available once reported as part of standard care and varied from 0 (trace) to +4 values. Ketonuria was defined as a urine ketone value of 3+ or 4+ and was analyzed as a dichotomous, categorical variable. A contingency table and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve were constructed for comparing the β-OHB values to those urine ketone values for each patient.

Mean (± SD) β-OHB was 0.43 (± 0.52) mmol/L, and median urine was 1+ for the cohort as a whole. The area under the ROC curve equaled 0.95. The sensitivity and specificity for a fingerstick test of > 0.45 mmol/L were 89 and 94.5%, respectively. The positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 16, and the negative LR was 0.12.

Fingerstick β-OHB is a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool that correlates well with ketonuria and identifies ketonemia in pregnant women with nausea and vomiting.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116bcBjA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Urine testing for ketones is a method that has been available for a long time; it is relatively inexpensive and painless, does not require the user to carry a meter, and involves minimal technical skill to implement. However, many patients prefer to avoid doing urine tests. The color-coded, strip-based test uses a nitroprusside reaction, which provides a semiquantitative measure of acetoacetate and, with some brands, acetone. The test represents an average of ketones excreted in the urine since the last void, which may delay recognition of impending diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or its resolution.

Importantly, with treatment, the circulating pool of β-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which may cause urine ketone readings to rise while blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations are falling. The paradoxical increase in urinary acetoacetate gives the false impression that the condition is not improving. In addition, acetoacetate accounts for approximately only 20% of circulating ketone bodies, impacting the sensitivity of urine testing.

False positive results can result from highly pigmented urine and interfering substances, including levodopa and drugs that are present in the blood and/or excreted in the urine as free-sulfhydryl compounds. Finally, it requires the person to recognize an increased risk of DKA to then initiate testing. This may be difficult because of oliguria from dehydration and acute renal failure, or in the absence of a private environment where a urine sample may be obtained.

### Controversies around the measurement of blood ketones to diagnose and manage diabetic ketoacidosis [^111aUKuC]. Diabetes Care (2022). Low credibility.

The measurement of blood ketones, in preference to urine ketones, has become a well-established tool in the diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, there remains considerable disparity between diabetes guidelines regarding if, how, and when this test should be used. Recent guidelines mainly emphasize blood measurement, yet several issues persist. Many laboratories still measure blood ketones using a semiquantitative test that does not measure the predominant ketone, β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), which may hinder patient management. Even when BOHB is measured, the evidence for cutoffs used in DKA diagnosis or exclusion is limited, while its use in gauging severity, treatment progress, and resolution is not fully clear. Lastly, although employing point-of-care meters instead of a laboratory for BOHB measurement offers undeniable benefits, this approach has its own challenges. This article provides a perspective on these topics to complement recommendations and suggests how future research may improve its use in the DKA context.

### Prolonged diabetic ketoacidosis associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: A review of postmarketing cases [^115fnp2D]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe reported cases of prolonged or relapsed ketoacidosis (KA) in adults with type 2 diabetes receiving treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

- **Methods**: We performed a search of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System and medical literature to identify our case series and to characterize cases of prolonged KA, relapsed KA, or persistent ketonemia, persistent ketonuria, and/or persistent glucosuria in adults receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.

- **Results**: The FDA identified 29 unique cases of prolonged or relapsed KA, as well as related terms persistent ketonemia, persistent ketonuria, and persistent glucosuria, in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors through July 26, 2022. The patients ranged in age from 26 to 85 years. Treatment duration of KA ranged from 3 to 20 days. There were 7 cases of relapsed KA when insulin was reduced or transitioned to subcutaneous route. Arterial pH value was 7.0 or below in 4 patients, and the median pH was 7.1. Associated factors for prolonged or relapsed KA included surgery, decreased caloric intake, and ketogenic/carbohydrate-restricted diet. A total of 62% of the patients were taking 3 or more glycemic control medications, including the SGLT2 inhibitor. All patients with sufficient follow-up information recovered.

- **Conclusion**: Although KA is a well-known risk associated with SGLT2 inhibitors, this case series demonstrated the potential for prolonged or relapsed KA events with serious outcomes. These cases informed updates to the FDA's prescribing information to improve patient safety.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^116BDf8b]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The origins of the ketogenic diet date back to the early 1920s when a series of publications proposed that very low-carbohydrate diets were effective in the management of pediatric epilepsy. The "ketogenic diet", as coined by Dr. Wilder at the Mayo Clinic, became a mainstay in the treatment of epilepsy in the 1920s–1930s, replacing the use of periodic starvation to induce ketosis in epileptic patients. The early ketogenic diet was defined as 1 g of protein per kg of body weight per day, 10–15 g of total carbohydrates per day, with the remainder of the diet consisting of fats.

Following the discovery of antiepileptic drugs, the use of ketogenic diets for the treatment of epilepsy significantly decreased, and today it is typically reserved for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Recently, the use of very low carbohydrate diets has been implicated in the treatment of various medical conditions beyond epilepsy and has become a central component of various diets aimed at promoting weight loss. Among the carbohydrate-restricted diets intended for weight loss, the most well-known is the Atkins diet.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^111FNs5s]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Polyuria refers to the excessive production of urine, generally defined as greater than 2000 mL/m²/24h in the pediatric population. It is differentiated from urinary frequency, which is the increased need to urinate without excessive urine volume production. While urinary frequency is a relatively common phenomenon in children, often occurring in the setting of lower genito-urinary tract infections, the causes of polyuria in pediatric patients are less common and require prompt recognition and diagnosis. Polyuria frequently presents in the setting of underlying conditions that result in either a water diuresis or solute diuresis.

The differential diagnosis for new-onset polyuria in the pediatric population includes diabetes mellitus, central diabetes insipidus, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, in addition to other less common metabolic, endocrine, renal, and psychological causes.

### Blood β-hydroxybutyrate vs. urine acetoacetate testing for the prevention and management of ketoacidosis in type 1 diabetes: A systematic review [^112H9My1]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of Type 1 diabetes. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is now widely available as an alternative to urine acetoacetate testing for detecting ketosis. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of capillary or serum β-hydroxybutyrate compared with urine acetoacetate testing in the prevention and management of diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were searched until April 2012, with no language restrictions, for studies in humans comparing the effectiveness of blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine acetoacetate testing. Outcomes examined included prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis, time to recovery, healthcare costs, and patient or caregiver satisfaction. Additional sources included reference lists, conference proceedings, and contact with experts in the field.

- **Results**: Four studies (two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies) met eligibility criteria, including 299 participants across 11 centers. Risk of bias was low to moderate. Blood ketone testing, compared with urine testing, was associated with reduced frequency of hospitalization (one study), reduced time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis (three studies), cost benefits (one study), and greater satisfaction (one study, intervention group only). No study assessed the prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. Meta-analysis could not be performed due to heterogeneity in study design and published data.

- **Conclusions**: There is evidence suggesting the potential benefits of blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing over urine acetoacetate testing in specific outcomes related to diabetic ketoacidosis management.

### Ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis in response to SGLT2 inhibitors: Basic mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives [^114jc5ss]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Inhibitors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2 are a new class of antihyperglycemic drugs approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These drugs inhibit glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidney, thereby enhancing glucosuria and lowering blood glucose levels. Additional consequences and benefits include a reduction in body weight, uric acid levels, and blood pressure. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibition can have protective effects on the kidney and cardiovascular system in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk. However, a potential side effect reported with SGLT2 inhibitors, particularly during off-label use in patients with type 1 diabetes, is diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration recently warned that SGLT2 inhibitors may result in euglycemic ketoacidosis.

We review the basic metabolism of ketone bodies, the triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis, and potential mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors may facilitate the development of ketosis or ketoacidosis. This provides the rationale for measures to lower the risk. We discuss the role of the kidney and potential links to renal gluconeogenesis and uric acid handling. Moreover, we outline potential beneficial effects of modestly elevated ketone body levels on organ function that may have therapeutic relevance for the observed beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the kidney and cardiovascular system.

### Steglatro [^114yDprM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Steglatro, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Steglatro.

Withhold Steglatro, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Steglatro when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Steglatro and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Lower limb amputation**:

	- In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, the occurrence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 4.7, 5.7, and 6.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, Steglatro 5 mg, and Steglatro 15 mg treatment arms, respectively. Amputation of the toe and foot were most frequent (81 out of 109 patients with lower limb amputations). Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both lower limbs. Lower limb infections, gangrene, and diabetic foot ulcers were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation.

### Phenylketonuria [^113FrQB5]. The Lancet (2010). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on phenylketonuria:

- **Definition**: Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the PAH gene, resulting in a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.

- **Pathophysiology**: Phenylketonuria is caused by a mutation in the PAH gene, most commonly a missense mutation, leading to a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting phenylalanine into tyrosine. The deficiency results in the accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the body, causing brain dysfunction if untreated. In classic phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is absent or significantly reduced, while in mild phenylketonuria or mild hyperphenylalaninemia, partial enzymatic activity is preserved. This accumulation triggers several biochemical changes involved in brain damage pathogenesis, including reduced activity of pyruvate kinase, HMG-CoA reductase, and monoamine oxidase B. Additionally, impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission and hypomyelination may occur.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of phenylketonuria is estimated at 1 in 15,000 live births in the United States and 1 in 100,000 live births in Europe.

- **Disease course**: Phenylketonuria is typically detected through newborn screening, which allows for early intervention. If left untreated, it can lead to seizures, eczema, intellectual disability, behavioral disturbances with autistic traits, parkinsonism, a musty body odor, and reduced skin and hair pigmentation.

The prognosis and comprehensive risk assessment of untreated phenylketonuria, along with detailed management strategies, remain essential areas for ongoing research and clinical focus.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^115jR868]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication usually affecting people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and, less commonly, people with type 2 diabetes. Early identification of ketosis is a cornerstone in DKA prevention and management. Methods for ketone measurement by people with diabetes include capillary blood or urine testing. These approaches have limitations, including the need to carry testing strips that have a limited shelf life and a requirement for the user to initiate a test.

Recent studies have shown the feasibility of continuous ketone monitoring (CKM) via interstitial fluid with a sensor inserted subcutaneously, employing an enzymatic electrochemical reaction. Ketone readings can be updated every 5 minutes. In the future, one would expect that commercialized devices will incorporate alarms linked with standardized thresholds and trend arrows. Ideally, to minimize the burden on users, CKM functionality should be integrated with other devices used to implement glucose management, including continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps.

We suggest CKM provision to all at risk of DKA and recommend that the devices should be worn continuously. Those who may particularly benefit are individuals who have T1D, are pregnant, on medications such as sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT) inhibitors that increase DKA risk, people with recurrent DKA (reDKA), those with T1D undertaking high-intensity exercise, are socially or geographically isolated, or those on low carbohydrate diets. The provision of ketone profiles will provide important clinical insights.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis: A potential complication of treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition [^114EzAFr]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the most recently approved antihyperglycemic medications. We sought to describe their association with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) in hopes of enhancing recognition of this potentially life-threatening complication.

- **Research design and methods**: Cases identified incidentally are described.

- **Results**: We identified 13 episodes of SGLT-2 inhibitor-associated euDKA or ketosis in nine individuals, seven with type 1 diabetes and two with type 2 diabetes, from various practices across the U.S. The absence of significant hyperglycemia in these patients delayed recognition of the emergent nature of the problem by patients and providers.

- **Conclusions**: SGLT-2 inhibitors seem to be associated with euglycemic DKA and ketosis, perhaps due to their noninsulin-dependent glucose clearance, hyperglucagonemia, and volume depletion. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who experience nausea, vomiting, or malaise, or develop a metabolic acidosis in the setting of SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy, should be promptly evaluated for the presence of urine and/or serum ketones. SGLT-2 inhibitors should only be used with great caution, extensive counseling, and close monitoring in the setting of type 1 diabetes.

### Presenting features of idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia [^116YNykK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Idiopathic ketotic hypoglycemia (IKH) is an important cause of emergent hypoglycemia among children. We present a case series of 24 patients with IKH in an effort to provide a clinical description of this disorder. Secondly, we provide a crude lower-bound estimate of the incidence of IKH in an Emergency Department (ED) setting.

The charts of 94 non-diabetic patients presenting to an ED during a period of 64 months with a diagnosis of hypoglycemia, as identified via ICD-9 codes, were reviewed. Eleven patients, accounting for 24.4% of all significant hypoglycemic episodes unrelated to diabetes in children over 6 months of age, were diagnosed with IKH. These patients accounted for 31.4% of hypoglycemic episodes among previously healthy children older than 6 months. A further review of 13 individuals with IKH identified from an endocrinology specialty clinic was also performed.

Among all 24 individuals identified with IKH, the mean age of presentation was 30.8 months. IKH was found to be the most common cause of hypoglycemia among previously healthy ED patients during childhood. In our series, patients with IKH presented initially before 5 years of age with symptomatic hypoglycemia during the morning hours following a moderate fast. These patients were found to have ketonuria, with symptoms resolving after glucose administration. Patients with IKH were more likely to be Caucasian, male gender, and have a low body weight.

### Hyperketonemia and ketosis increase the risk of complications in type 1 diabetes [^116qnri7]. Free Radical Biology & Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, increased serum ketones can be attributed to several conditions such as pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, hyperthyroidism, breastfeeding, pregnancy, complications of bariatric surgery, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose, glycogen storage disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and starvation ketosis. Additionally, certain medications like valproic acid, aspirin, acetylcysteine, and niacin can lead to increased serum ketones.

### Synjardy [^112B6qW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for three days after discontinuing SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than six days, with some cases up to two weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR.

Withhold SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis. Instruct patients to discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR and seek medical attention immediately if symptoms develop.

### Exploring the clinical utility of blood ketone levels in the emergency department assessment of paediatric patients [^114mDkrT]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Ketonuria, shown in standard urine testing, is a frequent finding in children presenting to emergency departments. With the advancement of hand-held ketone meters, blood ketone levels can now be rapidly quantified.

- **Hypothesis**: Point of care testing (POCT) of blood ketone levels could provide clinically useful information on the severity of illness in children and the risk of hospital admission.

- **Methods**: A prospective study using POCT of blood ketone levels in a convenience sample of children found that a level of 1.2 mmol/l has a positive predictive value of 66.7% for admission. Ketone levels correlated well with decreased oral intake (R² = 0.25; p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: A strong association was found between ketone levels, decreased oral intake, and fever. Although ketone levels do not correlate well with more traditional markers of illness severity, they can help.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116VmA14]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The integration of continuous ketone monitoring into clinical practice holds significant promise for managing diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders. This emerging technology allows for real-time tracking of ketone levels, providing valuable insights into metabolic processes.

- **Clinical benefits**: Continuous ketone monitoring offers potential advantages over traditional methods. It enables the detection of ketone production patterns that may not be captured with intermittent testing.

- **Patient outcomes**: By facilitating timely interventions, continuous monitoring can potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of ketoacidosis. It empowers patients with more information to manage their conditions effectively.

- **Implementation challenges**: While promising, implementing continuous ketone monitoring requires addressing several challenges, such as device accuracy, cost, and accessibility. Healthcare providers must consider these factors to integrate the technology effectively into patient care strategies.

- **Future directions**: Further research is needed to assess the long-term benefits and economic impact of continuous ketone monitoring. Ongoing studies may reveal additional applications of this technology in various metabolic conditions.

### An unusual case of hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, and increased anion gap acidosis [^117KgwXK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this case report, we illustrate the importance of correct diagnostic reasoning and the misleading features of point-of-care testing. This case shows that even though hyperglycemia, ketonuria, a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis, and acute abdominal pain almost inevitably suggest a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis, other possibilities still exist and need to be excluded. In that light, we emphasize the clinical and therapeutic importance of determining serum lactate and urinary ketones in the differential diagnosis of a raised anion gap metabolic acidosis.

### Dhivy [^116FgpG8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Laboratory tests**: Dhivy may cause a positive Coombs test or a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for the determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result from the use of glucose-oxidase methods for testing glucosuria. Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa-levodopa therapy have been reported. Caution should be exercised when interpreting plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on carbidopa-levodopa therapy.

- **Depression/suicidality**: All patients taking Dhivy should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies.
