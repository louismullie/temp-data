## Question

isnt montelukast a bad medication these days?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether montelukast is a "bad" medication now and how to interpret current guidance and evidence to answer that clinically and safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and boxed warning. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Next, I will review guideline positions for asthma versus allergic rhinitis. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus risks by indication and patient population. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated approach and a bottom-line answer with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory signal. In March 2020, the FDA added a boxed warning for montelukast due to postmarketing reports of serious neuropsychiatric events, including agitation, depression, sleep disturbances, and suicidal ideation or behavior, and emphasized reserving use for allergic rhinitis only when alternatives fail or are not tolerated, while advising clinicians to discuss risks and monitor closely in all patients [^113U9ZkT] [^1131pGbM] [^116DvfPo].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of the neuropsychiatric signal. Controlled trials generally showed low and similar rates of behavior-related adverse events versus placebo, but large observational studies have detected a small but real population-level excess of incident anxiety and insomnia after new montelukast exposure, with absolute risks that are small but potentially meaningful at scale; dechallenge-rechallenge case reports and mechanistic plausibility (CNS penetration) support a causal relationship in susceptible individuals, though confounding by indication remains a concern in observational designs [^113o2ncY] [^116TvfCS] [^1153UJuL] [^116RDMUA].

> I need to check how guidelines position montelukast for asthma. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite the boxed warning, major guidelines still allow montelukast as an alternative controller, particularly when ICS are not feasible or as an add-on in selected patients, but they consistently rank it below ICS-based regimens for efficacy; for example, GINA notes LTRAs are less effective than ICS, especially for preventing exacerbations, and NEJM data show higher treatment failure when stepping down to montelukast compared with continued ICS or ICS-LABA, reinforcing that it is not preferred when ICS can be used [^116Gdqhj] [^113iJXWy] [^112RRAiQ].

> Next, I should review allergic rhinitis guidance. I should double-check that both AAAAI/ACAAI and the FDA explicitly recommend against montelukast as first-line for allergic rhinitis because of limited incremental benefit over safer alternatives and the neuropsychiatric risk; they advise reserving it for patients who fail or cannot tolerate intranasal corticosteroids and/or oral antihistamines, with shared decision-making and explicit counseling about warning signs [^112GXFv1] [^111w4HLn] [^116DvfPo].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. For children, GINA highlights that montelukast is less effective than low-dose ICS and emphasizes counseling families about neurobehavioral adverse effects; for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, it remains an option but should be paired with rescue SABA and not used as chronic EIB prevention; in pregnancy, available human data have not shown a major teratogenic signal, but uncontrolled asthma itself carries maternal-fetal risks, so if a leukotriene is needed, the risk-benefit discussion should incorporate these factors [^111ssVcH] [^1125bwnU] [^115RMid7].

> I will now examine the benefit-risk balance by indication. For asthma, montelukast can still be reasonable when ICS are declined or not tolerated, as an add-on in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, or when adherence to inhaled therapy is a major barrier, but it should not displace ICS as first-line because of inferior control and exacerbation prevention; for allergic rhinitis, the balance is generally unfavorable given safer, more effective options, so it should be a last resort after INCS and second-generation antihistamines fail or are not tolerated [^112RRAiQ] [^112GXFv1] [^114amSGd].

> Hold on, I should verify practical risk-mitigation steps. Prescribers must provide the FDA Medication Guide, counsel patients and caregivers to monitor for mood, behavioral, or sleep changes, and instruct immediate discontinuation and contact if such symptoms occur; this is especially critical in patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, adolescents and young adults, and when treating mild allergic rhinitis where alternatives exist [^1125bwnU] [^113U9ZkT] [^116DvfPo].

> But wait, what if a patient is already on montelukast and doing well — should we stop it? I need to ensure we do not disrupt good control. If there is no history of neuropsychiatric symptoms and the indication is strong (e.g. AERD, ICS intolerance), continuation with ongoing monitoring is reasonable; if the indication is weak (e.g., mild allergic rhinitis), a planned taper with substitution of safer therapy is appropriate, with close follow-up for loss of control [^112GXFv1] [^112RRAiQ].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. Is montelukast "bad"? No — it is not inherently "bad", but its risk-benefit profile has shifted: the neuropsychiatric signal, while uncommon, is serious enough that regulators and guidelines now restrict its role, especially for allergic rhinitis, and position it as a non-preferred alternative for asthma behind ICS-based regimens; with informed consent, careful selection of patients, and active monitoring, it can still be a useful tool, but it should rarely be first-line today [^113U9ZkT] [^116Gdqhj] [^112GXFv1].

> Bottom line: Montelukast is not categorically contraindicated, but current evidence and guidance support avoiding it as first-line therapy, prioritizing ICS-based asthma regimens and intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines for rhinitis, and reserving montelukast for patients who cannot use or have failed preferred therapies, with mandatory counseling, vigilant monitoring for neuropsychiatric symptoms, and a low threshold to discontinue if red flags appear [^112RRAiQ] [^112GXFv1] [^113U9ZkT].

---

Montelukast is not inherently "bad", but its use has been **restricted by the FDA** due to serious neuropsychiatric risks, including suicidal thoughts and aggressive behavior [^113U9ZkT] [^1131pGbM]. It remains an option for asthma when inhaled corticosteroids are not tolerated or as add-on therapy, but it is **no longer first-line for allergic rhinitis** because safer alternatives exist [^112GXFv1] [^111DnuUB]. Clinicians should counsel patients and caregivers about neuropsychiatric symptoms and monitor closely; discontinue immediately if such symptoms occur [^1125bwnU] [^116RDMUA].

---

## Clinical indications and efficacy

Montelukast is **FDA-approved** for the following indications:

- **Asthma**: Prophylaxis and chronic treatment in adults and pediatric patients aged ≥ 2 years [^111bUaH9].
- **Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB)**: Acute prevention in patients aged ≥ 6 years [^111bUaH9].
- **Allergic rhinitis**: Relief of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms, reserved for patients with inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies [^111bUaH9].

Montelukast is effective in managing asthma and allergic rhinitis, but it is **generally less effective than inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)** for asthma control [^116Gdqhj] [^113iJXWy]. It is considered when ICS are not tolerated or as adjunctive therapy in patients who remain symptomatic despite ICS use [^114kVUQz].

---

## Safety concerns and adverse effects

Montelukast has a well-documented safety profile, but **serious neuropsychiatric adverse effects** have emerged as a significant concern:

- **Neuropsychiatric events**: The FDA has issued a boxed warning highlighting serious neuropsychiatric events, including suicidal ideation, depression, agitation, aggression, and sleep disturbances [^113U9ZkT] [^1131pGbM].
- **Incidence**: These events have been reported in patients of all ages, including children and adolescents, and may occur at any time during treatment [^116RDMUA].
- **Mechanism**: The exact mechanism underlying these neuropsychiatric effects is not fully understood, but montelukast has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in animal studies, suggesting a potential direct central nervous system effect [^116RDMUA].

---

## Regulatory actions and guidelines

In response to these safety concerns, the FDA implemented the following **regulatory actions**:

- **Boxed warning**: Added in 2020, emphasizing the risk of serious neuropsychiatric events and advising caution when prescribing montelukast, particularly for allergic rhinitis [^113U9ZkT] [^116DvfPo].
- **Restricted use**: Montelukast is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for allergic rhinitis; it should be reserved for patients who have failed or cannot tolerate alternative treatments [^112GXFv1] [^111w4HLn].
- **Patient counseling**: Healthcare providers are required to inform patients and caregivers about the potential for neuropsychiatric symptoms and to monitor closely during treatment [^1125bwnU] [^117878bQ].

---

## Comparison with alternative therapies

Montelukast is generally **less effective than ICS** for asthma control and is considered inferior to ICS-LABA combinations for preventing exacerbations [^116Gdqhj] [^115u3Yc9]. For allergic rhinitis, intranasal corticosteroids and second-generation antihistamines are preferred due to superior efficacy and a more favorable safety profile [^114sajEd] [^111sJxD2].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patient populations may be at **increased risk** for adverse effects from montelukast:

- **Children and adolescents**: Higher incidence of neuropsychiatric events reported in younger populations [^notfound].
- **Patients with psychiatric history**: Individuals with pre-existing psychiatric conditions may be more susceptible to neuropsychiatric adverse effects [^116TvfCS].
- **Patients with mild disease**: The FDA specifically cautions against montelukast use in patients with mild allergic rhinitis, where the risks may outweigh the benefits [^113U9ZkT] [^116DvfPo].

---

## Clinical recommendations and precautions

Given the potential risks, clinicians should **adhere to the following recommendations**:

- **Careful patient selection**: Use montelukast primarily for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who cannot tolerate or have failed alternative therapies [^notfound].
- **Thorough counseling**: Inform patients and caregivers about the risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms and advise immediate discontinuation if such symptoms occur [^1125bwnU].
- **Regular monitoring**: Closely monitor patients for behavioral changes, mood alterations, and sleep disturbances throughout treatment [^116RDMUA].
- **Alternative therapies**: Consider alternative treatments, such as ICS, ICS-LABA combinations, or biologics, particularly in patients with mild disease or those at higher risk for neuropsychiatric adverse effects [^116Gdqhj] [^117SeEfR].

---

## Conclusion and clinical stance

Montelukast is not inherently "bad", but its use has been significantly restricted due to serious **neuropsychiatric risks**. It remains a viable option for selected patients with **asthma**, particularly when alternative therapies are not tolerated or have failed. However, for allergic rhinitis, **montelukast** should be reserved for patients who have inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies. Clinicians must carefully weigh the risks and benefits, provide thorough patient counseling, and monitor closely for adverse effects.

### The national montelukast survey [^111VV9pz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of montelukast for treating asthma; whether this can be extrapolated to clinical effectiveness in routine practice has yet to be established.

Objective

To examine the use, effectiveness, and tolerability of montelukast in clinical practice for treating asthma and to explore prognostic factors that could predict a favorable response to the drug.

Methods

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study of clinical outcomes seen in patients prescribed montelukast for asthma that used routinely collected clinical information. Data were collected on all consenting patients who had been prescribed montelukast for asthma irrespective of the continuation or duration of treatment. Independent observers, treating physicians, and patients assessed certain outcomes after the initiation of montelukast, including the general asthma response and changes in activity-related symptoms.

Results

Fifty-six centers in the United Kingdom (20 primary care and 36 secondary care) participated. The analysis was based on 1351 eligible patients for whom essential data were available. Eight hundred thirty patients (66.4%; 95% CI, 63.8% to 69.0%) were recorded as having shown an improvement in their asthma control, and 103 (8.2%; 95% CI, 6.8% to 9.9%) experienced a dramatic improvement. The greatest proportion of patients responding was seen in those with mild to moderate asthma. Montelukast was well tolerated; no new adverse events were recorded.

Conclusions

Montelukast is an effective, well-tolerated treatment for asthma in routine practice. The overall response rate and tolerability seen in this survey are similar to those reported in randomized clinical trials.

Introduction

Montelukast, the most widely used leukotriene-modifying agent (LTMA), is a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist and is currently indicated for prophylactic and chronic treatment of asthma, relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Off-label uses include for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnea. There is also increasing interest in repositioning montelukast for treating various other health conditions.,

The evidence base for adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes associated with LTMAs is mixed and inconclusive. Nevertheless, in 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a new warning about potential serious mental health outcomes associated with montelukast to promote further awareness of potential adverse effects and also advised reducing montelukast's use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Drug safety updates on montelukast have been published recently in Europe. On one hand, controlled clinical trials have reported mainly mild and infrequent adverse effects. This led to an initial conclusion that montelukast was a safe and well-tolerated medicine. Contrasting evidence, however, has come from postmarketing safety signals, which have included a range of severe neuropsychiatric outcomes, such as aggression, anxiety, depression, various sleep-related problems, and suicidal ideation, self-harm, and completed suicide. Some case studies have reported a positive montelukast dechallenge-rechallenge association, that is, that adverse symptoms have resolved after cessation of treatment and returned after restarting of treatment. Evidence from observational studies, which are often methodologically better suited for studying adverse outcomes, is also mixed and inconclusive. Several methodological limitations have been identified in the evidence base on the safety of montelukast in observational studies, including potential confounding by indication, comorbidities of asthma, and concurrent use of other medicines. Furthermore, because much of the evidence is based on pediatric and adolescent populations, relatively little is known about potential adverse outcomes among adults.

### Comparison of ICS dose reduction vs. montelukast discontinuation for step-down therapy in well-controlled asthma: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^112jEUnF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease, affecting an estimated 300 million people globally. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation, defined by a history of variable respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and cough. Diagnosis relies on characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation documented through bronchodilator reversibility testing or other objective tests.

The primary objective of asthma management aims to control of asthma symptoms, enhance lung function, and minimize the risk of long-term complications. This includes infrequent or absent asthma symptoms, preserving or improving personal best lung function, reducing exacerbations, avoiding maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy, and preventing medication side-effects.

The stepwise approach to asthma pharmacotherapy involves gradually increasing medication to achieve symptom control and prevent exacerbations, followed by stepping down after several months of good control. While under-treatment is a well-known issue in asthma management, it's important to recognize that over-treatment is also prevalent and can lead to adverse outcomes.

These consequences include an increased risk of side effects, high-cost burden, and poor adherence. By reducing or "stepping down" asthma pharmacotherapy, healthcare providers can decrease adverse events and financial burden while improving patient adherence. Moreover, stepping down can help re-evaluate the current asthma diagnosis. The minimally effective dose (the lowest dose that maintains good symptom control and minimizes exacerbation) should align with patient values and preferences.

Once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months, gradual stepping-down treatment to find the lowest effective ICS dose should be considered. Montelukast, an orally administered leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), is recommended in the recent GINA guideline as an option for maintenance therapy in patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled despite ICS use. It is also effective in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and in pediatric population.

Given montelukast's favorable tolerability, ease of use, and safety profile, some patients and physicians may prefer a trial of adding montelukast to ICS rather than increasing the ICS dosage. This preference is due to concerns about adrenal suppression, growth retardation, and bone loss associated with high-dose ICS therapy. A recent meta-analysis found that montelukast did not significantly increase neuropsychiatric events compared with placebo in patients with allergic airway disease. Considering montelukast's favorable safety profile compared to high-dose ICS, we examined ICS dose reduction and montelukast discontinuation as step-down strategies in adult patients with well-controlled asthma.

Allergic rhinitis — oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast) added to intranasal corticosteroid (INCS): The guideline suggests against adding montelukast to an INCS for allergic rhinitis, citing lack of evidence for improved efficacy and concerns for serious neuropsychiatric events; this is a conditional recommendation with very low certainty, and available studies show either no further benefit or only nighttime symptom improvement with similar total symptom scores.

### A boxed warning for montelukast: the FDA perspective [^1131pGbM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became aware of postmarketing reports of neuropsychiatric adverse events with Singulair (montelukast) use in 2007. Over the years, the FDA has conducted reviews of the clinical trial safety data, focused analyses of postmarketing reports, and reviews of the published literature. These activities have resulted in successive labeling updates and public communications. However, there has been continued concern among stakeholders about the risk of neuropsychiatric events and the lack of awareness among prescribers and patients/caregivers. On the basis of these concerns, the FDA embarked on another comprehensive review and also conducted a new observational study using claims data in the Sentinel Distributed Database. In September 2019, the FDA held a public Advisory Committee meeting to discuss its review and solicit recommendations from the panel regarding labeling and communication strategies. After careful consideration of the available data and feedback received during the FDA Advisory Committee meeting, the FDA required a boxed warning and a revision specifically for the allergic rhinitis indication to reserve use of montelukast to patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies. Based on benefit-risk considerations, the asthma indication was not changed. To provide insight into the process and rationale for the required labeling changes, we provide an overview of the decision-making framework we used.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^112GXFv1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) for allergic rhinitis (AR) — We suggest that the clinician not select montelukast for the initial treatment of AR due to reduced efficacy compared with other agents, with strength of recommendation conditional and certainty of evidence very low; serious neuropsychiatric events have been reported, montelukast is approved down to 6 months of age, clinicians should monitor patients at elevated risk for suicidal ideation or psychiatric symptoms, and per FDA advice it should be used for AR only when other therapies are not effective or tolerated; considering comparative efficacy, clinicians should not routinely offer an LTRA as preferred therapy for AR.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^116pFC83]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Second-generation oral antihistamine combinations and montelukast-specific cautions — OAH 2G + INCS have not been shown to have any additive benefit over using just the INCS. For OAH 2G + LTRA, there is lack of adequate evidence of added efficacy to make a specific recommendation for or against this combination versus monotherapy; with the serious neuropsychiatric events reported with montelukast, this combination should rarely be used, and montelukast should generally be reserved for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies.

Understanding guidance impact is especially important if a substantial change in established practice is recommended. It is possible that the next iteration of UK asthma guidance may follow the latest international Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidance and recommend anti-inflammatory reliever therapy (AIR), as well as maintenance and reliever therapy (MART), which are both based on ICS/formoterol combination therapy. AIR in particular would represent a major step change in asthma management in the UK. AIR is already recommended in the recent short guidelines from the European Respiratory Society, which endorse that adults with mild asthma use as-needed ICS/formoterol, instead of regular ICS maintenance treatment plus as-needed short-acting β₂-agonists (SABAs), and that adolescents with mild asthma use either as-needed ICS/formoterol or ICS maintenance treatment plus as-needed SABA.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1137EQz5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Ages 0–4 years asthma — stepwise pharmacologic management is outlined for intermittent and persistent disease. Intermittent asthma includes PRN inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) and, at the start of respiratory tract infection (RTI), add a short course daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). For persistent asthma, the preferred sequence is daily low-dose ICS and PRN SABA; daily medium-dose ICS and PRN SABA; daily medium-dose ICS-LABA and PRN SABA; daily high-dose ICS-LABA and PRN SABA; and daily high-dose ICS-LABA + oral systemic corticosteroid and PRN SABA, where LABA denotes long-acting beta-agonist. Alternatives include daily montelukast or Cromolyn, and PRN SABA; daily medium-dose ICS + montelukast and PRN SABA; daily high-dose ICS + montelukast and PRN SABA; and daily high-dose ICS + montelukast + oral systemic corticosteroid and PRN SABA. For children age 4 years only, see Step 3 and Step 4 of Management of Persistent Asthma in individuals Ages 5–11 Years diagram. Assess control with the following actions: first check adherence, inhaler technique, environmental factors, and comorbid conditions; step up if needed; reassess in 4–6 weeks; step down if possible (if asthma is well controlled for at least 3 consecutive months); and consult with an asthma specialist if Step 3 or higher is required (consider consultation at Step 2). Note that cromolyn and montelukast were not considered for this update and the FDA issued a Boxed Warning for montelukast in March 2020.

### Marginal utility of montelukast for persistent asthma [^114462hX]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of a new pharmacologic agent for asthma, in this instance the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast, is determined in controlled trials in research subjects. The utility of a new drug is determined by multiple uncontrollable factors in individual patients.

Objective

To assess the utility of montelukast in the management of persistent asthma.

Design

Observational, retrospective.

Setting

Suburban multispecialty medical clinic.

Methods

From April 1998, montelukast was prescribed for 110 patients with persistent but controlled asthma, primarily for the corticosteroid-sparing effect. Outcomes after 1 year were determined from audits of medical records and responses to questionnaires.

Results

At least 56% of patients continued receiving montelukast for the entire year. However, compared to those patients who had discontinued montelukast therapy, those who continued receiving it had no difference in the use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroid or inhaled β₂-agonist therapy.

Conclusion

Montelukast had marginal utility in the management of these adult patients with controlled persistent asthma.

### Clinical safety and tolerability of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in controlled clinical trials in patients aged ≥ 6 years [^116dd2L7]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist administered orally once daily for treatment of chronic asthma in adults and children. A comprehensive analysis of safety data from double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with montelukast has not been previously reported.

Patients and Methods

A pooled analysis of safety data from 11 multicentre, randomized, controlled montelukast Phase IIb and III trials and five long-term extension studies was performed. A total of 3386 adult patients (aged 15–85 years) and 336 paediatric patients (aged 6–14 years) were enrolled in the trials; 2031 adults received montelukast for up to 4.1 years, and 257 children received montelukast for up to 1.8 years. Summary statistics comparing incidences of adverse events among treatment groups were calculated.

Results

The overall incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events among montelukast-treated patients, both adult and paediatric, was similar to that among patients receiving placebo. There were no clinically relevant differences in individual adverse events, including infectious upper respiratory conditions and transaminase elevations, between montelukast and placebo groups. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred with similar frequencies during placebo, montelukast and inhaled beclomethasone therapy. No dose-related adverse effects of montelukast were observed in adults treated with dosages as high as 200 mg per day (20 times the recommended dose) for 5 months. This tolerability profile montelukast observed in clinical trials has been generally reflected in the post-marketing safety experience seen to date.

Conclusions

These data indicate a tolerability profile for montelukast similar to placebo during both short-term and long-term administration, even at doses substantially higher than the recommended clinical dose of 10 mg once daily for adults and 5 mg once daily for children aged 6–14 years.

### Analysis of neuropsychiatric diagnoses after montelukast initiation [^114e4uuX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

To address some of the shortcomings of the current evidence base on potential adverse outcomes associated with montelukast, we conducted a propensity score–matched 1-year follow-up study of incident neuropsychiatric diagnoses among patients with a new treatment episode with montelukast. We used a patient repository of more than 51 million patients. Of LTMAs currently available, we focused on montelukast because 99% of patients with prescriptions for LTMAs in our data were prescribed montelukast. Furthermore, because of the FDA's recent recommendation on reducing use of montelukast in treating allergic rhinitis, we examined incident neuropsychiatric outcomes separately for patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis.

10 OVERDOSAGE

No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with montelukast sodium. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114kVUQz]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — pre-reassessment optimization includes to treat comorbidities and modifiable risk factors where there is evidence for benefit, with the note that there is no evidence to support routine treatment of asymptomatic GERD; avoid medications that make asthma worse (beta-blockers including eye-drops, aspirin and other NSAIDs in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease), and refer for management of mental health problems if relevant. Consider trial of non-biologic medication added to medium/high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), e.g., long-acting beta agonist (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), or leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) if not already tried, noting concerns about neuropsychiatric adverse effects with montelukast LTRA; and consider trial of high-dose ICS-LABA if not currently used.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

For the tablets, advise the patient and/or caregiver to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- Advise patients about the potential risk for serious neuropsychiatric symptoms and behavioral changes with montelukast sodium use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium with patients when prescribing or continuing treatment with montelukast sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- Advise patients to monitor for changes in behavior or neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients taking montelukast sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- Instruct patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately if changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient occur, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- Advise patients to take montelukast sodium daily as prescribed, even when they are asymptomatic, as well as during periods of worsening asthma, and to contact their physicians if their asthma is not well controlled.

- Advise patients that oral montelukast sodium is not for the treatment of acute asthma attacks. They should have appropriate short-acting inhaled β-agonist medication available to treat asthma exacerbations. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should be instructed to have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- Advise patients to seek medical attention if short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are needed more often than usual, or if more than the maximum number of inhalations of short-acting bronchodilator treatment prescribed for a 24-hour period are needed.

- Instruct patients to continue other anti-asthma medications as prescribed unless instructed by a physician.

Ages 5–11 years asthma stepwise management — preferred controller/reliever options escalate from daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA), to daily and PRN combination low-dose ICS–formoterol, then daily and PRN combination medium-dose ICS–formoterol, followed by daily high-dose ICS–long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) with PRN SABA, and finally daily high-dose ICS–LABA + oral systemic corticosteroid with PRN SABA. Assess control and actions include to first check adherence, inhaler technique, environmental factors, and comorbid conditions; step up if needed and reassess in 2–6 weeks; step down if possible if asthma is well controlled for at least 3 consecutive months; and consult with an asthma specialist if Step 4 or higher is required, considering consultation at Step 3. For adjuncts, Steps 2–4 conditionally recommend the use of subcutaneous immunotherapy as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy in individuals ≥ 5 years of age whose asthma is controlled at the initiation, build up, and maintenance phases of immunotherapy; consider Omalizumab, noting that Omalizumab is the only asthma biologic currently FDA-approved for this age range, and the FDA issued a Boxed Warning for montelukast in March 2020.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^111sJxD2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) montelukast is FDA-approved for treatment of symptoms of seasonal AR in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older and perennial AR in adults and pediatric patients 6 months of age and older; evidence shows LTRAs are more effective than placebo, are as effective as oral antihistamines in some trials, but are less effective than oral antihistamines and INS. In a single randomized, double-blind study, montelukast had a similar effect to pseudoephedrine except for nasal congestion where pseudoephedrine was more effective; montelukast is generally well tolerated and is not associated with drowsiness, behavior-related adverse events were infrequent in placebo-controlled trials, but rare drug-induced neuropsychiatric events have been reported and suicidal ideation was reported in 1 of 9929 patients (0.01%) in clinical trials treated with montelukast. Because montelukast is currently more expensive and equally as effective as or less effective than oral antihistamines for AR and is less effective than INS, clinicians should not routinely offer an LTRA as primary therapy for patients with AR.

5.1 Neuropsychiatric Events

Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with use of montelukast sodium. These postmarketing reports have been highly variable and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor. NP events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with and without a previous history of psychiatric disorder. NP events have been reported mostly during montelukast sodium treatment, but some were reported after montelukast sodium discontinuation. Animal studies showed that montelukast distributes into the brain in rats [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]; however, the mechanisms underlying montelukast sodium-associated NP events are currently not well understood. Based upon the available data, it is difficult to identify risk factors for or quantify the risk of NP events with montelukast sodium use.

Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies [see Indications and Usage (1.3)]. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium.

Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium use with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or for new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately. In many cases, symptoms resolved after stopping montelukast sodium therapy; however, in some cases symptoms persisted after discontinuation of montelukast sodium. Therefore, continue to monitor and provide supportive care until symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur.

### Adverse drug reactions of leukotriene receptor antagonists in children with asthma: a systematic review [^1159WZLU]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a disease of airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction. It is the most common chronic disease of childhood globally, affecting more than 338 million children globally. The UK has the highest prevalence of childhood asthma symptoms in the world, with the National Health Service spending around 1 billion pounds each year on asthma care. Globally, the prevalence of asthma has been steadily increasing, and as a result, so has the prescribing of anti-asthma medication, with management guided by national and international guidelines.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are a class of drugs used as a preventative treatment for asthma and are usually prescribed as an additional therapy for patients whose acute symptoms and attacks remain uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids. Montelukast, the originator drug in this class, has also been separately licenced for allergic rhinitis in some nations. Initially licenced in 1998, montelukast was the 16th most prescribed medication in 2020 globally.

Medications come with potential harms such as adverse drug reactions (ADRs), defined as 'an unwanted or harmful reaction which occurs after administration of drugs' and 'is suspected or known to be due to the drug(s)'. In March 2020 montelukast was marked with a boxed warning by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other agencies, warning of the potential severity of adverse events attributed to the labelled drug. There was particular concern regarding significant neuropsychiatric events associated with this drug. These included suicidal thoughts and actions, depression and sleeping problems.

This systematic review aims to identify types of ADRs reported in the medical literature for children and young people (CYP) who use LTRAs and provide estimates of the frequency of these suspected ADRs.

### Comparing LAMA with LABA and LTRA as add-on therapies in primary care asthma management [^111oAVin]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Much of the available evidence for asthma management is based on research carried out in adults, which leads to a greater restriction of licensing of medication in children, creating additional difficulties in selecting the most appropriate treatment option for paediatric patients with asthma. Despite advances in care, asthma still presents a burden within this population, with many children remaining symptomatic and uncontrolled. Data in patients aged < 18 years are currently limited due to inherent difficulties in the study of this population; however, available evidence suggests that LABAs and tiotropium have comparable effects with respect to lung function, asthma control and exacerbations. Of the LABAs, LTRAs and LAMAs reviewed here, the LTRA montelukast is the only add-on treatment that is indicated for use in patients aged < 4 years (as a chewable tablet) and the only add-on treatment recommended for use in patients aged ≤ 5 years as an optional controller treatment. Clinical trials of LTRAs in children aged ≤ 5 years have not demonstrated any safety concerns. However, in 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that a boxed warning for the LTRA montelukast was appropriate due to the risk of mental health side effects, and advised that healthcare professionals (HCPs) consider the benefits and risks of mental health side effects before prescribing montelukast. Despite less published evidence regarding use of add-on therapies in paediatric patients (aged < 18 years) than in adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years), current available data suggest that all three add-on therapies have comparable safety profiles, with LABAs and LAMAs providing greater improvements in lung function than LTRAs. When selecting the most appropriate add-on therapy for paediatric patients, it is important to consider the reported efficacy, safety data and subsequent post-marketing safety warnings (if applicable) and the indications of these add-on therapies, as not all are appropriate for all age ranges (Table 1).

### A phase I randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-exploration study of single-dose inhaled montelukast in patients with chronic asthma [^113bSUe7]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of oral montelukast has been well established in asthma and allergic rhinitis in adults and children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate dose-related bronchodilation and tolerability of inhaled montelukast.

Methods

Randomized, double-blind, crossover, adaptive-design study comparing single-dose administration of inhaled montelukast versus placebo in patients age 15–65 years with chronic asthma (n = 68). Montelukast was delivered as a witnessed dose through dry powder inhaler at doses of 25, 250, or 1000 μg, and doses of 50, 100, and 500 μg could be used if needed based on a prespecified dose-response algorithm. Each administration was followed by a 4- to 7-day washout period before crossing over to the next treatment. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) over the first 4 hours after administration, calculated as a time-weighted average (ΔFEV₁ [0–4 hours]). Other endpoints included the onset and duration of bronchodilation and the effect of albuterol when added to inhaled montelukast.

Results

Over 4 hours postdose, and compared with placebo (least-squares [LS] mean 0.03 L), inhaled montelukast 100 μg (0.13 L; p ≤ .001), 250 μg (0.10 L; p < .01), and 1000 μg (0.12 L; p ≤ .001) had significantly greater ΔFEV₁ (0–4 hours). At 24 hours postdose, inhaled montelukast 100 μg (0.10 L) and 1000 μg (0.09 L) had significantly greater bronchodilation compared with placebo (0.02 L; p < .05 vs. montelukast). Montelukast 1000 μg provided significant bronchodilation versus placebo within 20 minutes of administration (0.03 L vs. -0.05 L), whereas montelukast 100 μg provided significant bronchodilation relative to placebo within 2 hours of dosing (0.09 L vs. 0.01 L). Montelukast (pooled doses) plus albuterol was significantly more effective than montelukast plus placebo for ΔFEV₁ (0–90 minutes) (0.34 L vs. 0.15 L; p = .015). The tolerability of inhaled montelukast was similar to that of placebo. No serious adverse experiences were reported.

Conclusions

Inhaled montelukast provided significant bronchodilation compared with placebo as early as 20 minutes after the administration that persisted for 24 hours and provided additive bronchodilation to albuterol.

For AR, an oral LTRA plus oral antihistamine may be more effective than LTRA monotherapy, and this combination is similarly effective as intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) monotherapy though likely more costly and burdensome; when considering montelukast, a shared‑decision making conversation should be utilized.

WARNING: SERIOUS NEUROPSYCHIATRIC EVENTS

Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with the use of montelukast sodium. The types of events reported were highly variable, and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggression, depression, sleep disturbances, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide). The mechanisms underlying NP events associated with montelukast sodium use are currently not well understood [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies [see Indications and Usage (1.3)]. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium.

Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Genome-wide association study of leukotriene modifier response in asthma [^115sPRij]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Although the initial results of these candidate gene studies are promising, replication of identified associations has been problematic, making it difficult to estimate the degree of contribution of individual genes to LTM response. By necessity, candidate gene studies focus on characterizing the genotype–phenotype relationships within individual genes that are chosen a priori based on biological and clinical information, rather than an agnostic approach that considers data from the entire genome. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of symptomatic response to asthma medications have identified multiple genes associated with patient responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids, adding to the growing evidence for a genetic basis for therapeutic efficacy in asthma patients. Limited information from candidate gene studies of zileuton and montelukast response indicates that patient genetics has a role in LTM response; however, to date, no genome-wide investigation of LTM response has been reported. For these reasons, we performed a GWAS to identify novel genetic loci associated with leukotriene modifier response in asthmatic patients.

### Safety and tolerability of montelukast in placebo-controlled pediatric studies and their open-label extensions [^113QYweR]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Montelukast is a potent leukotriene-receptor antagonist administered once daily that provides clinical benefit in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults. Because of its wide use as a pediatric controller, there is a need for a further review of the safety and tolerability of montelukast in children.

Objective

To summarize safety and tolerability data for montelukast from previously reported as well as from unpublished placebo-controlled, double-blind, pediatric studies and their active-controlled open-label extension/extended studies.

Methods

These studies evaluated 2,751 pediatric patients 6 months to 14 years of age with persistent asthma, intermittent asthma associated with upper respiratory infection, or allergic rhinitis. These patients were enrolled in seven randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind registration and post-registration studies and three active-controlled open-label extension/extended studies conducted by Merck Research Laboratories between 1995 and 2004.

Results

Montelukast was well tolerated in all studies. Clinical and laboratory adverse experiences for patients treated with montelukast were generally mild and transient. The most frequent clinical adverse events for all treatments (placebo, montelukast, active control/usual care) in virtually all studies were upper respiratory infection, worsening asthma, pharyngitis, and fever.

Conclusion

The clinical and laboratory safety profile for montelukast was similar to that observed for placebo or active control/usual care therapies. The safety profile of montelukast did not change with long-term use.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published prospective and retrospective cohort studies over decades with montelukast use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects [see Data]. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of montelukast to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (MRHDOD) based on AUCs [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Poorly or moderately controlled asthma in pregnancy increases the maternal risk of perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia and infant prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age.

Data

Human Data

Published data from prospective and retrospective cohort studies have not identified an association with montelukast sodium use during pregnancy and major birth defects. Available studies have methodologic limitations, including small sample size, in some cases retrospective data collection, and inconsistent comparator groups.

Animal Data

In embryo-fetal development studies, montelukast administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17 in rats and 6 to 18 in rabbits) did not cause any adverse developmental effects at maternal oral doses up to 400 and 300 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively (approximately 100 and 110 times the AUC in humans at the MRHDOD, respectively).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

A published clinical lactation study reports the presence of montelukast in human milk. Data available on the effects of the drug on infants, either directly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] or through breast milk, do not suggest a significant risk of adverse reactions from exposure to montelukast sodium. The effects of the drug on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for montelukast sodium and any potential adverse reactions on the breastfed infant from montelukast sodium or from the underlying maternal condition.

### Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, for the treatment of persistent asthma in children aged 2 to 5 years [^11759938]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The greatest prevalence of asthma is in preschool children; however, the clinical utility of asthma therapy for this age group is limited by a narrow therapeutic index, long-term tolerability, and frequency and/or difficulty of administration. Inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled cromolyn are the most commonly prescribed controller therapies for young children with persistent asthma, although very young patients may have difficulty using inhalers, and dose delivery can be variable. Moreover, reduced compliance with inhaled therapy relative to orally administered therapy has been reported. One potential advantage of montelukast is the ease of administering a once-daily chewable tablet; additionally, no tachyphylaxis or change in the safety profile has been evidenced after up to 140 and 80 weeks of montelukast therapy in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 to 14 years, respectively. To our knowledge, this represents the first large, multicenter study to address the effects of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in children younger than 5 years of age with persistent asthma, as well as one of the few asthma studies that incorporated end points validated for use in preschool children.

Objective

Our primary objective was to determine the safety profile of montelukast, an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist, in preschool children with persistent asthma. Secondarily, the effect of montelukast on exploratory measures of asthma control was also studied. DESIGN AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We conducted a double-blind, multicenter, multinational study at 93 centers worldwide: including 56 in the United States, and 21 in countries in Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. In this study, we randomly assigned 689 patients (aged 2–5 years) to 12 weeks of treatment with placebo (228 patients) or 4 mg of montelukast as a chewable tablet (461 patients) after a 2-week placebo baseline period. Patients had a history of physician-diagnosed asthma requiring use of beta-agonist and a predefined level of daytime asthma symptoms. Caregivers answered questions twice daily on a validated, asthma-specific diary card and, at specified times during the study, completed a validated asthma-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Physicians and caregivers completed a global evaluation of asthma control at the end of the study. Efficacy end points included: daytime and overnight asthma symptoms, daily use of beta-agonist, days without asthma, frequency of asthma attacks, number of patients discontinued because of asthma, need for rescue medication, physician and caregiver global evaluations of change, asthma-specific caregiver quality of life, and peripheral blood eosinophil counts. Although exploratory, the efficacy end points were predefined and their analyses were written in a data analysis plan before study unblinding. At screening and at study completion, a complete physical examination was performed. Routine laboratory tests were drawn at screening and weeks 6 and 12, and submitted to a central laboratory for analysis. Adverse effects were collected from caregivers at each clinic visit. An intention-to-treat approach, including all patients with a baseline measurement and at least 1 postrandomization measurement, was performed for all efficacy end points. An analysis-of-variance model with terms for treatment, study center and stratum (inhaled/nebulized corticosteroid use, cromolyn use, or none) was used to estimate treatment group means and between-group differences and to construct 95% confidence intervals. Treatment-by-age, -sex, -race, -radioallergosorbent test, -stratum, and -study center interactions were evaluated by including each term separately. Fisher's exact test was used for between-group comparisons of the frequency of asthma attacks, discontinuations from the study because of worsening asthma, need for rescue medication, and the frequencies of adverse effects. Because of an imbalance in baseline values for eosinophil counts for the 2 treatment groups, an analysis of covariance was performed on the eosinophil change from baseline with the patient's baseline as covariate.

Study Participants

Of the 689 patients enrolled, approximately 60% were boys and 60% were white. Patients were relatively evenly divided by age: 21%, 24%, 30%, and 23% were aged 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. For 77% of the patients, asthma symptoms first developed during the first 3 years of life. During the placebo baseline period, patients had asthma symptoms on 6.1 days/week and used beta-agonist on 6.0 days/week.

Results

In over 12 weeks of treatment of patients aged 2 to 5 years, montelukast administered as a 4-mg chewable tablet produced significant improvements compared with placebo in multiple parameters of asthma control including: daytime asthma symptoms (cough, wheeze, trouble breathing, and activity limitation); overnight asthma symptoms (cough); the percentage of days with asthma symptoms; the percentage of days without asthma; the need for beta-agonist or oral corticosteroids; physician global evaluations; and peripheral blood eosinophils. The clinical benefit of montelukast was evident within 1 day of starting therapy. Improvements in asthma control were consistent across age, sex, race, and study center, and whether or not patients had a positive radioallergosorbent test. Montelukast demonstrated a consistent effect regardless of concomitant use of inhaled/nebulized corticosteroid or cromolyn therapy. Caregiver global evaluations, the percentage of patients experiencing asthma attacks, and improvements in quality-of-life scores favored montelukast, but were not significantly different from placebo. There were no clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups in overall frequency of adverse effects or of individual adverse effects, with the exception of asthma, which occurred significantly more frequently in the placebo group. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the frequency of laboratory adverse effects or in the frequency of elevated serum transaminase levels. Approximately 90% of the patients completed the study.

Conclusions

Oral montelukast (4-mg chewable tablet) administered once daily is effective therapy for asthma in children aged 2 to 5 years and is generally well tolerated without clinically important adverse effects. Similarly, in adults and children aged 6 to 14 years, montelukast improves multiple parameters of asthma control. Thus, this study confirms and extends the benefit of montelukast to younger children with persistent asthma.

### Reports of suicidality in clinical trials of montelukast [^112dFXfy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years, a number of drugs and drug classes have come under scrutiny by the US Food and Drug Administration regarding suicidality (including suicidal behavior and ideation).

Objective

We sought to perform 2 reviews (requested by the US Food and Drug Administration) of the number of events possibly related to suicidality reported in Merck clinical trials of montelukast.

Methods

Method 1 was a descriptive review of clinical adverse experiences (AEs) from 116 studies (double-blind and open-label, adult and pediatric, and single- and multiple-dose studies) completed as of March 2008. Summaries were constructed from investigator-reported AE terms possibly related to suicidality (completed suicide, suicide attempt, and suicidal ideation) or self-injurious behavior. Method 2 used a retrospective adjudication of investigator-reported AEs and other events listed in the study database described as possibly suicidality-related adverse events (PSRAEs) in a prespecified set of 41 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials completed as of April 2008.

Results

No completed suicides were reported in any study. For the descriptive review, 20,131 adults and children received montelukast, 9,287 received placebo, and 8,346 received active control; AEs possibly related to suicidality were rare and were similar between the montelukast and placebo or active-control groups. For the adjudicated review across 22,433 patients, there were 730 adjudicated events. In 9,929 patients taking montelukast, 1 PSRAE was identified (classified as suicidal ideation); none were identified in 7,780 and 4,724 patients taking placebo and active control, respectively.

Conclusions

Assessed by using 2 complementary methods, there were no reports of completed suicide, and reports of PSRAEs were rare in patients receiving montelukast and similar to those seen in control subjects.

### Oral montelukast in acute asthma exacerbations: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111cpgZj]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although leukotriene receptor antagonists have an established role in the management of patients with chronic asthma, their efficacy in an acute asthma exacerbation is not fully known.

Methods

87 adults with acute asthma requiring hospitalisation were randomly assigned to receive either montelukast 10 mg or placebo on admission and every evening thereafter for 4 weeks (when they were reviewed as outpatients). All patients were admitted under the care of a consultant chest physician and received full care for acute asthma according to the British Thoracic Society guidelines. The primary end point was the difference in peak expiratory flow (PEF) between active and placebo treatment the morning following admission.

Results

Primary end point data were analysed for 73 patients. At study entry, patients who received montelukast (n = 37) had a mean (± SD) PEF of 227.6 (± 56.9) l/min (47.6% predicted) and those who received placebo (n = 36) had a PEF of 240.3 (± 99.8) l/min (49.6% predicted). The morning after admission, patients who received montelukast achieved a PEF of 389.6 (± 109.7) l/min (81.4% predicted) compared with 332.3 (± 124.9) l/min (69.8% predicted) for placebo (p = 0.046). The mean difference between treatment groups was 57.4 l/min (95% CI of 1.15 to 113.6 l/min or 1.95–21.2% predicted).

Conclusion

In acute asthma exacerbations the additional administration of oral montelukast results in a significantly higher PEF the morning after admission than that achievable with current standard treatment. Clinical trial number NCT01011452.

Risk Summary

Available data from published prospective and retrospective cohort studies over decades with montelukast use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects [see Data]. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of montelukast to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (MRHDOD) based on AUCs [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

5.2 Acute Asthma

Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist.

5.3 Concomitant Corticosteroid Use

While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids.

5.4 Aspirin Sensitivity

Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

5.5 	Eosinophilic Conditions

Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.6 Risk in Patients with Phenylketonuria

Montelukast sodium chewable tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Each 4 mg and 5 mg chewable tablet contains 0.674 mg and 0.842 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. Before prescribing montelukast sodium chewable tablets to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including montelukast sodium chewable tablets.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists in the treatment of asthma: an update [^1151CTYA]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), such as montelukast and zafirlukast, have been demonstrated in a number of studies to possess bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory properties, that make these drugs ideal candidates for the treatment of asthma. The last 1998-updating of the GINA Guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy of asthma recommends the use of LTRAs in the treatment of moderate and mild asthma. In patients with moderate asthma not completely controlled with moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids, the addition of a LTRA is indicated in alternative to either the increase of the inhaled corticosteroid dose or the addition of an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist. Both in vitro and in vivo evidences indicate that LTRAs possess an anti-inflammatory activity that is presumably complementary to that presented by corticosteroids. Moreover, clinical studies show that the addition of an LTRA, montelukast, is able to improve clinical and functional indexes in patients with asthma not controlled with inhaled corticosteroids, and to allow a reduction in corticosteroid dosage in patients with asthma well controlled by inhaled corticosteroids. In patients with mild persistent asthma monotherapy with an LTRA is indicated in alternative to a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, an inhaled cromone, or an oral slow-release theophylline. Previous clinical studies in patients with mild to moderate asthma had demonstrated that monotherapy with LTRAs is able to improve airway function, asthma symptoms, use of as-needed medications, exacerbation rate, and quality of life, without evidence of tolerance with prolonged use. Recently, in a subgroup analysis of patients with mild persistent asthma, a 6-week treatment with oral montelukast or inhaled beclomethasone gave similar improvements in "rescue-free" days, days with well controlled asthma, FEV₁, blood eosinophils, beta-agonist use, and nocturnal awakes due to asthma.

### Comparison of ICS dose reduction vs. montelukast discontinuation for step-down therapy in well-controlled asthma: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^113kwNw5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study evaluated the effectiveness of step-down strategies in well-controlled asthma patients. While reducing ICS doses may be feasible for some patients, maintaining montelukast therapy may be beneficial, especially for those with severe asthma or a history of frequent exacerbations. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and guide optimal step-down strategies.

### Montelukast (montelukast sodium) [^111i6ctm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elimination

The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and < 0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile.

In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10 mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%).

Metabolism

Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady-state in adults and pediatric patients.

In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast.

Specific Populations

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI = 7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10 mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast sodium in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated.

Instruct patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately if changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient occur, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Advise patients to take montelukast sodium daily as prescribed, even when they are asymptomatic, as well as during periods of worsening asthma, and to contact their physicians if their asthma is not well controlled.
Advise patients that oral montelukast sodium is not for the treatment of acute asthma attacks. They should have appropriate short-acting inhaled β-agonist medication available to treat asthma exacerbations. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should be instructed to have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Advise patients to seek medical attention if short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are needed more often than usual, or if more than the maximum number of inhalations of short-acting bronchodilator treatment prescribed for a 24-hour period are needed.
Instruct patients to continue other anti-asthma medications as prescribed unless instructed by a physician.
Instruct patients with known aspirin sensitivity to continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Inform phenylketonuric patients that the 4 mg and 5 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine (a component of aspartame) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Other Step 3 treatment options for adults and adolescents — For adult patients sensitized to house dust mite with suboptimally controlled asthma despite low- to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), consider adding sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) provided FEV₁ is > 70% predicted. Increasing ICS to medium dose is less effective at a population level than adding a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), and other less efficacious options are low-dose ICS-containing therapy plus either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or low-dose, sustained-release theophylline; note the concerns about neuropsychiatric adverse effects with montelukast.

### Analysis of behavior-related adverse experiences in clinical trials of montelukast [^113o2ncY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Frequencies of behavior-related adverse experiences (BRAEs) in controlled clinical studies of leukotriene modifier drugs have not been summarized.

Objective

We sought to compare the frequency of BRAEs in patients receiving montelukast or placebo in a retrospective analysis of Merck clinical trial data.

Methods

An adverse experience database was constructed to include all double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of montelukast meeting prespecified criteria. BRAEs (described using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities controlled vocabulary dictionary) were prespecified to include any term in the Psychiatric Disorders System Organ Class, selected terms related to general disorders, and terms related to akathisia. Frequencies of BRAEs (overall, leading to study discontinuation, and/or serious) were summarized. Analyses estimated the odds ratios (ORs) for montelukast versus placebo based on the frequency of patients with BRAEs in each study.

Results

In total 35 adult and 11 pediatric placebo-controlled trials were included; 11,673 patients received montelukast, 8,827 received placebo, and 4,724 received active control. The frequency of patients with 1 or more BRAEs was 2.73% and 2.27% in the montelukast and placebo groups, respectively; the OR for montelukast versus placebo was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.93–1.36). The frequency of patients with a BRAE leading to study discontinuation was 0.07% and 0.11% in the montelukast and placebo groups, respectively (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.17–1.51). The frequency of patients with a BRAE considered serious was 0.03% in both treatment groups.

Conclusion

Reports of BRAEs were infrequent in clinical trials of montelukast. Those leading to study discontinuation or considered serious were rare. Frequencies were similar regardless of treatment group.

### Comparison of ICS dose reduction vs. montelukast discontinuation for step-down therapy in well-controlled asthma: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^115uXc5K]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given these findings and the results of our studies, we advise against discontinuing montelukast therapy in patients who are well-controlled on both montelukast and ICS-LABA. This recommendation is particularly important for patients with more severe asthma, as they may not respond as favorably to a step-down treatment approach without montelukast.

Rationale for the study design

The recent GINA guideline recommends medium-dose ICS-LABA as the preferred Step 4 treatment. LRTAs are among the options that can be added to medium or high-dose ICS. Our study focused on comparing ICS dose reduction with montelukast discontinuation while maintaining LABA dosage. This design was chosen because discontinuing LABA could lead to poor asthma control. The as-needed ICS-Formoterol strategy could be advantageous in avoiding treatment with short-acting beta 2-agonist (SABA), and thus, maintaining a low-dose ICS-formoterol plus montelukast could potentially benefit patients by providing them with a single controller and reliever medication, thereby increasing their adherence. Our study aimed to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of reducing ICS doses in well-controlled asthma. Previous research has demonstrated that most of the benefits of ICS are achieved at low doses with minimal side effects. By reducing ICS doses, we hypothesized that we could potentially minimize the risk of adverse effects associated with high-dose ICS therapy.

8.4 	Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of montelukast sodium for asthma have been established in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age. Use of montelukast sodium for this indication is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies. Safety and efficacy data in this age group are similar to those seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology, Specific Populations (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].

The effectiveness of montelukast sodium for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 2 to 14 years of age and for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 2 years to 14 years of age have been established and is supported by extrapolation from the demonstrated effectiveness in patients 15 years of age and older with allergic rhinitis as well as the assumption that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar among these populations.

The safety of montelukast sodium 4 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age with asthma has been demonstrated by adequate and well-controlled data [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Effectiveness of montelukast sodium in this age group is extrapolated from the demonstrated effectiveness in patients 6 years of age and older with asthma and is based on similar pharmacokinetic data, as well as the assumption that the disease course, pathophysiology and the drug's effect are substantially similar among these populations. Effectiveness in this age group is supported by exploratory efficacy assessments from a large, well-controlled safety study conducted in patients 2 to 5 years of age.

Asthma Treatment Steps for Children 5 Years and Younger

Step 1

Provide inhaled SABA for relief of wheezing episodes. A need for SABA more than twice a week on average over 1 month indicates the need for a trial of controller medication.

Step 2

The preferred option is regular, daily, low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, given for at least 3 months (see Box 6–6 in Referencefor ICS doses). Regular montelukast is less effective than low-dose ICS, and parents/caregivers should be counseled about potential neurobehavioral adverse effects, as in a boxed warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Step 3

Before considering step-up to double the "low" ICS dose, check for concomitant or alternative diagnoses, check and correct inhaler technique and adherence, and ask about risk factors such as exposure to allergens or tobacco smoke. ICS–LABA is not recommended in children < 4 years old, as there are insufficient data about efficacy and safety.

Step 4

Refer the child for expert advice if symptoms and/or flare-ups persist, or at any time if side effects of treatment are observed or suspected, or if there are doubts about diagnosis. See Chapter 6 in Referencefor details about other therapeutic options.

2.1 Asthma

Forasthma, administer montelukast sodium tablets orally once daily in the evening, with or without food. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma toevaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The following doses arerecommended: Table 1: RecommendedDosage in Asthma

Patientswho miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.

2.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)

Forprevention�of EIB, administer a single dose of montelukast sodium tablets orally at least 2 hours, before exercise. The following doses arerecommended: Table 2: RecommendedDosage in Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)

An additional dose of montelukast sodium tablets should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium tablets daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting β-agonist.

Daily administration of montelukast sodium tablets for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB.

2.3 Allergic Rhinitis

For allergic rhinitis, administer montelukast sodium tablets orally once daily without regard to time of food ingestion. Time of administration in patients with allergic rhinitis can be individualized to suit patient needs. The following doses for the treatment of symptoms ofseasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended:

Table 3: RecommendedDosage in Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitisare recommended:

Table 4: Recommended Dosage in Perennial AllergicRhinitis

Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular timeand should not take 2 doses at the same time.

2.4 Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis

For patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis, administer only one montelukast sodium tablets dose orally once daily in the evening. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.

### Adverse events are rare after single-dose montelukast exposures in children [^115FVeo4]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Montelukast sodium is a leukotriene-receptor antagonist approved as a controller medication for chronic asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults. We sought to characterize adverse events associated with single montelukast exposures in children ages 5–17 years and to determine whether adverse events were dose related for all-dose and for ultra-high-dose (≥ 50mg) exposures.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of data from the National Poison Data System for exposures that included montelukast in individuals aged 5–17 years for calendar years 2000–2016. Filters were applied to identify exposure events in which montelukast was the primary exposure and for which the exact or lowest-possible ingested dose was recorded. Characteristics of adverse events were examined using descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic models were used to examine whether associations of montelukast and adverse events were dose related.

Results

During the 17-year study period, there were 17,069 montelukast exposures available for analyses. Patients were median [interquartile range] age 7 (5, 9) years, and 10,907 (64%) male gender. Abdominal pain was the most common adverse event (0.23%). There were 618 ultra-high-dose exposures (≥ 50mg). These patients had median age 6 (5, 8) years, and 347 (56%) male gender. Abdominal pain was the most common adverse event (1.46%). Increasing ingested dose was associated with abdominal pain (adjusted odds ratio, 1.01, 95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.02) after adjustment for age and gender. No serious or life-threatening events were reported.

Conclusions

Single-dose exposures of montelukast up to 445mg are rarely associated with any adverse events and are not associated with serious or life-threatening adverse events in children aged 5–17 years.

Neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with montelukast

As noted in the montelukast monograph and highlighted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) boxed warning, neuropsychiatric events, ranging from mild symptoms like anxiety and insomnia to more severe manifestations such as hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, and aggressive behavior, have been reported in patients of all ages taking montelukast. While a 2023 systematic review did not find a direct association between montelukast and suicide or depression-related events, it is important to acknowledge that the risk of such events may vary among individuals. Factors like age, underlying mental health conditions, and concurrent medications can influence susceptibility.

Our study did not observe any neuropsychiatric adverse effects among the participants. However, given the potential for individual variability and the limitations of our study's sample size and duration, ongoing monitoring for neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients taking montelukast is recommended, especially in those with risk factors or a history of mental health conditions. Healthcare providers should be vigilant in reporting any suspected adverse events to regulatory authorities.

Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse reaction profile did not significantly change.

Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following reaction was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies.

Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis

Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following reactions were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo.

### Impact of comorbid conditions on asthmatic adults and children [^115hcCfV]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Additional considerations

Potential effects of asthma medications on mental health should also be considered. Adverse effects such as mood and behavioural changes, including manic or depressive states and even frank psychosis, can occur with large doses of oral corticosteroids. Concerns about a possible association between leukotriene receptor antagonist use and suicide risk were raised based on post-marketing surveillance reports. Even though a statistically significant association was found in patients aged 19–24 years in a case–control study, the association was no longer significant after adjusting for potential confounding factors. In some children, post-marketing surveillance reports have identified behavioural and/or neuropsychiatric AEs associated with montelukast use, and a possible association with suicide risk has been reported in adolescents and adults. Since March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration has required a boxed warning about the risk of neuropsychiatric events with montelukast to strengthen an existing warning. In addition, the potential effects of medications for psychiatric diseases on asthma control should be considered. For instance, β-blockers — a commonly prescribed treatment for anxiety — are contraindicated in asthma and may cause exacerbations. The benefit of a treatment for one condition should, therefore, be quantified against the potential risks of the comorbidity.

More important is the potential impact of depression and anxiety on asthma management. For example, depression may affect medication adherence, while anxiety associated with hyperventilation may result in misinterpretation of symptoms as asthma.

Top tips for identifying psychiatric diseases in primary care

If asthma control is poor, patients should be assessed for unrecognised anxiety and depression, along with impact on day-to-day functioning.

### Step 4: stick or twist? A review of asthma therapy [^111HUPGo]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Option 2: add-on therapy with LTRA

Leukotrienes are lipid mediators produced by inflammatory cells of the airways and are activated during allergic airway inflammation. Pathophysiological effects include bronchoconstriction, increased microvasculature permeability, mucus secretion and recruitment of eosinophils into the airway mucosa. Cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) inhibitors (montelukast, zafirlukast and pranlukast) can improve lung function, symptoms, SABA use, eosinophil level and exacerbation rate over a range of asthma severities in adults and children. One advantage of adding another anti-inflammatory medication to high-dose ICS is a potential steroid-sparing effect. LTRA may also inhibit early and late phase allergen responses, although the magnitude of effect on airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) may be reduced in comparison with ICS.

### Eosinophilic gastroenteritis in a young girl – long term remission under montelukast [^11666Upg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare disease, but should be considered as differential diagnosis in cases of recurrent abdominal pain. Failure to diagnose this disorder often relates to reluctance to biopsy an apparently normal intestinum. Montelukast therapy seems promising to be an effective long term treatment in these patients, particularly when they are steroid dependent. So far no side effects were noted in our patient. Further randomized trials are required to asses the full benefits of Montelukast therapy in eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders.

### Analysis of neuropsychiatric diagnoses after montelukast initiation [^116TvfCS]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

We observed a population-level association between new montelukast exposure and incident neuropsychiatric diagnoses within a subsequent year of the initial dispensed prescription among patients with asthma or allergic rhinitis compared with propensity score-matched patients not exposed to LTMAs. The association was mainly explained by an excess incidence of anxiety and insomnia in patients exposed to montelukast. The statistically significant excess of incident neuropsychiatric outcomes in patients prescribed montelukast was small in absolute terms. However, because montelukast is prescribed to several million patients in the US each year, a small excess risk can be relevant at a population level. Future research with representative samples should quantify the total population burden of potential montelukast-associated neuropsychiatric outcomes. Our findings suggest that clinicians prescribing montelukast and other LTMAs should discuss potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects with patients before starting treatment and consider monitoring for signs of neuropsychiatric symptoms during treatment regardless of treatment indication. This may be particularly important in individuals who have a history of mental health or sleep problems.

Leukotriene modifiers (leukotriene receptor antagonists, LTRA) target one part of the inflammatory pathway in asthma and are sometimes used as an option for maintenance therapy, mainly only in children. When used alone they are less effective than low-dose ICS, and when added to ICS they are less effective than ICS-LABA; medications include montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton. Adverse effects include elevated liver function tests with zileuton and zafirlukast, and there are concerns in adults and children about risk of serious behavioral and mood changes, including suicidal ideation, associated with montelukast that should be discussed with patients/parents/caregivers.

### Roflumilast combined with montelukast versus montelukast alone as add-on treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma [^1138oLeB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Roflumilast, a selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, has been shown to provide modest improvements in lung function in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma, but its efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma has not been assessed. We hypothesized that this drug might provide benefit if combined with montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in patients whose symptoms are uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists.

Objective

We sought to examine the efficacy, safety, and mode of action of the addition of roflumilast and montelukast versus montelukast alone in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.

Methods

In a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, 2-sequence, crossover study, 64 patients were randomized to receive 500 μg of roflumilast plus montelukast followed by placebo plus 10 mg of montelukast (sequence AB) or placebo plus 10 mg of montelukast followed by 500 μg of roflumilast plus 10 mg of montelukast (sequence BA). All patients had a diagnosis of bronchial asthma inadequately controlled by at least a medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting β-agonist.

Results

The analysis of FEV₁ change from baseline to week 4 showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful treatment difference of 100 mL for roflumilast plus montelukast versus placebo plus montelukast. Also, improvements in patient-reported outcomes and a reduction in urinary leukotriene E4 levels were observed during roflumilast plus montelukast treatment compared with placebo plus montelukast treatment. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of roflumilast.

Conclusion

The combination of roflumilast with montelukast compared with montelukast alone improved lung function and asthma control in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma and deserves further study for this indication.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonist, montelukast, can reduce the need for inhaled steroid while maintaining the clinical stability of asthmatic patients [^112LS2Pv]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists have been shown to have efficacy in chronic asthma.

Objective

To determine whether the addition of montelukast could lead to a reduction in inhaled corticosteroid dose without a significant decrease in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).

Methods

After a 4-week run-in period, 191 moderate-to-severe asthmatic patients whose asthma had been well controlled with daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy (beclometasone dipropionate 800 to 1600 micro g/day), were randomly assigned to one of two treatments - placebo (n = 98) or montelukast 10 mg once daily (n = 93) - for a 24-week, multicentre, double-blind, treatment period. At the beginning of the active treatment period, the daily dose of inhaled corticosteroid was halved in all of the patients. In addition, the inhaled corticosteroid dose was subsequently titrated every 8 weeks, based on PEFR, asthma symptoms and beta-agonist use.

Results

After 8 weeks of a 50% reduction in inhaled corticosteroid use, morning PEFR increased by 5.3 ± 32.3 L/min from baseline in patients receiving montelukast and significantly decreased by 6.9 ± 29.0 L/min in those receiving placebo (P = 0.035). In addition, evening PEFR significantly decreased by 9.8 ± 28.5 L/min (P = 0.003) in the placebo group, but was maintained in the montelukast group. In spite of a subsequent 50% reduction in the inhaled corticosteroid dose every 8 weeks, morning and evening PEFRs were maintained over the 24-week treatment period in the montelukast group; PEFR significantly decreased in the placebo group. There was a significant difference between the two groups with regard to morning PEFR, therapy score and asthmatic score at weeks 8, 16 and 24, as well as evening PEFR at week 8. However, the symptom scores were not significantly different between the two groups or within each group.

Conclusion

These data suggest that montelukast reduces the need for inhaled corticosteroids while maintaining asthma control over a 24-week period. Therefore, montelukast may be useful for long-term treatment in patients with asthma who require high doses of inhaled corticosteroids.

### Long-acting beta2-agonists versus anti-leukotrienes as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids for chronic asthma [^115u3Yc9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms despite taking regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent a management challenge. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) agents may both be considered as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

Objectives

We compare the efficacy and safety profile of adding either daily LABA or LTRA in asthmatic patients with asthma who remained symptomatic on ICS.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL databases were searched for randomised controlled trials up to and including January 2004. Reference lists of all included studies and reviews were screened to identify potentially relevant citations. Inquiries regarding other published or unpublished studies supported by the authors of the included studies or pharmaceutical companies who manufacture these agents were made. Conference proceedings of major respiratory meetings were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials conducted in adults or children with recurrent asthma where a LABA (for example, salmeterol or formoterol) or LTRA (for example, montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast) was added to ICS for a minimum of 28 days were considered for inclusion. Inhaled short-acting β₂-agonists and short courses of oral steroids were permitted as rescue medications. Other daily asthma treatments were permitted, providing the dose remained constant during the intervention period. Two reviewers independently reviewed the literature searches.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and trial quality assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Whenever possible, primary study authors were requested to confirm methodology and data extraction and to provide additional information and clarification when needed. Where necessary, expansion of graphic reproductions and estimation from other data presented in the paper was performed.

Main Results

Twelve randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria; only eight trials including 5,895 patients, provided data in sufficient details to allow aggregation. All eight trials pertained to adults with moderate airway obstruction (% predicted FEV₁ 66–76%) at baseline. Montelukast (n = 6) or Zafirlukast (n = 2) was compared to Salmeterol (n = 7) or Formoterol (n = 1) as add-on therapy to 400–565 mcg of beclomethasone or equivalent. Risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was significantly lower with LABA+ICS when compared to LTRA+ICS (RR = 0.83, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI): 0.71, 0.97): the number needed to treat with LABA compared to LTRA, to prevent one exacerbation over 48 weeks, was 38 (95% CI: 23 to 247). The following outcomes also improved significantly with the addition of LABA compared to LTRA to inhaled steroids (Weighted Mean Difference; 95%CI): morning PEFR (16 L/min; 13 to 18), evening PEFR (12 L/min; 9 to 15), FEV₁ (80 mL; 60 to 100), rescue-free days (9%; 4 to 14), symptom-free days (6%; 2 to 11), rescue beta2-agonists (-0.4 puffs/day; -0.2 to -0.5), quality of life (0.1; 0.05 to 0.2), symptom score (Standard Mean Difference -0.2; -0.1 to -0.3), night awakenings (-0.1/week; -0.06 to -0.2) and patient satisfaction (RR 1.12; 1.07 to 1.16). Risk of withdrawals due to any reason was significantly lower with LABA+ICS compared to LTRA+ICS (Relative Risk 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96). Withdrawals due to adverse events or due to poor asthma control, hospitalisation, osteopenia, serious adverse events, overall adverse events, headache or cardiovascular events were not significantly different between the two study groups.

Authors' Conclusions

In asthmatic adults inadequately controlled on low doses of inhaled steroids, the addition of LABA is superior to LTRA for preventing exacerbations requiring systemic steroids, and for improving lung function, symptoms, and use of rescue beta2-agonists.

### Comparison of ICS dose reduction vs. montelukast discontinuation for step-down therapy in well-controlled asthma: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^111Gqsow]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

While asthma guidelines advocate for reducing inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses in well-controlled patients, limited evidence exists to directly support this approach. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of ICS dose reduction versus montelukast discontinuation as step-down strategies in adults with well-controlled asthma.

Methods

This single-center, pilot randomized controlled trial enrolled 73 adults with well-controlled asthma. Participants were randomized to either Group A: ICS Dose Reduction (n = 37) or Group B: Montelukast Discontinuation (n = 36). Both groups received standard care and their designated intervention for three months. The primary outcome was asthma control measured by the ACT score. Secondary outcomes included lung function, asthma exacerbation frequency, treatment failure rates, and cough symptoms. Medication adherence was assessed using dose counters and pill counts.

Results

There was no significant difference in overall asthma control between the groups, as measured by the ACT score (p = 0.42). However, patients in Group A (reduced ICS) experienced significantly fewer treatment failures compared to Group B (discontinued montelukast) at three months (p = 0.01). No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

Although the ACT scores did not significantly differ between the groups, we did observe a trend towards fewer treatment failures in the ICS reduction group. This suggests that reducing ICS doses may help to maintain asthma control and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, further research is warranted to confirm these findings in larger, long-term studies.

### Montelukast (montelukast sodium) [^1148XYQb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium.

Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse reaction profile did not significantly change.

Pediatric Patients 6 to 14 Years of Age with Asthma

Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 476 pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age. Cumulatively, 289 pediatric patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, and 241 for one year or longer in clinical trials. The safety profile of montelukast sodium in the 8-week, double-blind, pediatric efficacy trial was generally similar to the adult safety profile. In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following reactions occurred with a frequency ≥ 2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: pharyngitis, influenza, fever, sinusitis, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, otitis, viral infection and laryngitis. The frequency of less common adverse reactions was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. With prolonged treatment, the adverse reactions profile did not significantly change.

### Risk factors for montelukast treatment failure in step-down therapy for controlled asthma [^112NFMfW]. The Journal of Asthma (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Leukotriene receptor antagonists including montelukast are an option for step-down therapy for mild asthmatics controlled on low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Because some patients fail montelukast step-down therapy, it would be helpful for clinicians to be able to predict the risk of treatment failure.

Objectives

To determine patient characteristics associated with montelukast treatment failure and develop a clinical index to predict the risk of montelukast treatment failure.

Methods

Using the 165 participants in the Leukotriene or Corticosteroid or Corticosteroid-Salmeterol Study (LOCCS) trial who were stepped down from low-dose ICS to montelukast, we determined associations between enrollment variables and treatment failure. We constructed a montelukast failure index to predict the risk of montelukast treatment failure during step-down. To assess its specificity for montelukast, index performance was evaluated in the other LOCCS treatment groups.

Results

Characteristics independently associated with montelukast treatment failure included age of asthma onset < 10 years old (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.17–5.02; p = .018), need for steroid burst in the last year (OR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.13–5.09; p = .022), and pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁) (OR = 1.44 per 10% lower % predicted; 95% CI = 1.07–1.97; p = .016). A montelukast failure index was generated from these three variables (range: -5 to 7 points). Scores < 0 predicted low risk (< 0.20) of treatment failure, whereas scores > 5 predicted high risk (> 0.60) of treatment failure.

Conclusion

Early asthma onset, worse asthma control in the last year, and lower pre-bronchodilator FEV₁ are associated with montelukast treatment failure. A montelukast failure index is proposed to quantify the risk of failure prior to treatment initiation.

### Randomized comparison of strategies for reducing treatment in mild persistent asthma [^113iJXWy]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment guidelines recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with asthma who have persistent symptoms and the "stepping down" of therapy to the minimum needed to maintain control of asthma. Whether patients with asthma that is well controlled with the use of inhaled corticosteroids twice daily can receive a step-down treatment with once-daily montelukast (our primary hypothesis) or once-daily fluticasone propionate plus salmeterol (our secondary hypothesis) has not yet been determined.

Methods

We randomly assigned 500 patients with asthma that was well controlled by inhaled fluticasone (100 microg twice daily) to receive continued fluticasone (100 microg twice daily) (169 patients), montelukast (5 or 10 mg each night) (166 patients), or fluticasone (100 microg) plus salmeterol (50 microg) each night (165 patients). Treatment was administered for 16 weeks in a double-blind manner. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure.

Results

Approximately 20% of patients assigned to receive continued fluticasone or switched to treatment with fluticasone plus salmeterol had treatment failure, as compared with 30.3% of subjects switched to montelukast. The hazard ratio for both comparisons was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.03). The percentage of days on which patients were free of asthma symptoms (78.7 to 85.8%) was similar across the three groups.

Conclusions

Patients with asthma that is well controlled with the use of twice-daily inhaled fluticasone can be switched to once-daily fluticasone plus salmeterol without increased rates of treatment failure. A switch to montelukast results in an increased rate of treatment failure and decreased asthma control; however, patients taking montelukast remained free of symptoms on 78.7% of treatment days.

### Risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with montelukast use in children and adolescents: a population-based case-crossover study [^1146kAZe]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), is widely prescribed for allergic rhinitis and asthma in children and adolescents. It is used as a preventative measure for patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma, and as an additional treatment for those whose asthma symptoms are uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids. Montelukast has been used extensively in children and adolescents because it can be easily administered orally. However, postmarketing case reports showed a possible risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPAEs) associated with montelukast use. Therefore, in 2008, a warning about NPAEs was included under the 'Precautions Section' of the montelukast label as advised by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The reported NPAEs were agitation, aggression, anxiety, depression, insomnia, irritability, suicidal ideation/attempts and suicide. The FDA further announced the strengthening of an existing boxed warning of montelukast in 2020. A possible explanation for montelukast-associated NPAEs is a montelukast-glutathione (GSH) conjugate leading to the possible progression of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and stress.

An increased risk of NPAEs associated with montelukast was not found in other observational studies, according to the FDA. However, these studies had shortcomings. There were possibilities of imprecise defining of exposures, outcomes, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and covariates, in which the Sentinel study recommended a careful interpretation of data. In addition, the data used in the study were from 2000 to 2015. To reflect on the current situation more effectively, the use of the most recent data available is needed. Other studies have shown a possible risk of NPAEs in association with montelukast. The overall risk of NPAEs did not increase in patients using LTRAs; an increase was noticed in a 4-day to 14-day window of initiation of LTRAs from a self-controlled case series (SCCS) study. A nested case-control study showed children with asthma who experienced an NPAE had nearly twice the odds of having been prescribed montelukast. The association between the risk of NPAEs and montelukast use remains unclear.

This study was conducted to observe whether there is an increased risk of NPAEs associated with montelukast use in children and adolescents using a case-crossover study design that allows study subjects to act as their own controls, minimising intersubject variability.

Seasonal allergic rhinitis: Once daily for patients 15 years and older (2.3).
Perennial allergic rhinitis: Once daily for patients 15 years and older (2.3).

Dosage (by age):

15 years and older: one 10-mg tablet (2).

Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one dose daily in the evening (2.4).

2.1 Asthma

For asthma, administer montelukast sodium tablets orally once daily in the evening, with or without food. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing.

The following doses are recommended:

Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.

2.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)

For prevention of EIB, administer a single dose of montelukast sodium tablets orally at least 2 hours, before exercise. The following doses are recommended:

An additional dose of montelukast sodium tablets should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium tablets daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting β-agonist.

Daily administration of montelukast sodium tablets for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB.

2.3 Allergic Rhinitis

For allergic rhinitis, administer montelukast sodium tablets orally once daily without regard to time of food ingestion. Time of administration in patients with allergic rhinitis can be individualized to suit patient needs.

The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended:

The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are recommended:

Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time.

2.4 Asthma and Allergic Rhinitis

For patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis, administer only one montelukast sodium tablets dose orally once daily in the evening.

### Boxed warning about mental health side effects for singulair… [^116DvfPo]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Boxed Warning was appropriate. Because of the risk of mental health side effects, the benefits of montelukast may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with other medicines. For allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, we have determined that montelukast should be reserved for those who are not treated effectively with or cannot tolerate other allergy medicines. For patients with asthma, we recommend that health care professionals consider the benefits and risks of mental health side effects before prescribing montelukast. Montelukast works to help improve symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinitis by blocking substances in the body that may cause them. Montelukast was first approved by FDA in 1998. It is marketed under the brand name Singulair and as generics.

Patients and parents/caregivers should stop montelukast and discuss with a health care professional right away if you or your child experience behavior or mood-related changes while taking the medicine. These may include: You should take montelukast for allergic rhinitis or hay fever only if you cannot tolerate other medicines or they do not work for you. Many other safe and effective allergy medicines are widely available, including over-the-counter medicines without a prescription. 1 Although new data regarding the risk of mental health side effects with montelukast are limited, we decided to strengthen the warnings by requiring a Boxed Warning. Due to the wide availability of alternative safe and effective allergy medicines with long histories of safety, we have reevaluated the risks and benefits of montelukast and have determined it should not be the first choice treatment particularly when allergic rhinitis symptoms are mild.

In addition, many health care professionals and patients/caregivers are not aware of the risk of mental health side effects despite the existing warnings in the prescribing information.
- Montelukast blocks substances in the body called leukotrienes to help improve symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinitis.
- Montelukast is marketed under the brand name Singulair and as generics. It is available as tablets, chewable tablets, and oral granules.
- Common side effects of montelukast include upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, stomach pain, diarrhea, earache or ear infection, flu, runny nose, and sinus infection.

### Administrators of the montelukast (singulair) side effects support… [^115Qhwjz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmaceutical Safety and Accountability, has advocated for the safer use of montelukast and research into its side effects. We know from published research that montelukast crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in the brain over time and at levels substantially higher than other body tissues after 24 hours1. Montelukast inhibits GPR172, a G-protein coupled receptor that is expressed on. montelukast works and its effects on the brain, particularly on children's brains, is incredibly important, given the enormous popularity and global distribution of this drug. WITHDRAWAL SIDE EFFECTS The FDA currently advises users to stop montelukast immediately if side effects occur. However, our members continue to report an intense and, at times, life-threatening withdrawal upon. problems later in life. Research needs to look at the long-term implications of taking montelukast. DOES MONTELUKAST SUBSTANTIALLY ALTER THE MICROBIOME.

Gastrointestinal problems were the first side effect noted by the FDA during pre-clinical trials8. Over the years, our members have reported digestive issues both during use and upon. discontinuation. These problems range from diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, acid reflux, IBS, H pylori and newly diagnosed celiac, to name only a few. Could montelukast use substantially impact the microbiome balance to cause a chronic GI illness. Could this explain the chemical sensitivities that are experienced during and after use. A recent study in Nature. lists Montelukast as a drug that alters
- and is altered by
- the bacteria in the microbiome. Montelukast was one of several drugs that were both bioaccumulated by some gut bacteria and degraded by others. 9 INCREASED SENSITIVITIES Our members continue to report extreme reactions to other medications, additives, heat. being on montelukast dysregulate the immune system. Montelukast side effects include tonsillitis, which can lead to PANDAS.

Those who suffer from PANS or PANDAS often carry an infection that has crossed over into the brain11. Mice using montelukast showed increased Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial counts from nasal lavage.

### FDA requires boxed warning about serious mental health side effects… [^116PcPVk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Because of the risk of mental health side effects, the benefits of montelukast may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with other medicines. For allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, we have determined that montelukast should be reserved for those who are not. prescribing information of montelukast to describe these serious mental health side effects and to recommend that montelukast should only be reserved to treat allergic rhinitis in patients who are not treated effectively with or cannot tolerate other allergy medicines. We are also requiring a new patient Medication Guide to educate patients and parents/caregivers about the medicine. What is montelukast and how can it help me. Montelukast is FDA-approved for asthma and allergies. It is a prescription medicine approved to prevent asthma attacks and for long-term treatment of asthma in adults and.

### Montelukast for management of persistent asthma… [^115MF2bX]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

1) better than placebo. Use of montelukast also decreased nocturnal awakenings from asthma and decreased use of a short-acting beta agonist inhaler by 25 percent compared with a 10 percent decrease with placebo. The beneficial effects were near maximum within 24 hours after the first dose and were maintained for the course of the trial. An eight-week trial demonstrated similar beneficial results. Montelukast is not recommended for use alone as prophylaxis or treatment of exercise-induced bronchospasm. In a 12-week trial, 10 mg of montelukast taken daily was less effective than inhaled beclomethasone, 200 μg twice daily, in increasing FEV₁ in patients with moderate asthma. In a study of patients whose asthma was not adequately controlled with inhaled beclomethasone, the addition of montelukast proved more effective than the addition of placebo in improving lung function and decreasing symptoms.

Adults with asthma that was well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids were able to decrease their corticosteroid dosage by 47 percent, compared with a 30 percent reduction with placebo. Montelukast is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaches a peak in three to four hours and is excreted mainly in bile. Hepatotoxicity and Churg-Strauss vasculitis have not been reported with the use of montelukast. Use of higher-than-recommended dosages of montelukast does not appear to increase the incidence of adverse effects. In short-term studies, the frequency of adverse events with montelukast is similar to that of placebo. Montelukast appears to have fewer drug interactions than zafirlukast because it does not inhibit CYP-450 enzymes, so theophylline, warfarin, prednisone, estrogens or progestins may be used concurrently.

Montelukast is modestly effective in controlling mild to moderate persistent asthma and is approved for use in children. It is less effective than inhaled corticosteroids, but the combination of the two drugs can allow the patient to decrease the corticosteroid dosage by almost 50 percent. It is more convenient and has fewer drug reactions than zafirlukast or zileuton.
