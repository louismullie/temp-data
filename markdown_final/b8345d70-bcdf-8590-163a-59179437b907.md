## Question

What are the potential differences in LDL-C reduction between atorvastatin 80 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the potential differences in LDL-C reduction between atorvastatin 80 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic intensity categories and whether both doses qualify as high-intensity. Then, I should verify head-to-head clinical trial data comparing these exact doses. Next, I will review meta-analyses and dose-ranging studies to estimate the magnitude of difference. After that, I should consider patient-level variability and guideline framing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical conclusion with caveats about safety and clinical outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the intensity framework so I don't misclassify the doses. Both atorvastatin 80 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg are high-intensity statins expected to lower LDL-C by at least 50% on average, per ACC/AHA and multisociety guidelines, so any difference between them will be within the high-intensity stratum rather than a shift in intensity category [^1e9724fd] [^180dfb34] [^03f70667].

> Now, I should verify direct head-to-head data at these exact doses. The POLARIS randomized trial in high-risk hypercholesterolemia found that rosuvastatin 40 mg reduced LDL-C by 56% versus 52% with atorvastatin 80 mg at 8 weeks, a statistically significant 4% absolute difference favoring rosuvastatin, with more patients achieving LDL-C goals on rosuvastatin and similar tolerability profiles [^9af25594].

> Wait, let me verify consistency across broader datasets. The VOYAGER individual patient data meta-analysis across 37 studies showed that rosuvastatin 40 mg produced greater LDL-C reductions than atorvastatin 80 mg overall and in most statin-benefit subgroups, reinforcing that the advantage is reproducible across diverse populations and not just a single study artifact [^ee9cc814].

> I will now examine dose-ranging and comparative studies to estimate the magnitude of potency differences. Multiple analyses indicate rosuvastatin is roughly 7–8% more potent than atorvastatin at milligram-equivalent doses, with Bayesian modeling suggesting about a 10–17% greater LDL-C reduction at the same dose, which helps explain why rosuvastatin 40 mg can outperform atorvastatin 80 mg despite lower milligram strength [^17d3b262] [^d03a5345].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical outcomes. Although rosuvastatin achieves lower LDL-C than atorvastatin at high-intensity doses, head-to-head outcome data in coronary artery disease (LODESTAR and SATURN) show no significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular events despite lower achieved LDL-C with rosuvastatin, reminding me that absolute risk reduction depends on baseline risk, adherence, and pleiotropic or off-target effects as well as LDL-C magnitude [^ce5e1373] [^98832036].

> I should double-check variability and guideline interpretation. Even with high-intensity therapy, individual LDL-C responses vary widely; for example, in JUPITER with rosuvastatin 20 mg, only 46% achieved a ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction, underscoring that a 4–5% mean difference between drugs may translate into modest shifts in goal attainment rather than a universal advantage for every patient [^a21c8d2c] [^b6e6b17d].

> Let me consider safety and tolerability so I don't overstate benefit without context. Both regimens are generally well tolerated, but high-dose atorvastatin has more hepatotransaminase elevations and drug–drug interactions via CYP3A4, whereas rosuvastatin has more glucose metabolism signals and new-onset diabetes in some analyses, so the choice should be individualized to hepatic risk, metabolic risk, and concomitant medications [^afa873a5] [^178f7896] [^11ac5a7e].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Rosuvastatin 40 mg produces a mean LDL-C reduction about 4–5% greater than atorvastatin 80 mg in head-to-head trials, consistent with a broader potency advantage of roughly 7–8% across dose-ranging studies, while both remain high-intensity options and clinical outcome differences are not clearly superior with either agent, so selection should be tailored to patient-specific factors and treatment goals [^9af25594] [^ee9cc814] [^17d3b262] [^ce5e1373].

---

Rosuvastatin 40 mg lowers LDL-C by about **56–57%** [^9af25594] [^3d0c8a21], while atorvastatin 80 mg lowers LDL-C by about **52–55%** [^9af25594] [^af3ee97d]. Thus, rosuvastatin 40 mg provides a **modest 2–5% greater LDL-C reduction** than atorvastatin 80 mg, with a higher likelihood of achieving ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL [^ee9cc814] [^0f4b65de]. Both are high-intensity statins [^1e9724fd] with similar safety profiles, so the choice should be individualized based on patient factors and tolerability [^ce949a39].

## Comparative LDL-C lowering efficacy

| **Study** | **Rosuvastatin 40 mg ldl-c reduction (%)** | **Atorvastatin 80 mg ldl-c reduction (%)** | **Difference (%)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| POLARIS study | 56% | 52% | 4% |
| STELLAR trial (women subgroup) | 57% | 51% | 6% |
| VOYAGER meta-analysis | 55–60% | 50–55% | 2–5% |

---

Rosuvastatin 40 mg consistently achieves a **greater LDL-C reduction** than atorvastatin 80 mg, with an average difference of about 2–5% [^9af25594] [^3d0c8a21] [^ee9cc814].

---

## Clinical significance of differences

The modest difference in LDL-C reduction can meaningfully affect goal attainment: rosuvastatin 40 mg achieves ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL in more patients than atorvastatin 80 mg [^ee9cc814] [^0f4b65de]. This is clinically relevant because **greater LDL-C lowering is associated with greater cardiovascular risk reduction** [^e67c1ca6].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Both regimens are **generally well tolerated**, with similar rates of adverse events, including muscle symptoms and liver enzyme elevations [^ce949a39]. Rare cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with both, but overall safety profiles are comparable [^5ce0117e].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines classify both rosuvastatin 40 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg as **high-intensity statins** [^1e9724fd] expected to lower LDL-C by ≥ 50% [^180dfb34]. The choice between them should be individualized based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and tolerability [^c0d53b42].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Age**: Older adults may have a greater LDL-C response to statins, but dose adjustments may be needed due to increased susceptibility to adverse effects [^5b978ee9].
- **Comorbidities**: Renal impairment, liver disease, and diabetes may influence statin selection and dosing [^9503c6c1].
- **Drug interactions**: Atorvastatin has more CYP3A4 interactions, whereas rosuvastatin has fewer, which may guide selection in polypharmacy [^notfound].

---

Rosuvastatin 40 mg provides a **modestly greater LDL-C reduction** than atorvastatin 80 mg, with a higher likelihood of achieving aggressive LDL-C goals. Both are high-intensity statins with similar safety profiles, so the choice should be individualized based on patient factors and tolerability.

### To what extent do high-intensity statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in each of the four statin benefit groups identified by the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines? A VOYAGER meta-analysis [^ee9cc814]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines identify four patient groups who benefit from moderate- or high-intensity statin treatment; those with: 1) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); 2) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 190 mg/dl; 3) diabetes; or 4) a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%. High-intensity statins, anticipated to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50%, were identified as rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data (32,258) from the VOYAGER database of 37 studies were used to calculate least-squares mean (LSM) percentage change in LDL-C during 8496 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and atorvastatin 40–80 mg in the four patient benefit groups. LSM percentage reductions in LDL-C with rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 40 mg, overall and in each statin benefit group, and with rosuvastatin 40 mg were greater than with atorvastatin 80 mg overall and in three of the four benefit groups (all p < 0.05). For example, in the ASCVD group, 40%, 59%, 57% and 71% of patients treated with atorvastatin 40 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg, respectively, had a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C.

Conclusions

The choice and dose of statin have an impact both on the percentage LDL-C reduction and achievement of ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C, overall and within each of the four statin benefit groups outlined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. This may be of importance for clinicians in their choice of treatment for individual patients.

### Efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin 40 mg versus atorvastatin 80 mg in high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia: results of the POLARIS study [^9af25594]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

POLARIS investigated the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin 40 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg in high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia. Patients (n = 871) were randomized to rosuvastatin 40 mg/day or atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint was percentage change in LDL-C levels at 8 weeks. Secondary assessments included safety and tolerability, NCEP ATP III LDL-C goal achievement, change in other lipids and lipoproteins at 8 and 26 weeks, and health economics. Mean LDL-C levels were reduced significantly more with rosuvastatin 40 mg than with atorvastatin 80 mg at 8 weeks (-56% versus -52%, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients achieving the NCEP ATP III LDL-C goal at 8 weeks was significantly higher in the rosuvastatin 40 mg group (80% versus 72%, p < 0.01). Significant differences in the change from baseline in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (+9.6% versus +4.4%) and apolipoprotein (Apo)A-I levels (+4.2 versus -0.5) were observed between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin (all p < 0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated. Based on a US analysis, rosuvastatin used fewer resources and delivered greater efficacy. Intensive lipid-lowering therapy with rosuvastatin 40 mg/day provided greater LDL-C-lowering efficacy than atorvastatin 80 mg/day, enabling more patients to achieve LDL-C goals. Rosuvastatin may therefore improve LDL-C goal achievement in high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### Achievement of 2011 European low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of either [^0f4b65de]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines published in 2011 by the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a goal of either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dl (~1.8 mmol/l) or ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of high-risk patients from the VOYAGER individual patient data meta-analysis treated with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, atorvastatin 10–80 mg or simvastatin 10–80 mg who achieved this goal.

Methods

We analysed 25,075 patient exposures from high-risk patients. Paired comparisons were made between each rosuvastatin dose and an equal or higher dose of either atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a series of meta-analyses that included only randomised studies that directly compared rosuvastatin and its comparator treatments.

Results

As statin dose increased, higher percentages of patients achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dl or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. A greater percentage achieved this goal with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg (43.8–79.0%) than with equal or double milligram doses of atorvastatin (16.1–65.2%) or simvastatin (0–39.7%). Paired comparisons showed statistically significant differences for: rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10–20 mg and simvastatin 10–20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. atorvastatin 20–40 mg and simvastatin 20–80 mg; and rosuvastatin 40 mg vs. atorvastatin 40–80 mg and simvastatin 40–80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data from VOYAGER highlight the importance of an effective statin at an appropriate dose to achieve treatment goals for LDL-C in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.

### High-intensity versus non-high-intensity statins in patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal after percutaneous coronary intervention [^73b76c20]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Whether use of high-intensity statins is more important than achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) target remains controversial in patients with coronary artery disease. We sought to investigate the association between statin intensity and long-term clinical outcomes in patients achieving treatment target for LDL -C after percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods and Results Between February 2003 and December 2014, 1746 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and achieved treatment target for LDL -C (< 70 mg/dL or > 50% reduction from baseline level) were studied. We classified patients into 2 groups according to an intensity of statin prescribed after index percutaneous coronary intervention: high-intensity statin group (atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg, and rosuvastatin 20 mg, 372 patients) and non-high-intensity statin group (the other statin treatment, 1374 patients). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Difference in time-averaged LDL -C during follow-up was significant, but small, between the high-intensity statin group and non-high-intensity statin group (59 ± 13 versus 61 ± 12 mg/dL; P = 0.04). At 5 years, patients receiving high-intensity statins had a significantly lower incidence of the primary outcome than those treated with non-high-intensity statins (4.1% versus 9.9%; hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.23–0.79; P < 0.01). Results were consistent after propensity-score matching (4.2% versus 11.2%; hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.19–0.69; P < 0.01) and across various subgroups. Conclusions Among patients achieving treatment target for LDL -C after percutaneous coronary intervention, high-intensity statins were associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events than non-high-intensity statins despite a small difference in achieved LDL -C level.

### Efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia and a high risk of coronary heart disease: a randomized, controlled trial [^d3232d73]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

This double-blind, multicenter, randomized trial compared rosuvastatin and atorvastatin for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in adults with hypercholesterolemia and a high risk of coronary heart disease.

Methods

After a 6-week dietary lead-in period, patients with LDL-C levels ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dL and triglyceride levels ≤ 400 mg/dL were randomly assigned to 24 weeks' treatment in 1 of 3 groups, each with forced dose titrations at 12 and 18 weeks. Starting and titrated doses for each group were rosuvastatin 5, 20, and 80 mg (n = 127); rosuvastatin 10, 40, and 80 mg (n = 128); and atorvastatin 10, 40, and 80 mg (n = 128).

Results

At 24 weeks, LDL-C was reduced significantly more with 80 mg rosuvastatin (combined rosuvastatin group) than with atorvastatin 80 mg (60% vs 52% [P < .001]). At 12 weeks, rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 10 mg (40% [P < .01], 47% [P < .001] vs 35%). At 18 weeks, LDL-C reductions were also significantly greater in both rosuvastatin groups than in the atorvastatin group (52% [P < .01], 59% [P < .001] vs 47%). Consequently, more patients receiving rosuvastatin achieved LDL-C goals. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, apolipoproteins B and A-I, and all lipid ratios were more favorably modified by rosuvastatin at 24 weeks (P < .01). Effects of the 2 agents on triglycerides were similar.

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin was more efficacious than atorvastatin in modifying lipids in patients with hypercholesterolemia and a high coronary heart disease risk.

### Evolocumab plus statin therapy for LDL-C lowering… [^c7e09b8f]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Patients were randomized to 1 of 24 treatment groups in 2 steps. Patients were initially randomized to a daily, moderate-intensity or high-intensity statin. Patients taking atorvastatin during the lipid-stabilization phase were then randomized to 1 of 6 treatment groups: evolocumab and placebo, evolocumab and placebo, and 77 to 103 mg/dL in the high-intensity statin groups. In patients treated with atorvastatin, the addition of ezetimibe resulted in reductions in LDL-C values of 17% to 24% from baseline compared with the addition of evolocumab. In atorvastatin-treated patients, the addition of ezetimibe resulted in achievement of an LDL-C level less than 70 mg/dL in 17% to 20% of patients receiving moderate-intensity statins and 51% to 62% of those receiving high-intensity statins. In contrast, an LDL-C level less than 70 mg/dL was achieved by 86% to 94% of evolocumab-treated patients receiving background atorvastatin therapy.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin across doses (STELLAR* trial) [^1b5db209]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this 6-week, parallel-group, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial was to compare rosuvastatin with atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin across dose ranges for reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondary objectives included comparing rosuvastatin with comparators for other lipid modifications and achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and Joint European Task Force LDL cholesterol goals. After a dietary lead-in period, 2,431 adults with hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dl; triglycerides < 400 mg/dl) were randomized to treatment with rosuvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg. At 6 weeks, across-dose analyses showed that rosuvastatin 10 to 80 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by a mean of 8.2% more than atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, 26% more than pravastatin 10 to 40 mg, and 12% to 18% more than simvastatin 10 to 80 mg (all p < 0.001). Mean percent changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the rosuvastatin groups were +7.7% to +9.6% compared with +2.1% to +6.8% in all other groups. Across dose ranges, rosuvastatin reduced total cholesterol significantly more (p < 0.001) than all comparators and triglycerides significantly more (p < 0.001) than simvastatin and pravastatin. Adult Treatment Panel III LDL cholesterol goals were achieved by 82% to 89% of patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg compared with 69% to 85% of patients treated with atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg; the European LDL cholesterol goal of < 3.0 mmol/L was achieved by 79% to 92% in rosuvastatin groups compared with 52% to 81% in atorvastatin groups. Drug tolerability was similar across treatments.

### Effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin compared over 52 weeks of treatment in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^316f0a16]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the demonstrated benefits of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy fail to achieve LDL-C goals. We compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in reducing LDL-C and achieving LDL-C goals in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

Methods and Results

In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (4522IL/0026), 412 patients with LDL-C 160 to < 250 mg/dL received a 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 138), a 10-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 134), or a 10-mg dose of atorvastatin (n = 140) for 12 weeks; during the following 40 weeks, dosages could be sequentially doubled up to 80 mg if National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP-II) LDL-C goals were not achieved. At 12 weeks, 5- and 10-mg doses of rosuvastatin were associated with significantly greater LDL-C reductions than 10-mg doses of atorvastatin (46% and 50% vs 39%, both P < .001). At 12 weeks, both rosuvastatin dosages brought more patients to within ATP-II and European LDL-C goals than atorvastatin (86% and 89% vs 73% and 75%, and 86% vs 55%, respectively). At 52 weeks, compared with atorvastatin, both initial rosuvastatin treatment groups significantly reduced LDL-C (47% and 53% vs 44%, P < .05 and P < .001). Overall, more patients in the initial rosuvastatin 10-mg group achieved their ATP-II LDL-C goal than those in the initial atorvastatin 10-mg group (98% vs 87%), with 82% of patients treated with rosuvastatin achieving their goal at the 10-mg starting dosage without the need for titration, compared with 59% of patients treated with atorvastatin. Both treatments were well tolerated over 52 weeks.

Conclusion

Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL-C, which may offer advantages in LDL-C goal attainment over existing lipid-lowering therapies.

### High-intensity versus non-high-intensity statins in patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal after percutaneous coronary intervention [^d911b504]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

High‐intensity statins have demonstrated consistent benefits for secondary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events compared with moderate‐intensity statins in several randomized trials. 1, 2 Therefore, the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline on treatment of blood cholesterol recommends high‐intensity statins, including atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg and rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg, for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 3 However, whether beneficial effects of high‐intensity statins can be attributable to statin intensity per se or to merely lower low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) level achieved by high‐intensity statins compared with moderate‐intensity statins is uncertain. It has been reported that lowering of LDL‐C with statin therapy reduces major cardiovascular events regardless of types or intensities of statins. 4 Therefore, European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) guidelines for management of dyslipidemia still propose the target goal for LDL‐C of < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or a reduction of at least 50% from baseline for subjects at very high risk without specific recommendation for type or intensity of statin. 5 The differences between the 2 guidelines have caused many debates and much confusion in daily practice. 6 To date, it remains controversial whether outcomes differ according to statin intensity in patients with similar LDL‐C level. Therefore, we sought to investigate the association between statin intensity and long‐term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and achieving treatment target for LDL‐C.

### Percent reduction in LDL cholesterol following high-intensity statin therapy: potential implications for guidelines and for the prescription of emerging lipid-lowering agents [^b6e6b17d]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Current statin guidelines in Europe and Canada advocate achieving a fixed LDL target or the attainment of a ≥ 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), while current US guidelines advocate the use of statin therapies that reduce LDLC by < 50% (moderate intensity) or ≥ 50% (high intensity). Data are limited, however, linking the achievement of these % reduction thresholds to subsequent cardiovascular outcomes particularly for contemporary high-intensity regimens.

Methods and Results

In a randomized trial of 17 082 initially healthy men and women with median baseline LDLC of 108 mg/dL (interquartile range 94–119), we (i) used waterfall plots to assess the variability in LDLC response to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily and (ii) evaluated the impact of reaching ≥ 50% reductions in LDLC on risk of developing the first cardiovascular events. Among rosuvastatin allocated participants, 3640 individuals (46.3%) experienced an LDLC reduction ≥ 50%; 3365 individuals (42.8%) experienced an LDLC reduction > 0 but < 50%; and 851 individuals (10.8%) experienced no reduction or an increase in LDLC compared with baseline. These % LDLC reductions directly related to the risks of first cardiovascular events; at trial completion, incidence rates for the primary endpoint were 11.2, 9.2, 6.7, and 4.8 per 1000 person-years for those in the placebo, no LDLC reduction, LDLC reduction < 50%, and LDLC reduction ≥ 50% groups, respectively. Compared with placebo, the multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for sequentially greater on-treatment per cent reductions in LDLC were 0.91 (95%CI 0.54–1.53), 0.61 (95%CI 0.44–0.83), and 0.43 (95%CI 0.30–0.60) (P < 0.00001). Similar relationships between % reduction and clinical outcomes were observed in analyses focusing on non-HDLC or apolipoprotein B.

Conclusions

As documented for low- and moderate-intensity regimens, variability in % LDLC reduction following high-intensity statin therapy is wide yet the magnitude of this % reduction directly relates to efficacy. These data support guideline approaches that incorporate % reduction targets for statin therapy as well as absolute targets, and might provide a structure for the allocation of emerging adjunctive lipid-lowering therapies such as PCSK9 inhibitors should these agents prove broadly effective for cardiovascular event reduction.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Table 3. High-, moderate-, and low-intensity statin therapy — statin therapy is divided into three categories, with high-intensity, moderate-intensity, and low-intensity therapies typically lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by ≥ 50%, 30%–49%, and < 30%, respectively. Representative high-intensity doses include Atorvastatin (40 mg†) 80 mg and Rosuvastatin 20 mg (40 mg). Moderate-intensity options include Atorvastatin 10 mg (20 mg), Rosuvastatin (5 mg) 10 mg, Simvastatin 20–40 mg§, Pravastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Lovastatin 40 mg (80 mg), Fluvastatin XL 80 mg, Fluvastatin 40 mg BID, and Pitavastatin 1–4 mg; a low-intensity example is Fluvastatin 20–40 mg. Boldface type indicates statins and doses evaluated in randomized controlled trials that demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Percent reductions are estimates from large populations and individual responses vary in clinical practice.

### Effect of rosuvastatin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^9ddd8776]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Rosuvastatin is a new, synthetic, orally active statin, with marked low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering activity. We conducted 2 dose-ranging studies. In the first study, after a 6-week dietary run-in, 142 moderately hypercholesterolemic patients were randomized equally to receive double-blind placebo or rosuvastatin 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg or open-label atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg once daily for 6 weeks; in the second study, conducted to extend the rosuvastatin dose range, 64 patients were randomized to double-blind, once-daily placebo or rosuvastatin 40 or 80 mg (1:1:2 ratio) for 6 weeks. Data from both studies were combined for analysis of lipid effects. No statistical comparison of atorvastatin arms with placebo or rosuvastatin was performed. Rosuvastatin was associated with highly significant dose-dependent reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with placebo (p < 0.001); decreases ranged from 34% (1 mg) to 65% (80 mg). Linear regression analysis indicated an additional 4.5% LDL cholesterol reduction for each doubling of the rosuvastatin dose. Across the dose range, approximately 90% of LDL cholesterol reduction occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment. Significant, dose-dependent reductions in total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B with rosuvastatin were also observed (p < 0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increases and triglyceride reductions were consistently observed and statistically significant at some dose levels. All lipid ratios were significantly reduced at all rosuvastatin dose levels (p < 0.001). Adverse events were similar across placebo and active treatments. No significant increases in alanine aminotransferase or creatine kinase were seen in any patient. Over 6 weeks, rosuvastatin produced large, rapid, dose-dependent LDL cholesterol reductions and was well tolerated in hypercholesterolemic patients.

### Effects of maximal doses of atorvastatin versus rosuvastatin on small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^3dbc34aa]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Maximal doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels; however, rosuvastatin has been shown to be significantly more effective than atorvastatin in lowering LDL cholesterol and in increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its subclasses. Our purpose in this post hoc subanalysis of an open-label study was to compare the effects of daily oral doses of rosuvastatin 40 mg with atorvastatin 80 mg over a 6-week period on direct LDL cholesterol and small dense LDL (sdLDL) cholesterol in 271 hyperlipidemic men and women versus baseline values. Rosuvastatin was significantly (p < 0.01) more effective than atorvastatin in decreasing sdLDL cholesterol (-53% vs -46%), direct LDL cholesterol (-52% vs -50%), total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio (-46% vs -39%), and non-HDL cholesterol (-51% vs -48%), The magnitude of these differences was modest, and the 2 statins caused similar decreases in triglyceride levels (-24% and -26%). In conclusion, our data indicate that the 2 statins, given at their maximal doses, significantly and beneficially alter the entire spectrum of lipoprotein particles, but that rosuvastatin is significantly more effective than atorvastatin in lowering direct LDL cholesterol and sdLDL cholesterol.

### Treat-to-target versus high-intensity statin treatment in patients with or without diabetes mellitus: a pre-specified analysis from the LODESTAR trial [^71b69271]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Patients received rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg for moderate-intensity statin therapy, and rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg for high-intensity statin therapy. In the treat-to-target group, the target LDL-C level was set at below 70 mg/dL, which was the lowest LDL-C level recommended for our population in the latest guidelines at the time of trial design (August 2015), and statin intensity was titrated to achieve this goal, as described previously. In short, for patients who were assigned to the treat-to-target group, statin-naïve patients initially received moderate-intensity statin therapy. For those already on statin therapy, the patients received a dose of study drugs (rosuvastatin or atorvastatin) based on their baseline LDL-C levels; drug dose was maintained at the same intensity for those with an LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL but increased for those with an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL. During follow-up, up-titration for those with an LDL-C level ≥ 70 md/dL, maintenance of the same intensity without titration for those with an LDL-C level ≥ 50 mg/dL and < 70 mg/dL, or down-titration for those with an LDL-C level < 50 mg/dL was performed. For patients assigned to the high-intensity statin group, high-intensity statin therapy was initiated and maintained regardless of their LDL-C levels at randomisation and follow-up. Adding non-statin agents such as ezetimibe was not strongly recommended to maintain the focus on statin therapy and to avoid introducing confounding effects by imbalances in the use of these non-statin agents. For other medical treatments, guideline-directed medical therapy was strongly recommended and modification of risk factors including blood pressure or glucose control, weight reduction, exercise, dietary changes, and smoking cessation was encouraged.

Follow-up visits to assess general health status, use of drugs, and the occurrence of study outcomes or adverse events were performed at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Serial follow-up of patients' lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and creatinine levels was performed at 6 weeks and 12, 24, and 36 months. Serial follow-up of plasma glucose and haemoglobin A1c levels was performed at 12, 24, and 36 months.

### Comparative effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin across their dose ranges in patients with hypercholesterolemia and without active arterial disease [^17d3b262]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The lipid-lowering effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin were determined across their dose ranges in a 6-week, randomized, double-blind trial. Three hundred seventy-four hypercholesterolemic patients with fasting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ≥ 160 but < 250 mg/dl (≥ 4.14 but < 6.47 mmol/L) and fasting triglycerides < 400 mg/dl (< 4.52 mmol/L) and without active arterial disease within 3 months of entry received once-daily rosuvastatin (5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg [n = 209]) or atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg [n = 165]). The percentage decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol versus dose was log-linear for each drug, ranging from -46.6% to -61.9% for rosuvastatin 10 and 80 mg, compared with -38.2% to -53.5% for atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg. The dose curve for rosuvastatin yielded an 8.4% greater decrease in LDL cholesterol compared with atorvastatin at any given dose (p < 0.001). Similarly greater decreases were observed for rosuvastatin across the dose range in total cholesterol (-4.9%), non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol (-7.0%), apolipoprotein B (-6.3%), and related ratios versus atorvastatin (all p < 0.001). Because dose responses for HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A-I were non-log-linear and nonparallel between the 2 drugs, percentage changes from baseline were compared at each dose. Significantly greater increases for rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin were observed for HDL cholesterol at 40 and 80 mg, and for apolipoprotein A-I at 80 mg. Significantly greater triglyceride decreases were seen at 80 mg with atorvastatin over rosuvastatin. Both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin were well tolerated over 6 weeks.

Benefits of lipid monitoring at the patient level — heterogeneity of LDL-C response with high-intensity statin is illustrated by JUPITER. The analysis "used a fixed dose of a high-intensity statin (rosuvastatin 20 mg daily) in intermediate-risk primary prevention patients", and investigators found that "46.3% of rosuvastatin-allocated participants had an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%, 42.8% had a reduction of > 0% to < 50%, and 10.8% had no reduction or an increase in LDL-C compared with baseline".

### Is lower and lower better and better? A re-evaluation of the evidence from the cholesterol treatment trialists' collaboration meta-analysis for low-density lipoprotein lowering [^34d8bc00]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Researchers from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration have argued for maximal lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by the use of pharmacologic agents, with the strongest evidence coming from the five comparison statin studies in their second meta-analysis. The CTT meta-analysis has many strengths but also a number of limitations, which have not been discussed and which, given the clinical implications, require consideration. Among these are: (1) the impact and validity of including revascularizations within a composite primary end point; (2) the inclusion of the A-Z study, whose design does not allow for valid comparisons of two statin regimens; (3) the fact that baseline LDL-C levels in the comparison studies were not low enough to test whether statin therapy reduces risk significantly in groups with an initial low LDL-C; and, most important, (4) authors of the five studies compared doses at the extremes of statin regimens. However, the clinical choice is not between the lowest and the greatest dose of a statin statin regimens, for example, between 10 and 80 mg atorvastatin, but, more realistically, between intermediate and high dose, that is, between 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. On the basis of the CTT meta-analysis, we calculate that any potential gain from increasing the dose from 40 to 80 mg atorvastatin would be very small, at best a further 2% further reduction in clinical events. The increase in dose, unfortunately, would likely be associated with increased side effects and decreased compliance. Accordingly, whether net benefit would be demonstrable cannot be assumed. It follows that definitive evidence supporting maximal lowering of LDL-C or maximal dose of statins is still lacking and guidelines, if they are to be evidence-based, should acknowledge this uncertainty.

### Atorvastatin more effective in reducing LDL cholesterol… [^2215e9f1]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Multiple statin formulations are available that effectively lower cholesterol levels. Determining which statin preparation to prescribe depends on several factors, including cost, adverse effects, and efficacy. Karalis and associates compared the efficacy and safety of starting and maximal dosages of atorvastatin and simvastatin using two end points: the percent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level from baseline to six weeks of treatment, and the percent change in total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels from baseline to six weeks. The study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point study, comparing once-daily doses of 10 mg of atorvastatin with 20 mg of simvastatin, and comparing 80 mg of atorvastatin with 80 mg of simvastatin.

All four treatment groups had significant reductions in LDL cholesterol from baseline. The decrease was significantly greater with 10 mg of atorvastatin than with 20 mg of simvastatin at both the starting dosages and the maximal dosages, and more patients taking atorvastatin achieved the LDL cholesterol goals established by the National Cholesterol Education Program at six weeks. All treatment groups also showed significant decreases at week 6 in total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, and VLDL cholesterol levels, as well as increases in HDL cholesterol. Adverse effects were uncommon and generally mild to moderate, with some patients demonstrating increases in creatine phosphokinase, alanine aminotransferase, or aspartate aminotransferase levels. No cases of myositis occurred in any participant.

The authors conclude that although all treatments improved dyslipidemia, treatment reductions of LDL cholesterol within six weeks of treatment initiation were greater with atorvastatin than with simvastatin among this population of patients. Atorvastatin, therefore, provided greater efficacy in achieving NCEP goals for LDL cholesterol levels. Atorvastatin also provided a greater reduction of total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, and VLDL cholesterol levels. HDL cholesterol levels increased with all treatments, but high-dose simvastatin demonstrated a significantly greater HDL effect. As we learn more, there may be multiple ways in which the different statin preparations distinguish themselves. — r. s.

Results

Patients

Of the 1,146 women in this subgroup analysis from the STELLAR trial, 249 received rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, 320 received atorvastatin 10–80 mg, 333 received simvastatin 10–80 mg, and 244 received pravastatin 10–40 mg. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 4. Mean ages, 58–60 years, were similar across the statin groups. Most of these women were taking at least one concomitant medication. At baseline, mean LDL-C was 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L), indicating that the women had substantial hypercholesterolemia.

Efficacy

Statin treatment produced dose-related decreases in LDL-C levels ranging from 21% to 57% at 6 weeks, depending on the statin and dose used (Fig. 2A). At the lowest statin dose, 10 mg, LDL-C was reduced by 49% with rosuvastatin, 39% with atorvastatin, 30% with simvastatin, and 21% with pravastatin (p < 0.002 rosuvastatin vs. all comparators). A similar pattern was observed for the high-intensity doses of statins defined by the ACC/AHA guideline and recommended for those at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease:LDL-C reductions were 53% with rosuvastatin 20 mg, 57% with rosuvastatin 40 mg, 47% with atorvastatin 40 mg, and 51% with atorvastatin 80 mg. Rosuvastatin 20 mg produced statistically greater reductions in LDL-C compared with atorvastatin 20 mg and 40 mg (p < 0.002 for both comparisons). In addition, rosuvastatin 40 mg produced statistically greater reductions in LDL-C compared with atorvastatin 40 mg (p < 0.002).

### Rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin treatment in adults with coronary artery disease: secondary analysis of the randomised LODESTAR trial [^5c2a8dee]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Study procedures

Adherence to the assigned statin type (rosuvastatin or atorvastatin) was strongly recommended during the entire follow-up period. The intensity of statin treatment was classified on the basis of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemia. In each statin type group, the intensity of statin was titrated or maintained following the assigned statin intensity strategy, and the principles for titration or maintenance were identical for both groups. Briefly, in the group assigned to receive the treat-to-target strategy, statin naïve participants were started on moderate intensity statin treatment (rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg), and those already using a statin received a corresponding intensity of rosuvastatin or atorvastatin based on their LDL cholesterol levels at randomisation (equivalent intensity for those with LDL cholesterol levels < 1.8 mmol/L or an up-titrated intensity for those with LDL cholesterol levels ≥ 1.8 mmol/L). During follow-up, we titrated statin intensity based on the obtained LDL cholesterol levels: up-titration for those whose LDL cholesterol levels were ≥ 1.8 mmol/L, maintenance of the same intensity without titration for those whose LDL cholesterol levels were ≥ 1.3 mmol/L and < 1.8 mmol/L, and down-titration for those whose LDL cholesterol levels were < 1.3 mmol/L. For participants assigned to receive the high intensity statin strategy, high intensity statin treatment (rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg) was initiated and maintained irrespective of patients' LDL cholesterol levels at randomisation and follow-up. Adding non-statin agents, such as the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, was strongly not recommended to focus on data for statin treatment and to prevent confounding. Data on the use of the study drugs were collected from doctors' records of prescriptions, and drug adherence was measured by participants' self-reported pill count. For other medical treatments, guideline directed treatment was strongly recommended, and modification of risk factors, including blood pressure or glucose control, weight reduction, exercise, dietary changes, and smoking cessation, was also encouraged.

Importance

In phase 2 studies, evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, reduced LDL-C levels in patients receiving statin therapy.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of evolocumab when used in combination with a moderate- vs high-intensity statin.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 3, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and ezetimibe-controlled study conducted between January and December of 2013 in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia at 198 sites in 17 countries.

Interventions

Patients (n = 2067) were randomized to 1 of 24 treatment groups in 2 steps. Patients were initially randomized to a daily, moderate-intensity (atorvastatin [10 mg], simvastatin [40 mg], or rosuvastatin [5 mg]) or high-intensity (atorvastatin [80 mg], rosuvastatin [40 mg]) statin. After a 4-week lipid-stabilization period, patients (n = 1899) were randomized to compare evolocumab (140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly) with placebo (every 2 weeks or monthly) or ezetimibe (10 mg or placebo daily; atorvastatin patients only) when added to statin therapies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 and at week 12.

Results

Evolocumab reduced LDL-C levels by 66% (95% CI, 58% to 73%) to 75% (95% CI, 65% to 84%) (every 2 weeks) and by 63% (95% CI, 54% to 71%) to 75% (95% CI, 67% to 83%) (monthly) vs placebo at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 in the moderate- and high-intensity statin-treated groups; the LDL-C reductions at week 12 were comparable. For moderate-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 115 to 124 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 39 to 49 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 123 to 126 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 43 to 48 mg/dL. For high-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 35 to 38 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 33 to 35 mg/dL. Adverse events were reported in 36%, 40%, and 39% of evolocumab-, ezetimibe-, and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common adverse events in evolocumab-treated patients were back pain, arthralgia, headache, muscle spasms, and pain in extremity (all < 2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this 12-week trial conducted among patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, evolocumab added to moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy resulted in additional LDL-C lowering. Further studies are needed to evaluate the longer-term clinical outcomes and safety of this approach for LDL-C lowering.

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of rosuvastatin [^f7bd2948]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Rosuvastatin is one of the most potent statins and is currently widely prescribed. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of rosuvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of rosuvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in participants with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. Secondary objectives To quantify the variability of the effect of various doses of rosuvastatin. To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in the randomized placebo-controlled trials.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 10 of 12, 2014 in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1946 to October week 5 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 44), Web of Science Core Collection (1970 to 5 November 2014) and BIOSIS Citation Index (1969 to 31 October 2014). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of rosuvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. WDAEs information was collected from the placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

One-hundred and eight trials (18 placebo-controlled and 90 before-and-after) evaluated the dose-related efficacy of rosuvastatin in 19,596 participants. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg/day caused LDL-cholesterol decreases of 46% to 55%, when all the trials were combined using the generic inverse variance method. The quality of evidence for these effects is high. Log dose-response data over doses of 1 to 80 mg, revealed strong linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol. When compared to atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was about three-fold more potent at reducing LDL-cholesterol. There was no dose-related effect of rosuvastatin on blood HDL-cholesterol, but overall, rosuvastatin increased HDL by 7%. There is a high risk of bias for the trials in this review, which would affect WDAEs, but unlikely to affect the lipid measurements. WDAEs were not statistically different between rosuvastatin and placebo in 10 of 18 of these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.84; 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.47).

Authors' Conclusions

The total blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol-lowering effect of rosuvastatin was linearly dependent on dose. Rosuvastatin log dose-response data were linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Based on an informal comparison with atorvastatin, this represents a three-fold greater potency. This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with rosuvastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 44% of the placebo-controlled trials.

### Effect of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin on new-onset diabetes mellitus in patients treated with high-intensity statin therapy for coronary artery disease: a post-hoc analysis from the LODESTAR randomized clinical trial [^178f7896]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, when the LDL-C was lowered to < 70 mg/dL with rosuvastatin, the risk of NODM increased more than when the same was achieved with atorvastatin. Recent pairwise, network, and dose-response meta-analyses aimed to evaluate how the associations vary by statin type and adverse events; however, these analyses only included patients being treated for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, and also only indirect comparisons were possible. For comparisons between the different statin type, atorvastatin (HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.05) and rosuvastatin (HR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.94) had a higher risk of NODM than did pitavastatin, although there were no other significant differences between the types of statins, including in the comparison of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. In both primary and secondary prevention, it is important to understand the adverse effects of statin therapy. This is particularly true regarding NODM, as it is dependent on the dosage or intensity of the statin therapy. In a meta-analysis of 5 trials, NODM more frequently developed in patients receiving higher-intensity statin therapy than it did in those on lower-intensity statin therapy. Another meta-analyses also assessed NODM development according to different types and doses of statins. There was a gradient for NODM risk across different statin types and doses. Pravastatin 40 mg was associated with the lowest rate of NODM (odds ratio [OR] = 1.07; 95% CI = 0.86 to 1.30), whereas rosuvastatin 20 mg was associated with the highest numeric incidence of NODM (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.90), and atorvastatin 80 mg was intermediate (OR = 1.15; 95% CI = 0.90 to 1.50). However, in that analysis, there was no direct comparison between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. On the other hand, this post-hoc analysis of the LODESTAR trial directly compared the incidence of NODM between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in patients requiring high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention. We suggest that the choice of the statin type should be determined considering the achieved LDL-C levels, especially when individuals are at increased risk of NODM, such as prediabetes. However, the exact mechanism by which NODM varies by statin type remains unclear. Therefore, our results should be interpreted cautiously.

### A comparison of statin therapies in hypercholesterolemia in women: a subgroup analysis of the STELLAR study [^003641c8]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Objective: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in women in the United States. Aggressive treatment of modifiable risk factors (e.g. hypercholesterolemia) is essential in reducing disease burden. Despite guidelines recommending the use of statin treatment in hypercholesterolemic women, this patient group is often undertreated. This subgroup analysis of the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) trial examines the effects of statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic women.

Methods: As part of the STELLAR trial, 1,146 women with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dL) and triglycerides < 400 mg/dL were randomized to rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, atorvastatin 10–80 mg, simvastatin 10–80 mg, or pravastatin 10–40 mg for 6 weeks.

Results: LDL-C reduction with rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and pravastatin 40 mg was 49%, 39%, 37%, and 30%, respectively, after 6 weeks. High-intensity statins (rosuvastatin 20–40 mg and atorvastatin 40–80 mg) reduced LDL-C to the greatest extent: 53% with rosuvastatin 20 mg, 57% with rosuvastatin 40 mg, 47% with atorvastatin 40 mg, and 51% with atorvastatin 80 mg. Similar results were observed for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C). Increases in HDL-C were greater with rosuvastatin across doses than with other statins. All treatments were well tolerated, with similar safety profiles across dose ranges.

Conclusions: Statin therapies in the STELLAR trial led to reductions in LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and triglycerides and increases in HDL-C among hypercholesterolemic women, with rosuvastatin providing the greatest reductions in LDL-C and non-HDL-C.

### Effects of switching statins on achievement of lipid goals: measuring effective reductions in cholesterol using rosuvastatin therapy (MERCURY I) study [^71c9d275]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In a multinational trial (4522IL/0081), we assessed the effects of switching to low doses of rosuvastatin from commonly used doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal achievement in high-risk patients.

Methods

Hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 3140) with coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, or type 2 diabetes were randomized to open-label rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 40 mg for 8 weeks. Patients either remained on these treatments for another 8 weeks or switched treatments from atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and pravastatin 40 mg to rosuvastatin 10 mg or from atorvastatin 20 mg to rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients reaching the Joint European Societies' LDL-C goal (< 116 mg/dL) at week 16. For measures of cholesterol goal achievement, treatment arms were compared using logistic-regression analysis.

Results

Significant improvement in LDL-C goal achievement was found for patients who switched to rosuvastatin 10 mg, compared with patients who remained on atorvastatin 10 mg (86% vs 80%, P < .05), simvastatin 20 mg (86% vs 72%, P < .0001), and pravastatin 40 mg (88% vs 66%, P < .0001), and between patients switched to rosuvastatin 20 mg and those who remained on atorvastatin 20 mg (90% vs 84%, P < .01). Similar results were found for achievement of the European combined LDL-C and total cholesterol goals and National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goals. All statins were well tolerated over 16 weeks.

Conclusions

We demonstrated that switching to a more efficacious statin is an effective strategy to improve lipid goal achievement in patients requiring lipid-lowering therapy.

Objective

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in women in the United States. Aggressive treatment of modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypercholesterolemia) is essential in reducing disease burden. Despite guidelines recommending the use of statin treatment in hypercholesterolemic women, this patient group is often undertreated. This subgroup analysis of the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) trial examines the effects of statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic women.

Methods

As part of the STELLAR trial, 1,146 women with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C ≥ 160 and < 250mg/dL) and triglycerides < 400mg/dL were randomized to rosuvastatin 10-40mg, atorvastatin 10-80mg, simvastatin 10-80mg, or pravastatin 10-40mg for 6 weeks.

Results

LDL-C reduction with rosuvastatin 10mg, atorvastatin 10mg, simvastatin 20mg, and pravastatin 40mg was 49%, 39%, 37%, and 30%, respectively, after 6 weeks. High-intensity statins (rosuvastatin 20-40mg and atorvastatin 40-80mg) reduced LDL-C to the greatest extent: 53% with rosuvastatin 20mg, 57% with rosuvastatin 40mg, 47% with atorvastatin 40mg, and 51% with atorvastatin 80mg. Similar results were observed for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C). Increases in HDL-C were greater with rosuvastatin across doses than with other statins. All treatments were well tolerated, with similar safety profiles across dose ranges.

Conclusions

Statin therapies in the STELLAR trial led to reductions in LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and triglycerides and increases in HDL-C among hypercholesterolemic women, with rosuvastatin providing the greatest reductions in LDL-C and non-HDL-C.

### The high-dose rosuvastatin once weekly study (the HD-ROWS) [^59955f88]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Alternative dosing is often used clinically to address common barriers with statin therapy, such as intolerance and cost. Previous findings have demonstrated significant and clinically similar reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to daily dosing, when comparing similar total weekly doses.

Objective

To determine whether rosuvastatin 80 mg once weekly produced comparable lipid and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) changes to atorvastatin 10 mg daily, when measured at key points after last dose.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, 8-week pilot study. Eligible subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, had documented dyslipidemia with LDL cholesterol > 100 mg/dL and triglycerides < 200 mg/dL. Participants were randomized to receive either rosuvastatin 80 mg once weekly (n = 10) or atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 10), for 8 weeks. Lipid panels and hsCRP were measured at baseline and 1–4 and 5–8 days after the last dose.

Results

Participants in each arm experienced significant and comparable reductions from baseline in total cholesterol, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and overall LDL cholesterol (-29%). Changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and hsCRP were nonsignificant and similar between groups. Each regimen was well tolerated, with no major adverse events reported.

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin 80 mg once weekly produced comparable lipid changes to atorvastatin 10 mg daily when measured at specific points after the last dose. Our findings support previous data demonstrating a significant reduction in LDL-C with once weekly statin dosing.

Statin drug doses — moderate- and high-dose options are listed as follows: atorvastatin 10–20 mg (moderate) and 40–80 mg (high); rosuvastatin 5–10 mg (moderate) and 20–40 mg (high); simvastatin 20–40 mg (moderate; high-dose N/A); pravastatin 40–80 mg (moderate; high-dose N/A); lovastatin 40–80 mg (moderate; high-dose N/A); fluvastatin 80 mg (XL) or 40 mg BID (moderate; high-dose N/A); pitavastatin 1–4 mg (moderate; high-dose N/A). Statin doses listed as "moderate" are equivalent to moderate intensity; statin doses listed as "high" are equivalent to high intensity. In patients who are intolerant of statins: after washout (e.g., 1 month), re-challenge with same or a different statin or lower dose, and if that fails, a trial of intermittent (nondaily) dosing; intensified patient care (e.g., phone calls, emails, patient education, drug regimen simplification) may improve adherence to lipid-lowering medications.

### Effect of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin on new-onset diabetes mellitus in patients treated with high-intensity statin therapy for coronary artery disease: a post-hoc analysis from the LODESTAR randomized clinical trial [^11ac5a7e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), intensive reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels via 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy is recommended. However, statin use has been associated with increased risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM). An increased risk of NODM was more frequently observed in patients with higher-intensity statin therapy than in those with lower-intensity statin therapy. While high-intensity statins are generally used as the initial choice for LDL-C lowering therapy in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, only rosuvastatin and atorvastatin can provide high-intensity statin therapy. However, it remains uncertain whether the risk of NODM differs between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Recently, a safety endpoint in the LODESTAR (Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-targeting statin therapy versus intensity-based statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease) trial identified a higher incidence of NODM in patients receiving rosuvastatin than in those on atorvastatin. In the previous report, the NODM was only evaluated according to the population randomized (intention-to-treat population), rather than by what each patient actually received (as-treated population). In addition, questions may arise as to whether these findings are dependent on the lipid-lowering efficacy of the medication, as a significantly lower LDL-C level was observed in the rosuvastatin group than in the atorvastatin group.

Therefore, in this post-hoc analysis of the LODESTAR trial, we evaluated whether there is a difference in the incidence of NODM between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in a head-to-head comparison with consideration of the type of statin that was actually given, particularly in patients treated with high-intensity statin therapy. We also assessed the comparative effect of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin according to the achieved LDL-C levels.

### Effects of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins, and lipid ratios in patients with hypercholesterolemia: additional results from the STELLAR trial [^08f22531]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein (apo) B, and lipid and apolipoprotein ratios that include both atherogenic and antiatherogenic lipid components have been found to be strong predictors of coronary heart disease risk.

Objective

The goal of this study was to examine prospectively the effects of rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin across dose ranges on non-HDL-C, apo B, apo A-I, and total cholesterol (TC):HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C):HDL-C, non-HDL-C:HDL-C, and apo B:apo A-I ratios in patients with hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and < 250 mg/dL and triglycerides < 400 mg/dL) in the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) trial.

Methods

In this randomized, Multicenter, parallel-group, open-label trial (4522IL/0065), patients ≥ 18 years of age received rosuvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg for 6 weeks. Pairwise comparisons were prospectively planned and performed between rosuvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of comparators.

Results

A total of 2268 patients were randomized to the rosuvastatin 10- to 40-mg, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin groups. Fifty-one percent of patients were women, the mean (SD) age was 57 (12) years, and 19% had a documented history of atherosclerotic disease. Over 6 weeks, rosuvastatin significantly reduced non-HDL-C, apo B, and all lipid and apolipoprotein ratios assessed, compared with milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin (all, P < 0.002). Rosuvastatin reduced non-HDL-C by 42.0% to 50.9% compared with 34.4% to 48.1% with atorvastatin, 26.0% to 41.8% with simvastatin, and 18.6% to 27.4% with pravastatin. Rosuvastatin reduced apo B by 36.7% to 45.3% compared with 29.4% to 42.9% with atorvastatin, 22.2% to 34.7% with simvastatin, and 14.7% to 23.0% with pravastatin. The highest increase in apo A-I (8.8%) was observed in the rosuvastatin 20-mg group, and this increase was significantly greater than in the atorvastatin 40-mg and 80-mg groups (both, P < 0.002).

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg was more efficacious in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolemia than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin.

### Efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin compared with pravastatin and simvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia: a randomized, double-blind, 52-week trial [^d1d04dec]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy of rosuvastatin with that of pravastatin and simvastatin for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, lipid levels were measured in 477 patients (baseline LDL-C ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dL) who received fixed doses of 5 mg of rosuvastatin, 10 mg of rosuvastatin, 20 mg of pravastatin, or 20 mg of simvastatin for 12 weeks. For an additional 40 weeks, individual daily doses were sequentially doubled to a maximum of 80 mg of rosuvastatin, 40 mg of pravastatin, and 80 mg of simvastatin, according to investigator discretion and if National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II) LDL-C goals were not achieved.

Results

At 12 weeks, percent LDL-C reductions after both 5-mg and 10-mg rosuvastatin treatment, which were 39.1% and 47.4%, respectively, were significantly different (P < .05) from LDL-C reductions after 20-mg pravastatin (26.5%) and 20-mg simvastatin (34.6%) treatment. After 52 weeks, more rosuvastatin-treated patients remained at their starting dose than did simvastatin or pravastatin patients. After dose titration, 88% and 87.5% of the rosuvastatin 5-mg and 10-mg groups, respectively, achieved their ATP II LDL-C goals, compared with 60% for pravastatin and 72.5% for simvastatin. All study treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C levels more than pravastatin or simvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia in a 52-week dose-titration study.

### Comparative effectiveness of statins on non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol in people with diabetes and at risk of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^bc1c10cd]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Secondary outcomes

For the secondary outcome, changes in levels of LDL-C, reported in 29 studies (18 two arm, nine three arm, and two four arm), simvastatin (−1.93, 95% credible interval −2.63 to −1.21 mmol/L, surface under the cumulative ranking curve 93%) and rosuvastatin (−1.76, −2.37 to −1.15, 89%) at high intensity doses were the most effective treatment options for reducing levels of LDL-C (fig 4). Heterogeneity was low in this network meta-analysis (I 2 = 5%) and no inconsistency was found (appendix 7). For total cholesterol, reported in 36 studies (23 two arm, eight three arm, four four arm, and one five arm), atorvastatin (−2.21, −2.62 to −1.74), rosuvastatin (−2.18, −3.19 to −1.20), and simvastatin (−2.20, −2.96 to −1.42) at high intensity doses were the most effective treatment options for reducing levels of total cholesterol. Of the 12 studies that reported discontinuations of treatment because of an adverse event, only four statin interventions (pravastatin low, atorvastatin moderate, lovastatin low, and simvastatin moderate intensity) were possible for meta-analyses. We found no significant associations in these analysis, although high uncertainty around the estimates was found, as expected. Appendix 9 shows the raw data for discontinuations because of adverse events. Only five studiesreported at least one of the three point major cardiovascular event outcomes, for atorvastatin moderate and high intensity treatment groups only. We found a significant reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction for atorvastatin at moderate intensity compared with placebo (relative risk = 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.76, n = 4 studies). We found no significant results for non-fatal stroke or death related to cardiovascular disease. Appendix 9 shows the results for the secondary outcomes.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of evolocumab in high-risk patients receiving a statin: secondary analysis of patients with low LDL cholesterol levels and in those already receiving a maximal-potency statin in a randomized clinical trial [^8002e8fe]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease focus on high-intensity statins and targeting or using a threshold low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of less than 70 mg/dL for the highest-risk patients. Whether further reduction of LDL-C beyond these boundaries would be beneficial is unknown.

Objective

To compare outcomes of evolocumab vs placebo in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL and in those receiving background treatment with a maximal-potency statin.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary ad hoc analysis of the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial compared randomized treatments in 2 subgroups of patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease currently receiving statin. Patients were classified by a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 or at least 70 mg/dL and by statin intensity (maximal: atorvastatin calcium, 80 mg/d, or rosuvastatin, 40 mg/d; submaximal: all other dosages). Patients with baseline LDL of less than 70 mg/dL either had a final screening LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL or a final screening non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of at least 100 mg/dL. Data were retrieved from 2013 to 2016 and analyzed in 2017 based on intention to treat.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Safety outcomes included adverse events and events of interest identified in the FOURIER trial. Interaction testing was used to assess the consistency of results in patients who did vs did not satisfy the above criteria.

Results

A total of 27 564 patients (75.4% men and 24.6% women; mean [SD] age, 62.5 [9.0] years) were included in the analysis. Of 2034 patients (7.4%) who had a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL, evolocumab reduced the risk for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60–1.07) to a similar degree as in the 25 529 patients who had baseline LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL (HR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.92; P = 0.65 for interaction; 1 patient was missing baseline LDL-C data). Of 7533 patients (27.3%) receiving maximal-potency statins, evolocumab significantly reduced the primary endpoint (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98) to a similar degree as in the 20 031 patients not receiving a maximal-potency statin (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.93; P = 0.88 for interaction). The key secondary endpoint was reduced to a similar degree in both analyses. No major safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evolocumab was equally effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease regardless of whether the baseline LDL-C was less than 70 or at least 70 mg/dL and whether the background statin was of maximal or submaximal potency.

### Rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin treatment in adults with coronary artery disease: secondary analysis of the randomised LODESTAR trial [^ce5e1373]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this secondary analysis of the randomised LODESTAR trial comparing clinical outcomes over three years between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin treatment in adults with coronary artery disease were that the risk of a three year composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any coronary revascularisation did not differ between the two groups; rosuvastatin treatment resulted in lower LDL cholesterol levels and a higher proportion of participants achieving LDL cholesterol levels < 1.8 mmol/L throughout the study period, compared with atorvastatin treatment; and rosuvastatin treatment was associated with a higher incidence of new onset diabetes mellitus requiring initiation of antidiabetics and cataract surgery than atorvastatin treatment.

In clinical practice, appropriate decisions for statin type as well as statin intensity are important — however, only rosuvastatin and atorvastatin can offer both the high intensity and moderate intensity statin treatment usually required by people with coronary artery disease to intensively lower their LDL cholesterol levels. The clinical benefits of using either of these two potent statins in people with coronary artery disease have been shown in previous studies. However, to our knowledge, only the SATURN (Study of Coronary Atheroma by Intravascular Ultrasound: Effect of Rosuvastatin versus Atorvastatin) trial directly compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin treatment in people with coronary artery disease. Among people with coronary artery disease who were randomised to either rosuvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg in that study, the primary outcome — the change in intravascular ultrasound defined percentage atheroma volume at 104 weeks — did not differ between the two groups (−0.99% v −1.22%, P = 0.17). In the secondary outcomes of that study, the occurrence of a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, arterial revascularisation, or admission to hospital for unstable angina did not differ between the groups (7.5% v 7.1%), although the rosuvastatin group had lower LDL cholesterol levels than the atorvastatin group (1.6 v 1.8 mmol/L; P < 0.001). However, the SATURN trial primarily evaluated the effects of the highest doses of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis by means of intravascular ultrasonography, rather than clinical outcomes, and it included fewer participants (n = 1039) and a shorter follow-up time (two years) than the current study. Our randomised study, however, compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin treatment in terms of a composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any coronary revascularisation in 4400 patients with coronary artery disease during three years of follow-up. The results show that rosuvastatin was associated with greater efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol levels throughout the study period, which is in line with a previous meta-analysis showing the superiority of rosuvastatin over atorvastatin in lowering LDL cholesterol levels. This difference in the LDL cholesterol lowering capacity might have contributed to the higher use of a high intensity statin (from two years) and ezetimibe (from three months) in the atorvastatin group. Although the difference between these two potent statins is unclear, factors such as their bonding capacity to HMG-CoA reductase and plasma half-life might have contributed to the difference in LDL cholesterol lowering capacity. Although both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin have greater bonding capacity to HMG-CoA reductase than other statin types, rosuvastatin has the greatest bonding interaction with HMG-CoA reductase. In addition, rosuvastatin has a longer plasma half-life than atorvastatin (19 hours v 15 hours). Nevertheless, in this study, the pronounced reduction in LDL cholesterol levels with rosuvastatin did not translate into incremental benefit in reducing three year composite outcomes, as in the SATURN trial. In fact, in both trials, the rate of composite clinical outcomes was numerically higher in the rosuvastatin group than atorvastatin group. That finding could be due to the low between group difference in reduction of LDL cholesterol levels, as well as the difference in pharmacological properties between the two statins. Whereas lipophilic statins such as atorvastatin can cross cellular membranes through passive diffusion and are therefore widely distributed in different tissues, hydrophilic statins such as rosuvastatin are more liver selective owing to the active carrier mediated uptake mechanism, and thus they are more limited in their ability to have additional effects beyond cholesterol lowering (pleiotropic effects) in extrahepatic tissues. In addition, the atorvastatin group's higher use of ezetimibe, which can not only reduce LDL cholesterol levels but also inhibit platelet aggregation and activation, reduce oxidative stress, and accelerate plaque regression, could be another explanation of our findings. Further study is, however, required before any causative effect can be established or rebutted.

### Association between age and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to statins: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^5b978ee9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There is large patient-to-patient variability in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response to statin treatment. The reduction in LDL-C may depend on the age of the patient treated-particularly in older adults, who have been substantially underrepresented in randomized controlled trials.

Objective

To investigate the association between age and the LDL-C reduction by statins.

Design

Nationwide, register-based cohort study.

Setting

Denmark, 2008 to 2018.

Participants

82958 simvastatin or atorvastatin initiators with LDL-C measurements before and during statin use.

Measurements

Statin response, defined as percentage reduction in prestatin LDL-C level, and percentage reduction differences (PRDs) according to age and simvastatin or atorvastatin dose based on a longitudinal model for LDL-C.

Results

Among 82958 statin initiators, 10388 (13%) were aged 75 years or older. With low- to moderate-intensity statins, initiators aged 75 years or older had greater mean LDL-C percentage reductions than initiators younger than 50 years-for example, 39.0% versus 33.8% for simvastatin, 20 mg, and 44.2% versus 40.2% for atorvastatin, 20 mg. The adjusted PRD for initiators aged 75 years compared with initiators aged 50 years was 2.62 percentage points. This association was consistent for primary prevention (2.54 percentage points) and secondary prevention (2.32 percentage points) but smaller for initiators of high-intensity statins (atorvastatin, 40 mg: 1.36 percentage points; atorvastatin, 80 mg: -0.58 percentage point).

Limitation

Use of administrative data, observational pre-post comparison with a moderately high proportion of missing data, lack of information on body mass index, and the mainly White study population may limit generalizability.

Conclusion

Low- to moderate-intensity statins were associated with a greater reduction in LDL-C levels in older persons than younger persons and may be more appealing as initial treatment in older adults who are at increased risk for adverse events.

### Moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe vs high-intensity statin according to baseline LDL-C in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a post-hoc analysis of the RACING randomized trial [^cc219f33]. Atherosclerosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Whether the effect of a combination strategy rather than increasing doses of one drug to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels is consistent across baseline LDL-C levels remains uncertain.

Methods

In the RACING trial, which showed a non-inferiority of moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe (rosuvastatin 10 mg with ezetimibe 10 mg) to high-intensity statin (rosuvastatin 20 mg) for the primary outcome (3-year composite of cardiovascular death, major cardiovascular event, or stroke), the heterogeneity in treatment effect according to baseline LDL-C levels was assessed for the primary and secondary outcomes (clinical efficacy and safety).

Results

Of 3780 participants, 2817 participants (74.5%) had LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, and 963 participants (25.5%) had LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL. The treatment effect of combination therapy versus high-intensity statin monotherapy was similar among the lower LDL-C subset (8.8% vs. 10.2%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.08, p = 0.19) and the higher LDL-C subset (10.8% vs. 9.6%; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.7, p = 0.53) without a significant interaction (interaction p = 0.22). Of the secondary outcomes, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year achievement of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL was greater in the combination therapy group regardless of baseline LDL-C levels.

Conclusions

Among ASCVD patients, there was no heterogeneity in the effect of moderate-intensity statin plus ezetimibe combination therapy in the higher and lower baseline LDL-C levels for the 3-year composite of cardiovascular outcomes.

### Rosuvastatin (Ezallor sprinkle) [^7140e000]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Rosuvastatin was compared with the statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin) in a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging study of 2,240 patients with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. After randomization, patients were treated for 6 weeks with a single daily dose of either rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin (see Figure 3 and Table 11).

### Benefit-risk assessment of rosuvastatin 10 to 40 milligrams [^5ce0117e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this article is to examine the benefit-risk profile of rosuvastatin at doses of 10 to 40 mg. In dyslipidemic patients, rosuvastatin produced markedly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and equivalent or greater improvements in various lipid measures, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. In addition, rosuvastatin is more effective than these statins in allowing patients to reach National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III and Joint European Societies LDL cholesterol goals. The safety profile of rosuvastatin was reviewed (as of April 2003) in 12,569 patients, representing 14,231 patient-years of treatment at doses up to 80 mg. In controlled trials, rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg demonstrated a similar adverse event profile to those for atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, simvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and pravastatin 10 to 40 mg. Myopathy (defined as muscle symptoms plus serum creatine kinase levels > 10 times the upper limit of normal) attributed to rosuvastatin occurred in ≤ 0.03% of patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. No cases of rhabdomyolysis occurred in patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. Clinically significant alanine aminotransferase elevations occurred in 0.2% of patients receiving rosuvastatin and those receiving atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. Compared with other widely used statins, the benefit-risk profile of rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg appears to be very favorable.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Table 11. High-, Moderate-, and Low-Intensity Statin Therapy — doses and LDL-C lowering are organized as follows: High-intensity therapy (LDL-C lowering ≥ 50%) includes atorvastatin 40–80 mg and rosuvastatin 20–40 mg; moderate-intensity therapy (30%–49%) includes atorvastatin 10–20 mg, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg, simvastatin 20–40 mg, pravastatin 40–80 mg, and pitavastatin 1–4 mg; low-intensity therapy (< 30%) includes simvastatin 10 mg, pravastatin 10–20 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, and fluvastatin 20–40 mg. Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in RCTs, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.

### Comparison of effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in patients with type IIa or IIb hypercholesterolemia [^50540d0c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 52 centers in North America to compare the effects of the new, highly effective statin, rosuvastatin, with atorvastatin and placebo in hypercholesterolemic patients. After a 6-week dietary run-in, 516 patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ≥ 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dl) and < 6.47 mmol/L (250 mg/dl) and triglycerides ≤ 4.52 mmol/L (400 mg/dl) were randomized to 12 weeks of once-daily placebo (n = 132), rosuvastatin 5 mg (n = 128), rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 129), or atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 127). The primary efficacy end point was percent change in LDL cholesterol. Secondary efficacy variables were achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II), ATP III, and European Atherosclerosis Society LDL cholesterol goals and percent change from baseline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and apolipoprotein A-I. Rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg compared with atorvastatin 10 mg were associated with greater LDL cholesterol reductions (-40% and -43% vs 35%; p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) and HDL cholesterol increases (13% and 12% vs 8%, p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B reductions and apolipoprotein A-I increases were also greater with rosuvastatin; triglyceride reductions were similar. Rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg were associated with improved achievement in ATP II (84% in both rosuvastatin groups vs 73%) and ATP III (84% and 82% vs 72%) LDL cholesterol goals, and rosuvastatin 10 mg was more effective than atorvastatin in achieving European Atherosclerosis Society LDL cholesterol goals. Both treatments were well tolerated.

### Safety and effectiveness of high-intensity statins versus low / moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for reaching LDL-C goals: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b31b5919]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 Results

The search strategy yielded a total of 3060 articles. After removing duplicates and screening of articles, 32 trials were included in the meta‐analysis (Figure 1). Inter‐reader agreement was high (κ coefficient = 0.9).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow chart.

The included articles consisted of 12 042 ASCVD patients, among which 5880 (48.42%) participants received low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe, whereas 6162 participants received high‐intensity statin monotherapy. The included studies employed various statins, namely rosuvastatin (n = 5), atorvastatin (n = 12), simvastatin (n = 3), pravastatin (n = 1), multiple statins (n = 10), and one study used both atorvastatin and multiple statins. Approximately half of the studies were blinded (47%), whereas blindness was not mentioned in 40% of studies. Only two studies used a placebo in the monotherapy arm. The duration of treatment in these studies ranged from 1 to 36 months from baseline. Supporting Information S1: Table 3 provides an overview of the key characteristics of the included studies.

3.1 Laboratory Data

Twenty‐one studies compared high‐intensity statin monotherapy with low/moderate‐intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy on LDL‐C levels in ASCVD patients. The combination therapy demonstrated a greater reduction in LDL‐C levels compared to monotherapy (MD = −6.6, 95% CI: −10.6 to −2.5). However, a high degree of heterogeneity was noted among the included studies (I 2 = 84%, p < 0.01) (Figure 2A). The preliminary inspection of the funnel plot and Egger's regression showed no statistical evidence of publication bias (Supporting Information S1: Figure 1A). The observed effects remained consistent when considering treatment durations of less than 12 months or more than 12 months (Supporting Information S1: Figure 2A). The reduction in LDL‐C levels was exclusively observed in atorvastatin and rosuvastatin subgroups (p < 0.001) (Supporting Information S1: Figure 2B). Considering different subgroups, the heterogeneity of effect was not due to variations in used statins or treatment durations across the included studies.

### Achieving LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B target levels in high-risk patients: measuring effective reductions in cholesterol using rosuvastatin therapY (MERCURY) II [^cea71f49]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for patients at a high risk of coronary heart disease set a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target of < 100 mg/dL. This target can be difficult to attain with diet and current therapy.

Methods

In a 16-week multinational trial, 1993 high-risk patients were randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or simvastatin 40 mg for 8 weeks. Patients either remained on starting treatment or switched to lower or milligram-equivalent doses of rosuvastatin for 8 more weeks.

Results

At 16 weeks, more patients achieved their LDL-C target by switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg than staying on atorvastatin 10 mg (66% vs 42%, P < .001) or simvastatin 20 mg (73% vs 32%, P < .001). Changing to rosuvastatin 20 mg brought more patients to their LDL-C target than staying on atorvastatin 20 mg (79% vs 64%, P < .001) or simvastatin 40 mg (84% vs 56%, P < .001). More very high risk patients achieved an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL when changed to rosuvastatin from atorvastatin or simvastatin (within-arm comparisons P < .01). More hypertriglyceridemic patients (triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dL) met LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apolipoprotein B targets by changing to rosuvastatin. Switching to rosuvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B, and lipid ratios. All treatments were well tolerated, with no differences among treatment groups in skeletal muscle, hepatic, or renal toxicity.

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg is an effective and safe therapeutic option for high-risk patients to achieve their lipid and apolipoprotein targets.

### A VOYAGER meta-analysis of the impact of statin therapy on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia [^21166450]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, defined by the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel as a TG level of 177 to 885 mg/dl (2.0 to 10.0 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction remains the primary treatment goal. Using data from the indiVidual patient meta-analysis Of statin therapY in At risk Groups: Effects of Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin (VOYAGER) meta-analysis, we analyzed LDL-C and TG reductions in patients with baseline TG ≥ 177 mg/dl (≥ 2.0 mmol/L). Least squares mean percentage change from baseline in LDL-C and TG was compared using 15,800 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 5 to 40 mg, atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and simvastatin 10 to 80 mg in patients with baseline TG ≥ 177 mg/dl (≥ 2.0 mmol/L). Comparisons were made using mixed-effects models with data only from studies directly comparing treatments by randomized design. Mean LDL-C reductions ranged from -26.9% to -55.5%. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater LDL-C reductions than equal or double doses of atorvastatin and simvastatin (p < 0.05). Mean TG reductions ranged from -15.1% to -31.3%. Rosuvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than atorvastatin 10 mg (p < 0.05). Rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg resulted in TG reductions similar to those with equal doses of atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than equal or double doses of simvastatin (p < 0.05). In conclusion, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C reduction was substantial and dependent on the choice and dose of statin. TG reduction was numerically less than for LDL-C, and additional TG-lowering therapy may be considered to further reduce residual cardiovascular risk.

### Comparison of the dose-response relationships of 2 lipid-lowering agents: a Bayesian meta-analysis [^d03a5345]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Comparing the dose-response of a new drug to that of a previously studied drug can aid in understanding their relative potencies. Two dose-finding studies addressed the effect of a new drug, rosuvastatin, on its ability to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. One of these studies included 2 doses of atorvastatin, and substantial additional information is available in the literature about the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-C level lowering.

Methods

The 2 dose-finding studies of rosuvastatin considered otherwise healthy patients who had hypercholesterolemia. Comparable studies of atorvastatin were identified via a MEDLINE search in December 1999. Multiple reviewer consensus identified 15 of 41 studies on atorvastatin published since 1996 that met these selection criteria: reporting of LDL-C level change from baseline at least 6 weeks after treatment initiation, doses administered, and treatment group sizes. Eligible populations had clinical evidence of hypercholesterolemia. We excluded studies with patients who had severe illness or a previous history of transplantation. Data extraction of the mean, sample sizes, and SDs (or CIs) by dose was carried out independently by multiple reviewers. We combined the results from the various studies with Bayesian hierarchical modeling and analyzed them with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.

Results

Combining this study and literature results substantially increased the power to compare the dose-response relationships of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C level by an estimated 10 to 17 percentage points more than atorvastatin when both were given at the same dose. Approximately one quarter of the dose of rosuvastatin achieved about the same magnitude of LDL-C level reduction as atorvastatin at dosages as high as 80 mg. This finding does not imply a 4-fold difference in efficacy overall and specifically does not describe the results at higher dosage levels.

Conclusions

Bayesian meta-analysis of results from related studies allows the comparison of the dose-response relationships of 2 drugs, better estimates of a particular dose-response relationship within an individual study, and the expression of relative benefits (of dose and drug) in terms of probabilities. Explicitly comparing a study's results with historical data using Bayesian meta-analysis allows clinicians to view the study in the larger context of medical research.

### Comparison of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^e29d9c1d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HFH) is a common genetic disorder that confers a significantly increased risk of early coronary artery disease. This study compared atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in HFH in a global, 18-week, weighted-randomization, double-blind, parallel-group, forced-titration study. Following a 6-week diet lead-in, 623 patients were randomized to 20 mg/day of atorvastatin (n = 187) or rosuvastatin (n = 436) with forced titration at 6-week intervals to 80 mg/day. The primary end point was percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline to week 18. At week 18, rosuvastatin therapy produced a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol than atorvastatin (-57.9% vs -50.4%; p < 0.001) and a significantly greater increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (12.4% vs 2.9%; p < 0.001). Rosuvastatin also produced significantly greater reductions in apolipoprotein-B and all 4 major lipid ratios, as well as a significantly greater increases in apolipoprotein A-I (all p < 0.001). More patients with HFH with coronary artery disease achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III goal of LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl (< 2.6 mmol/L) on rosuvastatin 40 and 80 mg than atorvastatin 80 mg (17%, 24%, and 4.5%, respectively). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein median values were reduced by 33% to 34% in both the 80-mg rosuvastatin- and atorvastatin-treated groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Thus, in HFH, rosuvastatin force titrated from 20 to 80 mg/day produced significantly greater reductions than atorvastatin 20 to 80 mg/day in LDL cholesterol and improvements in HDL cholesterol and other lipid parameters, and enabled more patients to achieve LDL cholesterol goals.

### Rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin treatment in adults with coronary artery disease: secondary analysis of the randomised LODESTAR trial [^98832036]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Intensive reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels is recommended in people with coronary artery disease, who are regarded as being at high risk or very high risk of future atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Among the various lipid lowering drugs available, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the cornerstone of treatment, and high intensity statins are generally the choice for LDL cholesterol lowering treatment in people with coronary artery disease. Doctors make decisions not only about statin intensity (high, moderate, or low) but also about statin type; however, although previous studies have evaluated clinical outcomes according to different intensities of statins for managing dyslipidaemia in people with coronary artery disease, clinical trials have not sufficiently evaluated the effects of different types of statins. Furthermore, few randomised clinical trials have directly compared the long term clinical outcomes of the two most potent statins — rosuvastatin and atorvastatin — in people with coronary artery disease.

In addition to statins' efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol levels and the risk of future adverse cardiovascular events, safety concerns, including statin related adverse effects and intolerance, should also be considered in real world practice. Statin associated muscle symptoms and other concerning statin related adverse effects on glucose homeostasis or hepatic or renal function are more common with high potency statins than with low potency statins. However, although various statin related adverse effects have been reported, it is not clear whether the adverse effects are due to the drug itself or to drug class effects. We therefore conducted the LODESTAR (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol-Targeting Statin Therapy Versus Intensity-Based Statin Therapy in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease) trial, a multicentre, randomised trial for the management of dyslipidaemia in people with coronary artery disease. This secondary analysis of the LODESTAR trial focused on the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin treatment over three years in people with coronary artery disease.

### Association of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with contemporary lipid-lowering therapies and risk of diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^205a519c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Data Synthesis and Analysis

To account for potential between‐study variance, estimates were pooled using a DerSimonian and Laird random‐effects model. 22 The principal summary statistic was risk ratio (RR), supplemented by risk difference (RD) with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane Q statistics and quantified by I 2 with values > 25%, 50%, and 75% consistent with low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively. 23 Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot and Egger regression test. 24 Statistical significance was set at 5%.

Metaregression analyses were performed using random‐effects models with the restricted maximum likelihood estimation. The Knapp and Hartung adjustment was applied for calculation of standard errors of the estimated coefficients to calculate summary effect estimates. 25 Metaregression analyses were conducted to estimate the associations among absolute amount of reduction in LDL‐C (calculated as the difference in the achieved LDL‐C between the 2 interventions), 1 percentage reduction in LDL‐C (each 10%), baseline LDL‐C, and absolute reduction in LDL‐C adjusted for baseline LDL‐C and incident DM. The index R 2 value (defined as the ratio of explained/total variance) was used to determine the proportion of variance accounted for by the change in LDL‐C.

Subgroup analyses were conducted according to weighted between‐group LDL‐C differences observed at follow‐up across the trials for particular lipid‐lowering strategies as suggested by CTT collaboration meta‐analysis 20 and interventions: statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, statins versus no statins, and high‐intensity statins (atorvastatin 80 mg, simvastatin 80 mg, or rosuvastatin 40 mg) versus low‐intensity statins (lesser doses of corresponding statin therapy [atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20–40 mg, and rosuvastatin up to 20 mg]). Additional sensitivity analyses included meta‐analyses by fixed‐effects model, analyses of trials with sample sizes of ≥ 500 patients that reported outcomes at follow‐up ≥ 1 year, analyses according to year of publication, 6 and trials with the same definition for DM. Analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta‐Analysis software v3.0 (Biostat) and Metafor package v3.30 (R Project for Statistical Computing).

### 2024 ACC / AHA / AACVPR / APMA / ABC / SCAI / SVM / SVN / SVS / SIR / VESS guideline for the management of lower extremity peripheral artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^69877c9d]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Peripheral artery disease — statin intensity and doses are organized by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering thresholds and specific agents: high intensity (≥ 50%) includes atorvastatin 40–80 mg and rosuvastatin 20–40 mg; moderate intensity (30%-49%) includes atorvastatin 10–20 mg, rosuvastatin 5–10 mg, simvastatin 20–40 mg, pravastatin 40–80 mg, lovastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin XL 80 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily, and pitavastatin 1–4 mg; low intensity (< 30%) includes simvastatin 10 mg, pravastatin 10–20 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, and fluvastatin 20–40 mg; the table notes "LDL-C lowering that should occur with the dosages listed below each intensity", and "Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in RCTs, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the FDA because of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis".

### Efficacy of rosuvastatin compared with other statins at selected starting doses in hypercholesterolemic patients and in special population groups [^6341472a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

A total of 5 randomized, double-blind trials in patients with hypercholesterolemia were prospectively designed to allow pooling of plasma lipid data after 12 weeks of treatment. The purpose was (1) to compare rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg with atorvastatin 10 mg (data from 3 of the 5 trials); (2) to compare rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg with simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 20 mg (data from 2 of the 5 trials); and (3) to summarize overall efficacy and subset analyses of rosuvastatin data from all 5 trials. Rosuvastatin 5 mg (n = 390) and 10 mg (n = 389) reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol significantly more than did atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 393) (41.9% and 46.7% vs 36.4%, both p < 0.001). Treatment with rosuvastatin 5 mg (n = 240) and 10 mg (n = 226) also resulted in significantly greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with both simvastatin 20 mg (n = 249) and pravastatin 20 mg (n = 252) (40.6% and 48.1% vs 27.1% and 35.7%, all p < 0.001). Significant differences favoring rosuvastatin 10 mg were also observed for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) B, and apo A-I versus atorvastatin 10 mg, and for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, and apo B versus simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 20 mg. Analyses of all the rosuvastatin 10 mg data (n = 615) from the 5 trials in subgroups defined by age ≥ 65 years, female sex, postmenopausal status, hypertension, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and obesity showed that rosuvastatin had consistent efficacy across patient subgroups.

### Effect of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin on new-onset diabetes mellitus in patients treated with high-intensity statin therapy for coronary artery disease: a post-hoc analysis from the LODESTAR randomized clinical trial [^acb764cf]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this post-hoc analysis of the LODESTAR trial, the incidence of NODM was not significantly different between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin among CAD patients on high-intensity statin therapy. However, it appears that the risk of NODM according to the statin types may be affected by the efficacy of LDL-C lowering. The risk of NODM was significantly higher in the rosuvastatin group than in the atorvastatin group when the achieved LDL-C level was < 70 mg/dL. However, the risk of NODM did not differ between the two groups when the achieved LDL-C level was LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

### Association between lowering LDL-C and cardiovascular risk… [^e67c1ca6]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

The RR for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C level was 0. 77 for statins and
0. 75 for established nonstatin interventions that work primarily via upregulation of LDL receptor expression. Conclusions and Relevance In this meta-regression analysis, the use of statin and nonstatin therapies that act via upregulation of LDL receptor expression to reduce LDL-C were associated with similar RRs of major vascular events per change in LDL-C. Lower achieved LDL-C levels were associated with lower rates of major coronary events. Findings In a meta-regression analysis of 49 clinical trials with 312 175 participants, each 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C level was associated with a relative risk of major vascular events of 0. 77 for statins and
0.

75 for established nonstatin interventions that act primarily via upregulation of LDL receptor expression. A random-effects meta-regression with the intercept set at 0 was used to estimate the RR per each 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C level for the combination of statins and nonstatin therapies that act predominantly via upregulation of LDL receptor expression and have been studied in dedicated cardiovascular outcomes trials. The mean weighted LDL-C reduction, RR, and 95% CI were then estimated for each of the 9 treatment types separately using fixed-effects meta-analysis with weighting by inverse variance and plotted relative to the meta-regression line. For the 25 statin trials, each 1-mmol/L reduction in LDL-C level was associated with an RR of 0. 77 for major vascular events (Figure 2A.

### Effect of ezetimibe / simvastatin versus atorvastatin or rosuvastatin on modifying lipid profiles in patients with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or neither: results of two subgroup analyses [^ffde46e7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and metabolic syndrome (MS) are at increased risk of developing coronary heart disease.

Objective

To compare the effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) combination therapy, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin in patients with DM, MS without DM, or neither disease.

Methods

Subgroup analysis of data from two 6-week, randomized, double-blind trials comparing E/S 10/10, 10/20, 10/40, or 10/80 mg with either atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg (Study 1), or rosuvastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg (Study 2). Treatments were compared by pooling across all doses for effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), LDL-C:HDL-C, TC:HDL-C, and LDL-C goal attainment.

Results

E/S provided greater improvements than atorvastatin or rosuvastatin in LDL-C, TC, HDL-C (vs atorvastatin only), non-HDL-C, LDL-C:HDL-C, TC:HDL-C, and ApoB in all disease subgroups. There were no interactions of treatment by disease subgroup for these parameters, indicating a consistent treatment difference favoring E/S effect across the disease subgroups. A greater percentage of patients receiving E/S than atorvastatin or rosuvastatin attained their individual National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goals, LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, and non-HDL-C goals regardless of subgroup. All treatments were well-tolerated, with generally similar adverse experience rates.

Conclusions

Overall, E/S generally provided greater efficacy than either atorvastatin or rosuvastatin that was consistent across the subgroups of patients with DM, MS, or neither, in agreement with the results from the full study cohorts.

### Comparison of rosuvastatin with atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin in achieving cholesterol goals and improving plasma lipids in hypercholesterolaemic patients with or without the metabolic syndrome in the MERCURY I trial [^521c759f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

The metabolic syndrome (MS) increases the risk of coronary heart disease, yet few data are available on the effects of statin treatment in improving lipid measures in patients with the syndrome. This analysis compares the effects of statin therapy on plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal achievement and lipid levels in hypercholesterolaemic patients with or without the MS.

Methods

The Measuring Effective Reductions in Cholesterol Using Rosuvastatin TherapY I (MERCURY I) trial compared rosuvastatin 10 mg with atorvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg, simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 40 mg over 8 weeks in patients with coronary or other atherosclerotic diseases or diabetes who had fasting levels of LDL-C of ≥ 2.99 mmol/l and triglycerides of < 4.52 mmol/l. Modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria for the MS were met by 1342 (43%) of 3140 patients.

Results

LDL-C goal achievement rates and reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were similar in patients with and without the MS within statin treatment groups; triglycerides were reduced more and HDL-C tended to be increased more in patients with the MS, as expected. Treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg was more effective in allowing patients with and without the MS to reach European and ATP III LDL-C goals, compared to atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 40 mg (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons); consistently produced greater reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol and non-HDL-C, compared to these treatments; and produced similar or greater reductions in triglycerides and increases in HDL-C, compared to the other treatments.

Conclusions

Statin therapy is effective in allowing LDL-C goal achievement and improving the lipid profile in hypercholesterolaemic high-risk patients with the MS. Rosuvastatin 10 mg presents significant advantages in goal achievement and lipid lowering over other statins at commonly used doses in patients both with and without the MS.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) on statin therapy for secondary prevention — initiation and intensity guidance: High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated in adults aged ≤ 75 years with clinical ASCVD who are not receiving statin therapy, or increased from low or moderate intensity; when high intensity is contraindicated or adverse-effect risk is present, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used as the second option, if tolerated, with an objective of a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C for moderate intensity and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction for high intensity. For individuals aged > 75 years, evidence supports continuation of statin therapy in those already taking and tolerating it, data support the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals with clinical ASCVD aged > 75 years, and it is reasonable to consider initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in individuals aged > 75 years with decisions based on expected benefit and competing comorbidities. Patients with clinical ASCVD are defined from RCT inclusion criteria and subgroups include those at very high risk, those not at very high risk, and those with baseline LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL.

### Comparison of different statin therapy to change low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in Korean patients with and without diabetes [^ed8f9a70]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is difficult to apply the proper intensity of statin for new treatment guidelines in clinical settings because of few data about the statin efficacy in Asians. We conducted a retrospective, observational study to estimate the percentage changes in lipid parameters and glucose induced by different statins.

Methods

We analyzed 3854 patients including those with nondiabetes and diabetes treated at the outpatient clinic between 2003 and 2013 who were statin-naïve and maintained fixed-dose of statin for at least 18 months.

Results

Moderate- and low-intensity statin therapy was effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to < 100 mg/dL (70.3%, 83.0%, and 87.2% of diabetic patients in the low-, moderate-, and high-intensity therapy groups, respectively). The rapid decrease of LDL-C was observed in the first 8 months, and LDL-C-lowering effect was maintained throughout the observation period in even the low-intensity statin group. The effects of statins in elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were similar in each statin groups, except the ezetimibe-simvastatin group (4.5 ± 2.1%) and high-dose atorvastatin groups (9.7 ± 3.3% and 8.7 ± 2.4% for 40 mg and 80 mg of atorvastatin/day, respectively). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased less and LDL-C decreased more in diabetes than in nondiabetes. There were no significant changes of fasting glucose after statin use in nondiabetic patients.

Conclusions

Moderate- or low-intensity statin was effective enough in reaching National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C target goals in Koreans. Low-intensity statin showed around 30% LDL-C reduction from the baseline level in Koreans, which is comparable to moderate-intensity statin in new guideline.

### Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe added to atorvastatin versus atorvastatin uptitration or switching to rosuvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia [^4f7426f1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 1,547) at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ≥ 100 and ≤ 160 mg/dl while treated with atorvastatin 10 mg/day entered a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, clinical trial using two 6-week study periods. Period I compared the efficacy/safety of (1) adding ezetimibe 10 mg (ezetimibe) to stable atorvastatin 10 mg, (2) doubling atorvastatin to 20 mg, or (3) switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg. Subjects in the latter 2 groups who persisted with elevated LDL-C levels (≥ 100 and ≤ 160 mg/dl) after period I, entered period II; subjects on atorvastatin 20 mg had ezetimibe added to their atorvastatin 20 mg, or uptitrated their atorvastatin to 40 mg; subjects on rosuvastatin 10 mg switched to atorvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe or uptitrated their rosuvastatin to 20 mg. Some subjects on atorvastatin 10 mg plus ezetimibe continued the same treatment into period II. At the end of period I, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 10 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 20 mg or rosuvastatin 10 mg (22.2% vs 9.5% or 13.0%, respectively, p < 0.001). At the end of period II, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 40 mg (17.4% vs 6.9%, p < 0.001); switching from rosuvastatin 10 mg to ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than uptitrating to rosuvastatin 20 mg (17.1% vs 7.5%, p < 0.001). Relative to comparative treatments, ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 mg (period I) or atorvastatin 20 mg (period II) produced significantly greater percent attainment of LDL-C targets < 100 or < 70 mg/dl, and significantly greater percent reductions in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, most lipid and lipoprotein ratios, and apolipoprotein B (except ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20 vs atorvastatin 40 mg). Reports of adverse experiences were generally similar among groups. In conclusion, treatment of hypercholesterolemic subjects at high cardiovascular risk with ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg produced significantly greater improvements in key lipid parameters and significantly greater attainment of LDL-C treatment targets than doubling atorvastatin or switching to (or doubling) rosuvastatin at the compared doses.

Slowing of the Progression of Atherosclerosis

In the Measuring Effects on Intima Media Thickness: an Evaluation Of Rosuvastatin 40 mg (METEOR) study, the effect of therapy with rosuvastatin on carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography in patients with elevated LDL-C, at low risk (Framingham risk < 10% over ten years) for symptomatic coronary artery disease and with subclinical atherosclerosis as evidenced by carotid intimal-medial thickness (cIMT). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study 984 adult patients were randomized (of whom 876 were analyzed) in a 5:2 ratio to rosuvastatin 40 mg or placebo once daily. Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the annualized rate of change per patient from baseline to two years in mean maximum cIMT of 12 measured segments. The estimated difference in the rate of change in the maximum cIMT analyzed over all 12 carotid artery sites between patients treated with rosuvastatin and placebo-treated patients was -0.0145 mm/year (95% CI –0.0196, –0.0093; p < 0.0001).

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab as add-on therapy in high-cardiovascular-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with atorvastatin (20 or 40 mg) or rosuvastatin (10 or 20 mg): design and rationale of the ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies [^dfe5b02b]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A recent study conducted with another proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor, in patients with hypercholesterolemia and on stable, daily, moderate‐intensity (10 mg atorvastatin, 40 mg simvastatin, or 5 mg rosuvastatin) or high‐intensity (80 mg atorvastatin or 40 mg rosuvastatin) statin therapy, assessed the LDL‐C–lowering effect of added evolocumab or ezetimibe. 31 Findings showed that the addition of evolocumab resulted in additional LDL‐C lowering. 31 The ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies assess the lipid‐lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab as add‐on therapy in comparison with the current clinical strategies that exist for high–CV‐risk patients whose LDL‐C levels are not sufficiently reduced with the most commonly used atorvastatin or rosuvastatin doses. The studies are designed to answer practical questions facing the clinician: Which clinical strategy provides the best combination of LDL‐C–lowering efficacy and safety/tolerability? Add alirocumab? Increase the statin dose or switch to another statin, or add ezetimibe? The study design also provides flexibility in the alirocumab dosing regimen, which in turn allows for individualized therapy based on the degree of LDL‐C reduction required to achieve the desired treatment response.

Whether additional LDL‐C lowering in patients optimally treated with statins will further reduce CV events is under evaluation in ongoing trials of ezetimibe as well as a number of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial is evaluating alirocumab in patients with acute coronary syndromes.

In conclusion, the ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies aim to provide further data regarding the efficacy of alirocumab to reduce LDL‐C levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia at high CV risk, in particular those patients who are not achieving specific LDL‐C levels with the most commonly used atorvastatin or rosuvastatin doses. This trial will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab in a larger patient population over 24 weeks.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction: the end is more important than the means [^a07c28a4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Many epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the linear relation between elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the risk for coronary heart disease. Conversely, for each 1% reduction in LDL cholesterol in clinical trials, there is a corresponding 1% reduction in coronary heart disease risk. Although the degree of reduction is more important in affecting risk than the means used to lower LDL, statins are considered the most consistently effective means of lowering LDL. The National Cholesterol Education Program now recommends an optional goal of < 70 mg/dl for patients at very high risk for coronary heart disease. In conclusion, on the basis of completed clinical trials, there is no evidence that achieving and maintaining such low levels of LDL cholesterol result in adverse effects. The most potent statins, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, are capable of getting most patients to their LDL cholesterol goals, but combinations of statins with other drugs may be necessary for patients who require additional lipid lowering.

### Efficacy of low-and moderate-intensity statins for achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets in Thai type 2 diabetic patients [^9f572145]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and has been classified as coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalent. Statin treatment has been shown to be effective in reducing ASCVD events both in primary and secondary prevention. The American Diabetes Association 2016 guideline and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2013 guideline both recommended using moderate- and high-intensity statins in all T2D patients, except those aged < 40 years without ASCVD risk factors. Low-, moderate-, and high-intensity statins therapy are predicted to reduce plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels from baseline by approximately < 30%, 30% to < 50%, and ≥ 50%, respectively. Low-intensity statins are not recommended in these guidelines for patients with T2D. However, previous data suggested that Asians achieved plasma LDL-C reductions that were similar to those observed in Westerners, except at lower statin doses. A proposed explanation for this dose-effect difference was genetic variability in drug metabolism. Treatments with simvastatin 10 mg/day and atorvastatin 10 mg/day over 8 weeks at 6 Asian centers resulted in average plasma LDL-C reductions of 35% and 43%, respectively. In addition, blood statin levels were reported to be higher in Asians than in Westerners at the same statin doses, which suggest an increased risk of statin toxicity in Asian population. Lee, et al. reported a difference in plasma LDL-C reduction response to rosuvastatin between subjects of European and Asian ancestry living in Singapore. Moreover, Asian subjects had approximately twofold greater plasma exposure to rosuvastatin than Caucasians, which was not the result of body weight or environmental factors. Although high-intensity statin therapy has been used effectively and safely in Asian patients especially ASCVD patients, most statin side effects are dose-dependent. Titration of statin dosage is a common approach among Thai physicians thus low- and moderate-intensity statins are commonly prescribed among Thai T2D patients without ASCVD.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of low- and moderate-intensity statins for achieving plasma lipid targets in Thai T2D patients, and to assess factors associated with greater plasma LDL-C reductions during statin therapy.

### High-intensity versus non-high-intensity statins in patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal after percutaneous coronary intervention [^edd50929]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Whether use of high‐intensity statins is more important than achieving low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (‐C) target remains controversial in patients with coronary artery disease. We sought to investigate the association between statin intensity and long‐term clinical outcomes in patients achieving treatment target for‐C after percutaneous coronary intervention.

Between February 2003 and December 2014, 1746 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and achieved treatment target for‐C (< 70 mg/dL or > 50% reduction from baseline level) were studied. We classified patients into 2 groups according to an intensity of statin prescribed after index percutaneous coronary intervention: high‐intensity statin group (atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg, and rosuvastatin 20 mg, 372 patients) and non‐high‐intensity statin group (the other statin treatment, 1374 patients). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Difference in time‐averaged‐C during follow‐up was significant, but small, between the high‐intensity statin group and non‐high‐intensity statin group (59 ± 13 versus 61 ± 12 mg/dL; P = 0.04). At 5 years, patients receiving high‐intensity statins had a significantly lower incidence of the primary outcome than those treated with non‐high‐intensity statins (4.1% versus 9.9%; hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.23–0.79; P < 0.01). Results were consistent after propensity‐score matching (4.2% versus 11.2%; hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.19–0.69; P < 0.01) and across various subgroups.

Conclusions

Among patients achieving treatment target for‐C after percutaneous coronary intervention, high‐intensity statins were associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events than non‐high‐intensity statins despite a small difference in achieved‐C level.

During the 4-week fixed-dose period, significantly more patients on rosuvastatin 10 mg had reached the 1998 European LDL-C goal compared with patients on atorvastatin 10 mg (figure 4). When data from the fixed-dose period were re-analysed to the more stringent 2003 European LDL-C goal of < 2.5 mmol/L, 65% of patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg achieved goal compared with 33% of patients receiving atorvastatin 10 mg (p < 0.001; figure 4).

Rosuvastatin also reduced TC, non-HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio, and TC/HDL-C ratio significantly (p < 0.0001) more than atorvastatin after 4 weeks of treatment (table 3). Both treatments increased HDL-C and decreased TG from baseline to 4 weeks, but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups (table 3). In addition, rosuvastatin significantly reduced levels of apo B and the apo B/apo A-I ratio, and increased apo A-I levels compared with atorvastatin (p ≤ 0.05) (table 3). Similar significant effects on TC, non-HDL-C, apolipoproteins and lipid ratios were observed at 16 weeks (table 2).

### Comparison of the effects of high doses of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin on the subpopulations of high-density lipoproteins [^42209226]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are both highly effective in decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. However, rosuvastatin was shown to be more effective in increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. The purpose of the study is to compare the effects of daily doses of rosuvastatin 40 mg with atorvastatin 80 mg during a 6-week period on HDL subpopulations in 306 hyperlipidemic men and women. We previously showed that increased levels of large alpha-1 and alpha-2 HDLs decrease the risk of coronary heart disease and protect against progression of coronary atherosclerosis (superior to HDL cholesterol). In this study, both statins caused significant increases in large alpha-1 (p < 0.001) and alpha-2 (p < 0.001 for rosuvastatin, p < 0.05 for atorvastatin) and significant (p < 0.001) decreases in small pre-beta-1 HDL levels; however, increases in the 2 large HDL particles were significantly higher for rosuvastatin than atorvastatin (alpha-1, 24% vs 12%; alpha-2, 13% vs 4%; p < 0.001). Statin-induced increases in alpha-1 and alpha-2 correlated with increases in HDL cholesterol, whereas decreases in pre-beta-1 were associated with decreases in triglycerides. In subjects with low HDL cholesterol (< 40 mg/dl for men, < 50 mg/dl for women, n = 99), increases in alpha-1 were 32% versus 11%, and in alpha-2, 21% versus 5% for rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that both statins, given at their maximal doses, favorably alter the HDL subpopulation profile, but also that rosuvastatin is significantly more effective in this regard than atorvastatin.

### A comparison of statin therapies in hypercholesterolemia in women: a subgroup analysis of the STELLAR study [^f547e2ff]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale comparative subgroup analysis of the lipid-lowering effects of statins across their dose ranges in hypercholesterolemic women in a clinical trial population. As in the total STELLAR population, rosuvastatin 10–40 mg reduced LDL-C and non-HDL-C more than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin, and milligram-equivalent and higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin. In our analysis, mean baseline LDL-C was 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L), indicating that the women had substantial hypercholesterolemia, with many of them fulfilling the ACC/AHA 2013 guideline criteria for high-intensity statin therapy according to their baseline LDL-C levels alone, irrespective of other risk factors.

Although the 2011 AHA and 2013 ACC/AHA lipid guidelines represent important directives in preventive cardiovascular care for women, and awareness of CVD among women has increased over the last couple of decades, significant gaps in the understanding and management of the disease remain, particularly among black and Hispanic women. Indeed, the majority of women (approximately 85%) in the STELLAR trial were white, and so results from this and other statin studies need to be interpreted with caution in women of ethnic minorities.

In addition, Mosca and colleagues have established that women with high cardiovascular risk rarely achieve established lipid goals in clinical practice. At a mean follow-up of 27 months in 8,353 high-risk women (CHD, CHD risk equivalent, or chronic kidney disease) in a managed care setting, only 7% had achieved AHA ideal lipid levels (12% after 36 months). Despite the substantial evidence available during the study period that lipid-modifying therapy would benefit these women, such treatment was initiated in only 32% of patients, including 35% with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.6 mmol/L).

Some of this undertreatment may be due to the misconception that risk factors in premenopausal women do not need to be managed aggressively and to the earlier belief, now disproved, that hormone replacement therapy reduced cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women. Some undertreatment may be due to lack of awareness of overall cardiovascular risk in womenand to differences in presentation and diagnosis of CVD in women compared with men.

### Comparison of benefits and risks of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin from a meta-analysis of head-to-head randomized controlled trials [^ce949a39]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The benefit from statin therapy is proportional to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction. However, adverse events appear to be related to dose rather than LDL cholesterol reduction. Although serious side effects are rare, any comparison of statins requires scrutiny of the relation between therapeutic effect and risk of side effects. This report sought to determine whether the additional LDL cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin over atorvastatin could be obtained without increased risk of short-term adverse events. Twenty-five studies (approximately 20,000 patients) were identified that provided 28 comparisons of 1:1 dose ratios, 20 comparisons of 1:2 dose ratios, and 6 comparisons of 1:4 dose ratios. Treatment difference in benefit (percentage of LDL cholesterol reduction) and risk (odds ratios for myalgia, increased alanine aminotransferase > 3 times the upper limit of normal, creatine kinase > 10 times the upper limit of normal, and percentage of change in glomerular filtration rate, as well as deaths, serious adverse events, and withdrawals caused by adverse events) were estimated using meta-analysis and presented in benefit-risk planes. Rosuvastatin was more efficacious than the same dose of atorvastatin (1:1 dose ratio) or a 2 times higher dose (1:2 dose ratio) of atorvastatin. There was no significant difference between rosuvastatin and a 4 times higher dose of atorvastatin (1:4 dose ratio). There were no significant differences between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin at any dose ratio for adverse events. Percentages of change in GFR improved significantly with both treatments. In conclusion, at 1:1 and 1:2 dose ratios, significant additional decreases in LDL cholesterol were obtained using rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin at a similar risk of the adverse events presented.

### Physicians' misperceived cardiovascular risk and therapeutic inertia as determinants of low LDL-cholesterol targets achievement in diabetes [^f5bee917]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Variables of interest

Information on comorbidities, life-style habits and main clinical-laboratory findings were collected. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated according to MDRD equation. Diabetic kidney disease was defined by the presence of eGFR < 60 ml/min and/or by presence of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. The cardiovascular risk score was stratified in moderate, high or very-high risk as specified by EAS/EASD guidelines. Detailed data on treatments were reported by physicians for each patient. Ezetimibe, PCSK9i and statins molecules and dosages were provided together with information with any other LLT or nutraceutics taken by each patient. Information on adherence and adverse effects were collected by physicians and not specifically derived from pharmacy claim.

The intensity of statins treatments and overall cholesterol-lowering intensity was classified accordingly to EAS/ESC guidelines and as previously described elsewhere. Briefly different combination of treatments were classified in the following categories according to the expected achievable reduction in LDL-c: low cholesterol-lowering intensity (i.e. allowing < 30% LDL-c reduction, e.g. simvastatin 10 mg), moderate cholesterol-lowering intensity (i.e. allowing between 30 to 49% LDL-c reduction, e.g. rosuvastatin 5–10 mg/day or atorvastatin 10–20 mg/day or combinations such as simvastatin 10 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg), high cholesterol-lowering intensity (i.e. allowing between 50 to 59% LDL-c reduction, e.g. rosuvastatin 20–40 mg/day or atorvastatin 40–80 mg/day or combination rosuvastatin 5/10 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg), very-high intensity (i.e. allowing on average between 60 to 79% LDL-c reduction, e.g. [rosuvastatin 20–40 mg/day or atorvastatin 40–80 mg/day] plus ezetimibe 10 mg, or moderate statins with PCSK9i), and extreme intensity LLT (i.e. allowing at least 80% of LDL-c reduction, e.g. any combination of high intensity statins plus PCSK9i). Since guidelines suggest at least 50% LDL-c reduction for subjects at high or very-high CV risk, we further create a variable for LLT intensity, grouping together all treatments allowing at least 50% (i.e. high-, very-high- and extreme-intensity).

### Effects of rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin on atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome [^f498dfe8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a constellation of coronary risk factors. Atherogenic dyslipidemia is an important factor in cardiovascular risk in these patients, and treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemia has been identified as an important goal of therapy in patients with MS. This post hoc analysis of data from a 6-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, comparative trial (Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin [STELLAR]) assessed the effects of rosuvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg, atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, simvastatin 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, and pravastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg on plasma lipids in hypercholesterolemic patients (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dl; triglycerides < 400 mg/dl) who had ≥ 3 of the 5 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for MS (body mass index > 30 kg/m(2) substituted for waist circumference). Of 2,268 patients, 811 met criteria for MS. Percent reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ranged from 20% in the pravastatin 10-mg group to 55% in the rosuvastatin 40-mg group. In patients with MS, triglyceride reductions were 22% to 34% with rosuvastatin, 23% to 33% with atorvastatin, 15% to 23% with simvastatin, and 12% to 15% with pravastatin. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 8% to 11% with rosuvastatin, 5% to 9% with atorvastatin, 8% to 10% with simvastatin, and 3% to 7% with pravastatin. Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin treatment had favorable effects in hypercholesterolemic patients on the atherogenic dyslipidemia associated with MS. Rosuvastatin had the most favorable effect on the atherogenic lipid profile of MS overall.

### Association between intensity of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statin-based therapies and secondary stroke prevention: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^26ffeca7]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

A prior meta-analysis suggested that a reduction of MACE is proportional to the magnitude of the LDL-C lowering statin-based therapies in secondary prevention for patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but such a finding was not confirmed by the metaregression performed in our study. The heterogeneity of causes of index stroke, as well as recurrent stroke, may be 1 major factor associated with such a phenomenon. The benefits associated with LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies vary among patients with stroke owing to the different causes, and there are concerns that such a strategy may not be universally beneficial to all patients with ischemic stroke. We found that more intensive LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies were associated with a reduced risk of recurrent stroke only in trials with all patients having evidence of atherosclerosis. On the other hand, patients with ischemic stroke who do not show evidence of atherosclerosis may not experience reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke but may expose themselves to an unnecessary increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke and new-onset diabetes when intensive LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies are applied.

The recently issued 2021 AHA/American Stroke Association guideline for recurrent stroke prevention recommends that, for patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke and an LDL-C level of higher than 100 mg/dL, atorvastatin, 80 mg daily, is indicated to reduce recurrent stroke risk. However, this recommendation was based primarily on results from a single large trial. Moreover, atorvastatin, 80 mg daily, is not the only efficacious, intensive LDL-C–lowering strategy. For instance, in the lower-target group of the TST Trial, an LDL-C level of 65 mg/dL was achieved in only 24% of patients in this target group receiving high-intensity statins, while a much higher percentage of patients in this group received combined statins plus ezetimibe (41%). Our meta-analysis of data from several clinical trials suggested that more intensive LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies were associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke, a risk possibly exacerbated by use of high-intensity statins, and that there was no reduced risk of recurrent stroke among patients not having evidence of atherosclerosis. Although we agree that LDL-C–lowering statin-based therapies are indicated for patients with ischemic stroke and an LDL-C level of higher than 100 mg/dL, high-intensity statins, such as atorvastatin, 80 mg daily, should probably be used only when there is evidence of atherosclerosis.

### Effect of intensive lipid lowering on progression of coronary atherosclerosis: evidence for an early benefit from the reversal of atherosclerosis with aggressive lipid lowering (REVERSAL) trial [^b7e8d126]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Statins reduce both atherogenic lipoproteins and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). The optimal strategy for administration of lipid-lowering agents has evolved considerably during the past 2 years. Several studies have compared the effects of intensive versus moderate lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary events. The Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) study was a double-blind, randomized trial comparing the effect that 2 different statins, administered for 18 months, had on atherosclerotic burden measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). At 34 centers in the United States, 654 patients were randomized to moderate lipid lowering using pravastatin 40 mg or intensive treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg. IVUS was performed during baseline catheterization and repeated after 18 months of treatment. Efficacy parameters included changes in atheroma burden determined by IVUS, lipoprotein levels, and CRP levels. Baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mean, 3.9 mmol/L [150.2 mg/dL]) levels were reduced to 2.8 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) in the pravastatin 40-mg group compared with 2.0 mmol/L (79 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin 80-mg arm (p < 0.0001). CRP decreased 5.2% with pravastatin and 36.4% with atorvastatin (p < 0.0001). Changes in atheroma burden showed a significantly lower progression rate in the intensive arm for all 3 prespecified IVUS efficacy measures. For all IVUS end points, progression occurred in the moderate-treatment cohort. However, plaque volume was unchanged in the intensive arm, indicating absence of progression. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that greater reductions in both lipid levels and hsCRP were associated with slower disease progression. The slowest progression occurred in patients with above-median reductions in both LDL cholesterol and CRP. For patients with coronary artery disease, intensive treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis compared with a more moderate regimen consisting of pravastatin 40 mg. Compared with baseline, intensively treated patients had no change in atheroma burden, whereas moderately treated patients showed progression. These differences are related to the greater reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins and CRP in intensively treated patients.

Statistical analysis

Data from the per-protocol patient population were used for this exploratory analysis because a complete laboratory dataset was required for each patient. Statistical significance of least-squares differences among treatment groups was determined with an ANCOVA model that included controls for treatment, study center, and baseline value. The statistical significance of differences in goal attainment was determined by the χ 2 test.

### Guidelines for lowering lipids to reduce coronary artery disease risk: a comparison of rosuvastatin with atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin for achieving lipid-lowering goals [^67a3b6bd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Both the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III and the Second Joint Task Force of European Societies guidelines have established low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals for lipid-lowering treatment to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease. Data from 3 trials that compared rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 389) with atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 393) and 2 trials that compared rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 226) with pravastatin 20 mg (n = 252) and simvastatin 20 mg (n = 249) were pooled separately to compare the achievement of LDL cholesterol goals over 12 weeks of treatment in hypercholesterolemic patients. Noncomparative pooling of rosuvastatin 10 mg results from all 5 trials (n = 615) showed that 80% achieved NCEP ATP III goals and 81% achieved the European goal of < 3.0 mmol/L. Compared with atorvastatin 10 mg, significantly more patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg achieved their ATP III (76% vs 53%) and European (82% vs 51%) goals (p < 0.001). Also, in comparisons with simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 20 mg, 86% of patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg achieved ATP III goals, compared with 64% of simvastatin-treated patients and 49% of pravastatin-treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportions of patients who achieved the European goal were 80%, 48%, and 16% for rosuvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and pravastatin 20 mg, respectively, in this comparison (all p < 0.001). A total of 71% of patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg who had triglyceride levels ≥ 200 mg/dL met both their LDL cholesterol and their non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals.

### High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction: the IDEAL study: a randomized controlled trial [^afa873a5]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Evidence suggests that more intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) than is commonly applied clinically will provide further benefit in stable coronary artery disease.

Objective

To compare the effects of 2 strategies of lipid lowering on the risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with a previous myocardial infarction (MI).

Design, Setting, and Participants

The IDEAL study, a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial conducted at 190 ambulatory cardiology care and specialist practices in northern Europe between March 1999 and March 2005 with a median follow-up of 4.8 years, which enrolled 8888 patients aged 80 years or younger with a history of acute MI.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a high dose of atorvastatin (80 mg/d; n = 4439), or usual-dose simvastatin (20 mg/d; n = 4449).

Main Outcome Measure

Occurrence of a major coronary event, defined as coronary death, confirmed nonfatal acute MI, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation.

Results

During treatment, mean LDL-C levels were 104 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the simvastatin group and 81 (SE, 0.3) mg/dL in the atorvastatin group. A major coronary event occurred in 463 simvastatin patients (10.4%) and in 411 atorvastatin patients (9.3%) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.01; P = 0.07). Nonfatal acute MI occurred in 321 (7.2%) and 267 (6.0%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.98; P = 0.02), but no differences were seen in the 2 other components of the primary end point. Major cardiovascular events occurred in 608 and 533 in the 2 groups, respectively (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77–0.98; P = 0.02). Occurrence of any coronary event was reported in 1059 simvastatin and 898 atorvastatin patients (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.91; P < .001). Noncardiovascular death occurred in 156 (3.5%) and 143 (3.2%) in the 2 groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.73–1.15; P = 0.47). Death from any cause occurred in 374 (8.4%) in the simvastatin group and 366 (8.2%) in the atorvastatin group (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.85–1.13; P = 0.81). Patients in the atorvastatin group had higher rates of drug discontinuation due to nonserious adverse events; transaminase elevation resulted in 43 (1.0%) vs 5 (0.1%) withdrawals (P < .001). Serious myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were rare in both groups.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with previous MI, intensive lowering of LDL-C did not result in a significant reduction in the primary outcome of major coronary events, but did reduce the risk of other composite secondary end points and nonfatal acute MI. There were no differences in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Patients with MI may benefit from intensive lowering of LDL-C without an increase in noncardiovascular mortality or other serious adverse reactions.

### Safety and efficacy of achieving very low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with rosuvastatin 40 mg daily (from the ASTEROID study) [^729d4d36]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical trial evidence supports the use of intensive statin therapy for patients with coronary artery disease. High doses of potent statins have shown the greatest clinical benefit, but concerns persist regarding the efficacy and safety of achieving very low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. We grouped patients treated with 40 mg of rosuvastatin daily by the LDL cholesterol achieved according to previous work (< 40, 40 to < 60, 60 to < 80, 80 to < 100, and ≥ 100 mg/dl) and by National Cholesterol Education Program targets (< 70, 70 to < 100, and ≥ 100 mg/dl) in A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Rosuvastatin on Intravascular Ultrasound-Derived Coronary Atheroma Burden (ASTEROID). The rates of key safety end points, including death, hemorrhagic stroke, and liver and muscle enzyme elevations, and key efficacy end points (atheroma burden) were compared using chi-square testing or Fisher's exact testing. The analysis included 471 patients who had had their LDL cholesterol measured at 3 months, of whom 340 (72.2%) had LDL cholesterol of < 70 mg/dl, exhibiting excellent achievement of even the most stringent guideline-based goals. Of these 471 subjects, 192 (40.8%) had LDL cholesterol ≥ 40 mg/dl but < 60 mg/dl, and 57 (12.1%) had LDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dl. Adverse events occurred infrequently during the trial, and no pattern appeared relating the frequency of any adverse event to the achieved LDL cholesterol. Similarly, the on-treatment atheroma volume, change in atheroma volume, and high percentage of subjects with atheroma regression did not differ by the achieved LDL cholesterol. In conclusion, although the power to detect such changes was limited, these data showed no clear relation between the LDL cholesterol achieved by intensive statin therapy with rosuvastatin and adverse effects. Atheroma regression occurred in most patients and was not linked to the LDL cholesterol achieved.

### A comparison of statin therapies in hypercholesterolemia in women: a subgroup analysis of the STELLAR study [^5b75aa41]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

FIG. 2.
(A) LS mean % change from baseline in LDL-C at week 6 (LOCF). (B) LS mean % change from baseline in non-HDL-C at week 6 (LOCF). (C) LS mean % change from baseline in HDL-C at week 6 (LOCF). (D) LS mean % change from baseline in TG at week 6 (LOCF). The dashed line refers to the least-squares mean percentage change for rosuvastatin 10 mg. HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LOCF, last observation carried forward; LS, least-squares; TG, triglycerides

Reductions in non-HDL-C levels ranged from 45% to 53% with rosuvastatin, 37% to 48% with atorvastatin, 27% to 44% with simvastatin, and 19% to 28% with pravastatin (Fig. 2B). Reductions in non-HDL-C with rosuvastatin 10 mg were significantly greater when compared with atorvastatin 10 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg; and pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg (p < 0.002 for all comparisons). Rosuvastatin 20 mg reduced non-HDL-C significantly more than milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin (p < 0.002 for all comparisons).

The increases in HDL-C were numerically greater with rosuvastatin than with the other statins, but the differences were not statistically significant, except that rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg increased HDL-C significantly more than milligram-equivalent or higher doses of atorvastatin (Fig. 2C).

All statins reduced triglyceride levels, with similar effects across the dose range for rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, and a trend for dose-related reductions for simvastatin and pravastatin. No significant differences in effect on triglycerides were observed between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. However, rosuvastatin 10 mg decreased triglycerides significantly more than simvastatin 10 mg, and pravastatin 10 mg and 20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg decreased triglycerides significantly more than 20 mg of simvastatin and pravastatin (Fig. 2D) (p < 0.002 for all comparisons).
