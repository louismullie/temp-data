## Question

Elevated alkaline phosphate levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and characterizing the pattern of liver test injury. Then, I should verify the source of ALP using GGT and consider isoenzyme fractionation. Next, I will branch the workup into hepatic versus non-hepatic etiologies, followed by targeted imaging and serologies. After that, I need to consider special populations and contexts, and finally outline thresholds for biopsy, observation, and follow-up, while double-checking for pitfalls and exceptions throughout.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and the clinical context, because I should not jump to conclusions based on a single report. I need to repeat the liver panel to verify persistence, review prior results, and anchor the interpretation to the current clinical scenario, since transient or spurious elevations are common and context changes everything [^a080bacb] [^a9b20052]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of elevation and the pattern: a cholestatic pattern shows disproportionate ALP elevation relative to AST/ALT, whereas a hepatocellular pattern shows the opposite, and I can quantify this with the R ratio to guide the differential and next steps [^d1ade2b6] [^9f945fab].

> Next, I should review the source of ALP, because ALP is produced in liver, bone, intestine, and placenta, and I need to ensure I am attributing it correctly. Wait, let me verify with GGT: if GGT is elevated, that supports a hepatobiliary source, whereas a normal GGT pushes me toward bone or other sources, though I must remember GGT is not specific and can be elevated with alcohol, obesity, and medications, so I should not overinterpret it in isolation [^c1d63df8] [^5b449e9b]. If uncertainty remains, I should consider isoenzyme electrophoresis to separate liver, bone, and intestinal fractions, especially in children or when the clinical picture conflicts with GGT guidance [^584fd32f] [^ff84e3bc].

> Now, assuming a hepatobiliary source, I will examine the biliary tree with right upper quadrant ultrasound, because I need to distinguish intrahepatic from extrahepatic cholestasis. If ducts are dilated, I should proceed to MRCP or ERCP to evaluate for obstruction from stones, strictures, or malignancy, whereas if ducts are not dilated, I should pivot to intrahepatic cholestasis and autoimmune serologies [^d6a25fc0] [^927019e1]. Hold on, I should verify that I do not miss PSC, which can present with a cholestatic profile and may require MRCP even with a normal ultrasound, so I will keep a low threshold for cholangiography when clinical suspicion is high [^38474054] [^4eeb3aec].

> For intrahepatic cholestasis, I need to check autoimmune markers, starting with AMA for primary biliary cholangitis, and add ANA and SMA to screen for autoimmune hepatitis and overlap syndromes. I should confirm that AMA is highly sensitive and specific for PBC and that a cholestatic biochemical pattern plus AMA is usually sufficient for diagnosis, reserving biopsy for AMA-negative cases or when staging is needed [^b67e099e] [^097ab41f]. But wait, what if I suspect PSC? I should double-check IgG4 and consider cholangiography, since PSC lacks a specific serologic marker and diagnosis rests on characteristic cholangiographic features after excluding secondary causes [^c6bafdb6] [^38474054].

> I will now examine non-hepatic sources if GGT is normal or isoenzymes point away from liver. Bone disease such as Paget's, metastases, or metabolic bone disease can elevate ALP, so I should correlate with symptoms, age, and imaging, and consider bone-specific ALP when available to improve specificity, especially in adults where hepatic ALP contributes substantially to total ALP [^36903aba] [^a0bc529c]. Let me reconsider pediatric and adolescent patients: transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is common in early childhood and can persist beyond 4 months, so I should avoid overtesting when the child is well and the pattern fits this benign entity [^b0f49774].

> Special populations and contexts require tailored thinking. In pregnancy, I should expect physiologic ALP elevation from placental production and interpret any marked rise cautiously, as very high levels have been linked to placental insufficiency and IUGR, prompting fetal surveillance when clinically indicated [^e618422a]. In infants with parenteral nutrition, I need to check for bone-specific ALP dominance, because ALP elevation often reflects metabolic bone disease rather than cholestasis, which changes management entirely [^72dcbfe0]. In older adults, I should keep Paget's disease and metastatic bone disease high on the list and use total ALP as a screening tool, recognizing its limited sensitivity and the value of targeted skeletal imaging when suspicion persists [^36903aba] [^3cd48a7b].

> Next, I should review thresholds for liver biopsy and observation. If ALP is more than twice the upper limit of normal and the evaluation is negative after 6 months, I should consider liver biopsy to clarify intrahepatic cholestasis or infiltrative disease, whereas if ALP is only 1–2 times the ULN, observation with periodic reassessment is reasonable, especially if stable and asymptomatic [^927019e1]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not missing drug-induced cholestasis or infiltrative malignancy; if the clinical context suggests these, I should escalate to biopsy or cross-sectional imaging sooner rather than later [^6ff95011] [^c9eba59d].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook rare but important mimics and associations. Syphilitic hepatitis in secondary syphilis can present with marked ALP elevation and minimal transaminase changes, so I should add syphilis serology when the pattern is cholestatic and risk factors or rash are present, because treatment is curative and delays are common [^ff9d9527] [^9754a133]. Sarcoidosis can involve the liver with a cholestatic pattern, and although evidence for treatment of asymptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis is limited, baseline ALP screening is reasonable to detect liver involvement and avoid hepatotoxic therapies [^3c389396]. Wilson disease can paradoxically show low or normal ALP in the setting of acute liver failure, so a very high bilirubin-to-ALP ratio should trigger urgent Wilson evaluation rather than reassurance [^bfd9c9eb] [^d8b4ee53].

> Finally, I should double-check that my follow-up plan aligns with guidelines and patient-specific risk. For confirmed hepatobiliary ALP elevation, I will monitor response to therapy and disease progression using ALP trends, recognizing that in PBC, ALP reduction on UDCA correlates with improved outcomes, and in PSC, ALP behavior informs prognosis even though it is not a diagnostic criterion in AASLD guidance [^47349751] [^4eeb3aec]. For non-hepatic sources, I will target the underlying bone or endocrine disorder and avoid attributing persistent elevation to liver disease when the data do not support it, thereby preventing unnecessary interventions and anxiety [^36903aba] [^a0bc529c].

Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reflects increased activity from liver, bone, or other sources, and **requires a structured approach** to determine the cause and guide management [^c1d63df8]. Confirm hepatic origin with **GGT** [^c1d63df8], then use **ultrasound** to distinguish extrahepatic obstruction from intrahepatic cholestasis [^d6a25fc0]. If cholestatic, evaluate for PBC/PSC with AMA, ANA, and cholangiography [^927019e1]; if hepatocellular, assess viral, alcoholic, metabolic, and drug causes [^9f945fab]. Non-hepatic causes include bone disease, malignancy, and pregnancy [^584fd32f]; tailor tests to the clinical context [^a9b20052]. Management targets the underlying cause, with biopsy or MRCP reserved for unresolved cases [^a080bacb].

---

## Physiological and pathological sources of ALP

ALP is a metalloenzyme produced by multiple tissues, with **liver and bone** as the predominant sources [^584fd32f]. Elevated levels can arise from physiological states (e.g. pregnancy, adolescence) or pathological conditions affecting liver, bone, or other organs [^584fd32f].

| **Source** | **Physiological conditions** | **Pathological conditions** |
|-|-|-|
| Liver | - Pregnancy (placental ALP) <br/> - Adolescence (bone growth) | - Cholestasis (PBC, PSC, biliary obstruction) <br/> - Hepatitis <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Infiltrative liver disease [^c1d63df8] [^4eeb3aec] |
| Bone | - Growth spurts in children <br/> - Adolescence | - Paget's disease <br/> - Osteomalacia <br/> - Hyperparathyroidism <br/> - Bone metastases <br/> - Fractures [^36903aba] [^ab8d8dcf] |
| Intestine | - Recent fatty meal | - Ulcerative colitis <br/> - Crohn's disease <br/> - Celiac disease [^notfound] |
| Placenta | - Third trimester of pregnancy | - N/A |

## Clinical significance of elevated ALP

Elevated ALP is a marker of **cholestatic liver disease**, bone disorders, and certain malignancies. The clinical significance depends on the underlying cause, magnitude, and persistence of elevation [^c1d63df8].

---

## Diagnostic approach to elevated ALP

A **structured approach** is essential to identify the cause of elevated ALP:

---

### Step 1: confirm hepatic origin

Measure **gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)** to confirm a hepatobiliary source; an elevated GGT supports hepatic origin, whereas a normal GGT suggests a non-hepatic source (e.g. bone) [^c1d63df8] [^5b449e9b].

---

### Step 2: imaging studies

Perform a **right upper quadrant ultrasound** to assess for biliary obstruction, gallstones, or mass lesions [^d6a25fc0]. If ultrasound is inconclusive and suspicion for obstruction or PSC remains, proceed to MRCP or ERCP [^c1d63df8].

---

### Step 3: laboratory evaluation

- **Hepatobiliary causes**: Evaluate for PBC (AMA), PSC (ANA, ASMA, IgG4), viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), and infiltrative diseases [^927019e1] [^c6bafdb6].
- **Bone causes**: Assess calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D, and consider bone-specific ALP or imaging (X-ray, bone scan) if bone disease is suspected [^36903aba] [^d0b11c2b].
- **Malignancy**: Consider metastatic disease or paraneoplastic syndromes if clinically indicated [^a8e5f72a].

---

## Common causes of elevated ALP

| **Category** | **Specific conditions** |
|-|-|
| Hepatobiliary | - Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) <br/> - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) <br/> - Biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, tumors) <br/> - Hepatitis (viral, alcoholic, autoimmune) <br/> - Cirrhosis <br/> - Infiltrative liver disease (sarcoidosis, lymphoma) [^c1d63df8] [^4eeb3aec] |
| Bone | - Paget's disease <br/> - Osteomalacia <br/> - Hyperparathyroidism <br/> - Bone metastases <br/> - Fractures [^36903aba] [^ab8d8dcf] |
| Malignancy | - Cholangiocarcinoma <br/> - Hepatocellular carcinoma <br/> - Metastatic liver disease <br/> - Bone metastases [^c9eba59d] [^a8e5f72a] |
| Physiological | - Pregnancy <br/> - Adolescence <br/> - Recent fatty meal [^584fd32f] [^9563da2d] |

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on the **underlying cause**:

- **Hepatobiliary disease**: Treat cholestasis, hepatitis, or obstruction; consider UDCA for PBC, immunosuppression for autoimmune hepatitis, and surgical or endoscopic intervention for obstruction [^9b4c3892] [^a304495c].
- **Bone disease**: Address vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, or malignancy; consider bisphosphonates for Paget's disease or metastatic bone disease [^36903aba].
- **Physiological elevation**: No intervention required; monitor and reassure [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic implications

Persistent ALP elevation, particularly in cholestatic liver disease, is associated with **progression to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver failure**. In bone disease, ALP correlates with disease activity and response to therapy [^47349751] [^a0bc529c].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: ALP elevation is common due to placental production; monitor for obstetric complications if markedly elevated [^e618422a].
- **Children**: Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is common; evaluate for bone disease or liver disease if persistent or symptomatic [^b0f49774].
- **Elderly**: Higher prevalence of bone disease and malignancy; thorough evaluation is warranted [^3cd48a7b].

---

Elevated ALP is a nonspecific marker requiring a **structured approach** to determine the source and cause. Confirm hepatic origin with GGT, use ultrasound to distinguish intra- from extrahepatic processes, and tailor further tests to the clinical context. Management targets the underlying disease, and persistent elevation warrants biopsy or advanced imaging [^927019e1].

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^c1d63df8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases—evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in >50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^9f945fab]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline—abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Differential diagnosis of perinatal hypophosphatasia: radiologic perspectives [^cd5fe7a1]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

HPP is confirmed with consistently low age- and gender-adjusted alkaline phosphatase activity in conjunction with medical history and physical findings, radiologic findings, elevated levels of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase substrates or sequencing of the ALPL gene. In utero and postnatal recognition and diagnosis of perinatal HPP based on radiologic findings can be challenging because of features that overlap with many of the more than 400 other skeletal dysplasias, the phenotypic variability and a lack of information about the in utero natural history of HPP. The skeletal abnormalities and the gestational and postnatal ages at which they manifest vary across skeletal dysplasias, including HPP. Many sonographic and radiographic findings are not pathognomonic for a specific disorder, as obtaining reliable information regarding skeletal mineralization is difficult with prenatal sonography and computed tomography (CT). These difficulties are confounded by a general lack of familiarity with HPP among the health care providers who perform prenatal ultrasound (US) and neonatal imaging. In addition, abnormalities can be detected at earlier gestational ages than they have in the past, underscoring the need for obstetricians, ultrasonographers and radiologists to possess in-depth knowledge of the appearance of the fetal skeleton at all gestational ages. This review focuses on the role of fetal and neonatal imaging modalities in the differential diagnosis of perinatal HPP.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^16264a32]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline—summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^a080bacb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline—initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^f8c52eff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2009 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) [^4b11fddf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary—calcium measurement approach and alkaline phosphatase use: The work group did not recommend that corrected calcium measurement be abandoned at present, although recent data did not show superiority over total calcium alone, and it considered measurement of ionized calcium to be more specific, but presently not practical or cost-effective. The KDOQI Work Group recommends using total alkaline phosphatase activity as an adjunct test, which may provide supplemental information in the assessment of bone turnover, particularly in the setting of increased PTH levels and in the assessment of response to therapy for increased PTH levels if liver disease is not likely to be the cause of increased total alkaline phosphatase levels. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase derives more specifically from bone and can be used when the clinical situation is more ambiguous; however, the test is not readily available. High total alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with higher mortality, but it is not known whether therapies aimed at decreasing these levels improve patient outcomes. The KDOQI bone guideline also discussed that concomitant consideration of alkaline phosphatase levels can increase the predictive power of PTH levels; data were insufficient to determine the sensitivity and specificity of alkaline phosphatase levels for renal osteodystrophy alone or together with PTH levels, and the value of alkaline phosphatase for clinical decision making remains to be proved.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Paget's disease, more specifically with respect to laboratory evaluation, PA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider measuring bone ALP, procollagen type-I N propetide or urinary N-terminal telopeptide in patients in whom serum ALP levels are normal and clinical suspicion of metabolically active Paget's disease remains high.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^b67e099e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations—primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is described as “an uncommon chronic liver disease” that “is seen more commonly in women than men,” with symptoms such as “fatigue and pruritus.” Testing highlights cholestasis and characteristic serology: “Lab testing reveals biochemical evidence of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevation of bilirubin), as well as the serologic hallmark for screening and diagnosis: immunoglobulin M and PBC-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in up to 95% of patients (64).” Histology is selective: “Liver biopsy is not routinely required although may be beneficial in patients with suspected anti-mitochondrial antibody-negative disease and to stage liver fibrosis.”

### Parathyroid carcinoma [^6c98cc74]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase activity is also higher in patients with parathyroid carcinoma than in those with adenoma in whom serum levels are generally close to the upper limit of the normal range. α- and β-subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may be elevated in patients with parathyroid cancer but not in those with benign tumors. Urinary hCG levels were found to be elevated in a small group of subjects with parathyroid carcinomas, in contrast to a control group of patients with benign PHPT. In particular, the elevated hCG isotype was the hyperglycosolated form of hCG that is specifically associated with malignancy in trophoblastic and nontrophoblastic diseases. Moreover, elevations of hCG might be predictive of complications such as hip fracture and death.

When benign PHPT presents with markedly elevated serum calcium concentrations and overt target organ involvement, a clinical phenotype that was historically common but is now infrequently seen in most countries, the clinical distinction between benign and malignant disease may be difficult. It is preferable to have a high index of suspicion particularly when concomitant kidney and bone disease are present than to miss the opportunity for surgical cure by failing to consider cancer in the differential diagnosis.

Acute PHPT, sometimes called “parathyroid crisis,” shares many clinical features with parathyroid carcinoma. In view of the marked elevations of serum calcium and PTH that are common in parathyroid crisis, parathyroid cancer should be considered in any differential diagnosis of this condition. Parathyroid cancer should also be considered in any hypercalcemic patient without a history of prior neck surgery who presents with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.

### Benign familial hyperphosphatasemia (...) [^d69fc4a8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase activity in serum suggests bone or liver disease or a neoplasm but can also indicate pregnancy or another benign condition. A family with benign hyperphosphatasemia was studied to elucidate the genetics and enzyme defect. Serum total alkaline phosphatase activity was greater than the population mean in all six family members, and more than 7 SDs above the mean in two of four offspring. Monoclonal antibodies to three alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes, intestinal, placental, and tissue nonspecific, demonstrated markedly increased intestinal alkaline phosphatase levels in all family members and significantly elevated liver/bone/ kidney activity in the two offspring. Guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of the liver/bone/kidney component showed high alkaline phosphatase activity from liver in both siblings and from bone in one.

The mode of inheritance in this family is obscure, but a complex regulation of the products of two different alkaline phosphatase genes seems likely. Steps toward diagnosis are suggested. Early recognition of this benign biochemical abnormality should help to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests. Siraganian PA, Mulvihill JJ, Mulivor RA, Miller RW. Benign Familial Hyperphosphatasemia.

### Rare cause of acute hepatitis: a common energy drink [^18a9a0eb]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

While the serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase were elevated on presentation, we were able to narrow our differential diagnosis to various possible aetiologies of hepatitis based on the predominant hepatocellular pattern of laboratory abnormalities. We then further narrowed our differential to the hepatocellular diseases associated with elevated bilirubin and jaundice, including viral infections (eg, hepatitis A, B, C, D and E, EBV, CMV), toxic (eg, alcohol, drugs, environmental), autoimmune, Wilson disease, ischaemia and congestive hepatopathy.

Though the patient was found to have HCV infection, we did not think HCV was responsible for his acute hepatitis. HCV antibody production has a window period, with serum antibodies undetectable by assay until ∼10 weeks after the initial exposure.Being that our patient's symptoms only began 2 weeks prior, his positive serology was not compatible with an acute HCV infection, but was deemed more likely a chronic infection. In the absence of clinical signs of haemodynamic instability, we thought ischaemic hepatic injury to be less likely. Furthermore, ischaemic hepatitis is often accompanied by evidence of other end-organ hypoperfusion, such as renal acute tubular necrosis.Therefore, our patient's normal renal function on presentation did not favour the diagnosis of ischaemic hepatitis.

History and examination also made aetiologies such as alcohol, prescribed medications, illicit drugs, environmental causes and congestive hepatopathy less likely. We excluded other viral causes of hepatitis, autoimmune aetiology and Wilson disease based on laboratory results. Biopsy findings in this case were non-specific and can be seen in drug-induced or toxin-induced hepatitis, and in hepatic injury related to other causes, such as autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, coeliac disease and acute viral hepatitis. Having carefully excluded the alternative processes with similar pathological findings, the diagnosis of acute hepatitis secondary to consumption of energy drinks was rendered.

Incidentally, the patient's high levels of serum folate and vitamin B 12 were also consistent with supplemental intake, likely from energy drink usage as he denied any alternative supplementation. The diagnosis was further supported by consideration of chronological and clinical data. His liver injury was directly subsequent to excessive consumption of energy drinks, and resolved on discontinuation of the product.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^6305141d]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal.Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1 
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral. ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; ARLD, alcohol-related liver disease; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BMI, body mass index; FBC, full blood count; GGT, γ-glutamyltransferase; INR, international normalised ratio; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus; USS, ultrasound scan.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^b3b3bd7a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Physical Examination

Physical examination identifies the consequences of hypophosphatemia and features guiding the differential diagnosis. Children may have bowing of limbs, waddling gait, in-toeing, enlargement of the wrist, knees, or ankles, frontal bossing, fusion of skull sutures, expansion of the costochondral junctions, or a horizontal groove along the thoracic border. Bone pain evident on palpation, movement, or weight bearing may be secondary to osteomalacia alone, but should prompt consideration of fracture or pseudofracture. Dental abscesses are common in XLH. Muscle weakness and abnormal gait may be present. Enthesopathy often manifests as decreased range of motion at the spine or large joints due to calcification of entheses in adults with XLH. If TIO is considered, a mass may be palpated in any part of body. Skin examination may detect café au lait macules (FD and McCune–Albright syndrome) or abnormal nevi with a variety of morphologies (pink/orange hairless plaques or brown verrucous lesions that are exophytic and friable; nevi on mucous membranes, mouth, or eyes, which could represent linear sebaceous nevi). FD may result in deformities of long bones or facial asymmetry due involved craniofacial bones.

Laboratory

We recommend collecting samples before initiating treatment to avoid confounding the results. If a patient is already receiving treatment, stopping phosphate and calcitriol for a week before testing can clarify the diagnosis. Initial evaluation includes measuring serum calcium, phosphorus, PTH, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. While secondary hyperparathyroidism often accompanies rickets, rickets is not usually caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. Hypocalcemia would suggest abnormal vitamin D stores or vitamin D metabolism or a tubulopathy. Alkaline phosphatase levels are typically elevated in rickets but may be only mildly high. Normal serum phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase values are higher in infants and young children and decrease with age gradually to adulthood; therefore, one must be certain to compare these to age-appropriate normal ranges to ensure appropriate diagnosis. Using an adult normal range for serum phosphorus could result in missing the diagnosis of hypophosphatemia.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^5b449e9b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries—bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually <1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of <24 h duration.

Investigations

At the acute presentation and after the two episodes of sudden neurological deterioration, the patient underwent urgent non-contrast head CT and brain MRI studies. Initial tests were performed and showed that haemoglobin A1c was 6.8%, low-density lipoprotein was 100 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein was 51 mg/dL. They also showed pancytopenia associated with the recent chemotherapy treatments and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels due to the underlying cholangiocarcinoma. Extensive workup to investigate the stroke aetiology was conducted, and the relevant findings are discussed below in relation to each differential diagnosis.

### Elevated liver enzymes: emergency department-focused management [^0def5966]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more common with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

Discussion

The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

Conclusions

By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management and evaluation of the patient with elevated LFTs.

Figure 4—Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under “Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases,” proceed with “History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT”; if “GGT normal --> evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies,” but if “GGT abnormal --> obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA.” If the evaluation is negative, then “If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN --> consider liver biopsy” or “If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2x ULN --> consider observation,” and “If AMA positive --> evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis,” with persistence prompting “If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation --> consider liver biopsy.” Under “Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin,” perform “History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound”; if “If ductal dilatation --> ERCP, MRCP” and if “If no ductal dilatation --> check AMA, ANA, SMA.” Next, “If AMA positive --> evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis,” whereas “If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN --> consider liver biopsy or MRCP” or “If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2x ULN --> consider observation,” and persistent elevation leads to “If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation --> consider liver biopsy or MRCP.”

### Is parathyroid hormone measurement useful for the diagnosis of renal bone disease? [^14bb0c00]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The non-invasive diagnosis of bone turnover in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains difficult compared with bone histomorphometry as the gold standard. Most clinicians rely on surrogate markers, mainly serum parathyroid hormone and total alkaline phosphatases, in association with serum calcium and phosphorus. Although very high serum PTH levels generally allow the diagnosis of high bone turnover, slight elevations, normal, or low values cannot allow a reliable distinction between normal or low turnover.

### Persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase [^ff84e3bc]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old overweight asymptomatic man was found to have a persistently raised serum alkaline phosphatase at 250-300&emsp14;U/l (normal range <130). Other liver function tests were unremarkable apart from an initial marginally elevated alanine transaminase, which normalised with weight reduction. Abdominal imaging revealed a fatty liver but an extensive serological search for significant hepatobiliary disease was negative. Subsequent isoenzyme electrophoresis revealed normal liver and bone fractions of alkaline phosphatase but a grossly elevated intestinal fraction. Elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase should be considered in the investigation of unexplained alkaline phosphatase, particularly when the usual associated hepatobiliary and bony pathologies are not present. Although an elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase can be linked to significant gastrointestinal pathology, this case report highlights that it can be a benign biochemical finding.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^8201f123]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries—bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Low serum alkaline phosphatase activity and pathologic fracture: case report and brief review of hypophosphatasia diagnosed in adulthood [^11b29f82]. Endocrine Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe an elderly patient with low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity detected after a pathologic fracture and to characterize hypophosphatasia in adult patients.

Methods

We present a case report of a 64-year-old woman, who was referred after sustaining an atraumatic femoral fracture treated successfully with intramedullary nailing. Clinical, biochemical, radiologic, and molecular studies explore the differential diagnosis of her hypophosphatasemia, and the features, diagnosis, and management of the adult form of hypophosphatasia are reviewed.

Results

Physical examination of our patient was revealing only for short stature. Bone mineral density evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was unremarkable. Biochemical investigations showed normal calcium, elevated inorganic phosphate, and low ALP levels in serum. In light of the hypophosphatasemia and pathologic fracture, the serum pyridoxal 5'-phosphate concentration was measured and found to be considerably elevated, a substantiation of the diagnosis of hypophosphatasia. Analysis of the gene encoding the "tissue-nonspecific" isoenzyme of ALP (TNSALP) demonstrated a novel, heterozygous, missense mutation causing her disorder.

Conclusion

Hypophosphatasia is a rare inborn error of metabolism due to a deactivating mutation (or mutations) of the gene encoding TNSALP, in turn leading to global deficiency of TNSALP activity and inadequate skeletal mineralization and fractures. Our patient illustrates the importance of low serum ALP activity in the assessment of patients with fractures. No established treatment exists for hypophosphatasia, but the correct diagnosis should help to avoid the use of traditional therapies for osteoporosis or osteomalacia, which would be ineffective or potentially harmful.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^16c785ac]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Research needs

Studies are needed to delineate the best screening test for hepatic sarcoidosis, such as alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases, or others. In addition, little is known about the natural history of hepatic sarcoidosis. Case series demonstrate a broad range of disease outcomes, from spontaneous resolution to rapid progression to cirrhosis. Future studies should use long-term longitudinal follow-up to determine the natural history of hepatic sarcoidosis and consider the influence of genetic and environmental factors. Better tools are needed to: 1) detect progression from hepatitis to early fibrosis and cirrhosis, such as liver elastography ultrasound; 2) more accurately characterize disease phenotypes; and 3) identify patients who might need and respond best to therapy.

Question 6: Should Patients with Sarcoidosis Who Do Not Have Symptoms or Signs of Hypercalcemia Undergo Screening for Abnormal Calcium Metabolism by Routine Serum Calcium and Vitamin D Testing?

Rationale for question

Abnormal calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis can lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and their manifestations, including kidney stones and renal failure; it is the most common cause of sarcoidosis-related renal insufficiency. Dysfunctional calcium metabolism can also result in elevated bone resorption and increased renal and intestinal absorption of calcium. The mechanisms of abnormal calcium metabolism are likely multifactorial, including increased 1α‐hydroxylase production by granulomatous macrophages, which converts 25-(OH) vitamin D to 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D, increased expression of parathyroid hormone–related protein in sarcoidosis macrophages, and cytokine and other growth factor production. Although hypercalcemia- or hypercalciuria-related symptoms may bring the problem to attention, the committee asked whether patients with sarcoidosis without symptoms should undergo screening for abnormal calcium metabolism by baseline serum calcium and vitamin D testing.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^37f87728]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^584fd32f]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease—for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin.While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget’s disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^ab8d8dcf]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical characteristics

The biochemical hallmarks of XLH are hypophosphataemia due to renal phosphate wasting, increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and elevated intact FGF23 levels,. A positive family history of XLH, elevated ALP levels, decreased serum phosphate concentrations associated with renal phosphate wasting and/or the identification of a PHEX mutation can help to identify affected children within the first weeks of life. Of note, serum levels of phosphate might be in the normal range within the first 3–4 months of life,. Renal phosphate wasting should be evaluated by calculating the tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR)(Table 1). In patients with insufficient phosphate intake, or impaired intestinal absorption (which might be suspected by low urinary levels of phosphate), TmP/GFR can be falsely low until serum levels of phosphate are restored to normal. Although, plasma levels of intact FGF23 are usually elevated, normal levels of FGF23 do not exclude XLH but should be interpreted as inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia. FGF23 levels are also influenced by other factors, in particular phosphate intake and vitamin D therapy,,,. Therefore, FGF23 levels are most informative in untreated patients. FGF23 levels are elevated in several other forms of hypophosphataemic rickets (Table 2), and the normal range varies considerably according to the assay used,. Serum concentrations of calcium are usually in the lower normal range, and urinary calcium is low owing to impaired 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D synthesis and consequently decreased intestinal calcium absorption. In contrast to calcipenic rickets, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are usually at the upper limit of the normal range or even slightly elevated. Circulating levels of 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D are low or inappropriately normal in the setting of hypophosphataemia,–.

### Clinical significance of serum alkaline phosphatase level in advanced pancreatic cancer (...) [^34f10f34]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

Abstract 183 Background: Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that is elevated by various hepatobiliary diseases. Generally its elevation is thought to indicate bile stasis. There are some reports that show ALP is an important prognostic factor for several cancers such as colon, lung, and gastric cancer. Often it is speculated that ALP elevation indicates bile stasis caused by liver metastasis. However, the significance of ALP elevation in advanced pancreatic cancer patients is not well evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine the significance of elevated serum ALP as a prognostic factor in patients with APC even without jaundice and liver metastasis. Methods: Serum ALP levels were measured in 393 patients with APC receiving gemcitabine monotherapy before treatment, and according to those levels, patients were subgrouped, UNL-500 U/L, 501-700 U/L, 701-1000 U/L, 1000U/L < ALP).

The clinical data of each group were analyzed to see characteristics of elevated ALP patients. The relationship between ALP level and survival, response were also examined. Results: The elevated ALP group included poor performance status patients, and associated with low serum albumin. The elevated ALP group 112 days) showed significantly worse prognosis and lower disease control rate compared to the normal ALP group. Multivariate analysis revealed ALP, CRP, ascites, distant metastasis, white blood cell count, PS, AST, and ALT were independent prognostic factors. Similar results were seen in liver metastasis free patients without jaundice. Conclusions: Elevated serum ALP level correlated with poor performance status and low serum albumin.

ALP was also the independent prognostic factor in liver metastasis free APC patients without jaundice. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

Elevation of total bilirubin level—evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert’s syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually <3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level >5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (<4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert’s syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^9107c0ca]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests—patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

Cholestatic liver disease—interpretation of nutritional biomarkers and vitamins emphasizes that Vitamin K deficiency (VKD) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of metabolic bone disease in cholestatic patients, even in those with a normal INR, and that Plasma PIVKA-II (protein induced in vitamin K absence) levels may assist in determining VKD; however, this assay is not widely available in the clinical setting. For vitamin D deficiency (VDD), If VDD is suspected, further work-up including measurement of serum parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate levels may be indicated. For zinc status, Zinc circulates bound to albumin; therefore, low serum albumin and zinc levels are used to screen for deficiency, which may be associated with hair loss and skin desquamation, and since zinc is required for alkaline phosphatase synthesis, low alkaline phosphatase levels may be suggestive of zinc deficiency; however, Alkaline phosphatase levels should, however, be interpreted with caution in patients with cholestasis and/or bone disease, which cause elevations in this biomarker. A directive on this page states that Clinicians should familiarize themselves with the limitations of nutritional biomarkers in the context of chronic liver disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^abd53d51]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries—initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g., GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Diagnosis considerations for hypophosphatasia—Diagnosis in patients of any age can be established based on characteristic signs, symptoms, and complications together with consistently low age- and sex-adjusted serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after excluding other causes of low ALP and skeletal diseases with similar presentations. Because the lower limit of normal for ALP varies by age and sex, measured activity must be compared with the lower limit and range appropriate for the patient. Physicians should be aware that many institutions do not routinely flag low ALP and may incorrectly apply adult ALP reference ranges to all ages, and the report emphasizes that age- and sex-adjusted ALP reference intervals are critical to an accurate diagnosis of HPP.

THE PROS AND CONS OF ALP IN PSC

An elevated serum ALP level above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is part of the diagnostic criteria of PSC in adults in the EASL, but not in the AASLD clinical practice guidelines. According to the AASLD guidelines, the cholangiographic features of PSC, along with the exclusion of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, is sufficient for making a diagnosis, accounting for the fact that a significant proportion of individuals with PSC may have normal ALP levels. As PSC is increasingly diagnosed at earlier disease stages along with increased attention and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) availability and quality, omission of the elevated ALP criterion of the diagnosis, as now implemented in the AASLD guidelines, may be particularly relevant. High levels of ALP are associated with a more severe disease stratum, while normal levels are associated with a better prognosis. ALP is thus included in several prognostic models for PSC, including the Amsterdam-Oxford score,the UK-PSC score,and the PREsTO score.However, the intraindividual variability of ALP is considerable, and spontaneous normalization of ALP frequently occurs.,

Biology of ALP

ALPs are glycoproteins bound to the plasma membrane and are widely distributed in nature.In humans, zinc and magnesium serve as significant cofactors for their biological activity. ALPs exist in 4 different isoforms: intestinal ALP, placental ALP, germ cell ALP, and liver/bone/kidney (ie, tissue-nonspecific) ALP. Over 80% of the ALPs in serum originate from the liver and bone. Although ALPs are found in numerous tissues, their exact physiological function remains largely unknown.Elevated activity in the circulation is a marker for skeletal remodeling or hepatobiliary disease, but clinical variations in serum ALP levels also commonly occur in endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease, hematological diseases, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiencies.Genetic variation, for instance related to bile acid transport and glycobiology, associates with ALP levels in apparently healthy individuals. It is currently unknown to what extent ALP serves an integral part of cholestatic liver disease pathophysiology or merely represents a marker of biliary injury, altered bile composition, and cholestasis.

### Background (...) [^95fb0e36]. stacks.cdc.gov (2013). Low credibility.

Elevated total serum alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with mortality in the general population and in dialysis patients. Retrospective cohort study. 28, 678 patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4. Each 1-standard deviation higher ALP level was associated with 15% and 16% increased risk of ESRD and mortality respectively. Single center observational study, lack complete data including PTH for all study participants and attrition bias. Higher serum ALP levels in CKD stages 3–4 were independently associated with all-cause mortality and ESRD. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase contributes to the development and progression of vascular calcification.

When the analysis was restricted to those who had ALP levels within the normal range, similar results were noted. In a subgroup analysis that included patients who had serum phosphorus data, we found that while adjusting for serum phosphorus, each 1-standard deviation higher ALP was associated with a 10% increased hazard for mortality, and a non-significant 9% increased risk for ESRD. In a diverse population with CKD stages 3 and 4, we noted a graded increase in the risk for the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and ESRD even after adjusting for relevant confounding variables. Similar results were obtained when the analysis was restricted to those who had ALP levels within the normal ranges highlighting that even high-normal values of ALP might be associated with risk for adverse outcomes.

Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, an isoenzyme of ALP, is a more sensitive and specific marker for bone histology than intact PTH and ALP alone. High serum bALP is associated with fracture risk and mortality in CKD and hemodialysis patients.

### Alkaline phosphatase: discovery and naming of our favorite enzyme [^2acf770d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase can be considered "our favorite enzyme" for reasons apparent to those who diagnose and treat metabolic bone diseases or who study skeletal biology. Few might know, however, that alkaline phosphatase likely represents the most frequently assayed enzyme in all of medicine. Elevated activity in the circulation is universally recognized as a marker for skeletal or hepatobiliary disease. Nevertheless, the assay conditions in many ways are nonphysiological. The term alkaline phosphatase emerged when it became necessary to distinguish "bone phosphatase" from the phosphatase in the prostate that features an acidic pH optimum. Beginning in 1948, studies of the inborn-error-of-metabolism hypophosphatasia would identify the natural substrates and establish the physiological role of alkaline phosphatase, including in biomineralization. Here, we recount the discovery in 1923 and then eventual naming of this enzyme that remains paramount in our field. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Pseudohypoparathyroidism: a rare but important cause of hypocalcaemia [^64e0de22]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We present a 46-year-old Caucasian lady with symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Investigations revealed markedly raised parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with vitamin D deficiency. A number of conditions causing secondary hyperparathyroidism were ruled out from her medical history and initial investigations. The main differential diagnoses were vitamin D deficiency and PTH resistance (pseudohypoparathyroidism, PHP). With high-normal serum phosphate and normal alkaline phosphatase, and a lack of symptoms associated with osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency alone was unlikely to be the cause of hypocalcaemia. Given a normal physical appearance, genetic testing was arranged and confirmed the diagnosis of PHP type Ib. She is currently taking activated vitamin D to maintain calcium homeostasis. PTH resistance is the hallmark of PHP, a rare complex genetic disorder, which can be easily missed resulting in potentially serious consequences.

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^ccaeb282]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical workup and features

The challenges associated with diagnostic testing have been recently reviewed by Brandi et al. ; for the purposes of this global guidance document, we will focus on the most salient points for clinicians to bear in mind. The first necessary step to diagnosis requires measuring serum phosphate in anyone being evaluated for musculoskeletal symptoms (Fig. 2). Serum phosphate should be measured on a morning, fasting blood specimen. Serum phosphate concentration is normally higher in young children and decreases with age ; therefore, it is important to make sure that an age‐specific normal range is used. In adults, hypophosphatemia is defined as levels below 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). To establish chronic hypophosphatemia, there must be two values below the normal range on at least two occasions ≥2 weeks apart.

One study showed that, among 144 patients with TIO, 43.1% of cases with hypophosphatemia were not treated or misdiagnosed, and only 11.8% of patients seeking medical care for the first time were tested for serum phosphate.

Comprehensive laboratory evaluation should include complete blood count, fasting serum phosphate, serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Additional variables, including PTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and FGF23, should also be measured (Table 3, Fig. 2). It should be emphasized that not all assays are standardized, and not all labs use the same reference values, so care must be taken when interpreting results.

Measurement of 25(OH)D levels is necessary for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency, a common cause of hypophosphatemia and rickets/osteomalacia that must be differentiated from TIO. However, vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is frequent in the general population, and a low 25(OH)D level does not rule out the possibility of concurrent TIO. In fact, persistent hypophosphatemia after correction of vitamin D deficiency should prompt consideration that the patient may have TIO. Iron deficiency may indicate a need for potentially different patient management.

### Markers of hepatocellular injury (...) [^973bd20c]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

AST and ALT values are higher in obese patients, probably because these persons commonly have fatty livers. 12 ALT levels have been noted to decline with weight loss. 13 Depending on the physician's point of view, the upper limits of normal for AST and ALT levels could be set higher for more obese persons. Rare individuals have chronically elevated AST levels because of a defect in clearance of the enzyme from the circulation. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Various liver diseases are associated with typical ranges of AST and ALT levels. ALT levels often rise to several thousand units per liter in patients with acute viral hepatitis. The highest ALT levels—often more than 10, 000 U per L—are usually found in patients with acute toxic injury subsequent to, for example, acetaminophen overdose or acute ischemic insult to the liver.

AST and ALT levels usually fall rapidly after an acute insult. It is especially important to remember that in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, the serum AST level is almost never greater than 500 U per L and the serum ALT value is almost never greater than 300 U per L. The reasons for these limits on AST and ALT elevations are not well understood. In typical viral or toxic liver injury, the serum ALT level rises more than the AST value, reflecting the relative amounts of these enzymes in hepatocytes. However, in alcoholic hepatitis, the ratio of AST to ALT is greater than 1 in 90 percent of patients and is usually greater than 2. 17 The higher the AST-to-ALT ratio, the greater the likelihood that alcohol is contributing to the abnormal LFTs. In the absence of alcohol intake, an increased AST-to-ALT ratio is often found in patients with cirrhosis. The elevated AST-to-ALT ratio in alcoholic liver disease results in part from the depletion of vitamin B.

An elevated PT can result from a vitamin K deficiency. This deficiency usually occurs in patients with chronic cholestasis or fat malabsorption from disease of the pancreas or small bowel. A trial of vitamin K injections is the most practical way to exclude vitamin K deficiency in such patients. The PT should improve within a few days.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^b59e34c7]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate and pancreas but not in bone; therefore it can be useful in confirming that an elevated ALP is of liver and not bony origin.GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality.It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

How is PBC diagnosed?

Modes and routes of presentation

Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

Figure 1 
The BSG/UK-PBC consensus care pathway for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). While care needs always to be personalised to the patient, there are consensus pathways that are important for patients with PBC, which encompass the important ‘pillars’ of care that are believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

Blood tests

The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (>95% for both sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart of PBC diagnosis.

Liver biochemistry

PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.

Consensus diagnostic criteria for PSC have been published as a workshop summary on behalf of the American College of Gastroenterology.Consensus guidelines relating to IgG4-SC, the biliary manifestation of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD),and on PSC/AIH variant syndrome, have also been published.A summary is outlined in figure 1.

Figure 1 
Algorithm for the management of suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Modes of presentation

Symptoms are rare in early disease. In more established cases, symptoms such as right upper quadrant pain, pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, fever and weight loss are present in 47–56% of patients.Patients usually present in one of several ways: (i) no symptoms or signs but with an incidental finding of abnormal liver biochemistry, (ii) biochemical screening of patients with newly diagnosed or pre-existing IBD, (iii) jaundice and pruritus secondary to cholestasis, (iv) cholangitis, (v) jaundice secondary to liver failure, (vi) variceal bleeding and/or ascites from portal hypertension or (vii) cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).

Blood tests

Serum liver biochemistry tests are abnormal in approximately 75% of patients with PSC.The most common pattern is of a cholestatic picture with raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. An elevated serum bilirubin is reported to be present in 28–40% and is a marker of poor prognosis,but this is likely to be an overestimate with more advanced cases reported by published series. An elevated ALP is a sensitive marker for diagnosis but is not specific. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are often mildly raised and do not necessarily suggest additional features of autoimmune hepatitis. As with other causes of liver disease, a raised AST>ALT may be an indicator of cirrhosis and poor prognosis.Other indicators of cirrhosis or portal hypertension include an elevated prothrombin time or international normalised ratio, low albumin and low platelets. There are no autoantibodies diagnostic of PSC. Serum perinuclear antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody is positive in 33–88% of those with PSC but is not specific and is not related to disease activity or prognosis.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher).Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races.African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease.While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate.Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis.Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST >10 x ULN are less likely than those with values <10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease ‘flare’ might precipitate ACLF.Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

### A patient with extensive cerebral calcification due to pseudohypoparathyroidism: a case report [^65ed9591]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Differential diagnoses in this patient who presented with symptomatic hypocalcemia were hypoparathyroidism, secondary hyperparathyroidism due to long standing vitamin D deficiency, PTH resistance due to magnesium deficiency and pseudohypoparathyroidism. Elevated serum intact PTH level narrowed down the differentials to the latter three diagnoses. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was considered unlikely in the absence of conditions leading to longstanding vitamin D deficiency such as chronic kidney disease, gastric or intestinal surgery and chronic diarrhoea suggestive of Chron’s disease or celiac disease. Severe hypocalcaemia and high PTH level couldn’t be explained solely by marginally low (insufficient) Vitamin D level. Although severe hypomagnesemia is well known to cause hypocalcaemia through a combination of defective PTH secretion and some degree of PTH resistance mild hypomagnesemia is unlikely to cause isolated PTH resistance leading to such severe hypocalcaemia. Also cerebral calcification can’t be explained by hypomagnesemia alone. The presence of severe hypocalcaemia and elevated PTH with a marginally low vitamin D level and especially the basal, thalamic and dentate ganglia calcification suggests the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism. Although PHP presenting at 59 years of age is uncommon there have been previous reports of adults presenting with symptomatic hypocalcaemia due to PHP.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase is thought to be due to development of osteomalacia secondary to reduced conversion of 25- hydroxyvitamin D to its active form i.e. 1, 25- dihydroxyvitamin D in the absence of PTH action and concurrent vitamin D deficiency.

The radiological findings of basal ganglia calcification seen in this case are well described in PHP. However cortical calcification is a rare finding and this is the first such report from Sri Lanka. Other differential diagnoses for this presentation are familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Fahr’s disease), neoplastic, vascular, infectious, and congenital causes, as well as other endocrine/metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. However hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia and increased PTH seen in this patient favor the diagnosis of PHP.

### Management of syphilitic hepatitis [^ff9d9527]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Syphilis is a sexuality transmitted disease caused by Treponema pallidum. Liver involvement is very rarely seen and occurs in the second phase of the disease. Syphilitic hepatitis generally is mild clinical condition and is characterized by high serum alkaline phosphatase level, often with normal or only slightly abnormal transaminases. The skin eruptions are classically diffuse, symmetric maculopapular rashes involving trunk and extremities. Involvement of palms and soles is a strong clue to the diagnosis of secondary syphilis. Therefore, syphilitic hepatitis should be included in the early differential diagnosis in patient with abnormal liver enzyme, especially increased alkaline phosphatase, and rashes involving palms and soles.

Although XLH seems to be completely penetrant, its severity varies widely, even among family members, with no clear gender difference,. A large number of inactivating mutations in PHEX can cause XLH, and a genotype–phenotype correlation is not obvious.

Patients should be evaluated for the presence and severity of common and rare complications of XLH depending on their age (Table 1). In young children, dynamic tests or specific investigations, such as hearing evaluation or oral examination, are sometimes not feasible and can be delayed until the child reaches 3–5 years of age.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^a9b20052]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### Cholestatic phenotypes of autoimmune hepatitis [^31cf7bfe]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis can have cholestatic features that are outside the codified diagnostic criteria. These features have uncertain effects on the clinical presentation and progression of disease. Patients with autoimmune hepatitis can have antimitochondrial antibodies and coincidental bile duct injury or loss (2%-13% of patients), focal biliary strictures and dilations based on cholangiography (2%-11%), or histologic changes of bile duct injury or loss in the absence of other features (5%-11%). These findings probably represent atypical manifestations of autoimmune hepatitis or variants of primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis, depending on the predominant findings. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transferase, histologic features of bile duct injury, and findings from cholangiography are associated with responsiveness to corticosteroid therapy and individualized alternative treatments. Corticosteroid therapy, in combination with low-dose ursodeoxycholic acid, has been promulgated by international societies, but these recommendations are not based on strong evidence. The frequency, variable outcomes, and uncertainties in diagnosis and management of the cholestatic phenotypes must be addressed by a collaborative investigational network. This network should define the genetic and pathologic features of these disorders, standardize their nomenclature, and establish a treatment algorithm. In this review, the different cholestatic phenotypes of autoimmune hepatitis, mechanisms of pathogenesis, current management strategies and outcomes, and opportunities for improving understanding and therapy are presented.

### Transient benign hyperphophatasemia [^b0f49774]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Sometimes, a temporary increase in alkaline phosphatase level is found in healthy infants and toddlers without evidence of liver or bone disease. The condition is customarily termed transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood. Most textbooks do not refer to the condition. The aim of the study was to promote broader awareness of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia.

Methods

We completed a systematic review of the literature using the principles underlying the UK Economic and Social Research Council guidance on the conduct of narrative synthesis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement.

Results

The 142 reports retained for analysis included 813 cases (male:female ratio 1.1:1.0): 80 in subjects older than 18 years and 733 in subjects 18 years or younger. The alkaline phosphatase ratio, calculated by dividing the measured level by the upper limit of normal, was ≥5.0 in ≈70% and the duration of the elevation was ≤4 months in 80% of the cases. Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia often followed a benign infection, but available data fail to demonstrate a causal link. The prevalence of transient benign hyperphosphatasemia ranged from 1.1% to 3.5% in infants 2 to 24 months of age.

Conclusions

Transient benign hyperphosphatasemia is likely the most common cause of hyperphosphatasemia among healthy infants and toddlers. Sometimes it also occurs in older children and adults, indicating that the traditional term transient benign hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood may not be correct. The elevation in alkaline phosphatase persists for >4 months in ≈20% of the cases. Recognition of this benign condition is crucial to avoid unnecessary investigations.

We present the case of a patient who sought treatment for fever and a maculopapular rash involving the trunk, limbs, palms and soles. The patient also presented with hepatomegaly and elevated levels of liver enzymes (with a higher increase of alkaline phosphatase).

All altered parameters improved with antibiotic treatment for secondary syphilis. Syphilitic hepatitis is an often overlooked presentation of syphilis and should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with elevated levels of liver enzymes and risk factors for syphilis.

The text also notes that the routine use of bone scan in the absence of bone pain or elevated ALP should not be pursued, although with the presence of symptoms and/or elevated marker, radionuclide bone scan can be a useful test.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ad5fe6fe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget’s disease—biochemical evaluation after imaging: We recommend that after radiological diagnosis of Paget’s disease, the initial biochemical evaluation of a patient should be done using serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or with the use of a more specific marker of bone formation when appropriate. In patients with radiological evidence of Paget’s disease, measurement of serum total ALP is the least expensive biochemical test to determine the metabolic activity of the disorder, and although this bone formation marker increases secondary to bone resorption, it correlates well with the extent of skeletal involvement when assessed from radiographs or scintigraphy and with the probability of achieving normal values with a potent bisphosphonate.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary biliary cholangitis: a patient-friendly summary of the 2018 AASLD practice guidance [^b69668d8]. Clinical Liver Disease (2021). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis diagnosis—guidance statements indicate that the diagnosis of PBC can be established when two of the following three criteria are met: biochemical evidence of cholestasis based on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevation; presence of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) or other PBC-specific autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210; or histologic evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts. Someone must have at least two features to be diagnosed with PBC, and liver biopsy to rule out concomitant autoimmune hepatitis or other liver disease should be considered in PBC patients when the alanine aminotransferase activity is more than five times the upper limit of normal.

### I can feel it in my bones – a case of deranged' liver' function? [^e04544da]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old Asian man was referred to a gastroenterology clinic by his general practitioner following an incidental finding of raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on routine blood testing. His ALP was found to be 198 (NR 35-129) with otherwise normal liver function tests. His past medical history consists of essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes and ischaemic heart disease. He was asymptomatic except for an intermittent ache over his left clavicle, which he had put down to angina. His gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) was normal at 33 (NR 11-50) making bone the most likely source of his raised ALP. Imaging, including x-ray, CT and bone scan, showed an area of abnormality in the left clavicle. The appearances were consistent with fibrous dysplasia. We discuss the interpretation and investigation of deranged 'liver' function tests and suggest a rational and cost-effective diagnostic path to follow.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^6ff95011]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI)—DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### How to use... alkaline phosphatase in neonatology [^cab02da0]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is regularly measured in clinical practice. Changes in serum levels are observed in a number of clinical conditions. In neonatology, it has been proposed as a useful marker for both a diagnosis and an indication of the severity of metabolic bone disease (MBD) in infants born preterm. Nutritional practices, aimed at reducing the occurrence or severity of MBD, have led to ALP being proposed as a stand-alone means of monitoring treatment. The current evidence does not support this use: ALP only achieves usefulness in a diagnostic and monitoring capacity when combined with other serum and imaging techniques.

Characteristics of complex lymphatic anomalies and their differential features

There is a need to rule out other osteolytic diseases in the differential diagnosis of GSD. Idiopathic multicentric osteolysis, multicentric osteolysis, hereditary multicentric osteolysis, neurogenic osteolysis, and osteolysis due to neoplastic, infectious, and immunological diseases should be considered before reaching a final diagnosis. A series of laboratory investigations were carried out, but they failed to detect osteolysis secondary to pathology (cyst, tumor, and infection), metabolic and endocrinal disorders, neoplastic disease, trauma, and/or connective tissue disorders. A recent case report showed the elevation of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and serum CTX-1 in a GSD patient; the patient showed rapidly decreasing levels of BAP and CTX-1 after bisphosphonate therapy.Another report showed the elevation of serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase before bisphosphonate therapy.At initial assessment, the elevation of serum IL-6 was found, but the level of IL-6 normalized after 6 months of bisphosphonate treatment. In contrast, the levels of the osteoclastic regulators OPG, free soluble RANKL, and OPG/free RANKL ratio were increased. In GLA and KLA patients, serum angiopoietin 1 and 2 levels were found to be useful for their diagnosis and suitable as biomarkers for drug treatment.In terms of new radiological methods, Papadakis reported thatF sodium fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT), which is used for detecting skeletal metastatic disease, is useful for GSD diagnosis and follow-up.However, the findings obtained by these methods are only speculative, preventing definitive conclusions from being drawn.

KDIGO CKD-MBD monitoring frequency by CKD stage: In patients with CKD stages 3-5D, it is reasonable to base the frequency of monitoring serum calcium, phosphorus, and PTH on the presence and magnitude of abnormalities and rate of progression of CKD (not graded). Reasonable monitoring intervals would be: In CKD stage 3: For serum calcium and phosphorus, every 6-12 months; and for PTH, based on baseline level and CKD progression; in CKD stage 4: For serum calcium and phosphorus, every 3-6 months; and for PTH, every 6-12 months; in CKD stage 5, including 5D: For serum calcium and phosphorus, every 1-3 months; and for PTH, every 3-6 months; and in CKD stages 4-5D: For alkaline phosphatase activity, every 12 months or more frequently in the presence of increased PTH levels. These recommendations are applicable to the United States.

### Special considerations in interpreting liver function tests (...) [^9563da2d]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

AST and ALT values are higher in obese patients, probably because these persons commonly have fatty livers. 12 ALT levels have been noted to decline with weight loss. 13 Depending on the physician's point of view, the upper limits of normal for AST and ALT levels could be set higher for more obese persons. Rare individuals have chronically elevated AST levels because of a defect in clearance of the enzyme from the circulation. It is especially important to remember that in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, the serum AST level is almost never greater than 500 U per L and the serum ALT value is almost never greater than 300 U per L. The reasons for these limits on AST and ALT elevations are not well understood. In typical viral or toxic liver injury, the serum ALT level rises more than the AST value, reflecting the relative amounts of these enzymes in hepatocytes.

However, in alcoholic hepatitis, the ratio of AST to ALT is greater than 1 in 90 percent of patients and is usually greater than 2. Diagnostic confusion can occur when a patient presents within a few hours after acute bile duct obstruction from a gallstone. In this situation, AST and ALT levels often reach 500 U per L or more in the first hours and then decline, whereas AP and GGT levels can take several days to rise. Both AP and GGT levels are elevated in about 90 percent of patients with cholestasis. Serum AP originates mostly from liver and bone, which produce slightly different forms of the enzyme. The serum AP level rises during the third trimester of pregnancy because of a form of the enzyme produced in the placenta. When serum AP originates from bone, clues to bone disease are often present, such as recent fracture, bone pain or Paget's disease of the bone.

Like the GGT value, the AP level can become mildly elevated in patients who are taking phenytoin. An elevated PT can result from a vitamin K deficiency. This deficiency usually occurs in patients with chronic cholestasis or fat malabsorption from disease of the pancreas or small bowel. A trial of vitamin K injections is the most practical way to exclude vitamin K deficiency in such patients. The PT should improve within a few days.

### Association of intestinal alkaline phosphatase with necrotizing enterocolitis among premature infants [^6a2b84d9]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Unlike candidate biomarkers inclusive for all forms of systemic inflammation, can dysfunction in host management of microbiota have a high positive predictive value as a biomarker for necrotizing enterocolitis?

Findings

In this diagnostic study of 136 premature infants, high amounts of intestinal alkaline phosphatase protein in stool and low intestinal alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity were associated with diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. There was no association of intestinal alkaline phosphatase measures with non–gastrointestinal tract infections.

Meaning

Measuring the inability of intestinal alkaline phosphatase to maintain host-microbiota homeostasis can potentially guide decisions for personalized care and treatment when an infant is most susceptible to developing necrotizing enterocolitis.

Biochemical follow-up

Serum level of ALP is a reliable biomarker of rickets activity and osteomalacia in children and adults,–. Given that bone-specific ALP represents ~80–90% of total ALP in the serum of children, total ALP might be used in this population. In adults, bone-specific ALP is preferred given that ~50% of circulating ALP originates from hepatocytes. When rachitic or osteomalacic bones are undertreated, ALP levels are elevated and urinary levels of calcium are usually low. By contrast, when rickets is healed, ALP levels tend to normalize and urinary calcium levels start to increase,. PTH should be measured regularly as secondary hyperparathyroidism is promoted by oral phosphate supplementation,–. Suppressed PTH levels suggest that the dose of active vitamin D is disproportionately high compared with phosphate supplementation. Measurement of serum and urinary levels of calcium is required to evaluate the safety of active vitamin D. Spot urine samples are preferred as they are simple to perform, especially in young children. Alternatively, 24-hour urine collections can be performed in toilet-trained patients. We do not recommend regular measurement of serum levels of FGF23 in treated patients as it does not guide therapy,,,.

In patients treated with burosumab, fasting serum phosphate level is a biomarker of efficacy and should be monitored to titrate the treatment in children and to exclude hyperphosphataemia. In some patients, burosumab might initially normalize TmP/GFR while serum level of phosphate is still below the normal range owing to the high demand for phosphate of the bone. In this setting, an increase in burosumab dose will not necessarily result in improved bone healing. Therefore, we suggest that TmP/GFR should be analysed together with fasting serum phosphate levels as a measure of drug efficacy. Serum levels of 1,25(OH) 2 vitamin D might increase under burosumab therapy; we suggest measuring these levels every 6 months and analysing them together with the urinary calcium excretion as safety parameters,–.

KDIGO CKD-MBD Chapter 3.1—biochemical abnormalities recommends monitoring serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase activity beginning in CKD G3a (1C), and in children it suggests such monitoring beginning in CKD G2 (2D). In CKD G3a–G5D, it is reasonable to base monitoring frequency on the presence and magnitude of abnormalities and CKD progression, with reasonable intervals specified as: CKD G3a–G3b—serum calcium and phosphate every 6–12 months and PTH based on baseline level and CKD progression; CKD G4—serum calcium and phosphate every 3–6 months and PTH every 6–12 months; CKD G5, including G5D—serum calcium and phosphate every 1–3 months and PTH every 3–6 months; and CKD G4–G5D—alkaline phosphatase activity every 12 months or more frequently if PTH is elevated. In CKD patients receiving treatments for CKD-MBD or with biochemical abnormalities, it is reasonable to increase measurement frequency to monitor for trends and treatment efficacy and side effects. In CKD G3a–G5D, the guideline suggests that 25(OH)D (calcidiol) levels might be measured with repeat testing determined by baseline values and therapeutic interventions (2C) and suggests correcting vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency using treatment strategies recommended for the general population (2C). It recommends basing therapeutic decisions on trends rather than a single laboratory value, taking into account all available CKD-MBD assessments (1C), suggests using individual serum calcium and phosphate values together rather than calcium-phosphate product (Ca × P) (2D), and recommends that laboratories report assay method and any changes, sample source, and handling specifications to facilitate appropriate interpretation (1B).

### Elevated alkaline phosphatase in infants with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease reflects bone rather than liver disease [^72dcbfe0]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in infants with intestinal failure (IF) can be due to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) or metabolic bone disease (MBD). The purpose of the study was to determine the utility of serum ALP in the diagnostic criteria for PNALD by measuring tissue-specific levels in infants with IF and PNALD.

Methods

A retrospective review of patient data for 15 infants diagnosed with PNALD between December 2012 and August 2013 was performed. PNALD was defined as the presence of 2 consecutive direct bilirubin (DB) levels >2 mg/dL. Fractionated serum alkaline phosphatase was measured in each patient, while the DB was >2 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were recorded where available.

Results

In 15 infants with PNALD, elevation in total ALP was due to marked elevations in bone-specific ALP. The median liver-specific ALP remained within the normal range. PTH, vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were within normal limits.

Conclusion

While elevated ALP can reflect biliary stasis, the ALP elevation observed in infants with IF and PNALD is predominantly of bone rather than hepatic origin. An elevated unfractionated ALP in infants with PNALD should therefore raise suspicion of underlying bone disease, rather than being attributed to liver disease alone.

### Introduction to the revised American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases position paper on acute liver failure 2011 [^d8b4ee53]. Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute liver failure (ALF) diagnosis and initial evaluation—The diagnosis of ALF hinges on identifying that the patient has an acute insult and is encephalopathic, and imaging in recent years has suggested “cirrhosis,” but this is often an overcall by radiology, because a regenerating massively necrotic liver will give the same nodular profile as cirrhosis. It is vital to promptly get viral hepatitis serologies, including A-E as well as autoimmune serologies. For fulminant Wilson’s disease, diagnosis can be made most effectively by looking for bilirubin level (very high) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP; very low), such that the bilirubin/ALP ratio exceeds 2.0, noting that ceruloplasmin levels can be low in half of all ALF patients. The availability of an assay that measures acetaminophen adducts has improved our clinical recognition of acetaminophen cases when the diagnosis is obscured by patient denial or encephalopathy, and any patient with very high aminotransferases and low bilirubin on admission with ALF very likely has acetaminophen overdose, with the one possible exception being those patients who enter with ischemic injury. Obtaining autoantibodies should be routine and a low threshold for biopsy in patients with indeterminate ALF should be standard, given that autoimmune hepatitis may be the largest category of indeterminate, after unrecognized acetaminophen poisoning.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^3cd48a7b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Biochemical markers

The elevations in bone remodeling that are characteristic of active PBD can be detected clinically by measurement of biochemical markers of bone turnover in blood and urine samples. It should be noted, however, that elevations in markers of bone turnover occur in many disease states and cannot be used in isolation for the diagnosis of PDB.

The most widely used biochemical marker for the diagnosis of PDB is serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which is usually performed as part of liver function tests in a routine biochemistry screen. A population‐based study by Eekhof (68) specifically looked at the performance of ALP in detecting PDB in participants of the Rotterdam study in Holland. The researchers selected 105 individuals from a cohort of 4406 subjects who had an elevated total ALP with normal transaminases and matched these subjects with 625 controls who had a normal total ALP. They found that the relative risk for PDB (based on radiographs of the hands, spine, pelvis, and knees) in the presence of a raised total ALP was 10.9 (95% CI 4.8–24.9) in men and women older than 55 years of age. 68 This is the only study that has addressed the accuracy of any biochemical marker for the diagnosis of PDB. It showed that the sensitivity of total ALP was 57.7% (95% CI 38.9–74.5); specificity 88.9% (95% CI 85.9–91.3); positive likelihood ratio 5.19 (95% CI 3.45–7.82); and negative likelihood ratio 0.48 (95% CI 0.30–0.75). It should be noted that the calculated sensitivity may be an underestimate because radiographic assessment of PDB in the study didn't include the skull and some patients with PDB of this site could have been missed. It's also important to emphasize that of 26 patients with radiological features of PDB, only 11 (42%) had elevated total ALP concentrations.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^74b4a2f6]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age >3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of >19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is >16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^3c389396]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

The evidence suggests that liver laboratory abnormalities will be found in 12% of patients with sarcoidosis who undergo routine liver function testing, most of whom have hepatic granulomas. We did not identify a specific pattern of liver function abnormalities indicative of hepatic sarcoidosis, but some studies suggest that liver granulomas are more often associated with increases of alkaline phosphatase and less frequently with rises in transaminases.

The committee discussed reports that immune suppression and ursodeoxycholic acid reduce transaminitis and cholestasis in patients with related symptoms (pruritus), suggesting that treatment is effective in reducing disease activity in patients with symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis. However, according to both the committee’s clinical experience and the systematic review, it is uncertain whether these effects can be extrapolated to asymptomatic patients with hepatic sarcoidosis. The systematic review found no difference in resolution or improvement of abnormal liver function tests with treatment; however, it was not designed to estimate the effects of treatment of hepatic sarcoidosis, and, therefore, better evidence about treatment may exist. Treatment decisions should not be undertaken carelessly, because death due to cirrhosis or liver failure is uncommon, yet the risks of chronic treatment, especially immune suppression, are significant. The committee also noted that prednisone treatment may confound the assessment, as it can cause transaminitis. The committee agreed that the evidence is too scarce to conclude whether treatment affects progression to cirrhosis or reduces the need for liver transplantation.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that more than 1 out of every 10 patients with sarcoidosis who undergo liver function testing will be identified as having liver involvement, but the implication on treatment is unclear. The committee concluded that there is value in identifying patients with liver involvement at the time of initial diagnosis, and to screen for liver involvement annually even if the initial screen is negative (Table 5), if for no other reason than to avoid hepatotoxic treatments, and to follow such patients more carefully for the development of symptoms that warrant treatment.

Recommendations

1 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we suggest baseline serum alkaline phosphatase testing to screen for hepatic sarcoidosis (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
2 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we make no recommendation for or against baseline serum transaminase testing.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease presenting with an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase [^1a5a2edb]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goals

To define a subset of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with isolated elevations in alkaline phophatase.

Background

NAFLD is a common referral to Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists. We have noted a subset of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD who present with an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase instead of the more typical aminotransferase elevations.

Study

A review of the liver biopsy database at Brooke Army Medical Center was performed with the key identifiers of "steatosis" and "steatohepatitis." Patients were separated into 2 groups depending on whether they presented with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (group 1), or more typical aminotransferase elevations (group 2). Multiple variables were analyzed to determine any significant differences between these groups.

Results

A total of 297 liver biopsies were evaluated. Of these, 135 biopsies were included in the study. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients and group 2 had 121 patients. Patients in group 1 were more likely to be older females (P<0.05). Within group 1, those with steatohepatitis were older than those with steatosis (P<0.05). When analyzed with regard to histopathology, patients with steatosis in group 1 were more likely female than group 2 patients (P=0.03). Those with steatohepatitis in group 1 were older than group 2 patients (P=0.001). Five of the 7 patients with steatohepatitis in group 1 had advanced liver disease at the time of biopsy.

Conclusions

Older female patients with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and risk factors for NAFLD should be evaluated for evidence of significant steatohepatitis.

Concluding remarks

In this review, we have summarized the recent reports of COVID-19-related liver injury, data that are obviously changing rapidly day by day. Although the pathophysiology behind liver injury in COVID-19 remains unresolved, several theories have been proposed, but a multifactorial mechanism seems most likely. Undoubtedly, the available clinical data so far show that the incidence of liver impairment in COVID-19 ranged from 6-61%, mainly indicated by abnormal ALT/AST levels (Table 1). However, most of the cases experienced a mild AST/ALT elevation (usually <3× ULN), accompanied by slightly elevated bilirubin levels. Since ACE2 receptors are expressed especially in the bile ducts, one may suppose that patients should have some degree of cholestasis or jaundice. However, this seems not to be the case in everyday practice and, remarkably, even ICU patients did not present with elevated ALP/GGT.
