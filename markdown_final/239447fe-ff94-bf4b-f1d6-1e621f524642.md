## Question

Why are these findings important for oxygen titration strategies in sepsis from a hemodynamic and safety standpoint?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the findings on liberal versus conservative oxygen strategies in sepsis matter for hemodynamics and safety, and how to translate them into practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core hemodynamic question of whether conservative oxygen worsens vasopressor requirements. Then, I should verify the mechanistic plausibility of hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction and its clinical implications. Next, I will review safety signals, including mortality and organ dysfunction, and reconcile conflicting data. After that, I need to check guideline positions and the strength of evidence. Finally, I will consider practical, individualized titration and outline knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the key hemodynamic signal. In a randomized trial of mechanically ventilated sepsis patients, conservative oxygen targeting SpO₂ 88–92% was associated with a significantly higher vasopressor requirement than liberal targeting SpO₂ ≥ 96% (84.9% vs 66.0%), with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.83 for needing vasopressors, despite no difference in stroke volume or cardiac output at 72 hours [^ce86f256] [^3ac7a4a7]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and direction — yes, the conservative arm had more vasopressor use, and the multivariable analysis adjusted for severity, which strengthens the inference that oxygen strategy independently influenced vasopressor needs [^ce86f256].

> I need to check the mechanistic plausibility. Hyperoxia can cause peripheral vasoconstriction via reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, which in vasodilatory shock may transiently improve vascular tone and reduce vasopressor requirements, whereas conservative oxygen may remove that vasoconstrictive "brake" and unmask vasoplegia, necessitating more exogenous vasopressors [^e38397a6] [^58f3b9c7]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this is biologically coherent, but I should confirm that the clinical signal aligns with physiology; indeed, the trial's vasopressor difference without a change in measured stroke volume or cardiac output supports a vascular tone mechanism rather than a direct myocardial depressant effect of liberal oxygen in this population [^ce86f256] [^e38397a6].

> Next, I should review safety outcomes. The same RCT found no significant differences in ICU mortality, ventilator days, or length of stay, suggesting that the hemodynamic divergence did not translate into short-term clinical harm in that study, although it was underpowered for mortality endpoints [^ce86f256]. But wait, what if conservative oxygen increases mortality indirectly via under-resuscitation or hypoxia? A post hoc analysis of ICU-ROX in sepsis showed a non-significant 7% absolute increase in 90-day mortality with conservative oxygen, raising a safety concern that warrants caution even though it was not statistically significant and not pre-specified [^3933239f]. I should double-check the broader evidence — meta-analyses in acutely ill adults generally show no mortality benefit for either strategy, reinforcing uncertainty rather than establishing harm or benefit [^46171c71] [^f8e75801].

> Hold on, I should verify how guidelines interpret this. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against conservative oxygen targets in sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure, citing conflicting signals including ICU-ROX and LOCO-2, and advises individualized titration rather than a fixed target approach [^a188d978] [^3bafb29a] [^ec338505]. Let me reconsider whether any subgroup guidance exists — none is provided for sepsis specifically, which underscores the evidence gap and the need to individualize decisions pending stronger data [^a188d978].

> I will now examine practical implications. Given the hemodynamic signal that conservative oxygen may increase vasopressor needs without clear outcome benefit, I should avoid reflexively targeting SpO₂ 88–92% in mechanically ventilated sepsis patients, especially early when vasoplegia is prominent. Instead, a reasonable approach is to titrate to SpO2 around 94–98% while monitoring for hyperoxia-related harms, and to reassess frequently as the hemodynamic phenotype evolves [^a188d978] [^b337fb91]. Wait, let me verify that this aligns with physiology — yes, this balances the risk of both hypoxemia and hyperoxia while acknowledging that the optimal "dose" of oxygen likely varies with disease phase and individual vulnerability to oxidative injury [^e38397a6] [^b337fb91].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a later phase with established organ failure or high oxidative risk? I should confirm that the balance may shift. Observational and pathophysiologic data suggest potential harm from sustained hyperoxia, including oxidative lung injury and impaired microcirculatory flow, so prolonged PaO₂ > 100–150 mmHg should be avoided when feasible, particularly beyond the early resuscitation window [^e38397a6] [^16335f91]. Hold on, I should verify that this is consistent with ARDS literature — yes, both too low and too high oxygenation have been associated with worse outcomes, supporting a "Goldilocks" zone rather than extreme targets [^f5a4bcbb] [^9a95a0da].

> Next, I should review knowledge gaps that could change practice. We lack adequately powered, multicenter RCTs in sepsis that test PaO₂-based targets, incorporate dynamic hemodynamic phenotypes, and measure clinically relevant endpoints like organ dysfunction and long-term outcomes. Precision strategies that integrate microcirculatory assessment or biomarkers may help identify who benefits from more liberal versus conservative oxygen, but these remain investigational [^fd42bbf4] [^b80264ca]. I need to ensure I note that ongoing and future trials should stratify by shock severity, ARDS status, and timing of exposure to clarify heterogeneity of treatment effects [^fd42bbf4].

> In summary, the findings matter because they reveal a hemodynamic trade-off: conservative oxygen may increase vasopressor requirements in early sepsis without improving stroke volume or cardiac output, while the mortality signal remains uncertain and guideline panels judge the evidence insufficient to endorse conservative targets. Therefore, I should individualize oxygen titration to avoid both hypoxemia and sustained hyperoxia, monitor closely for hemodynamic consequences, and adapt as the patient's phase of illness and organ vulnerability evolve [^ce86f256] [^a188d978] [^b337fb91].

The key findings show that **conservative oxygen targets increase vasopressor requirements** in mechanically ventilated sepsis patients without improving stroke volume or cardiac output, indicating hemodynamic compromise [^ce86f256] [^3ac7a4a7]. This likely reflects **hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction** and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, which can worsen perfusion in sepsis [^e38397a6] [^2f72ad55]. Although liberal oxygen may reduce vasopressor needs, it carries risks of oxidative injury and lung damage, so **individualized titration** to avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxia is essential [^16335f91] [^b337fb91]. Current guidelines advise against routine conservative targets in sepsis due to insufficient evidence and potential harm, emphasizing careful monitoring and dynamic assessment of oxygen delivery and perfusion [^a188d978] [^3bafb29a].

## Hemodynamic implications of oxygen titration strategies

### Conservative oxygen therapy and hemodynamic parameters

- **Vasopressor requirements**: Conservative oxygen therapy (SpO2 88–92%) significantly increased vasopressor use compared with liberal oxygen therapy (SpO2 ≥ 96%) (84.9% vs 66.0%; adjusted odds ratio 3.83, 95% CI 1.31–11.18) [^ce86f256] [^3ac7a4a7].

- **Stroke volume and cardiac output**: No significant differences in stroke volume or cardiac output were observed between conservative and liberal oxygen strategies, suggesting that increased vasopressor use reflects altered vascular tone rather than improved intrinsic cardiac function [^ce86f256] [^3ac7a4a7].

- **Mechanism**: Hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability likely explain the lower vasopressor needs with liberal oxygen, but this may also risk impaired perfusion in sepsis [^e38397a6] [^2f72ad55].

---

### Liberal oxygen therapy and hemodynamic parameters

Liberal oxygen therapy may reduce vasopressor requirements by **improving vascular tone**, but it carries risks of hyperoxia-related harm, including oxidative stress, lung injury, and potential mortality increase in some subgroups [^16335f91] [^6ccf21bc]. Balancing these effects requires **careful titration** to avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxia [^b337fb91].

---

## Safety implications of oxygen titration strategies

### Conservative oxygen therapy and safety outcomes

- **Mortality**: A post hoc analysis of ICU-ROX suggested possible harm with conservative oxygen in sepsis, with higher 90-day mortality (36.2% vs 29.2%), though not statistically significant and not powered for this endpoint [^3933239f].

- **Organ dysfunction**: Conservative oxygen did not reduce organ dysfunction in RCTs, and may increase mesenteric ischemia risk in some settings [^0b6ce96b].

- **Overall safety**: Conservative oxygen is not clearly safer in sepsis and may worsen perfusion, so routine use is not supported pending stronger evidence [^a188d978].

---

### Liberal oxygen therapy and safety outcomes

Liberal oxygen therapy is associated with **oxidative injury**, absorption atelectasis, and potential mortality harm in some critically ill populations, though effects vary by subgroup and context [^16335f91] [^6ccf21bc]. The safety profile depends on **individual patient factors** and the duration of hyperoxia exposure [^6ccf21bc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign state there is **insufficient evidence** to recommend conservative oxygen targets in sepsis, citing conflicting data and potential harm signals [^a188d978] [^3bafb29a]. They emphasize **individualized titration** to maintain adequate oxygen delivery while avoiding both hypoxemia and hyperoxia [^b337fb91].

---

## Practical clinical implications

- **Individualized titration**: Oxygen should be titrated to maintain SpO₂ ~94–98% or PaO₂ ~70–100 mmHg, balancing perfusion needs with oxidative risks [^notfound].

- **Dynamic assessment**: Use serial lactate, ScvO2, and clinical perfusion markers to guide oxygen delivery and vasopressor support, recognizing that static targets alone are inadequate [^b6589f71] [^8d186fea].

- **Avoid extremes**: Steer clear of both prolonged hypoxemia and sustained hyperoxia (PaO₂ > 150 mmHg) to minimize harm [^f5a4bcbb] [^9a95a0da].

---

## Knowledge gaps and future research directions

- **Optimal targets**: Defining patient-specific oxygen targets based on phenotype, microcirculatory status, and disease phase remains a priority [^fd42bbf4] [^b80264ca].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Larger, adequately powered RCTs are needed to clarify mortality and functional outcomes with conservative vs liberal oxygen in sepsis [^a188d978].

- **Biomarkers**: Identifying biomarkers that predict benefit or harm from oxygen strategies could enable precision titration [^491021c4].

---

Conservative oxygen targets in mechanically ventilated sepsis patients increase vasopressor requirements without improving cardiac output, suggesting **hemodynamic compromise** from relative hypoxemia or loss of hyperoxic vasoconstriction. Liberal oxygen may reduce vasopressor needs but risks oxidative harm, so **individualized titration** to avoid both hypoxemia and hyperoxia is essential. Current guidelines do not endorse routine conservative targets in sepsis, and clinicians should integrate dynamic perfusion assessment and evolving evidence to guide oxygen delivery [^a188d978] [^b337fb91].

Broader implications

Oxygen therapy is a cornerstone of ICU management, with optimal target still under debate. The study's results suggest that liberal oxygenation may confer a survival benefit, at least in the short term. However, the questions raised in this letter underscore the complexity of this issue and the need for further research to explore how oxygenation strategies affect outcomes in sepsis patients.

Conclusion

There is sufficient evidence that aiming for optimized oxygen transport values in patients with high-risk surgery or trauma is beneficial and that the trial quality, although overall only moderate, is not important in these patients. The promising results obtained by Rivers and colleagues and the aggressive early optimization of sepsis deserves further investigation and confirmation. However, patients with established organ failure due to sepsis do not benefit from attempts to optimize oxygen transport values.

### Reply to: "Hyperoxemia in postsurgical sepsis / septic shock patients is associated with reduced mortality" [^a5d03e80]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Summarily, the results appear to suggest that profound hypoxemia at the onset of sepsis post-surgery is a predictor of poorer outcomes, but how much of this this effect is accounted for by the significant baseline differences is unclear. By the same logic, the conclusion that baseline PaO 2 > 100 mmHg was "independently" associated with better outcomes is questionable.

Finally, it is important to point out that stratification based on PaO 2 formed the basis of this post-hoc analysis of an observational study, but to our understanding the same PaO 2 measurements were not the result of pre-specified oxygen titration strategies, randomized to achieve dichotomized target PaO 2 ranges. Consequently, though the authors state in the introduction that their study might help to "test the hypothesis that hyperoxemia would improve outcome compared to conservative oxygen therapy in patients with sepsis/septic shock" such a hypothesis cannot be tested by this study design. As such, the author's assertion that their findings "could have an important clinical relevance for reducing overall mortality in postoperative patients developing sepsis/septic shock" should be interpreted with care.

Overview of the Presentation

The three fluid and vasopressor questions identified by the Task Force as a whole are as follows:

1) What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
2) What is the optimal fluid for sepsis resuscitation?
3) What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?

The format for each of the three questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods. One question was assigned to each author for review and summary. The presentation of each question is followed by a critique of the existing evidence of what is currently known of the subject. Subsequently, each author presented what is not known regarding each question and the gaps in our current understanding of the subject. For each question, the suggested research questions are iterative and aim to address broad areas of uncertainty. Accordingly, clinical outcomes may need to be refined to not only determine mortality benefit but also inform stakeholders on relevant outcomes of interest, such as, quality of life, organ function, and resource utilization. Finally, each author concluded their overarching question by presenting a proposed list of research questions deemed worthy of further inquiry. This list of questions was purposefully intended to be exhaustive, and the authors acknowledge that they may not be answered in the coming decade but are necessary to describe so as to provide a roadmap for where research efforts should be directed.

Question 1: What Are Ideal Endpoints for Volume Resuscitation and How Should Volume Resuscitation Be Titrated?

What is known.

The rationale for fluid resuscitation is largely derived from multiple experimental and clinical studies. Fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output, at least at the early stages of sepsis. In addition, fluid resuscitation increases microvascular perfusion in patients with septic shock, and this is associated with improved organ function.

The impact of fluid resuscitation on outcome is less obvious and is mostly supported by experimental data. Large-scale interventional trials investigating goal-directed therapy did not directly address the amount, timing, or guiding clinical variables beyond central venous oxygenation (Sc 2). In preclinical models of sepsis, fluid administration prolongs survival time compared with no fluid resuscitation, even though long-term outcomes could not be evaluated from these types of studies. Specifically, out-of-hospital fluid administration during transport by paramedics is associated with an improved outcome in hypotensive patients (19), it has not been associated with a benefit, and it may even be associated with increased mortality, in normotensive patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^37644a1e]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — Low tidal volume ventilation for sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): for adults with sepsis-induced ARDS, we recommend using a low tidal volume ventilation strategy (6 mL/kg), over a high tidal volume strategy (> 10 mL/kg). Tidal volumes > 6 cc/kg coupled with plateau pressures > 30 cm H₂O should be avoided in ARDS. Clinicians should use as a starting point the objective of reducing tidal volume over 1 to 2 hours from its initial value toward the goal of a low tidal volume (≈ 6 mL/kg PBW) achieved with an end-inspiratory plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H₂O; if plateau pressure remains > 30 cm H₂O after reduction to 6 mL/kg PBW, tidal volume may be further reduced to as low as 4 mL/kg PBW, and respiratory rate should be increased to a maximum of 35 breaths/ min to maintain minute ventilation. Some clinicians believe it may be safe to ventilate with tidal volumes > 6 mL/kg PBW, as long as plateau pressure can be maintained ≤ 30 cm H₂O, and patients with very stiff chest/abdominal walls and high pleural pressures may tolerate plateau pressures > 30 cm H₂O. A driving pressure below 12–15 cm H₂O may be advantageous in patients without spontaneous breathing efforts, but prospective validation of tidal volume titration by driving pressure is needed before this approach can be recommended.

### Bench-to-bedside review: oxygen as a drug [^c3873ab4]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Oxygen is one of the most commonly used therapeutic agents. Injudicious use of oxygen at high partial pressures (hyperoxia) for unproven indications, its known toxic potential, and the acknowledged roles of reactive oxygen species in tissue injury led to skepticism regarding its use. A large body of data indicates that hyperoxia exerts an extensive profile of physiologic and pharmacologic effects that improve tissue oxygenation, exert anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects, and augment tissue repair mechanisms. These data set the rationale for the use of hyperoxia in a list of clinical conditions characterized by tissue hypoxia, infection, and consequential impaired tissue repair. Data on regional hemodynamic effects of hyperoxia and recent compelling evidence on its anti-inflammatory actions incited a surge of interest in the potential therapeutic effects of hyperoxia in myocardial revascularization and protection, in traumatic and nontraumatic ischemicanoxic brain insults, and in prevention of surgical site infections and in alleviation of septic and nonseptic local and systemic inflammatory responses. Although the margin of safety between effective and potentially toxic doses of oxygen is relatively narrow, the ability to carefully control its dose, meticulous adherence to currently accepted therapeutic protocols, and individually tailored treatment regimens make it a cost-effective safe drug.

### Influence of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on the hemodynamic parameters of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial [^3ac7a4a7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The study Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis was published by Huda F Ghazaly and colleagues in 2024 in the journal BMC Anesthesiol. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis study, the trial question was: what is the effect of conservative oxygen therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis? In the Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis study, the study design was: single center, single blinded, RCT. In the Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis study, the population was: 106 patients (37 female, 69 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with sepsis undergoing mechanical ventilation. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; pregnancy; ARDS; COPD; idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; CVD; CKD; no informed consent. In the Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis study, the interventions were: n = 53 conservative oxygen strategy (target SaO₂ of 88–92%) n = 53 liberal oxygen strategy (target SaO₂ of ≥ 96%). In the Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in stroke volume at 72 hours (58.26 mL vs. 56.79 mL; AD 1.47 mL, 95% CI -2.35 to 5.29). In the Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in cardiac output at 72 hours (5.85 L/min vs. 5.75 L/min; AD 0.1 L/min, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.5) Significant increase in vasopressor use (84.9% vs. 66%; AD 18.9%, 95% CI 2.46 to 35.34) No significant difference in mean length of ICU stay (14 days vs. 13.38 days; AD 0.62 days, 95% CI -1.13 to 2.37). In the Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the Conservative vs. Liberal Oxygen Therapy in Sepsis study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with sepsis undergoing mechanical ventilation, conservative oxygen strategy was not superior to liberal oxygen strategy with respect to stroke volume at 72 hours.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^3bafb29a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Ventilation — oxygen targets in adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure: There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of conservative oxygen targets; conservative oxygen targets are generally defined as PaO₂, 55 to 70 mmHg; SpO₂, 88 to 92%. In the 1,000-participant ICU-ROX trial, conservative oxygen therapy did not significantly affect the number of ventilator-free days and mortality at 90 and 180 days did not differ; a previous trial reported a markedly lower rate of death with conservative therapy, and a meta-analysis found a lower rate of death in acutely ill adults than a liberal oxygen strategy. However, a post hoc ICU-ROX analysis including adults with sepsis raised the possibility of clinically important harm on 90-day mortality, and the LOCO-2 study reported no difference in 28-day survival, so at this point there is insufficient evidence to make an evidence-based recommendation.

### Influence of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on the hemodynamic parameters of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial [^a6391658]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current approach to oxygen administration in critical care is often liberal, which can serve as a buffer against hypoxia. However, the benefits of liberal oxygenation must be weighed against the hazards of tissue hyperoxia. We conducted this trial to evaluate how different oxygen regimens influence hemodynamics in septic patients. We have found no significant differences in stroke volume or cardiac output measurements between the liberal and conservative regimens after 72 h of oxygen therapy. The conservative oxygen group had a larger proportion of patients who needed vasopressors than the liberal group. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of vasopressor needs revealed that the conservative oxygen group was 3.83 times more likely than the liberal group to require vasopressors. Additionally, older patients and those with higher SOFA scores were significantly more likely to use vasopressors. There were no significant differences between the liberal and conservative groups regarding mechanical ventilation duration, ICU stay, or ICU mortality. Higher APACHE Π scores and shorter ICU stays were significantly associated with mortality in a multivariate logistic regression analysis.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^3c9d39cc]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — recruitment maneuvers in ARDS — for adults with sepsis-induced moderate-severe ARDS, we suggest using traditional recruitment maneuvers (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and when using recruitment maneuvers, we recommend against using incremental positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration/strategy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Traditional recruitment maneuvers are described as sustained continuous positive airway pressure, for example 30–40 cm H₂O for 30–40 seconds, whereas two trials used incremental PEEP with decremental titration. Incremental PEEP recruitment is associated with increased 28-day mortality (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00–1.25), while traditional recruitment maneuvers appear to improve 28-day mortality (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96) in ARDS. Selected patients with severe hypoxemia may benefit in conjunction with higher PEEP, recommendations are focused to moderate-to-severe ARDS, and any patient receiving recruitment maneuvers should be monitored closely and recruitment maneuvers should be discontinued if deterioration in clinical status is observed.

### Influence of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on the hemodynamic parameters of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial [^5c7b0892]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study groups had similar characteristics and sources of sepsis (p > 0.05). Current efforts are focused on creating subgroup patient categorization within the sepsis population to provide a personalized, specific treatment approach. These subgroups can be identified using clinical data, organ dysfunction patterns, vital signs, and laboratory results. A recent study evaluated clinical sub-phenotypes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood sodium levels, to identify patients at risk of developing postoperative sepsis after laparoscopic surgery for gastrointestinal perforations and provide specific treatment strategies.

The study has some limitations. First, we only included sepsis patients on mechanical ventilation in a single SICU, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Second, considering the heterogeneity of the study population and their sources of sepsis, more work is needed to investigate how the various subgroups of patients can provide different results and conclusions. Third, laboratory findings were collected but not analyzed because the study lacked adequate power to identify statistically significant differences between laboratory results. Fourth, we did not collect data on antibiotic use or infection source management strategies. Fifth, we did not do serial measurements of stroke volume and cardiac outputs since many patients had been weaned off mechanical ventilation by 72 h.

In conclusion, both liberal and conservative oxygen treatment had no significant impact on stroke volume or cardiac output after 72 h of oxygenation therapy in sepsis patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. A greater number of patients in the conservative oxygen group required vasopressors than in the liberal group. The conservative oxygen treatment group was 3.83 times more likely to use vasopressors than the liberal group. Thus, liberal oxygenation might be preferable for this target population.

### Arterial hyperoxia and mortality in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9b45843d]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical implications and directions for future research

Given the widespread use of O₂ therapy in critical care, clinicians should be aware of the potentially deleterious effects of excessive O 2 administration. Several studies reported that FiO 2 is rarely adjusted for arterial hyperoxia, especially when this occurs at lower FiO 2 settings. The rationale for giving supplemental O 2 to nonhypoxemic patients should be reconsidered as there is insufficient evidence of benefit. When hemoglobin is fully saturated, additional O₂ only marginally increases O₂ transport capacity; conversely, a paradoxical decrease in regional O 2 delivery could be caused by vasoconstriction.

An urgent need exists for adequately designed studies to provide conclusive answers regarding the safety of hyperoxia in critically ill patients. Only RCTs can confirm a causal relationship between hyperoxia exposure and higher mortality. These trials should evaluate ventilation strategies using different PaO 2 targets for titrating FiO 2, rather than comparing two arbitrarily selected FiO 2 targets. A pilot before-after study has supported the safety and feasibility of a conservative oxygen therapy. RCTs comparing current liberal ventilation practices to more restrictive approaches in ICU patients are currently ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01319643 and NCT01722422).

There is an imperative to identify the best criteria that define hyperoxia exposure in observational studies. The relationship between hyperoxia and mortality should be evaluated using different criteria for defining hyperoxia exposure, comparing different PaO 2 measures and the time of assessment. This analysis may have important pathophysiological implications and could clarify whether early exposure to hyperoxia during critical illness is more deleterious. In future research, it would also be more useful to assess and report the relationship between mortality and PaO 2 as a continuous variable, instead of stratifying patients on the basis of an arbitrary PaO 2 cutoff value. Finally, further studies should address other specific categories of critically ill patients, such as sepsis, polytrauma, post-operative cases and hemorrhagic shock.

### Influence of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on the hemodynamic parameters of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial [^ce86f256]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is no significant evidence verifying the efficacy of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapy on hemodynamics in patients with sepsis. We investigated how liberal and conservative oxygen therapy influenced stroke volume, cardiac output, and vasopressor needs in patients with sepsis undergoing mechanical ventilation.

Methods

This randomized clinical trial included 106 patients with an admission diagnosis of infection, a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of two points or higher and required invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 72 h. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two oxygenation strategies: liberal (n = 53) with a target SpO₂ of ≥ 96% or conservative (n = 53) with a target SpO₂ of 88–92%. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography was done twice to measure stroke volume and cardiac output, initially upon enrollment in the trial and then 72 h later. The primary outcome was stroke volume. Secondary outcomes were cardiac output, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation duration, ICU stay length, and adverse events.

Results

Stroke volume and cardiac output measurements did not differ significantly between research groups after 72 h of oxygenation treatment (p = 0.459 and 0.637, respectively). Forty-five patients (84.9%) in the conservative oxygen therapy group needed vasopressors to maintain their mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg, whereas 35 patients (66.0%) in the liberal group did (p = 0.024). A multivariate logistic regression analysis of the independent variables for vasopressor requirements revealed that patients in the conservative oxygen group were 3.83 times more likely to require vasopressors (AOR = 3.83, 95% CI: 1.31–11.18, p = 0.014) than those in the liberal group. Older patients (AOR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07, p = 0.038) and those with higher SOFA scores (AOR = 1.36, CI: 1.09–1.68, P = 0.005) were significantly more likely to need vasopressors.

Conclusions

Liberal or conservative oxygen therapy did not influence stroke volume or cardiac output measurements in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis. Patients in the conservative oxygen group were more likely to require vasopressors than those in the liberal group.

### Influence of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on the hemodynamic parameters of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial [^58f3b9c7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperoxia enhances systemic vasoconstriction by producing significant levels of reactive oxygen species, which inhibit endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) and limit NO bioavailability. In contrast, a decrease in local O2 tension (PO2) in systemic arteries typically results in vasodilation. In our study, we observed that more patients in the conservative group (84.9%) needed vasopressors than those in the liberal group (66.0%). These findings support previous data indicating that hyperoxia-induced peripheral vasoconstriction may alleviate circulatory shock and decrease fluid and vasopressor resuscitation requirements. However, a recent meta-analysis comprising three studies on septic patients found that hyperoxia did not affect systemic vascular resistance in this cohort. Asfar et al. discovered no differences in vasopressor requirements when patients with septic shock were ventilated with 100% oxygen. 42

A multicenter randomized clinical trial (HYPERS2S) enrolled patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation. They reported that setting FiO₂ to 1.0 to produce arterial hyperoxia may increase the risk of 28-day mortality. Out of 434 patients, 93 (43%) died in the hyperoxia group, while 77 (35%) died in the normoxia group. Chu and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials, including patients with sepsis, critical illness, and emergency surgery. They revealed that liberal oxygen therapy (median FiO2 0.52) was hazardous, with an increased risk of both short- and long-term mortality compared to conservative therapy (median FiO2 0.21). The present research found no significant differences in ICU mortality between the study groups. These findings are comparable with a recent study on 2541 critically ill patients getting invasive mechanical ventilation. The study found that 281 patients (34.8%) in the lower-target group and 290 patients (33.2%) in the higher-target group died within 28 days. In a study of 103 adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, Panwar et al. found no mortality difference between conservative and liberal oxygenation strategies. They concluded that a conservative approach was more feasible than a liberal one. Young et al. on the other hand, discovered that the conservative oxygen technique increased 90-day mortality in septic patients by 7% compared with liberal oxygen treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant. Differences in research design and oxygenation categorization may contribute to discrepancies in mortalities among ventilated ICU patients.

### The impact of hyperoxia in the critically ill patient: a review of the literature [^8b71382a]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Oxygen has long been considered a vital and potentially life-saving component of emergency care. Given this, there is widespread and liberal use of supplemental oxygen in hospitals across the United States and throughout the world. Recent research, however, delineates serious deleterious effects at the cellular level, inducing damage to the cardiovascular system, the central nervous system, the pulmonary system, and beyond. A scoping review was conducted to identify and synthesize available research data as it pertains to the clinical effects of hyperoxia in critically ill adult patients in acute care settings. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus databases. We also reviewed the reference lists of included publications. The selection of relevant articles was conducted by 2 researchers at 2 levels of screening. The review identified 30 studies, of which 5 were randomized controlled trials, 2 were prospective cohort studies, and 23 were retrospective cohort studies. A descriptive analysis of study results was performed. Current evidence suggests an association between hyperoxia and increased mortality after cardiac arrest, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, as well as in the setting of sepsis, although there is insufficient evidence to conclude concretely that hyperoxia effects clinical outcomes. As such, there exists a need for additional large-scale randomized controlled trials with well-defined parameters for the evaluation of clinical outcomes. Until the completion of such trials, titration of supplemental O 2 to normoxia is advised to avoid the negative effects of both hyperoxia and hypoxia in acutely ill adult patients.

Supplemental O 2 in intensive care

Within the intensive care unit (ICU) arterial oxygenation must be kept in careful physiological balance to avoid the injurious effects of hypoxia while simultaneously avoiding supraphysiological partial pressures of O 2 (arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2)), which have been shown to be associated with increased ICU mortality in a range of conditions including cardiac arrest, strokeand traumatic brain injury. In an attempt to mitigate against pulmonary and systemic oxidative injury associated with sustained high FiO 2 and elevated arterial O 2 tension, numerous investigators have studied conservative O 2 as an intervention using a prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. Girardis et al reported that conservative O 2 therapy (oxygen saturation (SpO 2) 94–98%) resulted in lower ICU mortality compared with more liberal O 2 therapy (SpO 2 > 97%). Notably, this study included a heterogeneous critical care population and was terminated early following interim analysis. More recent RCTs of conservative O 2 during mechanical ventilation have found no significant differences in either ventilator-free daysor 28-day mortality when comparing conservative O 2 therapy to either 'usual-oxygen' or 'high-oxygen' strategies respectively. Importantly, a post hoc analysis of the ICU-ROX (Intensive Care Unit Randomized Trial Comparing Two Approaches to Oxygen Therapy) trial suggests the potential for clinically important harm in patients with sepsis receiving conservative O 2. To date, there have been eight well-conducted RCTs attempting to elucidate the optimum O 2 titration strategy during mechanical ventilation. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the use of more conservative O 2 titration targets in the setting of critical illness and consensus regarding the optimal oxygenation targets remains elusive.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^7dca75ec]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — Higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS summarizes evidence from three multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one pilot RCT and found no significant overall benefit of higher versus lower PEEP with low tidal volumes for mortality (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83–1.03), days on mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.00; 95% CI, −1.02–1.02), or ventilator-free days (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.19–2.76), with no increase in barotrauma (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.99–2.23). A patient-level meta-analysis showed decreased mortality with higher PEEP in moderate or severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 200 mm Hg), and a separate patient-level analysis reported a stronger association in more severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150 mm Hg). The optimal method of selecting a higher PEEP level is not clear; options described include titrating PEEP according to bedside measurements of thoracopulmonary compliance with the objective of obtaining the best compliance or lowest driving pressure, titrating PEEP upward while the patient is receiving a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW until the plateau airway pressure is 28 cm H2O, or using a PEEP/FiO2 titration table; a PEEP > 5 cm H2O is usually required to avoid lung collapse. In addition, a subsequent 200 patient multicenter RCT comparing esophageal pressure–guided PEEP titration with empirical high PEEP–FiO2 titration showed no significant difference in a composite outcome.

### Practice parameters for hemodynamic support of sepsis in adult patients: 2004 update [^40677a48]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide the American College of Critical Care Medicine with updated guidelines for hemodynamic support of adult patients with sepsis.

Data Source

Publications relevant to hemodynamic support of septic patients were obtained from the medical literature, supplemented by the expertise and experience of members of an international task force convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine.

Study Selection

Both human studies and relevant animal studies were considered.

Data Synthesis

The experts articles reviewed the literature and classified the strength of evidence of human studies according to study design and scientific value. Recommendations were drafted and graded levels based on an evidence-based rating system described in the text. The recommendations were debated, and the task force chairman modified the document until < 10% of the experts disagreed with the recommendations.

Conclusions

An organized approach to the hemodynamic support of sepsis was formulated. The fundamental principle is that clinicians using hemodynamic therapies should define specific goals and end points, titrate therapies to those end points, and evaluate the results of their interventions on an ongoing basis by monitoring a combination of variables of global and regional perfusion. Using this approach, specific recommendations for fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, and inotropic therapy of septic in adult patients were promulgated.

### Titrating oxygen therapy in critically ill patients… [^b337fb91]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The development of oxygen therapy is one of the major advances of modern medicine. Oxygen therapy laid the groundwork for intensive care medicine as a specialty and has saved millions of lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of patients survived due to provision of supplemental oxygen, with or without mechanical ventilation. In some regions of the world, where oxygen supply is limited, however, there were many preventable deaths from acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Urner M, Calfee CS, Fan E.

### Bench-to-bedside review: the effects of hyperoxia during critical illness [^e38397a6]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Oxygen administration is uniformly used in emergency and intensive care medicine and has life-saving potential in critical conditions. However, excessive oxygenation also has deleterious properties in various pathophysiological processes and consequently both clinical and translational studies investigating hyperoxia during critical illness have gained increasing interest. Reactive oxygen species are notorious by-products of hyperoxia and play a pivotal role in cell signaling pathways. The effects are diverse, but when the homeostatic balance is disturbed, reactive oxygen species typically conserve a vicious cycle of tissue injury, characterized by cell damage, cell death, and inflammation. The most prominent symptoms in the abundantly exposed lungs include tracheobronchitis, pulmonary edema, and respiratory failure. In addition, absorptive atelectasis results as a physiological phenomenon with increasing levels of inspiratory oxygen. Hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction can be beneficial during vasodilatory shock, but hemodynamic changes may also impose risk when organ perfusion is impaired. In this context, oxygen may be recognized as a multifaceted agent, a modifiable risk factor, and a feasible target for intervention. Although most clinical outcomes are still under extensive investigation, careful titration of oxygen supply is warranted in order to secure adequate tissue oxygenation while preventing hyperoxic harm.

### Lower versus higher oxygenation targets in critically ill patients with severe hypoxaemia: secondary Bayesian analysis to explore heterogeneous treatment effects in the handling oxygenation targets in the intensive care unit (HOT-ICU) trial [^0c2cf345]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

None of the aforementioned trials, have considered the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects in a comparable manner to the one presented here. However, in a subgroup of patients with sepsis in the ICU-ROX trial, point estimates of treatment effects indicated harm of a lower oxygenation strategy, although this was not statistically significant. Similar was found in the subgroup of patients with shock at baseline in the HOT-ICU trial. On the contrary, the OXYGEN-ICU trial found reduced occurrence of shock when using a conservative oxygenation strategy compared with a more liberal oxygenation strategy.

The strengths and limitations from the HOT-ICU trial are all carried over to this study. The most important strengths are the size of the trial, the pragmatic design, high external validity (35 ICUs in seven countries), and the clear separation in the oxygenation parameters between the intervention groups. Also, the protocol for this study was published before randomisation of the last patient in the HOT-ICU trial. Further, our results were consistent in the sensitivity analyses using different priors, and we evaluated the presence of heterogeneity of treatment effects both in subgroups and on the continuous scale, which may ease interpretation of our finding and serves as a consistency check. The limitations of this study are mainly related to the heterogeneity of treatment effect analyses. We chose the variables of interest based on availability and of the following reasons:the SOFA score is independently associated with mortality, and assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effects according to the risk of the outcome is recommended. Based on clinical rationale, different degrees of hypoxaemic respiratory failure may benefit from different levels of oxygenation; plasma lactate concentration and norepinephrine dose both serve as markers of shock, which, in turn, is associated with increased mortality. A dedicated prediction model for mortality would have been preferable, but this was not available. Also, other variables, or combinations of such, could have provided additional information on the potential heterogeneity with different oxygenation targets. As some subgroups may contain few events, this may lead to imprecision. Yet, this effect is to some extent mitigated by shrinkage and partial pooling in the hierarchical models. As the categorisation of the continuous baseline variables into quintile-based subgroups was data driven, cut-offs did not follow established conventions (e.g. in relation to the PaO₂:FiO₂ ratio), limiting the generalisability of the results. However, this was chosen to ensure that all subgroups were of adequate and similar sizes. In the analyses on the continuous scale, we assumed a linear relationship (on the log-OR scale) between the variables of interest and mortality, including the interaction term. For the sake of simplicity and to limit the risk of spurious findings and overfitting because of the use of multiple and increasingly flexible models, no other models to predict this relationship were applied. Lastly, secondary analyses and subgroup analyses should always be cautiously interpreted. Despite the analyses being pre-planned and the benefits of the Bayesian methods, the risks of spurious findings are not eliminated. All results from this study should consequently be regarded as hypothesis generating only.

### Physiology is vital to precision medicine in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis [^491021c4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Thoracic Society recently released a thoughtful and forward-thinking statement outlining a research agenda for precision medicine in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The statement draws attention to the problem of highly variable treatment responsiveness in these heterogeneous syndromes and proposes a range of promising solutions to address this problem, with a focus on enhanced molecular phenotyping and novel trial designs. This approach is predicated on an overarching hypothesis that the molecular contents of biospecimens contain the key to unlocking patient heterogeneity for precision-guided therapy for sepsis and ARDS. Although this hypothesis is very attractive and will undoubtedly yield exciting discoveries and therapies in the future, we suggest that the focus on molecular measurements is too narrow and overlooks critical readouts of systems biology, yielding an incomplete data set for precision medicine. We contend that physiology remains an important and feasible means to understand and predict heterogeneity of treatment effect. It has a proven record of success and can be used in real time to monitor and tailor treatment.

The concept of precision medicine can carry multiple meanings. Applied to individual patients, it connotes the tailoring of treatments to some optimal dose or setting according to a patient's individual characteristics. Physiology, including the information obtained from laboratory tests (e.g. blood gases), vital signs and hemodynamics (e.g. blood pressure), point-of-care ultrasound, and echocardiography, is routinely used to this end in the ICU (e.g. titration of ventilator settings, vasopressors, and inotropes). This tailoring relies on the individual patient's physiological response, (often) in real time to the specific intervention, and how that intervention interacts with the patient's host response to the particular insult (e.g. infection or trauma). The tailoring is also dependent on some understanding of the relationship between physiological parameters and the benefit or harm of the therapy, an understanding often derived from experimental physiology (e.g. plateau pressure and the risk of barotrauma).

### Oxygen supplementation and hyperoxia in critically ill cardiac patients: from pathophysiology to clinical practice [^e3053638]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

An important subgroup of critically ill patients who may be particularly harmed by a liberal oxygen strategy and subsequent hyperoxia are those with hypercarbic respiratory failure, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In these patients, chronic elevation in carbon dioxide (CO₂) results in a drive to breathe triggered primarily by hypoxia, with excess oxygen administration serving to decrease respiratory drive. Supplemental oxygen also destabilizes already optimized ventilation-perfusion matching, further exacerbating hypercarbia. For these patients, we recommend careful titration of FiO₂ to maintain SpO₂ at 88% to 92% and no higher.

COVID-19 infection is associated with both cardiovascular complications and poorer outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. Compared with the evidence for other causes of hypoxic respiratory failure, there is limited high-quality evidence to suggest oxygen targets should be any different in COVID-19. An ongoing RCT is comparing lower (60 mm Hg) vs higher (90 mm Hg) PaO 2 goals with a planned enrollment of 780 COVID-19 patients. Until more data are available, consistent with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, we recommend an SpO 2 goal between 92% and 96% for patients with acute COVID-19 infection.

### The new usual care [^cde245c0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Recent literature continues to refine which components of the early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) algorithm are necessary. Given it utilizes central venous pressure, continuous central venous oxygen saturation, routine blood transfusions, and inotropic medications, this algorithm can be timely, invasive, costly, and potentially harmful. New trials highlight early recognition, early fluid resuscitation, appropriate antibiotic treatment, source control, and the application of a multidisciplinary evidence-based approach as essential components of current sepsis management. This article discusses the landmark sepsis trials that have been published over the past several decades and offers recommendations on what should currently be considered 'usual care'.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^68fae084]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Mechanical ventilation strategy — non-invasive ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in sepsis-induced pediatric ARDS (PARDS) — We suggest a trial of non-invasive mechanical ventilation (over invasive mechanical ventilation) in children with sepsis-induced PARDS without a clear indication for intubation and who are responding to initial resuscitation (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence), and when non-invasive mechanical ventilation is initiated, clinicians should carefully and frequently re-evaluate the patient's condition. We suggest using high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in children with sepsis-induced PARDS (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence), noting that The exact level of high PEEP has not been tested or determined in PARDS patients and that adverse hemodynamic effects of high PEEP may be more prominent in children with septic shock. We cannot suggest for or against the use of recruitment maneuvers in children with sepsis-induced PARDS and refractory hypoxemia, and if a recruitment maneuver is considered, the use of a stepwise, incremental and decremental PEEP titration maneuver is preferred over sustained inflation techniques that have not been optimized through direct testing in PARDS patients, and all PARDS patients must be carefully monitored for tolerance of the maneuver.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — Selecting higher PEEP and esophageal pressure guidance: The optimal method of selecting a higher PEEP level is not clear. Options include titrating PEEP by thoracopulmonary compliance to obtain the best compliance or lowest driving pressure, titrating PEEP upward while receiving a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW until the plateau airway pressure is 28 cm H2O, or using a PEEP/FiO2 titration table; a PEEP > 5 cm H2O is usually required to avoid lung collapse. Esophageal pressure guided PEEP titration has been evaluated; while a pilot suggested benefit, a subsequent 200 patient multicenter RCT comparing esophageal measurement versus empirical high PEEP-FiO2 titration showed no significant difference in a composite outcome.

### The effect of goal-directed therapy on mortality in patients with sepsis-earlier is better: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^7c3b12b0]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Ethical approval and patient consent were not required, because we conducted a meta-analysis of previously published studies. We followed the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to carry out the study and follow the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement to report our meta-analysis.

Search strategy

Electronic searches were conducted in the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. Search terms included "goal directed", "goal oriented", "goal target", "cardiac output", "cardiac index", "oxygen delivery", "oxygen consumption", "cardiac volume", "stroke volume", "fluid therapy", "fluid loading", "fluid administration", "optimization", "optimization", "supranormal" and "sepsis", "severe sepsis", "septic shock", "septicemia", "septicaemia", "pyohemia", "pyaemia" and "pyemia". There was no language restriction placed on the searches. Each database was searched from inception to April 2014. Additionally, reference lists in the articles chosen for inclusion, and the reference lists of previous reviews were screened to identify other potentially eligible trials.

Inclusion criteria

We included trials with the following characteristics:
Population: Adult patients with one or more of the following characteristics were eligible for inclusion: sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. Adults were defined as being of a legal age for consent in the country where the trial was conducted. Studies that included sepsis secondary to noninfectious causes were excluded.
Intervention: The intervention had to be GDT, defined as an explicit protocol encompassing the use of hemodynamic monitoring and manipulation of hemodynamic parameters to achieve predetermined hemodynamic endpoints.
Control: The control group had to have received standard therapy or usual care.
Outcomes: The overall mortality rate had to be the outcome measured.
Type of study: The studies had to be randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

We included studies that randomized a mixed population of critically ill patients when a septic subpopulation that met our inclusion criteria was defined; that is, the patients with sepsis constituted a subgroup of the trial population.

### Higher vs Lower oxygenation strategies in acutely ill adults: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^46171c71]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Liberal oxygen supplementation is often used in acute illness but has, in some studies, been associated with harm.

Research Question

The goal of this study was to assess the benefits and harms of higher vs lower oxygenation strategies in acutely ill adults.

Study Design and Methods

This study was an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) of randomized clinical trials. A clear differentiation (separation) was made between a higher (liberal) oxygenation and a lower (conservative) oxygenation strategy and their effects on all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, quality of life, lung injury, sepsis, and cardiovascular events at time points closest to 90 days in acutely ill adults.

Results

The study included 50 randomized clinical trials of 21,014 participants; 36 trials with a total of 20,166 participants contributed data to the analyses. Meta-analysis and TSAs showed no difference between higher and lower oxygenation strategies in trials at overall low risk of bias except for blinding: mortality relative risk (RR), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.89–1.09; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.86–1.12; low certainty evidence); serious adverse events RR, 0.99 (95% CI, 0.89–1.12; TSA-adjusted CI, 0.83–1.19; low certainty evidence). The corresponding summary estimates including trials with overall low and high risk of bias showed similar results. No difference was found between higher and lower oxygenation strategies in meta-analyses and TSAs regarding quality of life, lung injury, sepsis, and cardiovascular events (very low certainty evidence).

Interpretation

No evidence was found of beneficial or harmful effects of higher vs lower oxygenation strategies in acutely ill adults (low to very low certainty evidence).

### Early goal-directed resuscitation of patients with septic shock: current evidence and future directions [^41f440f3]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Conventional management that focuses on early antibiotics and targeted resuscitation has contributed to improvements in survival of patients with septic shock over the last decade. New evidence from the ProCESS, ARISE and PRoMISe trials, however, suggests that structured 'early goal-directed resuscitation' with routine placement of a central venous catheter, monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation and aggressive red cell transfusion does not improve outcomes in most patients with septic shock. The nuances of fluid and vasopressor administration in early septic shock remain incompletely defined. Further, development and validation of practical methods for accurately assessing optimal fluid administration is needed. Future studies that seek to address these issues will likely benefit from emerging novel techniques, including molecular diagnostics and adaptive trial designs.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^5d87c683]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### Advanced life support. post-cardiac arrest care [^d556de28]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Prehospital oxygen target strategies after return of spontaneous circulation — trial definitions and outcomes: In the prehospital setting, four RCTs evaluated lower versus higher oxygen "targets" defined as a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) of 30% versus 100%, administration of 2 to 4 L/minute versus greater than 10 L/minute oxygen, an oxygen saturation of 94% to 98% versus an FiO₂ of 100%, and an oxygen saturation of 90% to 94% compared with 98% to 100%. In the EXACT trial, a higher proportion of patients randomized to the lower oxygen titration group (oxygen saturation target, 90% to 94%) compared with the higher oxygen titration group (oxygen saturation target, 98% to 100%) experienced hypoxemia and required an increase in oxygen to 100%, survival-to-hospital discharge was lower in the lower oxygen titration group, and randomization did not occur until after the patient was hemodynamically stable and had an oxygen saturation greater than 94% on 100% oxygen, with titration via a ventilator once in the hospital for the higher oxygen group.

### Influence of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on the hemodynamic parameters of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial [^8e780050]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The following clinical data were gained upon admission

History and baseline characteristic data (age, gender, source of ICU admission, and sites of infection), complete laboratory investigations, microbiological samples, and radiographic investigations. Antimicrobials were given immediately within one hour of sepsis identification following the international recommendations.
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Simplified Acute Physiology Score Ш (SAPS Ш), and Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation Π (APACHE Π) scores were calculated upon ICU admission.
Continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring was performed using an arterial catheter, and the heart rate was also continually measured using electrocardiography.
After adequate fluid resuscitation, if diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) was lower than 60 mmHg or mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was lower than 65 mmHg, we immediately initiated vasopressor (norepinephrine) infusion. The norepinephrine dosage was adjusted between 0.2 and 1.5 µg/kg/minute to maintain MAP above 65 mmHg and DBP above 60 mmHg.
The central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) was measured every 12 h to guide fluid resuscitation. ScvO2 levels were characterized as high if they exceeded 75%, normal if they ranged between 65 and 75%, and low if they were less than 65%.
Arterial blood gas was checked every six hours. Mean FiO₂, SpO₂, PaO₂, and the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio were calculated daily.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^b6589f71]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — dynamic assessment to guide fluid therapy: Heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP) and systolic blood pressure alone are poor indicators of fluid status, and dynamic measures have demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy at predicting fluid responsiveness, including passive leg raising with cardiac output (CO) measurement and stroke volume (SV)–based fluid challenges. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, dynamic assessment to guide fluid therapy was associated with reduced mortality (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.83), ICU length of stay (MD -1.16 days; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.36), and duration of mechanical ventilation (-2.98 hours; 95% CI, -5.08 to -0.89), although another meta-analysis found no significant difference in mortality versus standard resuscitative strategies. An RCT in Zambia using protocolized IV fluids guided by jugular venous pressure, respiratory rate, and arterial oxygen saturation only led to more fluids in the first 6 hours (median 3.5 L [IQR, 2.7–4.0] versus 2.0 L [IQR, 1.0–2.5]) and higher hospital mortality (48.1% versus 33%) than standard care.

### Meta-analysis of hemodynamic optimization: relationship to methodological quality [^c4bb44f7]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis, for which we conducted a systematic search, selection and quality assessment of the literature, suggests that optimization techniques can improve survival when used in peri-operative and trauma patients without sepsis or multiple organ failure. Overall, patients with sepsis and overt organ failure do not benefit from this method.

The use of hemodynamic optimization as a therapy to improve outcome is controversial. The regimen was originally designed to optimize the hemodynamic status in high-risk surgical patients. The initial studies found an improved outcome, although doubt remained about the methodological quality of these studies. A large number of studies, using different patient populations and optimization techniques, were subsequently conducted. A considerable number of these studies found no improved outcome. Moreover, one study found an increased mortality rate in the optimized patient group. The meta-analysis by Heyland and colleagues, reporting the first seven studies published at that time, found no overall benefit from maximizing oxygen delivery with the aim of improving outcome. This meta-analysis also criticized the quality of the individual studies. A subsequent meta-analysis by Kern and Shoemaker found a significantly lower mortality in patient groups optimized at an early stage (namely surgical patients optimized peri-operatively), but no formal quality analysis was presented. Our meta-analysis represents the most up-to-date evaluation of the issue of hemodynamic optimization in which a quality assessment was performed and related to the outcome of the studies. It suggests that hemodynamic optimization strategies are beneficial in all patient subgroups but that the overall effect is explained by the significant improvement in mortality in those studies including peri-operative and trauma patients.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^efeee36c]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults — respiratory support and oxygenation — states that while high-flow nasal cannula therapy appears to be beneficial for sepsis patients with progressive hypoxia without hypercapnia, these patients are at high risk of needing intubation and require close monitoring for ventilatory failure. There was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of conservative oxygen targets in adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure, but several trials are currently underway. Similarly, there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of noninvasive ventilation compared with invasive ventilation for adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure.

### Hemodynamic goals in randomized clinical trials in patients with sepsis: a systematic review of the literature [^c344bfa8]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Most sepsis clinical trials reviewed did not include hemodynamic goals of therapy. Of note, the four largest clinical trials evaluating novel therapies in patients with sepsis did not specify hemodynamic goals of treatment.

- For those 13 studies identified in our systematic review, there was wide variation in hemodynamic measures selected and the hemodynamic goals chosen.

- Further research is necessary to determine whether this lack of consistency in hemodynamic goals may contribute to heterogeneity in treatment effects for clinical trials of novel sepsis therapies.

### Effect of low-normal vs high-normal oxygenation targets on organ dysfunction in critically ill patients… [^0b6ce96b]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The median SOFARANK score was −35 points in the low-normal Pao₂ group vs −40 in the high-normal Pao₂ group. Six randomized clinical trials in ICU patients7-12 and 1 meta-analysis13 comparing low vs high oxygenation targets showed inconsistent results. Two of these trials7, 8 and the meta-analysis13 reported reduced mortality for lower oxygenation targets, while 4 trials9-12 showed no difference in outcome. One trial11 reported an increased incidence of mesenteric ischemia in the low oxygenation target group. The trial was designed to detect a difference of 0. 33 SDs on the primary end point with 90% power and a 2-sided α of. 05 with 2 interim analyses. In a validation study of SOFA score–based end points, a between-group difference in SOFA trajectory of 0. 33 SDs was associated with a 28-day mortality odds ratio of 0.
79.

18 Thus, the total sample size proposed for this trial was 385 patients. In this multicenter RCT including 400 critically ill patients with 2 or more SIRS criteria, treatment with a low-normal Pao2 target compared with a high-normal target did not significantly reduce organ dysfunction at 14 days. There were no significant differences in 90-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or ICU length of stay. Similar to 2 other trials, 11, 12 we evaluated oxygen therapy predominantly based on Pao₂ targets. A Po₂ difference is the driving force for oxygen diffusion from the arterial blood to the tissues. 14 Small differences in SpO₂ can coincide with large Pao₂ differences because the relation between Pao₂ and Spo₂ is not linear but S-shaped. Therefore, a Pao₂ strategy allows more precise titration of oxygenation compared with Spo₂ targets, although with a theoretical need for increased blood sampling. 24–26.

The HYPERS2S trial, in which mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis were randomized to 100% oxygen vs an Spo2 of 88% to 95%, 8 was stopped prematurely because of excess mortality in the hyperoxemia group that did not reach statistical significance.

### Bench-to-bedside review: the initial hemodynamic resuscitation of the septic patient according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines – does one size fit all? [^6a218eba]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock recommend that the initial hemodynamic resuscitation be done according to the protocol used by Rivers and colleagues in their well-known early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) study. However, it may well be that their patients were much sicker on admission than many other septic patients. Compared with other populations of septic patients, the patients of Rivers and colleagues had a higher incidence of severe comorbidities, a more severe hemodynamic status on admission (excessively low central venous oxygen saturation [ScvO2], low central venous pressure [CVP], and high lactate), and higher mortality rates. Therefore, it may well be that these patients arrived to the hospital in late untreated hypovolemic sepsis, which may have been due, in part at least, to low socioeconomic status and reduced access to health care. The EGDT protocol uses target values for CVP and ScvO2 to guide hemodynamic management. However, filling pressures do not reliably predict the response to fluid administration, while the ScvO2 of septic patients is characteristically high due to decreased oxygen extraction. For all these reasons, it seems that the hemodynamic component of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines cannot be applied to all septic patients, particularly those who develop sepsis during their hospital stay.

### Early liberal fluid therapy for sepsis patients is not harmful: hydrophobia is unwarranted but drink responsibly [^bcc4e5f2]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

TITRATION OF FLUIDS — A WORK IN PROGRESS

Titration of fluid therapy is performed with numerous methodologies. Frequently, more than one method is required to make an accurate assessment. History, physical examination, dynamic, static and volumetric devices, and ultrasound and metabolic variables can be used, each with certain limitations. Inherent in measuring intravascular pressures is the inference that pressure equals volume. There are many instances for which the pressure within an intracardiac chamber may be elevated and the intravascular volume status may be diminished. The goal is to infuse "adequate" volume to restore perfusion before the onset of irreversible tissue damage without raising cardiac filling pressure to a level that produces hydrostatic pulmonary edema. Hemodynamic monitoring used to accomplish these goals can vary and have not been shown to have outcomes superiority. Although much maligned as a predictor of fluid responsiveness, the general use of CVP in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock has been associated with improved outcomes.

For example, a patient with a CVP of 30 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70 mm Hg, heart rate of 80 beats/min, lactate of 5 mM/L, and normal hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation and Sc 2 of 44% would get an inotrope. Interestingly, this scenario is associated with increased fluid administration because the CVP is lowered with improved ventricular compliance. A patient with a CVP of 4 mm Hg, MAP of 70 mm Hg, heart rate of 80 beats/min, lactate of 5 mM/L, and normal hemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturation and Sc 2 of 44% would get fluid therapy. If CVP was taken in isolation in the first scenario, one would not assume fluid therapy is indicated and some may mistakenly use a diuretic. An elevated CVP has been associated with increased mortality as an interpretation of volume overload when in reality it may be myocardial suppression. Thus, using all endpoints in an algorithmic approach is the foundation of a comprehensive resuscitation. The discussion regarding CVP is best summarized by Sondergaard et al who stated:

"Knowledge of the CVP is essential for the measurement of the volume state, the performance of the heart and the SVR. It enters considerations of heart, volume and power efficiency. The CVP provides a floating ground for the differential measurement of intravascular pressures. It does not inherently measure preload or the volume state but its measurement is essential to their calculation. Once the above principles are understood, precise control of the circulation becomes a straightforward mathematically predictable process".

Recruitment maneuvers in ARDS — For adults with sepsis-induced moderate-severe ARDS, we suggest using traditional recruitment maneuvers (Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and when using recruitment maneuvers, we recommend against using incremental PEEP titration/strategy (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). The traditional maneuver is described as the application of sustained continuous positive airway pressure (e.g., 30–40 cm H2O for 30–40 seconds). Incremental PEEP recruitment is associated with increased 28-day mortality RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00–1.25), whereas traditional recruitment maneuvers appear to improve 28-day mortality (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96) in patients with ARDS. Any patient receiving recruitment maneuvers should be monitored closely and recruitment maneuvers should be discontinued if deterioration in clinical status is observed.

Primary and secondary outcomes

Data expressed as mean ± SD, median (range), or frequency (%). ICU, intensive care unit; VAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia; RRT, renal replacement therapy

Vasopressors were needed by 45 patients (84.9%) in the conservative treatment group to keep their MAP above 65 mmHg, compared to 35 patients (66.0%) in the liberal treatment group (p = 0.024) (Table 2). The univariate logistic regression study of the independent variables for vasopressor needs in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis revealed significant associations with increasing SOFA score, APACHE Π score, and the conservative oxygen management group. After adjusting for all variables, the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the conservative oxygen group was 3.83 times more likely than the liberal group (reference) to require vasopressors (AOR = 3.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31–11.18, p = 0.014). Elderly patients were significantly more likely to need vasopressors, with an AOR of 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01–1.07, p = 0.038). Furthermore, individuals with higher SOFA levels were significantly more likely to utilize vasopressors than those with lower values (AOR = 1.36, 95% CI, 1.09–1.68, P = 0.005) (Table 3).

### Influence of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on the hemodynamic parameters of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial [^ba1635a8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis and septic shock remain significant global health burdens, characterized by elevated morbidity and mortality rates. Sepsis is an unregulated host response to infection that results in tissue hypoperfusion and end-organ damage. Optimizing oxygen delivery is crucial for patients with sepsis, particularly those on mechanical ventilation, which requires increasing cardiac output and oxygen supplementation. Bak et al. identified a negative correlation between increasing arterial oxygen levels and decreasing left ventricular stroke volume and end-diastolic area. The study involved nine healthy volunteers between the ages of 23 and 48. Previous research has also shown that oxygen therapy can considerably impact cardiovascular function. Additionally, hyperoxia and oxidative imbalance produce excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributing to organ damage and cardiac cell death. Sepsis also enhances the formation of these free radicals. Thus, the optimal oxygen regimen for patients with sepsis is still being determined.

A recent post-hoc analysis of data from 251 mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis who participated in a trial evaluating conservative to standard oxygen therapy revealed that conservative oxygen therapy did not result in a statistically significant reduction in 90-day mortality compared to standard oxygen therapy. However, the study was insufficiently powered to detect the hemodynamically meaningful advantage or harm of conservative oxygen therapy in this patient population. Therefore, there is a lack of evidence verifying the effect of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapy on hemodynamics in mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis. Notably, echocardiographic monitoring has recently been implemented in critical care, and stroke volume (SV) is becoming a more significant hemodynamic parameter to evaluate heart pump performance and organ perfusion. SV is considered the fundamental determinant of cardiac output (CO) and is less affected by compensatory processes.

This randomized clinical trial compared the effect of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapy on stroke volume and cardiac output in sepsis patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Vasopressor needs, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality were also evaluated.

### Hyperoxaemia and hypoxaemia are associated with harm in patients with ARDS [^f5a4bcbb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite existing evidence, there remains a need to better define the optimal oxygenation targets in ARDS, and how to safely titrate oxygen to achieve these but without exposing patients to potentially injurious hyperoxia. Furthermore, there remains a need to define hyperoxaemia, with a pragmatic definition that can be evaluated by the bedside clinician likely to be of most practical benefit. In patients with ARDS, the predicted probability of both ICU and hospital mortality was lowest when the average time-weighted PaO₂ was between 12.5 and 14 kPa (93.8–105.0 mmHg), suggesting this is a reasonable oxygenation target for clinicians to aim for. A recently completed clinical trial evaluating different oxygenation targets in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NCT02321072) will add to existing data in patients at risk for ARDS and will help to inform clinicians about the risks to their patients of different oxygenation targets.

### Effect of an early resuscitation protocol on in-hospital mortality among adults with sepsis and hypotension: a randomized clinical trial [^78c09f6c]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study SSSP-2 was published by Ben Andrews and colleagues in 2017 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Sepsis and septic shock. In the SSSP-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of an early resuscitation protocol in adults with sepsis and hypotension in resource-limited settings? In the SSSP-2 study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the SSSP-2 study, the population was: 209 patients (92 female, 117 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with sepsis and hypotension presenting to the emergency department in resource-limited settings. The key exclusion criteria were hypoxemia or severe tachypnea; gastrointestinal bleeding in the absence of fever; congestive HF exacerbation; ESRD; elevated jugular venous pressure; incarceration; indications for immediate surgery. In the SSSP-2 study, the interventions were: n = 106 early sepsis protocol (an early aggressive fluid strategy; blood transfusion and titratable dopamine when appropriate) n = 103 usual care (hemodynamic management determined by treating clinicians). In the SSSP-2 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in death in the hospital (48.1% vs. 33%; RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.05). In the SSSP-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in IV fluid in the 6 hours after presentation (3.5 L vs. 2 L; AD 1.2 L, 95% CI 1 to 1.5) Significant increase in vasopressor use (14.2% vs. 1.9%; AD 12.3%, 95% CI 5.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in death at day 28 (67% vs. 45.3%; RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.91). In the SSSP-2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant difference in length of hospital stay (5 days vs. 7 days). In the SSSP-2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with sepsis and hypotension presenting to the emergency department in resource-limited settings, early sepsis protocol was inferior to usual care with respect to death in the hospital.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — Plateau pressure targets and outcomes in ARDS: Randomized trials comparing low tidal volume and limited plateau pressure versus higher tidal volume and plateau pressure showed reduced mortality (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.97) and more ventilator-free days (MD 1.8 days; 95% CI, 0.35 to 3.25) with low plateau pressures. Observational data noted the mortality association was not evident when plateau pressure was below 20 cm H2O and identified a plateau pressure cut-off value of 29 cm H2O above which risk of death increased. The guideline therefore states the upper limit goal for plateau pressure should be less than 30 cm H2O.

A patient-level analysis suggested that ARDS patients who respond to increased PEEP with improved oxygenation have a lower risk of death, with a stronger association in more severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mm Hg) compared with less severe ARDS.

### Early goal-directed therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock: insights and comparisons to proCESS, proMISe, and ARISE [^a7370207]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO₂)

Similar to a low CVP, a low ScvO₂ (< 40%) is a consistent finding in experimental models and observations of early human sepsis. The lower ScvO 2 values in the EGDT trial reflect earlier CVC placement, greater shock severity, or imbalances between DO₂ (oxygen delivery) and VO₂ (oxygen consumption) before corrective interventions. The frequency of ScvO 2 less than 70% has been reported as 36% to 45.4% in ED patients and up to 53% of ICU admissions. ScvO 2 below 70% upon ICU admission is associated with a 10.4% increase in hospital mortality.

Did the trio of EGDT trials shed light on the role of ScvO 2 as an important endpoint of EGDT when the initial mean ScvO 2 was 71%, 72%, and 70% in the ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe trials, respectively, along with a normal CVP (Table 3)? In the EGDT trial, the mean (and median) ScvO 2 of 49% at randomization was 2 standard deviations below the target ScvO 2 of 70%. In other words, 97.5% of enrolled patients actually required specific steps to normalize ScvO 2. Assuming that ScvO 2 values were normally distributed — and they were reported and analyzed in the trio of EGDT trials as parametric (normally distributed) data — the median value for ScvO 2 would also be greater than or equal to 70%, indicating that half of the patients had a normal baseline ScvO 2 or reached the targeted endpoint of EGDT at the time of randomization. Assuming that randomization was effective in the trio of EGDT trials, half of patients in the usual care arms of the studies also would not have "required" specific steps of EGDT to reach this endpoint.

Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was a component of the trio of EGDT trials. ITT analysis is limited when the endpoint of the variable in question (ScvO 2 and CVP) is achieved at the time of randomization. A methodologically more appropriate investigation would randomize patients who required normalization of ScvO 2 (or with low baseline ScvO 2) to receive EGDT versus usual or other forms of care. Unfortunately, without having a CVC inserted, the investigators of the trio of EGDT trials did not have a mechanism for screening those patients with low ScvO 2 after meeting the same enrollment criteria as the EGDT trial.

### Personalizing fluid and vasopressor decision in early sepsis management… [^547f5059]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Because central lines take time to place, clinicians often rely on fluids to support blood pressure during central line placement. 5, 6 However, there has been recent concern that aggressive fluid resuscitation and fluid overload may increase organ failure and mortality in patients with sepsis. 7–9 Concurrently, emerging data have demonstrated that administering vasopressors through peripheral IVs is safe, which may help facilitate earlier vasopressor initiation. 5, 10–13 As a result, there has been increasing interest in restricting fluid volumes and starting vasopressors earlier. 14, 15. Cases 3 and 4 included randomized supplemental oxygen support and respiratory rate.

Cases 5 and 6 included randomized laboratory-based factors: lactate trend after fluids and acute kidney injury. Oxygen requirement, higher respiratory rate, rising lactate with fluids, and nonoliguric AKI all had significant but small associations with vasopressor initiation. History of kidney failure and receiving dialysis, HFrEF, downtrending lactate with fluids, and oliguric AKI were not associated with vasopressor initiation. This finding may reflect the fact that clinicians are willing to give fluids to patients with these comorbidities, which is potentially beneficial, given evidence that suggests fluids may decrease mortality in these patients. 26 In contrast, respiratory failure has been associated with harm from fluid resuscitation in sepsis trials in lower-resource settings.

27–29 Additionally, in the CLASSIC trial, 16 there was a signal for potential harm among patients on respiratory support in the fluid-liberal group. Yet, in our survey, oxygen requirement and respiratory rate only had small associations with resuscitation decisions, outweighed by fluid volume. Finally, there is some evidence to support guiding fluid resuscitation by lactate clearance, as suggested in the SSC guidelines. 24, 30, 31 Despite this guideline, we found that lactate trend was not associated with changes in clinical decision-making. These findings may suggest that apart from fluid volume received, clinicians are not using clinical factors to personalize resuscitation decisions. However.

### The association of arterial partial oxygen pressure with mortality in critically ill sepsis patients: a nationwide observational cohort study [^7d4eae06]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among critically ill adult patients with sepsis in this nationwide cohort study, oxygen supplementation aiming at a PaO₂ ≥ 80 mm Hg was associated with better outcomes compared with conservative oxygenation therapy. Additionally, hyperoxia on ICU days 2 and 3 was associated with a decreased likelihood of mortality, with the lowest mortality at PaO 2 of 100 mm Hg. We found apparent differences in the subgroup analysis of 28-day mortality in patients using vasopressors, with lactate level ≥ 4 mmol/L, or without moderate to severe ARDS. Thus, exposure to a higher intensity of oxygen therapy during early ICU days may be associated with reduced mortality in patients with sepsis and these characteristics.

Despite several studies, a controversy about the range of oxygenation in critically ill patients remains, with discrepancies in results from each study. For example, the LOCO 2 trial, including 205 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who received liberal (PaO 2 of 90–105 mm Hg) or conservative (PaO 2 of 55–70 mm Hg) therapy, showed significantly higher 90-day mortality in the conservative therapy group. Conversely, the HOT-ICU trial, including a larger sample of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure than the LOCO 2 trial, demonstrated no significant difference in 90-day mortality according to the oxygenation range. The conventional target of PaO 2 ≥ 60 mm Hg for tissue oxygenation has long been regarded as indisputable. However, a recently conducted study, which utilized a machine learning model to investigate whether the effects of oxygenation targets on outcomes differ based on individual characteristics of patients in the ICU-ROX trial, might provide a solution to this controversy. This study suggested that using individualized oxygenation targets might improve outcomes for critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation. For instance, treating septic patients with a high oxygenation target could reduce absolute mortality by 13.0%, which is supported by our study results. Therefore, the varying results of studies on optimal oxygenation do not negate the role of a higher oxygenation target but rather suggest that different diseases or severities of a specific disease may require different oxygenation strategies.

### The influence of early hemodynamic optimization on biomarker patterns of severe sepsis and septic shock [^4815d743]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Despite abundant experimental studies of biomarker patterns in early severe sepsis and septic shock, human data are few. Further, the impact of the severity of global tissue hypoxia resulting from resuscitative strategies on these early biomarker patterns remains unknown.

Methods

The temporal patterns of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, caspase-3, and interleukin-8 were serially examined over the first 72 hrs of hospitalization after early hemodynamic optimization strategies of early goal-directed vs. standard therapy for severe sepsis and septic shock patients. The relationship of these biomarker patterns to each hemodynamic optimization strategy, severity of global tissue hypoxia (reflected by lactate and central venous oxygen saturation), organ dysfunction, and mortality were examined.

Results

Abnormal biomarker levels were present upon hospital presentation and modulated to distinct patterns within 3 hrs based on the hemodynamic optimization strategy. The temporal expression of these patterns over 72 hrs was significantly associated with the severity of global tissue hypoxia, organ dysfunction, and mortality.

Conclusion

In early severe sepsis and septic shock, within the first 3 hrs of hospital presentation, distinct biomarker patterns emerge in response to hemodynamic optimization strategies. A significant association exists between temporal biomarker patterns in the first 72 hrs, severity of global tissue hypoxia, organ dysfunction, and mortality. These findings identify global tissue hypoxia as an important contributor to the early inflammatory response and support the role of hemodynamic optimization in supplementing other established therapies during this diagnostic and therapeutic "window of opportunity".

### Evolving management practices for early sepsis-induced hypoperfusion: a narrative review [^b824b574]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Resuscitation is a cornerstone of management. This review covers five areas of evolving practice in the management of early sepsis-induced hypoperfusion: fluid resuscitation volume, timing of vasopressor initiation, resuscitation targets, route of vasopressor administration, and use of invasive blood pressure monitoring. For each topic, we review the seminal evidence, discuss the evolution of practice over time, and highlight questions for additional research. Intravenous fluids are a core component of early sepsis resuscitation. However, with growing concerns about the harms of fluid, practice is evolving toward smaller-volume resuscitation, which is often paired with earlier vasopressor initiation. Large trials of fluid-restrictive, vasopressor-early strategies are providing more information about the safety and potential benefit of these approaches. Lowering blood pressure targets is a means to prevent fluid overload and reduce exposure to vasopressors; mean arterial pressure targets of 60–65 mm Hg appear to be safe, at least in older patients. With the trend toward earlier vasopressor initiation, the need for central administration of vasopressors has been questioned, and peripheral vasopressor use is increasing, although it is not universally accepted. Similarly, although guidelines suggest the use of invasive blood pressure monitoring with arterial catheters in patients receiving vasopressors, blood pressure cuffs are less invasive and often sufficient. Overall, the management of early sepsis-induced hypoperfusion is evolving toward fluid-sparing and less-invasive strategies. However, many questions remain, and additional data are needed to further optimize our approach to resuscitation.

### Early goal-directed resuscitation of patients with septic shock: current evidence and future directions [^e507dcc0]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis and septic shock are among the leading causes of mortality in the intensive care unit. Over a decade ago, early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) emerged as a novel approach for reducing sepsis mortality and was incorporated into guidelines published by the international Surviving Sepsis Campaign. In addition to requiring early detection of sepsis and prompt initiation of antibiotics, the EGDT protocol requires invasive patient monitoring to guide resuscitation with intravenous fluids, vasopressors, red cell transfusions, and inotropes. The effect of these measures on patient outcomes, however, remains controversial. Recently, three large randomized trials were undertaken to re-examine the effect of EGDT on morbidity and mortality: the ProCESS trial in the United States, the ARISE trial in Australia and New Zealand, and the ProMISe trial in England. These trials showed that EGDT did not significantly decrease mortality in patients with septic shock compared with usual care. In particular, whereas early administration of antibiotics appeared to increase survival, tailoring resuscitation to static measurements of central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation did not confer survival benefit to most patients. In the following review, we examine these findings as well as other evidence from recent randomized trials of goal-directed resuscitation. We also discuss future areas of research and emerging paradigms in sepsis trials.

### Liberal transfusion strategies reduce sepsis risk and improve neurological recovery in acute brain injury: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^fb61a64b]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This updated systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials involving 2,394 patients with ABI compared restrictive transfusion strategies with liberal transfusion strategies. Our findings indicate that RTS is associated with a higher risk of sepsis or septic shock and worse neurological outcomes at six months compared to LTS. Importantly, no significant differences were observed between the two strategies in terms of ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, venous thromboembolism, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. These results suggest that LTS may offer advantages in reducing infections and improving neurological recovery while maintaining comparable safety in terms of mortality and systemic complications in neurocritical care patients.

The current evidence on transfusion thresholds in neurocritical care remains inconclusive, with earlier meta-analyses reporting no significant differences between restrictive transfusion strategies and liberal transfusion strategies, particularly in mortality outcomes. While these meta-analyses suggested uniformity in pooled results, findings from individual observational studies and randomized trials have been inconsistent, with some studies favoring LTS and others favoring RTS for specific outcomes. These discrepancies may be attributed to methodological variability and lack of randomization, heterogeneity in patient populations, and small sample sizes. By incorporating newer trials and a larger pooled dataset, our study identified statistically significant differences in outcomes such as sepsis risk and neurological recovery, suggesting potential benefits of LTS in these domains. The clinical implication of these statistical significance remains uncertain.

In neurocritical patients, where compensatory mechanisms for maintaining oxygenation such as cerebrovascular reactivity are impaired, liberal transfusion may address this physiologic need by enhancing oxygen delivery in critical settings. This is supported by findings from the TRAIN trial, which observed a decreased risk of cerebral ischemic events in the liberal transfusion group, potentially explaining the observed neurological protection associated with LTS. While findings from the HEMOTION trial, which showed no significant differences in mortality but demonstrated better scores in functional independence and quality of life among survivors in the liberal transfusion group, suggest benefits of LTS, these results predominantly reflect TBI populations.

Four of the five trials included in our analysis focused primarily on patients with TBI, while only one trial exclusively enrolled patients with SAH. This disparity reflects the predominance of TBI in the current literature on transfusion thresholds and may limit applicability for specific neurocritical subpopulations. As such, findings should be interpreted with caution, as liberal transfusion carries risks, including an increased likelihood of progressive cerebral hemorrhagic injury, transfusion reactions, and cerebral vasospasm, which may be more pronounced in certain subpopulations such as SAH.

Pediatric sepsis-induced PARDS — inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) as rescue therapy is suggested after optimization of other strategies: "We suggest using iNO as a rescue therapy in children with sepsis-induced PARDS and refractory hypoxemia after other oxygenation strategies have been optimized (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)". iNO "is not recommended for routine use in children with sepsis-associated PARDS", though it "may be considered in children with documented pulmonary hypertension or severe right ventricular dysfunction", and abrupt discontinuation "can result in a rapid and potentially life-threatening rebound pulmonary hypertensive crisis". Evidence cited includes a Cochrane review showing no mortality benefit "(RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.51–1.18) in three RCTs", observational data suggesting "possible increased mortality risk", and "one RCT of 55 PARDS patients" indicating improved ventilation duration in survivors; collectively, these data "do not support 'routine' use… but do raise the potential for benefit as an emergency rescue therapy… after other oxygenation strategies have been optimized". When used, align with PALICC that "assessment of benefit must be undertaken promptly and serially to minimize toxicity and to eliminate continued use without established effect".

### Should we use central venous saturation to guide management in high-risk surgical patients? [^ad682049]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Measurements of central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) have been successfully used to guide haemodynamic therapy in critical care. The efficacy of this approach in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock has stimulated interest in the use of ScvO2 to guide management in patients undergoing major surgery. The physiological basis of ScvO2 measurement is complex. A number of outstanding issues will need to be resolved before incorporating ScvO2 measurement into routine practice. First, it is not yet clear which value of ScvO2 should be targeted. Second, there is some uncertainty as to which interventions are the most effective for achieving the desired value of ScvO2 or how long this value should be maintained. The study by The Collaborative Study Group on Perioperative ScvO2 Monitoring published in this edition of Critical Care may help provide answers to some of these questions. Our understanding of ScvO2 measurement remains limited, however, and the routine use of peri-operative ScvO2-guided goal-directed therapy cannot be recommended until a large randomised trial has confirmed the value of this approach.

### Meta-analysis of hemodynamic optimization: relationship to methodological quality [^cb6350ae]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

To review systematically the effect of interventions aimed at hemodynamic optimization and to relate this to the quality of individual published trials.

Methods

A systematic, computerized bibliographic search of published studies and citation reviews of relevant studies was performed. All randomized clinical trials in which adult patients were included in a trial deliberately aiming at an optimized or maximized hemodynamic condition of the patients (with oxygen delivery, cardiac index, oxygen consumption, mixed venous oxygen saturation and/or stroke volume as end-points) were selected. A total of 30 studies were selected for independent review. Two reviewers extracted data on population, intervention, outcome and methodological quality. Agreement between reviewers was high: differences were eventually resolved by third-party decision. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate (mean 9.0, SD 1.7), and the outcomes of the randomized clinical trials were not related to their quality.

Results

Efforts to achieve an optimized hemodynamic condition resulted in a decreased mortality rate (relative risk ratio (RR) 0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.90) in all studies combined. This was due to a significantly decreased mortality in peri-operative intervention studies (RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.81). Overall, patients with sepsis and overt organ failure do not benefit from this method (RR 0.92 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.11)).

Conclusion

This systematic review showed that interventions aimed at hemodynamic optimization reduced mortality. In particular, trials including peri-operative interventions aimed at the hemodynamic optimization of high-risk surgical patients reduce mortality. Overall, this effect was not related to the trial quality.

### Early goal-directed therapy: an evidence-based review [^e509a7f7]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for early goal-directed therapy that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

During the first 6 hrs of resuscitation of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, specific levels of central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, urine output, central venous (or mixed venous) oxygen saturation should be targeted. When central venous oxygen saturation remains low, despite achieving central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure targets, packed red blood cells or dobutamine should be considered. Increasing cardiac index to achieve an arbitrarily predefined elevated level is not recommended.

High positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in sepsis-induced PARDS — recommendation and practice considerations: We suggest using high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in children with sepsis-induced PARDS (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). The exact level of high PEEP has not been tested or determined in PARDS patients, and adverse hemodynamic effects of high PEEP may be more prominent in children with septic shock. Reported practice patterns indicate that pediatric critical care clinicians almost uniformly limit PEEP to 10 cm H2O irrespective of oxygenation and FIO2, which contrasts with recommendations for use of PEEP in excess of 15 cm H2O for severe PARDS patients.

### The association between supraphysiologic arterial oxygen levels and mortality in critically ill patients. A multicenter observational cohort study [^6ccf21bc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Oxygen therapy is widely used to treat critically ill patients. British Thoracic Society guidelines regard oxygen as a drug and advise a prescription to accompany its use. These guidelines acknowledge potential harm and recommend targeting a specific oxygen saturation range in acutely unwell patients. In adult patients, hyperoxemia may induce hemodynamic changes, including vasoconstriction, reduced cardiac output, and increased peripheral vascular resistance; and inflammatory changes, including the generation of reactive oxygen species and absorption atelectasis. In healthy subjects, exposure to high inspired oxygen concentrations causes alveolar leak and release of mediators responsible for lung fibrosis.

Despite these concerns, other than in patients with type II (hypercarbic) respiratory failure, oxygen use is still largely unregulated in clinical practice. Prospective randomized trials of oxygen therapy in patients suffering myocardial infarction have reported either harm or no effect. Increased mortality risk has been suggested in patients receiving higher concentrations of inspired oxygen in conditions such as cardiac arrest and septic shock, as well as in general critically ill populations. However, most of these studies lack a delineation between harm from appropriately high levels of inspired oxygen used to maintain normoxemia and excessive concentrations that result in hyperoxemia. Similarly, analyses of ICU databases variably report an association or lack thereof between hyperoxemia and poor outcomes in the critically ill. Many of these approaches are limited by using only a single measure of PaO₂ or inspired oxygen to define oxygen exposure for an entire ICU admission.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 16,000 patients indicated potential harm, concluding, "Patients treated liberally with oxygen had a dose-dependent increased risk of short-term and long-term mortality". Yet, paradoxically, they could find "no significant difference in disability, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or length of hospital stay".

The aim of the present study was to determine whether exposure to supraphysiologic PaO₂, measured as time-weighted mean exposure to hyperoxemia (referred to as "hyperoxemia dose" for brevity), was associated with excess ICU mortality. Particular attention was paid to dose–response as a proxy for a causal relationship. The specific impact of hyperoxemia was assessed in patients with a primary respiratory diagnosis for ICU admission or those who were mechanically ventilated because concurrent lung inflammation may predispose to pulmonary oxygen toxicity and increased mortality.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^cf9b1200]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should we individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation and, if so, how? Applying a standard fluid dose to all patients with sepsis is inconsistent with other areas of sepsis management, where efforts are made to personalize care where possible. What alternative strategies can be readily used in clinical practice to individualize the initial amount of fluid resuscitation to maximize benefit and reduce harms?
2) Which variables should be used to titrate fluid resuscitation? Rigorous trials comparing various dynamic and static variables to evaluate fluid responsiveness are needed. Furthermore, testing various dynamic variables in subgroups of patients with sepsis would be informative. Trials should be designed to incorporate multiple methods of assessing fluid responsiveness.
3) What is the optimal timing for fluid resuscitation? After rapid identification of sepsis and septic shock, time-series studies of fluid resuscitation are needed, especially evaluating the benefits and harms of additional therapies (e.g. vasopressors) and their respective interplay.
4) Which variables should be used to trigger fluid resuscitation and deresuscitation? Related to the timing of fluid resuscitation, should a particular set of physiologic variables be assessed in a serial fashion to determine when to shift from resuscitation to deresuscitation in a structured manner?
5) Is a combined approach using several indices of fluid responsiveness better than using a single measurement in isolation? Furthermore, how should various measures be prioritized to inform clinical judgment?
6) What is the efficacy of using CRT to guide resuscitation in patients with normal lactate levels? Would the use of a rapidly assessable physiologic test be of value in patients without a derangement in lactate levels?
7) What is the duration of effect of fluid resuscitation? Recognizing that the duration of benefit of fluid resuscitation will vary between patients, having some population estimates in mind via pharmacokinetic studies would be useful to clinicians in evaluating therapeutic options and subsequent care.
8) Do early vasopressors limit the amount of fluids required to reach the same hemodynamic target? If so, what is the appropriate ratio of fluids and vasopressors? Identifying if there is a benefit to applying a polytherapeutic approach to early resuscitation is particularly interesting given the concerns regarding excessive fluid administration. A polytherapeutic approach of early fluid administration and vasopressors using a standardized assessment approach considerate of patient variables may be more precise and individualized, thereby maximizing benefit and limiting adverse effects.
9) Should the initial resuscitation of fluids be restricted to hypotensive patients or patients with lactate greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L? In an effort to limit the effects of excessive fluid administration while maximizing benefit in those patients with malperfusion, comparing strategies of fluid resuscitation in distinctive groups of septic shock would be useful.
10) Should the initial fluid resuscitation be administered as a fixed dose of 30 mL/kg or should it be administered in smaller aliquots, with further administration contingent on reassessing the patient condition prior to administering the next bolus? Although the 30 mL/kg bolus carries the risk of under- and overdosing, it has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply, especially in resource-limited settings where advanced measurements cannot be obtained. Administration of smaller doses, repeated as needed according to hemodynamic assessment, has the advantage of fine-tuning fluid administration according to an individual patient's needs. The risk associated with this approach is the potential for adding additional complexity, while still resulting with relatively similar amount of fluids administered and diverting the healthcare team from completing other essential tasks in the initial management of the patient with sepsis.
11) Should sicker patients receive a greater amount of initial resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, should those patients with more severe physiologic derangements receive greater initial amounts of fluid resuscitation to restore perfusion at the cellular level? Understanding that there may be dose gradient to the initial volume of fluid resuscitation based on the severity of shock would be informative and guide further, targeted research in the field.
12) Should resuscitation differ in patient populations less able to tolerate large volumes? In an effort to individualize sepsis care for subgroups at greater risk of harm from vigorous resuscitation, trials evaluating subgroups of patients with particular comorbidities (heart failure, dysrhythmias, end-stage renal disease) are necessary. The ideal trial in this domain should test two fluid resuscitation strategies using tiered severity in the triggering variables, whereas the fluid boluses should be of similar amount and given only after the evaluation of fluid responsiveness. Ideally, the study should be stratified for subgroups such as heart failure and kidney disease.
13) What is the optimal strategy for fluid resuscitation in resource-limited settings? Data on resuscitation vary significantly between well-resourced and resource-limited settings, as in sub-Saharan Africa, the administration of fluids was associated with an increased risk of death. Understanding the physiology of fluid resuscitation in the absence of other elements of critical care provided in ICUs with higher resources is a key question for a large portion of the world's population. Developing simplified strategies for patient assessment and fluid administration would greatly improve the quality of care delivered.

Noninvasive ventilation in sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure — There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of noninvasive ventilation in comparison to invasive ventilation for adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure. Due to a small number of patients studied, low quality of evidence, uncertainty regarding whether clinicians can identify hypoxic patients in respiratory failure in whom NIV might be beneficial, and observational data that suggest the potential for harm with NIV in this setting, no clear recommendation can be made. If NIV is used for patients with sepsis-associated hypoxic respiratory failure, we suggest monitoring for an early reduction in work of breathing and close monitoring of tidal volumes.

### Sepsis: personalization V protocolization? [^67521825]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The founding tenet of evidence-based medicine is to combine best evidence with clinical expertise. As David Sackett opined 'Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannised by evidence'. Rigid protocols and mandates, based on an inconclusive and low-level evidence base, cannot suit the physiological, biochemical and biological heterogeneity displayed by the individual septic patient. Indeed, clear proof of outcome benefit through adoption of an inflexible management approach is lacking and will certainly be detrimental to some. Therapy thus needs to be tailored to meet the individual patient's needs. The same principle should be applied to clinical trials; the continued disappointments of multiple investigational strategies trialled over three decades, despite (often) a sound biological rationale, suggest a repeated methodological failure that does not account for the marked heterogeneity within the septic patient's biological phenotype and thus marked variation in their host response. The increasing availability of rapid point-of-care diagnostics and theranostics should facilitate better patient selection and titrated optimization of the therapeutic intervention.

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in sepsis-induced PARDS — We suggest using iNO as a rescue therapy in children with sepsis-induced PARDS and refractory hypoxemia after other oxygenation strategies have been optimized (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence cited includes a 2016 Cochrane review showing no mortality benefit from iNO (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.51–1.18) in three RCTs, observational data suggesting possible increased mortality risk, and one RCT of 55 PARDS patients indicating improved duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors. The panel states these data do not support "routine" use of iNO but support emergency rescue use after optimization; when iNO is used, "assessment of benefit must be undertaken promptly and serially to minimize toxicity and to eliminate continued use without established effect". Additional contextual notes state iNO may be considered in children with documented pulmonary hypertension or severe right ventricular dysfunction, and that abrupt discontinuation can result in a rapid and potentially life-threatening rebound pulmonary hypertensive crisis.

### Hyperoxia for sepsis and development of acute lung injury with increased mortality [^16335f91]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Oxygen administration is a fundamental treatment for patients with critical illnesses. However, a supraphysiological amount of oxygen in the blood and/or tissue has been related to unfavourable clinical outcomes in various diseases, including postcardiac arrest syndrome, accidental hypothermia, traumatic brain injury and postcardiac surgery. A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) on patients receiving mechanical ventilation showed that oxygen titration targeting at 70–100 mm Hg of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) reduced the mortality rate in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The pathophysiology behind the harmful effects of hyperoxia has been investigated, and oxygen toxicity in the brain and pulmonary tissues affects critically ill patients. Cerebral vasoconstriction and mitochondrial dysfunction were reportedly due to hyperoxia in the injured brain, which paradoxically decreases oxygen delivery to the cerebral tissues. Additionally, pulmonary vasoconstriction with alveolar damages by unnecessary reactive oxygen species was observed, particularly in patients experiencing hyperoxia under mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (ALI) was another adverse effect caused by excessive oxygen, which leads to unfavourable clinical outcomes.

Under critical illness such as sepsis, impaired oxygen utilisation at the intracellular mitochondria and reactive oxygen species production were observed. Although such toxic oxygen derivatives were considered to lead to several organ dysfunctions, appropriate tissue oxygen tension during such cytopathic hypoxia remains unclear. Subgroup analyses of RCTs on conservative oxygen usage during mechanical ventilation reported conflicting results on the harmful effects of hyperoxia among patients with sepsis. Moreover, several post-hoc analyses targeting on the association between PaO 2 and mortality due to sepsis also showed various effects of hyperoxia from benefits to harms.

Accordingly, to eventually elucidate an optimal PaO 2 target for patients with sepsis, this study conducted a post-hoc analysis on a multicentre prospective observational study on ICU patients with severe infections. We aimed to determine whether hyperoxia would be associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes in these patients. We hypothesise that hyperoxia at treatment initiation for severe infection in the ICU was associated with increased in-hospital mortality rate post-ICU admission.

### Liberal versus restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy in sepsis or septic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^09c52eeb]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with sepsis or septic shock are often anemic and undergo red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. This intervention may restore the balance between oxygen supply and demand by increasing oxygen delivery into tissue. However, RBC transfusion may also lead to deleterious events such as cardiovascular overload, acute kidney injury, acute lung injury, infectious complications, and immunomodulation. With these adverse effects of RBC transfusion, clinicians are challenged with selecting the optimal threshold of transfusion for sepsis patients to improve survival outcome.

Two different strategies of RBC transfusion ("liberal" transfusion with a hemoglobin threshold of 9 or 10 g/dL and "restrictive" transfusion with a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL) have been compared in observational studies and a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess which strategy would be more beneficial in treating sepsis patients. After the introduction of the systematic review process, the newest international guidelines for the management of sepsis and septic shock (Surviving Sepsis Campaign, 2016) recommended restrictive RBC transfusions only when the hemoglobin level decreases to < 7.0 g/dL in adult sepsis in the absence of extenuating circumstances, such as myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, or acute hemorrhage. However, this recommendation is based on limited data from only two clinical trials, including one less-direct assessment of blood transfusion therapy.

Until now, there has been no meta-analysis reviewing only RCTs on hemoglobin threshold for RBC transfusion in sepsis. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of present RCTs to assess the effect of liberal versus restrictive RBC transfusion strategy on survival outcome in sepsis or septic shock patients.

Protective ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — low tidal volume strategy (Recommendation 49) states that for adults with sepsis-induced ARDS, we recommend using a low tidal volume ventilation strategy (6mL/kg) over a high tidal volume strategy, with Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence; implementation details specify that tidal volumes > 6 cc/kg coupled with plateau pressures > 30 cm H2O should be avoided in ARDS, clinicians should use as a starting point the objective of reducing tidal volume over 1 to 2 hours toward the goal of a low tidal volume (≈ 6 mL/kg PBW) with end-inspiratory plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O, and if plateau pressure remains > 30 cm H2O after reduction to 6 mL/kg PBW, tidal volume may be further reduced to as low as 4 mL/kg PBW; during these adjustments, respiratory rate should be increased to a maximum of 35 breaths/ min to maintain minute ventilation, while recognizing that very low tidal volumes may result in significant patient-ventilator dyssynchrony and patient discomfort; supporting evidence on-page notes the largest trial showed 9% absolute decrease in mortality in ARDS patients ventilated with 6 mL/kg compared with 12 mL/kg PBW while aiming for plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O.

### Dangers of hyperoxia [^f8e75801]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, the IOTA systematic review and meta-analysis reported that conservative O 2 use in acutely ill adults significantly reduced in-hospital mortality. Although these findings were concordant with the Oxygen-ICU trial, they provided only low certainty evidence: First, the Oxygen-ICU trial contributed 32% of the weight to the mortality analysis. Second, predominant conditions were acute myocardial infarction and stroke, and a range of O 2 regimens were tested so that the analysis provided only indirect evidence about the optimal O 2 regimen for patients in the ICU. Third, the overall mortality treatment effect estimates were imprecise. Finally, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis found no evidence of benefit or harm comparing higher vs. lower oxygenation strategies in acutely ill adults.

The multicentre randomised ICU-ROX trial found that conservative O 2 therapy did not significantly affect the primary end point of number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation (ventilator-free days) compared with usual (liberal) O 2 therapy. Overall, 32.2% of conservative and 29.7% of usual O 2 patients died in hospital. While these findings provide some reassurance to clinicians about the safety of the liberal O 2 use that occurs in standard practice, they do not exclude clinically important effects of the O 2 regimens tested on mortality risk. Indeed, based on the distribution of data, there is a 46% chance that conservative O 2 therapy increases absolute mortality by more than 1.5% points, and a 19% chance that conservative O 2 therapy decreases absolute mortality by more than 1.5% points. Finally, a recent RCT conducted in ICU patients fulfilling the systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, found no significant difference between high-normal and low-normal oxygenation targets for non-respiratory organ dysfunction over the first 14 days, or in Day-90 mortality. Accordingly, the most appropriate dose of O 2 to give to adult ICU patients remains uncertain.

### Hemodynamic effects of acute hyperoxia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^2f72ad55]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In critical care and emergency medicine, oxygen is frequently administered to ensure satisfactory oxygen delivery to organs. To correct or prevent hypoxia, oxygen is often supplemented superfluously which may lead to hyperoxia (a higher than normal arterial partial pressure of oxygen (P a O 2)).

Both negative and positive clinical consequences are ascribed to hyperoxia. It is associated with increased intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and increased myocardial and cerebral infarction size. However, hyperoxia has also been associated with beneficial effects such as improved organ function after cardiac arrest and, in animal models, hyperoxia has been shown to induce a redistribution of blood flow to vital organs.

The cardiovascular effects of oxygen could play an important role in the aforementioned clinical outcomes. Reported hemodynamic effects include peripheral vasoconstriction and reduced cardiac output (CO). These effects may exacerbate pre-existing perfusion disturbances and, therefore, reduce tissue oxygen delivery. On the other hand, hyperoxic peripheral vasoconstriction may improve circulatory shock, potentially reducing the need for fluid and vasopressor resuscitation.

The magnitude of hyperoxia-induced hemodynamic alterations is currently unclear, as is the generalizability of the effects to different types of patients. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to provide an overview of the evidence of changes in hemodynamics and oxygen delivery induced by oxygen supplementation in healthy volunteers and patients with cardiovascular disease or sepsis.

### Early goal-directed therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock: insights and comparisons to proCESS, proMISe, and ARISE [^14ae6191]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The early physiologic-hemodynamic response to severe sepsis and septic shock

In animal and human models of early sepsis, global tissue hypoxia results from hemodynamic perturbations that create an imbalance between systemic oxygen delivery and demands. These perturbations can include hypovolemia, decreased vasomotor tone, decreased arterial oxygen content, myocardial depression, increased metabolic demands, and impairment of systemic oxygen utilization via microcirculatory or mitochondrial derangements (cytopathic tissue hypoxia). A critical decrease in systemic oxygen delivery is followed by an increase in the systemic oxygen extraction ratio and a decrease in mixed or central venous (SvO 2 or ScvO 2) oxygen saturation. Anaerobic metabolism ensues when the limits of this compensatory mechanism cannot maintain systemic oxygen consumption leading to lactate production. The final, and often terminal, stage is an impairment of systemic oxygen utilization. Patients in this stage have elevated ScvO 2, increased lactate, and decreased systemic oxygen consumption (Additional file 1: Figure S1).

As a result of this early response, distinct hemodynamic phenotypes emerge. Characterizing patients by distinct hemodynamic phenotypes using ScvO 2, lactate, and blood pressure provides diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic staging of sepsis for study comparisons. These hemodynamic phenotypes reflect distinct stages along a continuum of disease whether pre-hospital, in the emergency department (ED), on general practice floors or in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.

The history and development of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT)

Beginning in the early 1990s, the EGDT Collaborative Group challenged the paradigm of sepsis care as an "ICU disease" by applying similar urgent diagnostic and therapeutic principles as used for acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and trauma at the point of presentation in the ED. At that time, no structured formal worldwide accepted protocols for early identification and treatment of patients with sepsis existed. The observations of high mortality, fractured, and unstructured care triggered a series of investigations using a system-based approach to identify delays in patient diagnosis and care before hospital admission. Combining system issues with the early pathogenesis and natural progression of sepsis required the development of unique diagnostic and risk stratification criteria to detect patients at risk and most likely to benefit (Fig. 1).

### The future of intensive care: the study of the microcirculation will help to guide our therapies [^b80264ca]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Different parameters of macrocirculation and microcirculation optimization

This is essential because clinical studies in different states of shock both in adult and pediatric patients have consistently shown that the persistence of microcirculatory alterations with lost of coherence between macrocirculation and microcirculation is predictive of organ failure and unfavorable outcomes in a more sensitive and specific manner than systemic hemodynamic and biological parameters. Previous studies have demonstrated marked heterogeneity of microcirculatory flow in septic patients, with the presence of occluded capillaries next to perfused capillaries inducing microcirculatory shunting responsible for the decreased oxygen extraction capacity in sepsis. In contrast to the reduction in oxygen extraction in sepsis, a recent study of the microcirculation response to COVID-19 identified an adaptive response of the microcirculation to increase its oxygen extraction capacity in response to COVID-19-induced hypoxemia. This COVID-19-induced increase in microcirculatory oxygen extraction capacity was attributed to an increase in functional capillary density and capillary hematocrit. But the adaptive response may be impaired during hyperinflammation because of the inflammatory-induced alterations of the endothelium and glycocalyx and of a concomitant procoagulant state.

An other illustrative example of the potential interest in microcirculation assessment is the evaluation of the response to fluids. While a lot of emphasis has historically focused on the SV response to fluid infusion, the microcirculation represents a perhaps more element of the response in terms of tissue perfusion. A study by Ospina et al. found that fluid administration can improve the microcirculation at early but not at later stages of sepsis. Furthermore, Pottecher et al. showed that a first bolus, but not a second bolus, of fluid improved the sublingual microcirculation independently of the SV increase in patients with septic shock. In both trials, the microcirculatory effects were dissociated from the systemic effects. Pranskunas et al. reported that patients who had impaired microcirculatory perfusion that improved with fluid therapy had an associated improvement in organ function, whereas patients who had normal microcirculatory perfusion initially or who failed to improve their microcirculation in response to fluids did not have an associated improvement in organ function. Such a distinction which could not be made by measurement of SV in this study. Indeed, these findings highlight the importance of the microcirculation in the response to fluids and support the need to assess the microcirculation to guide fluid titration.

### Hemodynamic evaluation and monitoring in the ICU [^10d019ae]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Hemodynamic monitoring, a cornerstone in the management of the critically ill patient, is used to identify cardiovascular insufficiency, its probable cause, and response to therapy. Still it is difficult to document the efficacy of monitoring because no device improves outcome unless coupled to a treatment that improves outcome. Several clinical trials have consistently documented that preoptimization for high-risk surgery patients treated in the operating room and early (< 12 h) goal-directed resuscitation in septic patients treated in the emergency department reduce morbidity, mortality, and resource use (costs) when the end points of resuscitation were focused on surrogate measures of adequacy of global oxygen delivery (Do2). The closer the resuscitation is to the insult, the greater the benefit. When resuscitation was started after ICU admission in high-risk surgical patients, reduced length of stay was also seen. The focus of these monitoring protocols is to establish a mean arterial pressure > 65 mm Hg and then to increase Do2 to 600 mL/min/m² within the first few minutes to hours of presentation. To accomplish these goals, hemodynamic monitoring focuses more on measures of cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen saturation to access adequacy of resuscitation efforts than on filling pressures. Although these protocols reduce mortality and morbidity is selected high-risk patient groups, the widespread use of monitoring-driven treatment protocols has not yet happened, presumably because all studies have been single-center trials using a single, proprietary blood flow-monitoring device. Multicenter trials are needed of early goal-directed therapies for all patients presenting in shock of various etiologies and when the protocol and not the monitoring device is the primary variable.

### Influence of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on the hemodynamic parameters of mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis: a randomized clinical trial [^ba6f4a80]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Excessive oxygen administration has a negative impact by producing free radicals, which generate an imbalance between oxidative and anti-oxidative species, alter cell metabolism, and inhibit enzyme activity. Hyperoxia has also been associated with systemic vasoconstriction via reducing the synthesis and availability of nitric oxide, as well as a decrease in heart rate and a consequent reduction in cardiac output. Moreover, sepsis is strongly linked with impaired cardiovascular function. It can cause vasodilatation, hypotension, and reduced global cardiac function. Our clinical trial is the first to use stroke volume and cardiac output as monitoring parameters to compare the effect of liberal versus conservative oxygen therapies on hemodynamics in sepsis patients on mechanical ventilation.

Experts strongly recommend implementing critical care echocardiography as the first-line technique to assess the hemodynamic characteristics associated with shock, rather than invasive procedures. Stroke volume and cardiac output indicate significant hemodynamic instability in ICU patients. A previous transthoracic echocardiographic study included 106 patients admitted to three adult ICUs with sepsis or septic shock. The study found that 64% of patients with sepsis or septic shock have myocardial dysfunction, which includes left ventricular diastolic, systolic, and/or right ventricular failure. Sepsis causes maximum cardiac depression 48 to 72 h after onset, which appears normal on the baseline echocardiogram. In the current study, we evaluated SV upon enrollment in the trial and again 72 h later using the Doppler echocardiography approach, which correlates well with invasive SV and has high reliability. We found no significant differences in heart rate, stroke volumes, or cardiac output values between the conservative and liberal treatment groups after 72 h of oxygen therapy. An earlier study revealed that delivering 100% oxygen to individuals with congestive heart failure lowered cardiac output and stroke volume without affecting blood pressure or heart rate. In line with our findings, Smit et al. found that hyperoxia did not significantly influence heart rate or cardiac output in sepsis patients. On the other hand, they reported that hyperoxia treatment reduced stroke volume and cardiac output in patients with heart failure by 8.6% and 15.2%, respectively. These discrepancies could be attributed to the various types of patients with different illnesses.

### Liberal or conservative oxygen therapy for ventilated patients in the ICU: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c3416471]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

To further illustrate the change of effect in LOT and COT to ICU patients, we conducted subgroup analysis according to follow-up time and publication year. Before 2020, the 4 articles we involved demonstrated that LOT could significantly result in more mortality than COT. These two papers contributed the most to the effect size. But the findings of 3 articles published after 2020 are at variance with the previous results. Young et al. found that the 90-day mortality of sepsis patients in ICU who received LOT was 7 percentage points lower than that of the COT group, although not significant. For patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Barrot et al. demonstrated that the 90-day mortality rate in LOT group was 14 percentage points lower than that in the COT group.

Several possible factors might explain the results. First, the patients' characteristics should be an important concern. For patients with sepsis, oxygen delivery to the tissues could be impaired and excess oxygen delivery might help to reverse this situation and avoid cellular and organ dysfunction. While for patients with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, it is biologically plausible that COT reduces the incidence of secondary brain damage after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Moreover, based on the APACHE II score, the disease state of patients included in the Suzuki et al. was severer than that in the Young et al. and Mackle et al. Second, from the study design perspective, the follow-up duration of these two studies are relatively shorter than the studies published after 2020 and they are single-center studies. Third, targeting lower oxygenation might decrease oxygen content and transport and liberal use of oxygen may provide a baseline of safety against hypoxia in the long run.

This study also had some limitations. Firstly, the time of intervention, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the definitions and implementation of LOT and COT are hard to be unified and impractical to be consistent in clinical work. It was also reported that clinicians might prone to switch from controlled ventilation to a mode allowing unassisted ventilation in the presence of a lower fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2). Secondly, the methods of information gathering between publications could be diverse. Some papers are short of clinical parameters such as lactate and central venous oxygen saturation, which could be major influences during the treatment.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^fd42bbf4]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations.

Methods

Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D636) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: 1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times?; 2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?; 3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice?; 4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock?; 5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality?; and 6) what information identifies organ dysfunction?

Conclusions

While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### Optimising organ perfusion in the high-risk surgical and critical care patient: a narrative review [^e22d9b36]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Maintenance or prompt restoration of an oxygen supply sufficient to facilitate adequate cellular metabolism is fundamental in maintaining organ function. This is particularly relevant when metabolic needs change markedly, for example in response to major surgery or critical illness. The consequences of inadequate tissue oxygenation include wound and anastomotic breakdown, organ dysfunction, and death. However, our ability to identify those at risk and to promptly recognise and correct tissue hypoperfusion is limited. Reliance is placed upon surrogate markers of tissue oxygenation such as arterial blood pressure and serum lactate that are insensitive to early organ compromise. Advances in oxygen sensing technology will facilitate monitoring in various organ beds and allow more precise titration of therapies to physiologically relevant endpoints. Clinical trials will be needed to evaluate any impact on outcomes, however accurate on-line monitoring of the adequacy of tissue oxygenation offers the promise of a paradigm shift in resuscitation and perioperative practice. This narrative review examines current evidence for goal-directed therapy in the optimisation of organ perfusion in high-risk surgical and critically ill patients, and offers arguments to support the potential utility of tissue oxygen monitoring.

### Hyperoxaemia and hypoxaemia are associated with harm in patients with ARDS [^9a95a0da]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The concept of a U-shaped relationship between oxygen targets and mortality has been previously demonstrated in a broad cohort of critically ill patients. In a retrospective analysis of two large patient datasets of patients admitted to ICUs, it was demonstrated that hospital mortality was lowest in patients when their median SpO₂ was 94–98%. Titrating oxygen to SpO₂ targets is likely to be more achievable in resource-limited environments and therefore a study of oxygen titration to SpO₂ in patients with ARDS may be warranted in future. Such studies may wish to prioritise including patients with moderate ARDS given the findings presented in this manuscript.

Whilst oxygen targets are predominantly based on pulse oximetry or PaO₂ the variable that is most likely to be adjusted to achieve these targets is FiO₂. It is difficult to extrapolate the benefits or harms from one oxygenation target without considering the potential harms from higher FiO₂. Indeed, it is plausible that patients at both extremes of arterial oxygenation were each exposed to high FiO₂. Exposure to an FiO₂ set at 1.0 has been shown to be associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients with septic shock, and therefore it is possible that the harm demonstrated in this analysis (of an average time-weighted PaO₂ within the first 7 days of ARDS out-with 12.5–14 kPa (93.8–105.0 mmHg)) is at least in part mediated by exposure to high FiO₂.

### Conservative oxygen therapy for mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis: a post hoc analysis of data from the intensive care unit randomized trial comparing two approaches to oxygen therapy (ICU-ROX) [^3933239f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Sepsis is a common reason for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in ICU patients. Despite increasing interest in treatment strategies limiting oxygen exposure in ICU patients, no trials have compared conservative vs. usual oxygen in patients with sepsis.

Methods

We undertook a post hoc analysis of the 251 patients with sepsis enrolled in a trial that compared conservative oxygen therapy with usual oxygen therapy in 1000 mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The primary end point for the current analysis was 90-day mortality. Key secondary outcomes were cause-specific mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, ventilator-free days, vasopressor-free days, and the proportion of patients receiving renal replacement therapy in the ICU.

Results

Patients with sepsis allocated to conservative oxygen therapy spent less time in the ICU with an SpO 2 ≥ 97% (23.5 h [interquartile range (IQR) 8–70] vs. 47 h [IQR 11–93], absolute difference, 23 h; 95% CI 8–38), and more time receiving an FiO 2 of 0.21 than patients allocated to usual oxygen therapy (20.5 h [IQR 1–79] vs. 0 h [IQR 0–10], absolute difference, 20 h; 95% CI 14–26). At 90-days, 47 of 130 patients (36.2%) assigned to conservative oxygen and 35 of 120 patients (29.2%) assigned to usual oxygen had died (absolute difference, 7 percentage points; 95% CI -4.6 to 18.6% points; P = 0.24; interaction P = 0.35 for sepsis vs. non-sepsis). There were no statistically significant differences between groups for secondary outcomes but point estimates of treatment effects consistently favored usual oxygen therapy.

Conclusions

Point estimates for the treatment effect of conservative oxygen therapy on 90-day mortality raise the possibility of clinically important harm with this intervention in patients with sepsis; however, our post hoc analysis was not powered to detect the effects suggested and our data do not exclude clinically important benefit or harm from conservative oxygen therapy in this patient group.
