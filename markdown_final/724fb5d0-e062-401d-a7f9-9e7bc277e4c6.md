## Question

TIBC of 330, iron of 63 and iron saturation of 19

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret iron studies with TIBC 330 mcg/dL, serum iron 63 mcg/dL, and transferrin saturation 19%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the calculation and whether these values fall within guideline-relevant thresholds. Then, I should verify how clinical context shifts interpretation, especially CKD, heart failure, and inflammatory states. Next, I will integrate ferritin to distinguish absolute from functional iron deficiency. After that, I should apply disease-specific criteria, check for confounders that can distort ferritin or TSAT, formulate the most likely diagnosis and differential, outline management pathways by scenario, and finally set a monitoring plan and safety guardrails, citing contemporary guidelines throughout [^111CX2fR] [^111vEPEQ] [^111Ws2Lt] [^114N2wZa].

> Let me first confirm the arithmetic and basic categorization. TSAT is calculated as serum iron divided by TIBC times 100; 63 divided by 330 is approximately 0.19, that is 19%, which aligns with the reported value, and it sits just below the commonly used 20% threshold adopted in several guidelines to flag iron-restricted erythropoiesis, while the TIBC of 330 mcg/dL lies within typical reference ranges, suggesting no extreme upregulation of transferrin binding capacity at this moment [^111CX2fR] [^114CUyEC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; interpretation hinges on clinical context. In CKD, particularly during ESA therapy, a TSAT below 20% often operationally defines functional iron deficiency and can trigger iron therapy even when ferritin is normal or elevated; in heart failure, low TSAT rather than ferritin predicts benefit from IV iron; in general outpatient evaluation of anemia, ferritin remains the primary discriminator and TSAT supports but does not replace it [^111vEPEQ] [^111CX2fR] [^111Ws2Lt] [^114N2wZa] [^116wrM29].

> I need to check ferritin next, because ferritin is the key marker that separates absolute iron deficiency from functional deficiency, with modern evidence supporting ferritin thresholds around 30 ng/mL for high specificity and the AGA's 45 ng/mL cutoff in patients with anemia; without ferritin, I cannot definitively classify these results beyond saying iron delivery to marrow is suboptimal by TSAT criteria [^116CTNtA] [^114N2wZa] [^116wrM29] [^111vsMJh].

> Let me consider disease-specific diagnostic rules before assigning labels. For CKD and ESA use, TSAT less than 20% with any ferritin can constitute functional iron deficiency, and iron repletion is recommended and monitored at least every three months; ESA labels similarly direct iron supplementation when TSAT is below 20% or ferritin below 100 mcg/L. For heart failure, low TSAT below 20% identifies patients who derive outcome benefits from IV iron, whereas ferritin criteria alone are not predictive of benefit. In primary care anemia workups, confirmed iron deficiency typically pairs low ferritin with anemia thresholds, using TSAT as supportive evidence rather than as a stand-alone diagnostic [^111vEPEQ] [^111CX2fR] [^114R1Kbf] [^116xnrbz] [^117TVcio] [^111Ws2Lt] [^116wrM29].

> But wait, what if confounders are distorting these indices. Ferritin rises with inflammation and liver disease and can mask absolute deficiency, while TSAT can be depressed by inflammation or low transferrin states, especially in CKD; newer markers like reticulocyte hemoglobin content can help in dialysis populations. I was about to say TSAT varies by about five percentage points through the day with higher morning values, but hold on, I should verify that; the evidence shows no consistent diurnal pattern across individuals, so timing alone should not drive interpretation, and between-day variation is similar to within-day variation, which argues for repeating studies if results are borderline or discordant with the clinical picture [^116DvtSE] [^112s7Cr6] [^112SKvHf].

> Let me synthesize what is most likely with the data in hand. With TSAT 19% and iron 63 mcg/dL in the context of a normal TIBC of 330 mcg/dL, this suggests early absolute iron deficiency or functional iron deficiency, depending on ferritin and comorbid inflammation. The normal TIBC does not exclude absolute deficiency, though in more advanced iron deficiency TIBC may increase; I should confirm ferritin and markers of inflammation to resolve this, as misclassification is common if ferritin is interpreted without CRP in inflammatory states [^111vsMJh] [^114CUyEC] [^113ppJQG].

> Next, I should review management pathways conditional on ferritin. If ferritin is below about 30 ng/mL, that supports absolute iron deficiency and a trial of oral iron is appropriate with reassessment for response and investigation for sources of blood loss based on sex and age; if ferritin is 30–100 ng/mL with symptoms or anemia, a therapeutic trial of oral iron and recheck in 4–6 weeks is reasonable; if ferritin is above 100 ng/mL with TSAT 19% in CKD or heart failure or active inflammation, this fits functional deficiency, and IV iron is often favored, particularly in ESA-treated CKD and in symptomatic heart failure where outcome data support benefit at low TSAT [^116CTNtA] [^114N2wZa] [^116wrM29] [^111vEPEQ] [^111Ws2Lt].

> I should confirm condition-specific treatment triggers and safety. ESA labels and KDIGO recommend ensuring iron repletion with TSAT below 20% or ferritin below 100 mcg/L, and to monitor hemoglobin weekly during ESA titration while using the lowest ESA dose that avoids transfusion; in heart failure, low TSAT identifies responders to IV iron, while reliance on ferritin thresholds alone may treat many who are not iron deficient, so TSAT guides best in that setting [^116xnrbz] [^114R1Kbf] [^117TVcio] [^111vEPEQ] [^111Ws2Lt].

> Hold on, I should verify that iron overload is not a concern here. A TSAT of 19% argues strongly against hereditary hemochromatosis or iron overload, which typically presents with TSAT above 45% and frequently much higher; HH evaluations start with fasting TSAT and ferritin when overload is suspected, so at 19% there is no indication to pursue HH workup from these labs alone [^113LCxUQ] [^1111fi8H] [^114A3ihE].

> I will now examine a monitoring plan and guardrails. After starting iron therapy, recheck TSAT and ferritin in 4–6 weeks to assess repletion, and in CKD on ESA therapy reassess at least every three months; monitor hemoglobin weekly during ESA dose changes. I need to ensure TSAT does not overshoot above roughly 50%, because higher TSAT has been linked to adverse outcomes including diabetes and mortality in observational cohorts, warranting dose adjustments or holding iron if parameters rise excessively [^111vEPEQ] [^116xnrbz] [^114p8ta5] [^112feMAD].

> Finalizing the interpretation, TSAT 19% indicates inadequate iron delivery to the marrow and sits at the threshold many guidelines use to define iron-restricted erythropoiesis; this is not diagnostic of absolute deficiency without ferritin, but it supports either early absolute iron deficiency or functional iron deficiency depending on ferritin and inflammation. The immediate next step is to obtain ferritin with CRP and hemoglobin, and then proceed along context-specific pathways: oral iron and source evaluation if absolute deficiency is confirmed, or IV iron if functional deficiency is present in CKD or heart failure, while avoiding unnecessary hemochromatosis workup given the low TSAT [^116CTNtA] [^114N2wZa] [^116wrM29] [^111CX2fR] [^111Ws2Lt].

The combination of **TIBC 330 µg/dL, serum iron 63 µg/dL, and iron saturation 19%** indicates **early iron deficiency** or **functional iron deficiency** [^111vsMJh]. This pattern reflects increased transferrin production (higher TIBC) with low serum iron, resulting in low-normal saturation [^114CUyEC]. Confirm the diagnosis with **ferritin** (expect < 30 µg/L in absolute deficiency) and evaluate for chronic inflammation or CKD if ferritin is normal or elevated [^116CTNtA] [^111CX2fR]. Management includes identifying the cause, **initiating oral iron** if ferritin is low, and **considering IV iron** in CKD or if oral therapy fails [^114CUyEC] [^111vEPEQ].

## Interpretation of laboratory values

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| TIBC | 330 µg/dL | 250–370 µg/dL | High-normal |
| Serum iron | 63 µg/dL | 60–170 µg/dL | Low-normal |
| Iron saturation | 19% | 20–50% | Low-normal |

- **TIBC**: High-normal, indicating increased transferrin production due to low iron stores [^111vsMJh].
- **Serum iron**: Low-normal, suggesting reduced circulating iron [^114CUyEC].
- **Iron saturation**: Low-normal, reflecting reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis [^111CX2fR].

---

## Clinical significance

The pattern suggests **early** or **functional iron deficiency** [^111vsMJh]. Early iron deficiency is characterized by **depleted iron stores** without anemia, with TIBC rising as transferrin increases to capture limited iron [^114CUyEC]. Functional iron deficiency occurs when iron is present but **unavailable for erythropoiesis**, often due to inflammation or CKD [^111CX2fR].

---

## Differentiating absolute and functional iron deficiency

Ferritin helps distinguish absolute from functional deficiency. Absolute iron deficiency is indicated by **ferritin < 30 µg/L** [^116CTNtA], whereas **functional iron deficiency** features normal or elevated ferritin with **TSAT < 20%** [^111CX2fR].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with these findings

- **Early iron deficiency anemia**: Depleted stores without anemia [^111vsMJh].
- **Chronic inflammatory conditions**: CKD, heart failure, IBD, rheumatoid arthritis [^1128644A].
- **Chronic blood loss**: Gastrointestinal or menstrual bleeding [^1149wkcb].
- **Malabsorption syndromes**: Celiac disease, bariatric surgery [^114LkXo9].

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation

- **Confirm iron deficiency**: Measure ferritin; < 30 µg/L indicates absolute deficiency [^114N2wZa] [^116CTNtA].
- **Assess inflammation**: Check CRP/ESR; elevated levels suggest functional deficiency [^1128644A].
- **Evaluate for chronic blood loss**: GI evaluation (endoscopy/colonoscopy) and gynecologic assessment [^114LkXo9] [^116wrM29].
- **Screen for chronic diseases**: CKD, heart failure, IBD, rheumatoid arthritis [^111vsMJh].
- **Consider malabsorption**: Test for celiac disease and review surgical history [^114LkXo9].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**. For **absolute iron deficiency**, use oral iron supplementation and consider IV iron if oral therapy fails or is intolerable [^114CUyEC]. For **functional iron deficiency**, treat the underlying inflammatory condition and consider IV iron, especially in CKD or chronic inflammation [^111CX2fR] [^111vEPEQ].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Iron studies**: Recheck ferritin and TSAT every 3 months during treatment [^111vEPEQ].
- **Hemoglobin**: Monitor for anemia development [^1149wkcb].
- **Clinical response**: Adjust therapy based on response and side effects [^114CUyEC].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

- **Anemia**: Fatigue, weakness, cognitive impairment [^111vsMJh].
- **Impaired immune function**: Increased infection risk.
- **Cardiovascular complications**: Worsening heart failure or CKD outcomes [^111Ws2Lt].
- **Reduced quality of life**: Persistent symptoms and functional impairment [^111vsMJh].

---

## Summary and recommendations

Findings indicate **early or functional iron deficiency**. Confirm with ferritin, assess for inflammation, and identify the underlying cause. Treat with oral or IV iron as appropriate, and monitor response to prevent complications [^111vsMJh].

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically in relation to diagnostic criteria, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend considering a transferrin saturation of less than 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency. This applies to patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, those maintained on peritoneal dialysis, and individuals receiving hemodialysis. It is important to recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as elevated levels may be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

### Consensus statement on the definition and classification of metabolic hyperferritinaemia [^113UwyPT]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia, more specifically with respect to MRI, MHF-CG 2023 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a noninvasive estimation of iron concentration in the liver by MRI in the context of a clinical trial. This recommendation is given due to initial evidence that serum levels of ferritin might be associated with iron accumulation in tissue in patients with stable metabolic hyperferritinemia. It is advisable to obtain this estimation in patients with high serum levels of ferritin (grade 2, but in particular, grade 3) and/or additional clinical risk factors for iron overload. Prefer iron concentration in tissues over serum ferritin levels, when available, for grading metabolic hyperferritinemia.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114LkXo9]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

In the initial clinical assessment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), it is recommended to take a detailed history, as it may provide important clues as to the cause(s) of IDA in the individual case (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). The initial investigation of confirmed IDA should include urinalysis or urine microscopy, screening for coeliac disease (CD), and in appropriate cases, endoscopic examination of the upper and lower GI tract (evidence quality — moderate, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

CD is found in 3%–5% of cases of IDA, and it is recommended that CD should be routinely screened for serologically or on small bowel biopsy at the time of gastroscopy (evidence quality — high, consensus — 84%, statement strength — strong). Age, sex, Hb concentration, and mean cell volume are all independent predictors of the risk of GI cancer in IDA, and need to be considered as part of a holistic risk assessment. It follows that the cancer risk in iron deficiency without anaemia is low (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

There are insufficient grounds at present to recommend faecal immunochemical testing for risk stratification in patients with IDA. The evidence base is evolving rapidly, however, and on that basis, this guidance may therefore change (evidence quality — low, consensus — 100%, statement strength — weak). It is recommended that in men and postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed IDA, gastroscopy and colonoscopy should generally be the first-line GI investigations. In those not suitable for colonoscopy, CT colonography is a reasonable alternative.

### Iron deficiency anemia: Diagnosis and management [^116BQgD7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) remains a universal concern worldwide. This review focuses on articles from the past 18 months, critiquing strategies for diagnosing and managing this prevalent condition.

The medical community continues to lack consensus on the optimal approach for diagnosing and managing IDA. Diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA relies on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations have expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since introducing low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include designing an algorithm inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics. This approach will provide direction in managing IDA and distinguish it from the anemia of chronic disease.

### Retacrit [^114R1Kbf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Important dosing information**: Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require supplemental iron during the course of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating Retacrit. Following the initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

- **Selection of formulation**: In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants, use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Retacrit sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against these risks.

### Elevated transferrin saturation and risk of diabetes: Three population-based studies [^112xGi5M]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Here we demonstrated that transferrin saturation ≥ 50% was associated with a two- to threefold increased risk of developing any form of diabetes, as well as type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes separately. This is the first and largest population-based study that consistently demonstrates transferrin saturation as a risk marker of any form of diabetes, and of type 1 and type 2 diabetes separately, in three independent studies. There was no overlap of individuals between the three studies, thus allowing independent confirmation of findings.

Because the risk of developing diabetes observed in this study increased with the degree of iron overload, for which there is a simple treatment (phlebotomy), 1–3% of diabetes cases in the general population and 7% of cases in a diabetes population likely could be resolved if patients received such treatment earlier in life. This would equal approximately 300 patients per million in Denmark. These findings reinforce the importance of investigating iron overload in the differential diagnosis of secondary causes of diabetes and support arguments in favor of screening for iron overload in the general population.

A health-economic analysis of the cost/benefit ratio of screening for elevated iron saturation in the general or diabetic populations may help to determine the public health consequences of this study (e.g. advice against iron supplements) and whether large prospective intervention studies should be initiated to show causality between elevated transferrin saturation and diabetes.

### Re-evaluation of serum ferritin cut-off values for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in children aged 12–36 months [^112BfSq3]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Determining clinically relevant serum ferritin cut-off values for diagnosing iron deficiency in children aged 1–3 years has been an ongoing challenge. We identified two potential clinically relevant serum ferritin cut-off values based on their association with clinically important hemoglobin cut-offs as an indicator of anemia.

### Worse outcomes of patients with HFE hemochromatosis with persistent increases in transferrin saturation during maintenance therapy [^115KqjNH]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Aims: Even if patients with hemochromatosis maintain low serum levels of ferritin, they still have an increased risk of general and joint symptoms, which reduce quality of life. This could be related to persistently increased transferrin saturation. We assessed whether the duration of exposure to increased transferrin saturation during maintenance therapy is associated with more severe general and joint symptoms.

Methods: We performed a longitudinal cohort study of 266 individuals homozygous for the C282Y substitution in HFE, seen at a tertiary reference center in Rennes, France, and followed for 3 or more years after initial iron removal. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were measured at the same time points; values were used to calculate the duration of exposure to serum ferritin 50 μg/L or more (FRT50exp) and to determine transferrin saturation 50% or greater (SAT50exp). Clinical and biochemical follow-up data were recorded from log books completed during maintenance therapy. The primary outcome was a change in general and joint symptoms, determined from answers to a self-administered questionnaire.

Results: Patients were followed for 13.5 ± 5.9 years. FRT50exp (3.2 ± 3.5 years) and SAT50exp (4.5 ± 3.4 years) values correlated (r = 0.38; P < .0001), but each associated with different variables in multivariate analysis. We found independent associations, regardless of follow-up time, between SAT50exp ≥ 6 years and worsened joint symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 4.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.88–9.31), and between SAT50exp ≥ 6 years and decreased athletic ability.

### Data-driven physiologic thresholds for iron deficiency associated with hematologic decline [^111vFXg5]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency contributes to approximately 50% of anemia prevalence worldwide, but reference intervals for iron status tests are not optimized for anemia diagnosis. To address this limitation, we identified the serum ferritin (SF) thresholds associated with hematologic decline in iron-deficient patients and the SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with hematologic improvement. Paired red blood cell and SF measurements were analyzed from two adult cohorts at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), from 2008–2011 (N = 48,409) and 2016–2018 (N = 10,042).

Inter-patient measurements in the first cohort were used to define optimal SF thresholds based on the physiologic relationship between SF and red cell measurements. Intra-patient measurements (1–26 weeks apart) in the second cohort were used to identify SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with an increase in red cell measurements. The identified optimal SF thresholds varied with age, sex, and red cell measure. Thresholds associated with an approximately 5% decline in red cell index were typically in the range of 10–25 ng/mL.

Thresholds for younger women (18–45 years) were about 5 ng/mL lower than for older women (60–95 years), and approximately 10 ng/mL lower than for men. Thresholds from which a subsequent increase in SF was associated with a concomitant increase in red cell measure showed similar patterns: younger women had lower thresholds (approximately 15 ng/mL) than older women (approximately 25 ng/mL) or men (approximately 35 ng/mL). These results suggest that diagnostic accuracy may be improved by setting different SF thresholds for younger women, older women, and men.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relation to other clinical parameters, including patient history, transferrin saturation, and serum concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST). Additional diagnostic methods include testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration.

We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload, documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices, as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Hepcidin in the diagnosis of iron disorders [^115Rvodh]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

The discovery of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin in 2001 has revolutionized our understanding of iron disorders, and its measurement should advance the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. Although several assays have been developed, a gold standard is still lacking and efforts toward harmonization are ongoing. Nevertheless, promising applications can already be glimpsed, ranging from the use of hepcidin levels for diagnosing iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia to global health applications such as guiding safe iron supplementation in developing countries with a high infection burden.

### Comparison of plasma ferritin concentration with the ratio of plasma transferrin receptor to ferritin in estimating body iron stores: results of 4 intervention trials [^116wctTB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). High credibility.

Efforts to develop global programs for the control of iron deficiency require simple, low-cost, and accurate indicators of iron status.

- **Objective**: We aimed to compare estimates of body iron (BI) stores, as calculated from either plasma ferritin concentration alone (BI-ferritin) or the ratio of plasma transferrin receptor (TfR) to ferritin (BI-TfR/ferritin).

- **Design**: Data were analyzed from four previously completed, randomized intervention trials that enrolled infants, schoolchildren, or pregnant women (total n = 1,189, after excluding subjects with elevated C-reactive protein).

- **Results**: The correlation coefficients between BI-ferritin and BI-TfR/ferritin were greater than 0.95 for all studies. The kappa index ranged from 0.5 to 1.0. All of the sensitivities of BI-ferritin for identifying persons with low iron stores (defined as BI-TfR/ferritin < 0.0.90) were greater than 0.90. All specificities were greater than 0.90, except in the study of pregnant women (specificity = 0.66). The effect sizes of iron intervention trials were significantly greater for change in iron reserves estimated by BI-TfR/ferritin than by BI-ferritin in two studies with larger effect sizes (1.11 compared with 1.00 and 1.56 compared with 1.44, respectively; P < 0.2).

### Assessing iron status: Beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common.

This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): Is too little iron making your patient sick [^112Vtput]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with chronic inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency becomes more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here, I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### The origin of ferritin reference intervals: A systematic review [^116CTNtA]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent condition, contributing to unnecessary morbidity, mortality, and health inequity. A serum ferritin concentration of less than 30 μg/L is highly specific and sensitive for diagnosing iron deficiency in adults. However, the laboratory-reported lower limit of normal (LLN) is typically lower than this value. These LLNs might not be rooted in rigorous scientific evidence, which could contribute to the structural underdiagnosis of iron deficiency. A systematic review was conducted according to systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. This involved using medical literature databases from each database's inception to November 30, 2021, and conducting a grey literature search for the five most common ferritin assays (registration number CRD42022268844).

- **Objectives**: To systematically summarize the ferritin reference intervals and perform a methodological quality assessment of the included studies.

A total of 2306 studies were screened, with 61 full texts included. Out of these, 37 studies were eligible for analysis of the ferritin LLN in the general population, comprising 21,882 females and 23,650 males. The ferritin LLN was a median of 8 μg/L (IQR 5–15) and a mean of 9 μg/L (SD 11) in females, and a median of 25 μg/L (IQR 16–44) and a mean of 25 μg/L (SD 29) in males. Notably, 30 (49%) of the 61 studies did not explicitly screen for patients at risk of iron deficiency, and 32 (52%) did not refer to a reference interval establishment guideline.

### Total mortality by elevated transferrin saturation in patients with diabetes [^114sarHZ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In summary, we found that increased transferrin saturation and genotype C282Y/C282Y predict total mortality in patients with late-onset type 1 diabetes, and increased transferrin saturation after diagnosis is a risk factor independent of HFE genotype. Early measurement of transferrin saturation in these patients, leading to appropriate intervention, improves life expectancy.

### Procrit [^116xnrbz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiating Procrit. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

- **Selection of formulation**: In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered ESAs to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, ESA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Procrit sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Physicians and patients should weigh the possible benefits of decreasing transfusions against the potential risks.

Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

- **Monitoring of response to therapy**: Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc) before initiating Aranesp. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: A call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2023). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin test is the most capable of distinguishing iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories often leads to the underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women have no marrow iron stores, indicating that basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that the physiological ferritin "cutoff" for the body is 50 ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing this readily treatable disorder.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1149wkcb]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

- **Definitions**: We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (e.g. transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong). We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

- **Anaemia**: The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age, and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO-defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines provide further insights.

### Critical re-evaluation of the identification of iron deficiency states and effective iron repletion strategies in patients with chronic heart failure [^111Ws2Lt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). High credibility.

According to guidelines, iron deficiency is defined by a serum ferritin level of less than 100 ng/ml or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) of less than 20% if the serum ferritin level is between 100–299 μg/L. These criteria were developed to encourage the use of intravenous iron as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of renal anemia. However, in patients with heart failure, these criteria are not supported by any pathophysiological or clinical evidence that they identify an absolute or functional iron deficiency state.

A low baseline TSAT, but not the serum ferritin level, appears to be a reliable indicator of the effect of intravenous iron in reducing major heart failure events. In randomized controlled trials, intravenous iron decreased the risk of cardiovascular death or total heart failure hospitalization in patients with a TSAT below 20% (risk ratio 0.67 [0.49–0.92]) but not in patients with a TSAT of 20% or more (risk ratio 0.99 [0.74–1.30]), with the magnitude of the risk reduction being proportional to the severity of hypoferraemia.

Patients who were enrolled in clinical trials solely because they had a serum ferritin level of less than 100 μg/L showed no significant benefit on heart failure outcomes. It is noteworthy that serum ferritin levels of 20–300 μg/L lie entirely within the range of normal values for healthy adults. Guidelines reflect the eligibility criteria of clinical trials, which inadvertently adopted unvalidated criteria to define iron deficiency. Reliance on these guidelines would lead to the treatment of many patients who are not iron deficient.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^115Hgx9N]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning the evaluation for functional iron deficiency, the BCSH 2013 guidelines highlight that there is insufficient evidence regarding the role of hepcidin measurement for the diagnosis of functional iron deficiency.

### Iron deficiency in gastrointestinal oncology [^116XX5vA]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

It is important to differentiate which mechanism is the most significant in a particular patient to guide treatment, as functional iron deficiency (FID), absolute iron deficiency (AID), and iron sequestration can be present in cancer patients.

Serum ferritin is commonly assessed as a reflection of iron stores status, while transferrin saturation at 5% and hemoglobin (Hb) content of reticulocytes (CHr) less than 26 pg reflect the availability of iron in the body. Furthermore, serum ferritin is an acute-phase protein and can be elevated in inflammatory states (e.g. cancer) and liver injury. Hence, normal or elevated ferritin levels in patients with a chronic disease such as cancer do not necessarily indicate sufficient iron stores.

Soluble transferrin receptor levels, which are suggested to differentiate patients needing therapy with iron, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) or the combination, rather reflect the erythropoietic activity than the iron status. These cannot be assessed as iron status parameters when erythropoiesis is stimulated, such as with ESAs.

Recently, a diagnostic plot was suggested for differentiating between the different mechanisms to guide therapy, based on iron stores (reflected as the ratio of soluble transferrin receptor to log ferritin) and iron demand (reflected as Hb content of the reticulocytes). Since the ratio of soluble transferrin receptor to log ferritin and CHr are not routinely measured, the plot is difficult to use in day-to-day clinical practice. In routine clinical practice, serum ferritin levels below 100 ng/mL probably indicate insufficient iron stores in patients with cancer.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency across indications: A systematic review [^116qgPPz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency (ID) vary widely across indications.

- **Objective**: We reviewed all available guidelines on the management of ID worldwide.

- **Design**: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE, as well as in main professional association websites. The search was limited to documents published between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2014.

- **Results**: Of 127 guidelines identified, 29 were selected, involving 29 professional associations. These were issued from the United States (n = 8), Europe (n = 6), Britain (n = 4), Canada (n = 3), international organizations (n = 2), France (n = 2), Poland (n = 1), Australia (n = 1), Mexico (n = 1), and Japan (n = 1).

	- A total of 22 and 27 guidelines provided recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of ID, respectively. All guidelines recommended a concentration for serum ferritin to define ID, with half of them (10 of 22) proposing transferrin saturation (TSAT) as an alternative or complementary diagnostic test.

	- To treat ID, most guidelines (18 of 27) preferentially recommended the oral route if possible, especially for children and women in the pre- or post-pregnancy period. According to 13 of 27 guidelines, iron supplementation should be administered intravenously, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 7) and chemotherapy-induced anemia (n = 5).

	- Treatment targets for ID included an increase in hemoglobin concentrations to 10–12 g/dL or normalization (n = 8) and achieving serum ferritin > 100 μg/L (n = 7) or 200 μg/L (n = 4). For the latter, in some situations, such as CKD, further considerations are necessary.

### Iron deficiency in JAK2 exon12 and JAK2-V617F mutated polycythemia vera [^111Z7958]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Subjects with transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% at diagnosis showed significant differences based on JAK2 mutation types. The severity of iron deficiency differed depending on whether subjects had a JAK2 exon12 mutation or a JAK2 V617F mutation. Subjects with a JAK2 exon12 mutation were more likely to be iron deficient (92% versus 51%; p = 0.006) and had lower serum iron levels (medians, 5.1 versus 11.9 μmol/L; p = 0.002) and ferritin concentrations (medians, 13.9 versus 32.2 ng/mL; p = 0.004) compared to those with JAK2 V617F.

Declined mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were also observed among these patients.

### Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin are main predictors of liver iron content in subjects with hyperferritinemia [^114Zehy4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Hyperferritinemia is widespread and is caused by or associated with a variety of diseases requiring complex diagnostic workup. Magnetic resonance imaging-based liver iron quantification (LIC MRI) can differentiate subjects with iron overload requiring treatment but is still limited to specialized centers and costly. We aimed to determine whether parameters belonging to the diagnostic setting of hyperferritinemia could lead to a more selective use of LIC MRI.

We enrolled a cohort of 570 subjects with hyperferritinemia from a tertiary hospital center. They underwent full clinical and laboratory evaluation and LIC MRI. We applied a partitioning tree to explore which features were relevant in classifying LIC MRI severity from grade 1 to 3.

A total of 66.1% had LIC MRI ≤ 3 mg/g (grade 1), while 11.2% had LIC MRI above 7 mg/g (grade 3). The partitioning tree model showed a global accuracy of 78% (95% confidence interval, 74%-81%) in predicting the severity of LIC MRI in the entire series. Sensitivity and specificity were high to distinguish patients with grade 1 from those with grade 3 but not from patients with grade 2. Focusing on the LIC MRI threshold of 7 mg/g, we found that transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥ 60% and TSAT < 60% with serum ferritin ≥ 963 μg/L correctly classified 61 (95.3%) subjects with grade 3 LIC MRI to class 3. Based on these cutoffs, 193 subjects with LIC MRI grade 1 and 2 were also selected for LIC MRI assessment, while 316 patients (55.4%) would be addressed to follow-up.

TSAT and serum ferritin allow for a more focused allocation of LIC MRI, thereby enhancing the utility in diagnosing hyperferritinemia-related conditions.

### Auryxia [^1112rdsr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:
	- **Iron overload**: Monitor ferritin and TSAT levels. Patients may require a reduction in dose or discontinuation of intravenous iron. Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.

- **Iron overload**:
	- Iron absorption from Auryxia may lead to excessive elevations in iron stores. Increases in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels were observed in clinical trials. In a 56-week safety and efficacy trial evaluating the control of serum phosphate levels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis — where concomitant use of intravenous iron was permitted — 55 (19%) of patients treated with Auryxia had a ferritin level > 1500 ng/mL compared to 13 (9%) of patients treated with active control.

	- Assess iron parameters (e.g. serum ferritin and TSAT) prior to initiating Auryxia and monitor them while on therapy [see Contraindications (4), Overdosage (10), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Patients receiving intravenous iron may require a reduction in dose or discontinuation of intravenous iron therapy.

- **Risk of overdosage in children due to accidental ingestion**:
	- Accidental ingestion and resulting overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age [see Overdosage (10)]. Advise patients of the risks to children and ensure Auryxia is kept out of their reach.

Regarding medical management for hereditary hemochromatosis, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, the BSH 2018 guidelines recommend targeting serum ferritin levels of approximately 20–30 mcg/L and transferrin saturation < 50% with phlebotomy.

### Elevated serum transferrin saturation and mortality [^112feMAD]. Annals of Family Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

A large proportion of US adults have elevated transferrin saturation, an indicator of a predisposition for iron overload. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between elevated serum transferrin saturation and mortality.

- **Methods**: This cohort study was conducted using data from the First Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1 (1971–1974) (NHANES I) merged with the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (1992) (N = 10,714). We used SUDAAN and appropriate weights to make population estimates for the adult US population (aged 25 to 74 years at baseline). All-cause mortality was evaluated in relation to serum transferrin saturation of greater than 45%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, and greater than 60% using Cox proportional hazards regression.

- **Results**: In a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for potential confounders, including comorbid diseases, smoking, and cholesterol, all-cause mortality is significantly greater for persons with a serum transferrin saturation of more than 55%, compared with those with saturations below this cutoff (hazards ratio [HR] = 1.60, 95% confidence interval, 1.17–2.21). No one who died had hemochromatosis as any of the 20 listed causes of death. Many of the underlying causes of death for persons with serum transferrin saturation levels of more than 55% are common causes of death in the general population, although these persons were more likely to have died of cirrhosis and diabetes, a finding consistent with iron overload.

In this nationally representative cohort of adults, those with elevated transferrin saturation showed significant health risks.

### The problem with transferrin saturation as an indicator of iron 'sufficiency' in chronic kidney disease [^113MtQ4x]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

After a brief review of physiological iron metabolism, we describe diagnostic tests for iron status and iron deficiency anemia in patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD) or inflammation. We then review the dysregulation of iron metabolism in CKD. Specific emphasis is placed on the role of the 'inflammatory' state that develops with the progression of CKD. This state causes changes in iron metabolism that are the exact opposite of those occurring during pure iron deficiency. As a result, transferrin saturation (TSAT) becomes a poorer index of iron availability to the bone marrow, and serum ferritin no longer represents iron that can be used during erythropoiesis. We argue that serum iron may provide more information to guide iron therapy than TSAT. In other words, the emphasis on TSAT is misplaced.

With the development of several hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, which restore iron metabolism toward the 'physiologic state', the iron indices indicating sufficient iron availability to avoid functional iron deficiency during therapy of CKD-associated anemia are likely to change. We summarize these changes in the section 'A peek into things to come!', citing the available data.

### A randomized trial of iron deficiency testing strategies in hemodialysis patients [^1111kXdp]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients is limited by the inaccuracy of commonly used tests. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) has shown promise for improved diagnosis in preliminary studies. The purpose of this study was to compare iron management guided by serum ferritin and transferrin saturation to management guided by CHr.

- **Methods**: A total of 157 hemodialysis patients from three centers were randomized to iron management based on serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (group 1) or CHr (group 2). Patients were followed for six months. Treatment with intravenous iron dextran, 100 mg for 10 consecutive treatments, was initiated if serum ferritin was < 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation was < 20% for group 1, or if CHr was < 29 pg for group 2.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference between groups in the final mean hematocrit or epoetin dose. The mean weekly dose of iron dextran was 47.7 ± 35.5 mg in group 1 compared to 22.9 ± 20.5 mg in group 2 (P = 0.02). The final mean serum ferritin was 399.5 ± 247.6 ng/mL in group 1 compared to 304.7 ± 290.6 ng/mL in group 2 (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in final TSAT or CHr. The coefficient of variation was significantly lower for CHr than serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (3.4% vs. 43.6% and 39.5%, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: CHr is a markedly more stable analyte than serum ferritin or transferrin saturation, and iron management based on CHr results in similar hematocrit and epoetin dosing while significantly reducing IV iron exposure.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein, and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein, and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test for iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

- **Search methods**: We searched various databases up to June 10, 2020: DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12 2020, MEDLINE (OVID) from 1946 to June 9, 2020, Embase (OVID) from 1947 to week 23, 2020, CINAHL (Ebsco) from 1982 to June 2020, and Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020. Additional searches included POPLINE, Open Grey, TRoPHI, Bibliomap, IBECS, SCIELO, Global Index Medicus, PAHO, WHOLIS, IndMED, and Native Health Research Database up to specific dates in 2020. We also searched two trial registers and contacted relevant organizations for unpublished studies.

### Diurnal variation of serum iron, iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels [^112SKvHf]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Serum iron levels vary throughout the day; morning levels are generally assumed to be higher than afternoon or evening levels. We studied whether our practice of restricting serum iron collections to the morning was necessary. Serum iron, iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels were determined on blood specimens obtained from 20 healthy adult volunteers at 8 AM, noon, and 4 PM (day 1) and 8 AM (day 2). Although statistically significant differences among mean values for the collection times were observed for iron, iron-binding capacity, and (log) ferritin, no consistent diurnal variation was seen. Morning iron levels were higher than afternoon levels for only half of the subjects. Between-day variation for all four analytes was similar to within-day variation. We conclude that the practice of restricting iron specimen collections to a specific time of day does not improve the reliability of the test result.

### Screening of iron deficiency anaemia in early childhood [^113ppJQG]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

According to the USPSTF review, there is a lack of data evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of other single tests for the detection of iron deficiency, such as serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and CRP. Serum ferritin and CRP are acute phase reactants and should therefore be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation to avoid false positive results. Serum ferritin, however, is considered a useful laboratory measure of iron status, with a low value being diagnostic of iron deficiency.

In 2007, the WHO and the CDC published a report on the assessment of iron status in populations. This document resulted from a consultation that aimed to review and select the best indicators available to assess the iron status of populations and evaluate the impact of interventions to control iron deficiency. The authors reviewed the literature on indicators of iron status, including red blood cell parameters, ferritin, free erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum and plasma iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and serum transferrin receptor, as well as the interpretation of indicators of iron status during an acute phase response. The authors concluded that measurements of serum ferritin and transferrin receptor provide the best approach to measuring the iron status of populations. However, in places where infectious diseases are common, serum ferritin is not a useful indicator because inflammation leads to a rise in the concentration of serum ferritin as a result of the acute phase response to disease.

### Biomarkers of iron metabolism facilitate clinical diagnosis in infection [^113FTbPv]. Thorax (2019). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, substantial efforts have been made to develop novel methods for TB diagnosis. Among them, although IGRA is the most important and widely used immunodiagnostic for TB, it is unable to accurately differentiate TB from LTBI or PN; therefore, IGRA may not be useful in monitoring clinical anti-TB treatment. Based on polychromatic flow cytometry, biomarkers on MTB-specific CD4+ T cells have been identified to effectively discriminate between active TB and LTBI. However, flow-based assays are highly specialized, technical, and complicated processes.

We found that the gold standard assays, AFB and MTB culture, could discriminate TB with 100% specificity, but they showed low sensitivity at 37% (95% CI 34 to 41) and 47% (95% CI 43 to 51), respectively. By contrast, serum iron homeostasis-related biomarkers have good performance for the diagnosis of TB, which can be rapidly and easily determined at low cost using automated equipment. Therefore, in combination with microbiological tests, this new TB diagnostic strategy may improve TB detection rates, particularly in resource-limited, high TB-burden countries.

### Total mortality by elevated transferrin saturation in patients with diabetes [^115mMq1k]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Cohort 1 focused on patients with late-onset type 1 diabetes. Total mortality was increased in patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50% compared to those with < 50%, with an age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio of 2.3 (95% CI 1.3–3.9; P = 0.002) overall and 2.4 (1.3–4.2; P = 0.003) in men (Fig. 1A). The result for women was not significant (Fig. 1A). Mortality due to neoplasms was increased among patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50% compared to those with < 50%, yielding an age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio of 5.8 (2.4–14; P = 0.00007) (Fig. 1B). Notably, two of the seven cases of neoplasms in patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50% were liver cancers, whereas no liver cancers were observed in patients with transferrin saturation < 50% (Fisher exact test, P = 0.003). Mortality due to endocrinological or cardiovascular causes showed no significant differences.

For total mortality in patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50%, there was 80% power to detect hazard ratios of 2.1 overall, 2.3 in men, and 3.7 in women. The study had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 3.6 for neoplasms, 10.0 for liver cancer, 3.5 for endocrinological causes, and 3.6 for circulatory causes.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^117T6jBq]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Although iron-deficiency anemia is common, interpreting iron laboratory test results can be challenging in patients with comorbidities. We aimed to study the accuracy of common iron biomarkers compared with bone marrow iron staining in a large retrospective data set of patients with hematologic disorders. We collected results from 6610 patients (median age, 66 years) concerning ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, transferrin, hemoglobin, and mean red blood cell volume from Helsinki University Hospital electronic health records.

In receiver operating characteristics analysis, ferritin had the highest area under the curve (AUC) with 88% (95% confidence interval, 86–90) for females and 89% (95% CI, 87–91) for males in predicting reduced bone marrow iron. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L resulted in high specificity rates of 97% in females and 99% in males. However, sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. Other studied biomarkers had inferior AUCs.

Multivariate logistic regression models did not significantly perform better in prediction than ferritin alone. With 50% pre-probability for reduced iron stores, a ferritin of 30 μg/L (females) and 51 μg/L (males) had a 95% positive predictive value for reduced iron stores. A 95% negative predictive value was achieved at 1750 μg/L (females) and 4967 μg/L (males). In our large population study, ferritin was the best single biomarker for iron deficiency in secondary care. Adding other blood tests in a multivariate model did not improve performance.

### Transferrin saturation, dietary iron intake, and risk of cancer [^111BdAA2]. Annals of Family Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Transferrin saturation of more than 60% has been identified as a cancer risk factor. It is unclear whether dietary iron intake increases the risk of cancer among individuals with transferrin saturation of less than 60%. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of dietary iron intake and the risk of cancer among adults with increased transferrin saturation.

- **Methods**: Analysis of a cohort study, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study, was performed. US adults (aged 25 to 74 years at baseline) were followed up from baseline in 1971–1974 to 1992 (N = 6,309).

- **Results**: A total of 7.3% of the US population had a serum transferrin saturation of more than 45% at baseline. Intake of dietary iron was essentially uncorrelated with transferrin saturation (r = 0.04). Compared with individuals who had normal serum transferrin saturation and low dietary iron intake, individuals whose serum transferrin saturation was more than 45% and who had high dietary iron intake also had an increased adjusted relative risk of cancer (2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–4.89). Increased risk was not found for individuals with a transferrin saturation of more than 45% but a normal dietary iron intake (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.69–1.49). Transferrin saturation levels could be set as low as 41%, and individuals with high transferrin saturation and high dietary iron intake would still have an increased adjusted relative risk of cancer (hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.04–3.82).

### Best but not perfect: Indirect measure of low iron stores [^1145jGej]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

The other biomarkers studied by the authors demonstrated inferior diagnostic performance compared to ferritin, except for transferrin in females. Multivariate logistic regression models including these biomarkers did not improve the prediction of low or absent bone marrow iron stores over ferritin alone.

The clinical implications of the study are important. The high specificity of ferritin at the 30 μg/L cutoff suggests that it can be a reliable marker for ruling in low or absent iron stores in patients with a high pretest probability of the condition. However, the low sensitivity indicates that clinicians should be cautious in ruling out low or absent iron stores based solely on ferritin levels, particularly in patients with conditions that can elevate ferritin, such as inflammation or liver disease. In such cases, additional diagnostic tests or clinical judgment may be necessary to accurately diagnose low or absent iron stores. We cannot emphasize too strongly that bone marrow aspirate with iron staining is often necessary, as the finding of absent iron necessitates an evaluation that may uncover a gastrointestinal or genitourinary malignancy at an early, curable stage.

The reliability of the bone marrow iron determination depends on the adequacy of the specimen, including the presence of spicules in the aspirate. It would have been beneficial to have specific comments about these factors in this study. Additionally, it would have been valuable to provide their analysis based on the classical definition of iron deficiency, which is the absence of stainable iron in an adequate specimen.

### Total mortality by elevated transferrin saturation in patients with diabetes [^1162QZ4E]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

It is unknown to what extent iron overload predicts prognosis in patients with diabetes after diagnosis or whether iron overload is a risk factor independent of the HFE genotype. We investigated total and cause-specific mortality according to increased transferrin saturation (≥ 50% vs. < 50%), whether mortality is driven by the HFE genotype, and whether early measurement of transferrin saturation helps to predict mortality outcomes.

- **Research design and methods**: Cohort 1 included patients with late-onset type 1 diabetes (n = 716) with a cross-sectional measurement of transferrin saturation and HFE genotype. Cohort 2 included consecutively recruited patients with any diabetes (n = 6,120), transferrin saturation measurement at referral, and HFE genotype if transferrin saturation was above 50%.

- **Results**: In cohort 1, the hazard ratio for total mortality was 2.3 (95% CI 1.3–3.9; P = 0.002) and for cause-specific mortality by neoplasms was 5.8 (2.4–14; P = 0.00007) in patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50% vs. < 50%. Excluding genotypes C282Y/C282Y and C282Y/H63D yielded similar results. The hazard ratio for total mortality was 4.0 (1.2–13; P = 0.01) and for cause-specific mortality by neoplasms was 13 (3.6–49; P = 0.0001) in patients with C282Y/C282Y versus wild type. In cohort 2, total mortality was not different in patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50% vs. < 50%. In patients with late-onset type 1 diabetes and transferrin saturation ≥ 50%, the hazard ratio for total mortality was 0.4 (0.2–0.9; P = 0.03) in cohort 2 versus cohort 1.

### Elevated transferrin saturation and risk of diabetes: three population-based studies [^113ypFjC]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The results indicated that the hazard ratios (HRs; 95% CI) for any form of diabetes in individuals with transferrin saturation of ≥ 50% compared to < 50% were 1.8 (1.4–2.4; P = 0.001) in the CCHS and 1.5 (1.0–2.1; P = 0.03) in the CGPS (Fig. 1A). In the case-control study, the odds ratio (OR; 95% CI) for any form of diabetes in individuals with transferrin saturation of ≥ 50% versus < 50% was 3.3 (2.6–4.2; P = 0.0001). In the combined studies, the OR in the meta-analysis using a random-effects model was 2.1 (1.3–3.4; P = 0.003) for any form of diabetes in those with transferrin saturation ≥ 50% compared to < 50% (Fig. 1A), with statistical heterogeneity being Q = 17 and P = 0.001. The ORs for type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the combined studies under the random-effects model were 2.6 (1.2–5.6; P = 0.01) and 1.7 (1.4–2.1; P = 0.001), respectively, in those with transferrin saturation ≥ 50% versus < 50% (Fig. 1B and 1C). Statistical heterogeneity was Q = 15 and P = 0.001 for type 1 diabetes and Q = 0.7 and P = 0.7 for type 2 diabetes.

- **Figure 1**: Risk of diabetes according to transferrin saturation ≥ 50% vs. < 50% in the CCHS, the CGPS, a case-control study, and combined.
	- A: Any form of diabetes.
	- B: Type 1 diabetes.
	- C: Type 2 diabetes.

The case-control study comprised patients with diabetes from the Steno Diabetes Centre in Copenhagen, and control subjects were ascertained as in the CGPS but from a different sample than those included in the CGPS-only study. Combined, there was no overlap of individuals among these three studies, thus allowing independent confirmation of findings. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are shown.

### Transferrin saturation with intravenous irons: An in vitro study [^111grgB6]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia in chronic kidney disease is commonly treated with one of three intravenous irons: iron dextran, iron sucrose, or iron gluconate. Substantial pharmacologic differences between these drugs exist, yet their ability to saturate transferrin has not been compared. Drugs that may lead to rapid transferrin saturation could result in greater efficacy but also increased toxicity if transferrin-mediated uptake of iron forms the basis of this toxicity.

- **Methods**: We studied the in vitro ability of the three intravenous irons to donate iron to transferrin. Transferrin saturation was analyzed by direct visualization of transferrin bands using urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), along with a functional assay that evaluated the capability of iron to half-saturate transferrin in a dose-dependent (0 to 100 microg/mL) and time-dependent (15 to 180 min) manner. The half-maximal dose (EC(50)) required for transferrin saturation was assessed.

- **Results**: Nondextran irons were found to saturate transferrin in both a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Transferrin saturation occurred more rapidly with iron gluconate compared to iron sucrose. The slope of the EC(50) versus dose iron gluconate titration curve was -0.021 nmol/microg/mL (95% CI -0.025 to -0.017, P 0.2). The least square mean EC(50) computed for mean iron concentration was 5.95 nmol for iron gluconate (95% CI 5.82 to 6.08) and 6.73 nmol for iron sucrose.

### Transferrin as a predictor of survival in cirrhosis [^1173sg3T]. Liver Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with cirrhosis frequently present with high serum ferritin and low transferrin concentrations, reflecting impaired liver function and inflammation. Recent studies have shown that transferrin and its saturation with iron are Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-independent predictors of mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic utility of serum iron parameters in relation to markers of liver function and immune activation.

Clinical, demographic, and biochemical data were retrospectively analyzed from a cohort of 1,255 consecutive patients with cirrhosis (aged ≥ 18 years) who presented from August 1, 2004, until December 31, 2014, at the University Hospital of Innsbruck. Patients with malignancies at diagnosis, including hepatocellular carcinoma, were excluded. Survival analysis was conducted using Cox regression with baseline laboratory parameters, and findings were validated in an independent patient cohort.

During a median follow-up of 2.4 years, 193 deaths occurred, and 254 patients underwent liver transplantation. In patients with transferrin < 180 mg/dL, the 3-month, 1-year, and 5-year transplant-free survival estimates were significantly lower (91.7%, 79.0%, and 30.5%, respectively) compared to patients with transferrin ≥ 180 mg/dL (98.9%, 95.5%, and 68.0%, respectively; P < 0.001). Transferrin predicted transplant-free survival independently of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium (MELD-Na) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in multivariate regression analysis including all patients.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^112s7Cr6]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend viewing a reticulocyte hemoglobin content value of less than 29 pg as predictive of functional iron deficiency in patients receiving ESA therapy and less than 25 pg as suggestive of classical iron deficiency. Additionally, a reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent value of less than 30.6 pg should be viewed as predictive of the likelihood of response to IV iron therapy in patients with CKD on hemodialysis.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: What do we need to know [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous.

There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards, such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF, among non-inflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoffs from 30 years ago do not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity, and were performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes.

### Biomarkers of iron metabolism facilitate clinical diagnosis in infection [^113VYsQK]. Thorax (2019). Low credibility.

Iron is a micronutrient that is important for host and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) metabolism. Pathogenic mycobacteria compete with the host for iron, either by directly depleting intracellular iron from the host cytoplasm or by synthesizing siderophores and macromolecules, including transferrin, ferritin, or lactoferrin, which have high affinity to capture extracellular ferric ion. Anemia, as a result of inflammation caused by MTB infection, is predominantly caused by an iron delivery problem where erythrocyte iron is poorly used and dietary iron is enriched in intestinal enterocytes. This condition is in contrast to iron deficiency-mediated anemia, which is mainly due to malnutrition. Although serum iron levels are low in both types of anemia, other components involved in iron homeostasis are high in anemia due to inflammation, including ferritin and hepcidin, a peptide involved in regulating iron metabolism.

Previous studies have found that serum iron and transferrin concentrations are lower and ferritin levels are higher in patients with tuberculosis (TB) compared with those without TB. These abnormalities in ferritin and transferrin concentration in affected patients typically normalize following treatment. Others have suggested that reduced transferrin levels are associated with the progression of TB at any time point, and higher ferritin and hepcidin levels are associated with a higher risk of early TB progression in household contacts of TB cases. In addition, iron biomarker status can be used as an indicator of treatment failure (low ferritin) and mortality (high ferritin). Finally, low transferrin and ser…

### Higher concentrations of serum iron and transferrin saturation but not serum ferritin are associated with cancer outcomes [^114Uqhwk]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Although the carcinogenic potential of iron has been shown, evidence from observational studies linking serum iron variables and cancer outcomes has been inconsistent. We investigated whether higher iron concentrations increased the risk of cancer outcomes.

A prospective examination of iron biomarkers as independent risk factors for cancer was assessed in 1597 men and 1795 women aged 25–79 years who participated in the 1994/1995 Busselton Health Survey. Participants had relevant data, no history of cancer before the survey, and serum ferritin concentrations ≥ 20 μg/L. Follow-up for incident cancers and death from cancer was available to 2010. Proportional hazards regression modeling was performed to investigate if iron status predicted cancer incidence and mortality.

After adjustments for age, smoking, drinking, anthropometric and biochemical variables, or menopausal status (for breast cancer), higher serum iron concentrations and transferrin saturation were associated with increased risks of incident nonskin cancer [HR for iron: 1.83 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.76; P < 0.01); HR for transferrin saturation: 1.68 (95% CI: 1.18, 2.38; P < 0.01)], including breast cancer [HR for iron: 2.45 (95% CI: 1.12, 5.34; P < 0.05); HR for transferrin saturation: 1.90 (95% CI: 1.02, 3.56; P < 0.05)] in women. Transferrin saturation was also associated with a greater risk of cancer death (HR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.28, 4.82; P < 0.01). In men, higher iron concentrations were associated with reduced risks of incident nonskin cancer (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.99; P < 0.05).

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy.

Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but they should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among women and children from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Central America: A multinational comparative study [^111tZ19f]. The Lancet Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of iron deficiency commonly relies on the measurement of serum ferritin concentrations. WHO guidelines identify serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among healthy individuals as less than 15 μg/L for women and less than 12 μg/L for children under 5 years, based on expert opinion. We report thresholds for iron deficiency for apparently healthy non-pregnant women and young children based on physiological indicators.

- **Methods**: We performed secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from women (aged 15–49 years) and children (aged 6–59 months) from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Central America, using available surveys from 2007 to 2019. Using haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations as individual-level indicators of iron deficiency, we identified country-specific serum ferritin thresholds. We conducted multivariate meta-analysis using individual participant data to assess multinational heterogeneity and inter-country consistency.

- **Findings**: Data were collected from July 2007 to March 2019. A total of 18,251 individuals (13,864 women and 4,387 children) were included in the final analysis. The thresholds of pooled serum ferritin levels corresponding to the starting point of decline in circulating haemoglobin concentrations were 24.8 μg/L (95% CI 24.4–25.2) for women and 22.1 μg/L (20.8–23.4) for children, based on the national survey data from 12 countries. The thresholds were consistent among countries (p heterogeneity: women = 0.73, children = 0.43), but median serum ferritin concentrations and lower 5% reference ranges differed among all countries.

### Iron deficiency in adults: A review [^111vsMJh]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalence varies depending on age, comorbidities (e.g. chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and the severity and rate of development of iron deficiency.

The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia, and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%), and HF (37%-61%).

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^1128644A]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little focus in the guidelines on how iron deficiency in the absence of anemia should be diagnosed in relation to the underlying chronic disease. Thus, it is unsurprising that physicians may not prioritize iron deficiency treatment. Based on the literature available, we propose the following consensus laboratory test cut-off values in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD):

- **Serum ferritin**: < 100 µg/L or TSAT < 20%.
- **If serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg/L**: A TSAT test will be required to confirm iron deficiency.

We also propose algorithms for the diagnostic workup of iron deficiency in patients with CHF, CKD, and IBD. In all conditions, the initial workup should incorporate assessment of serum ferritin, TSAT, and hemoglobin (Hb) levels. This helps distinguish between those with normal hematological parameters, those with some form of iron deficiency (iron deficiency: normal Hb and low iron; iron deficiency anemia: low Hb and low iron), and those with other forms of anemia (where iron levels are normal, but Hb is low).

For CKD patients, we must also consider whether the patient is receiving dialysis. In the case of IBD, it is essential to assess whether the underlying condition is in remission or active. Therefore, we recommend measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) levels or stool markers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin at the time of iron markers and hematological workup. This is crucial to appropriately manage iron deficiency in relation to these results. We recommend a CRP threshold of 5 mg/L.

### Total mortality by elevated transferrin saturation in patients with diabetes [^1175SgEv]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to understand the extent to which iron overload predicts prognosis in patients with diabetes after diagnosis and whether it acts as a risk factor independent of the HFE genotype. The investigation focused on total and cause-specific mortality with increased transferrin saturation (≥ 50% vs. < 50%), examining if mortality is influenced by the HFE genotype, and assessing whether early measurement of transferrin saturation aids in predicting mortality outcomes.

The research design included two cohorts. Cohort 1 consisted of patients with late-onset type 1 diabetes (n = 716) who underwent a cross-sectional measurement of transferrin saturation and HFE genotype. Cohort 2 involved consecutively recruited patients with any type of diabetes (n = 6,120), where transferrin saturation was measured at referral and the HFE genotype was assessed if transferrin saturation exceeded 50%.

Results indicated that in cohort 1, patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50% had a hazard ratio for total mortality of 2.3 (95% CI 1.3–3.9; P = 0.002) and for cause-specific mortality by neoplasms of 5.8 (2.4–14; P = 0.00007). Excluding genotypes C282Y/C282Y and C282Y/H63D yielded similar outcomes. The hazard ratio for total mortality was 4.0 (1.2–13; P = 0.01), while for cause-specific mortality by neoplasms it was 13 (3.6–49; P = 0.0001) in the C282Y/C282Y genotype compared to wild type. In cohort 2, there was no significant difference in total mortality between patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50% and < 50%. Among patients with late-onset type 1 diabetes and transferrin saturation ≥ 50%, the hazard ratio for total mortality was 0.4 (0.2–0.9; P = 0.03) in cohort 2 compared to cohort 1.

In conclusion, increased transferrin saturation appears to impact mortality outcomes in patients with diabetes, although further research is necessary to confirm these findings.

### Biological variability of transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity [^114oBBvu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Transferrin saturation is widely considered the preferred screening test for hemochromatosis. Unsaturated iron-binding capacity has similar performance at lower cost. However, the within-person biological variability of both these tests may limit their ability at commonly used cut points to detect HFE C282Y homozygous patients.

- **Methods**: The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study screened 101,168 primary care participants for iron overload using transferrin saturation, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and HFE C282Y and H63D genotyping. Transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity were performed at initial screening and again when selected participants and controls returned for a clinical examination several months later. A missed case was defined as a C282Y homozygote who had transferrin saturation below the cut point (45% for women, 50% for men) or unsaturated iron-binding capacity above the cut point (150 micromol/L for women, 125 micromol/L for men) at the initial screening or the clinical examination, or both, regardless of serum ferritin.

- **Results**: There were 209 C282Y previously undiagnosed homozygotes with transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity testing performed at the initial screening and clinical examination. Sixty-eight C282Y homozygotes (33%) would have been missed at these transferrin saturation cut points (19 men, 49 women; median serum ferritin level of 170 microg/L; first and third quartiles, 50 and 474 microg/L), and 58 homozygotes (28%) would have been missed at the unsaturated iron-binding capacity cut points.
