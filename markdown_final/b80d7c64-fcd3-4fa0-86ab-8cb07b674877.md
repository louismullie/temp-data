## Question

Most common cause of 1st trimester spontaneous miscarriage:

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most common cause of first-trimester spontaneous miscarriage is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how first-trimester miscarriage is defined and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on etiologies, especially the proportion attributable to fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Next, I will review corroborating data from large cohorts and contemporary genomic studies. After that, I should consider competing causes and why they trail behind. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically useful answer with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. Early pregnancy loss, also called first-trimester miscarriage or spontaneous abortion, is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks' gestation, and it occurs in roughly 10–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, with most losses clustering between 6 and 10 weeks' gestation [^111VneQh] [^115vHndx].

> Now, I need to check the leading etiology. Multiple high-quality sources converge on the same conclusion: fetal chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause of first-trimester miscarriage, accounting for more than two-thirds of losses between 6 and 10 weeks, and about half of all clinically recognized first-trimester miscarriages overall, with autosomal trisomies (notably trisomy 16, 21, 22, and 15) and monosomy X most frequently identified [^113ufhJP] [^111VneQh] [^115vHndx].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude across different datasets so I don't overstate this. ACOG cites approximately 50–82% of early losses due to chromosomal abnormalities, and contemporary genomic studies using advanced methods have shown that when detection sensitivity is improved, the proportion attributable to fetal chromosomal abnormalities can approach or exceed two-thirds, which aligns with the JAMA estimate for 6–10 week losses [^111VneQh] [^11128p3h] [^113ufhJP].

> Hold on, I should also review corroborating cohort evidence. Large observational and clinical series consistently report that about half of first-trimester miscarriages harbor fetal chromosomal abnormalities, reinforcing that genetics is the predominant cause, even though the exact percentage varies with ascertainment and methodology [^1174gGXG] [^1165rFD3].

> Next, I should review competing etiologies to ensure I'm not missing a major contributor. Maternal factors such as uterine anomalies, endocrine disorders, autoimmune conditions like antiphospholipid syndrome, infections, and lifestyle exposures contribute to a minority of first-trimester losses, and paternal or environmental factors play smaller roles compared with fetal chromosomal abnormalities in sporadic cases, which supports the primacy of genetic etiologies in early miscarriage [^111VneQh] [^115ePbjd] [^114jWnGL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought infections might rival genetics, but I should double-check that. While infections such as malaria and possibly COVID-19 in early pregnancy are associated with increased miscarriage risk, these associations do not displace chromosomal abnormalities as the leading cause in aggregate, and the attributable fraction remains lower than that of fetal aneuploidy in first-trimester losses [^114D34Fj] [^115pPDb4] [^113ufhJP].

> I will now examine why chromosomal abnormalities predominate mechanistically. Errors in meiosis during oogenesis and early mitotic divisions in preimplantation embryogenesis lead to aneuploidy and structural variants; most such conceptuses fail to develop beyond early gestation, consistent with a biologic selection model in which only embryos with sufficient genome integrity survive to term, explaining the high proportion of chromosomal causes in early losses [^115vHndx] [^116Emrxo].

> But wait, what if detection bias inflates the genetic fraction? Let me consider that. Traditional karyotyping has limitations including culture failure and maternal contamination, which can underestimate chromosomal abnormalities; newer genome-wide methods increase yield, yet even conventional studies still show roughly 50% chromosomal abnormalities, and advanced methods push that higher, arguing that the true proportion is at least half and likely more in early gestation, not less [^115mbBiu] [^11128p3h] [^111VneQh].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final synthesis. The most common cause of first-trimester spontaneous miscarriage is fetal chromosomal abnormalities, accounting for approximately 50% or more of clinically recognized losses overall and for more than two-thirds of losses between 6 and 10 weeks' gestation, with autosomal trisomies and monosomy X most frequently identified, which is supported by guideline statements, large clinical reviews, and contemporary genomic studies [^111VneQh] [^113ufhJP] [^115vHndx].

---

The most common cause of first-trimester spontaneous miscarriage is **fetal chromosomal abnormalities** [^113ufhJP], accounting for 50–60% of cases [^114jWnGL]. The most frequent are **autosomal trisomies** (notably trisomy 16, 21, 22, and 15) [^111VneQh], monosomy X, and polyploidy [^111VneQh]. These abnormalities typically arise from **non-disjunction during meiosis** [^115vHndx] and are strongly associated with **advanced maternal age** [^111VneQh]. Other causes include maternal factors (endocrine, autoimmune, uterine anomalies) [^111VneQh], infections, and lifestyle factors, but chromosomal abnormalities remain the leading cause [^115vHndx].

---

## Frequency and distribution of chromosomal abnormalities

Chromosomal abnormalities are the **most common cause** of first-trimester miscarriage, accounting for approximately 50–60% of cases [^1165rFD3]. The most frequent abnormalities include:

- **Autosomal trisomies**: Trisomy 16, 21, 22, and 15 are the most commonly observed trisomies in miscarried fetuses [^111VneQh].

- **Monosomy X**: Turner syndrome (45, X) is a frequent cause of early pregnancy loss [^111VneQh].

- **Polyploidy**: Triploidy and tetraploidy are common in early miscarriages [^notfound].

These abnormalities typically result from **errors during meiosis**, such as non-disjunction, leading to aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes) [^115vHndx].

---

## Maternal age and chromosomal abnormalities

Advanced maternal age is a **significant risk factor** for chromosomal abnormalities in early pregnancy loss [^11128p3h]. The risk of miscarriage increases substantially with maternal age, particularly after 35 years, due to the higher incidence of chromosomal errors during oogenesis [^111VneQh]. This correlation between maternal age and chromosomal abnormalities is well-documented and consistent across multiple studies [^115vHndx].

---

## Other causes of first-trimester miscarriage

While chromosomal abnormalities are the leading cause, **other factors contribute** to first-trimester miscarriage:

- **Maternal factors**: Endocrine disorders (e.g. thyroid dysfunction, diabetes), autoimmune diseases (e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome), and uterine anomalies (e.g. septate uterus, fibroids) [^111VneQh] [^115ePbjd].

- **Infections**: Certain infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, and bacterial vaginosis, have been associated with increased miscarriage risk [^111VneQh].

- **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking, alcohol consumption, and exposure to environmental toxins have been linked to higher miscarriage rates [^114jWnGL] [^111VneQh].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Understanding the **predominant role of chromosomal abnormalities** in first-trimester miscarriage has important clinical implications:

- **Genetic counseling**: Couples experiencing recurrent miscarriages may benefit from genetic counseling and chromosomal analysis of fetal tissue to identify underlying genetic factors [^111LoW4A] [^113etCic].

- **Expectant management**: Many early miscarriages resolve spontaneously without intervention, and expectant management is a reasonable option for stable patients [^114YWUGV] [^113ufhJP].

- **Medical and surgical management**: Medical management with misoprostol or surgical evacuation may be considered based on patient preference, clinical presentation, and presence of retained products of conception [^113oAfwx] [^113853mk].

---

Fetal chromosomal abnormalities are the **most common cause of first-trimester spontaneous miscarriage**, accounting for 50–60% of cases [^1165rFD3]. Advanced maternal age significantly increases the risk of chromosomal errors, and other maternal, infectious, and lifestyle factors also contribute to miscarriage risk [^115vHndx] [^111VneQh].

### Which approach for first trimester miscarriage? [^111KME3K]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Around 15% of all known pregnancies miscarry during the first trimester. Historically, first trimester miscarriage was managed surgically to remove all retained products of conception, with the aim of minimising the likelihood of blood loss and infection from retained tissue. Nowadays, medical management (use of drugs such as mifepristone and misoprostol) and expectant management (i.e. allowing the miscarriage to conclude naturally) have become alternatives to a surgical procedure for managing women with early miscarriage. Here, we review the evidence on these three methods to assess the benefits and disadvantages of each.

### Methods for managing miscarriage: a network meta-analysis [^113oAfwx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Miscarriage, defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation, is common with approximately 25% of women experiencing a miscarriage in their lifetime. An estimated 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Miscarriage can lead to serious morbidity, including haemorrhage, infection, and even death, particularly in settings without adequate healthcare provision. Early miscarriages occur during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and can be managed expectantly, medically or surgically. However, there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and risks of each option.

Objectives

To estimate the relative effectiveness and safety profiles for the different management methods for early miscarriage, and to provide rankings of the available methods according to their effectiveness, safety, and side-effect profile using a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (9 February 2021), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (12 February 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness or safety of methods for miscarriage management. Early miscarriage was defined as less than or equal to 14 weeks of gestation, and included missed and incomplete miscarriage. Management of late miscarriages after 14 weeks of gestation (often referred to as intrauterine fetal deaths) was not eligible for inclusion in the review. Cluster- and quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Randomised trials published only as abstracts were eligible if sufficient information could be retrieved. We excluded non-randomised trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We estimated the relative effects and rankings for the primary outcomes of complete miscarriage and composite outcome of death or serious complications. The certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Relative effects for the primary outcomes are reported subgrouped by the type of miscarriage (incomplete and missed miscarriage). We also performed pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analysis to determine the relative effects and rankings of all available methods.

Main Results

Our network meta-analysis included 78 randomised trials involving 17,795 women from 37 countries. Most trials (71/78) were conducted in hospital settings and included women with missed or incomplete miscarriage. Across 158 trial arms, the following methods were used: 51 trial arms (33%) used misoprostol; 50 (32%) used suction aspiration; 26 (16%) used expectant management or placebo; 17 (11%) used dilatation and curettage; 11 (6%) used mifepristone plus misoprostol; and three (2%) used suction aspiration plus cervical preparation. Of these 78 studies, 71 (90%) contributed data in a usable form for meta-analysis. Complete miscarriage Based on the relative effects from the network meta-analysis of 59 trials (12,591 women), we found that five methods may be more effective than expectant management or placebo for achieving a complete miscarriage: · suction aspiration after cervical preparation (risk ratio (RR) 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.20, low-certainty evidence), · dilatation and curettage (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.75, low-certainty evidence), · suction aspiration (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.62, low-certainty evidence), · mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.66, moderate-certainty evidence), · misoprostol (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46, low-certainty evidence). The highest ranked surgical method was suction aspiration after cervical preparation. The highest ranked non-surgical treatment was mifepristone plus misoprostol. All surgical methods were ranked higher than medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Composite outcome of death and serious complications Based on the relative effects from the network meta-analysis of 35 trials (8161 women), we found that four methods with available data were compatible with a wide range of treatment effects compared with expectant management or placebo: · dilatation and curettage (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.06, low-certainty evidence), · suction aspiration (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.32, low-certainty evidence), · misoprostol (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.15, low-certainty evidence), · mifepristone plus misoprostol (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.84, low-certainty evidence). Importantly, no deaths were reported in these studies, thus this composite outcome was entirely composed of serious complications, including blood transfusions, uterine perforations, hysterectomies, and intensive care unit admissions. Expectant management and placebo ranked the lowest when compared with alternative treatment interventions. Subgroup analyses by type of miscarriage (missed or incomplete) agreed with the overall analysis in that surgical methods were the most effective treatment, followed by medical methods and then expectant management or placebo, but there are possible subgroup differences in the effectiveness of the available methods. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on relative effects from the network meta-analysis, all surgical and medical methods for managing a miscarriage may be more effective than expectant management or placebo. Surgical methods were ranked highest for managing a miscarriage, followed by medical methods, which in turn ranked above expectant management or placebo. Expectant management or placebo had the highest chance of serious complications, including the need for unplanned or emergency surgery. A subgroup analysis showed that surgical and medical methods may be more beneficial in women with missed miscarriage compared to women with incomplete miscarriage. Since type of miscarriage (missed and incomplete) appears to be a source of inconsistency and heterogeneity within these data, we acknowledge that the main network meta-analysis may be unreliable. However, we plan to explore this further in future updates and consider the primary analysis as separate networks for missed and incomplete miscarriage.

### Prevalence and clinical, social, and health care predictors of miscarriage [^1174gGXG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous abortion, also known as early pregnancy loss and miscarriage, typically occurs in the first trimester of gestation. Depending on the data source, these losses are estimated to occur in 10–25% of clinically-recognized pregnancies in developed countries. Approximately 50% of early-term miscarriages are attributed to chromosomal abnormalities – "random numeric chromosome errors" – which influences the conventional wisdom that early-term pregnancy losses occur at random, and that all women are at risk. However, other maternal (and sometimes paternal) characteristics have been identified as risk factors, particularly for recurrent miscarriages, including clinical, social, behavioral, and health factors.

Reliable statistics on both the population prevalence and distribution of these losses early in pregnancy are challenging to estimate. The loss may occur before the woman knows she was pregnant and whether a woman seeks medical attention will depend on the accessibility of services, severity of symptoms, and the woman's circumstances. Published estimates range from 5% to 52% of pregnancies, with the bulk of the estimates between 13 and 30%. This variation is due in part to small samples, as well as different populations and time periods under study (e.g. upward trends over time are partly due to to increased awareness of pregnancy). In prospective studies, estimates are affected by the specificity and sensitivity of different methods and assays used to detect pregnancy and when in their menstrual cycle or gestation women are enrolled in the study. Retrospective studies use diagnostic codes to identify miscarriages among hospitalized women and interview data for non-hospitalized women, where recall bias can be a particular challenge. Using existing, population-level data that includes both inpatient and outpatient health care utilization may be a cost-effective way to estimate the prevalence of these events.

### Spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rates per woman among parous women with 1 or more pregnancies of 24 weeks or more [^112fjSy4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this population, 43% of women reported a history of 1 or more recognized spontaneous first trimester miscarriages. If underreporting occurred, perhaps due to denial, forgetfulness, and/or miscarriage mistaken for delayed menstruation, the number of parous women reporting spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rate might approximate 50%. The findings show miscarriage to be widespread. This concurs with current research showing about 50% to 60% of miscarriages are the result of random fetal chromosomal abnormalities incompatible with life.

Advanced maternal age has been documented to be the strongest risk factor for miscarriage, with women over 42 years experiencing 50% miscarriage rates and women aged 45 associated with 75% rates. This was confirmed by our data.

The number of miscarriages per woman increases with parity. Women of higher parity are older than women of lower parity in general, which may explain this association.

Recurrent miscarriage is defined as three or more consecutive miscarriages and is consistently previously reported as affecting 1% of women and was thought to be predictive of high rates of future miscarriage. In contrast to this, 6% of women in this population had three or more recurrent or non-recurrent miscarriages and went on to deliver at least one more child. Regan et al.'s extensive body of work on recurrent miscarriage states: "The most predictive factor for spontaneous abortion is a previous spontaneous abortion. Since the most important predictive factor for spontaneous abortion is a previous spontaneous abortion, the outcome of a woman's first pregnancy has profound consequences for all subsequent pregnancies". Regan's work studies populations of more limited generalizability and ignores maternal age, the most predictive factor for first trimester miscarriage.

### First trimester miscarriage [^1172yTp9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

First trimester miscarriage, or early pregnancy loss, is a common occurrence in the United States. Miscarriage management includes expectant, medical, or surgical approaches. Decisions about management options should be approached through shared decision making between the patient and provider and with consideration of patient's preferences, hemodynamic stability, cost, gestational age, and effectiveness. Emergencies requiring immediate interventions are rare. Newer developments in management, including a more effective medical regimen with the addition of mifepristone and cost-effective and convenient in-office surgical interventions, have expanded treatment options.

### Incidence of pregnancy after expectant, medical, or surgical management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage: long term follow-up of miscarriage treatment (MIST) randomised controlled trial [^114Npm2M]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

For decades the standard treatment of women who experienced an early miscarriage was evacuation of retained products of conception. This was increasingly questioned, and now women are usually offered expectant (watch and wait, no active intervention)and medicalmanagement as well. Trials have suggested that all three methods are probably equivalent in terms of gynaecological infection, including the largest trial, which recruited around 1200 women (the miscarriage treatment (MIST) trial).

Little published evidence, however, has assessed the effect of management method on subsequent fertility — a key issue for women and those responsible for their care. One small trial found no significant difference in subsequent fertility rates up to 24 months after an index miscarriage. We examined subsequent fertility rates in women randomised to the three arms of the larger MIST trial. Our primary aim was to establish if the management method for early miscarriage affects subsequent fertility. We also assessed the effects of age, previous miscarriage, and previous birth history.

### The genetic architecture of sporadic and multiple consecutive miscarriage [^115o8iZF]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Miscarriage is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the spontaneous loss of an embryo or fetus weighing < 500 g, up to 20–22 weeks of gestation. Recurrent miscarriage, which is considered to be a more severe phenotype, is currently defined as two or more miscarriages, although previous definitions also include three or more (consecutive) miscarriages. It is acknowledged that using two miscarriage as the definition of recurrent miscarriage is at least in part to facilitate research, improve shared decision making with patients and provide them psychological support, rather than because of more specific evidence that this defined a unique phenotype, leaving open the question where to draw the line for separating different miscarriage phenotypes from a biological point of view.

Miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy, and the majority of miscarriages, both sporadic or recurrent, happen in the first trimester. Miscarriage is associated with excessive bleeding, infection, anxiety, depression, infertility, and an increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease.

The risk of miscarriage increases with maternal age, and has been associated with a range of causes; embryo and oocyte aneuploidy, parental chromosomal abnormalities, maternal thrombophilias, obesity, and endocrine and immunological dysregulationbut causal underlying factors remain largely unknown. Miscarriage has a genetic component, with most studies focusing on associations of maternal genetic variants with recurrent miscarriage. A recent systematic review illustrates the small sample sizes of these studies (vast majority < 200 cases) and the heterogeneous definition of cases, and as a consequence identified largely inconsistent results.

To discover and map the maternal genetic susceptibility and underlying biology of miscarriage, we combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) results of up to 69,054 cases from different ancestries (European, Chinese, UK South-Asian, UK African, African American, Hispanic American, UK Caribbean) for sporadic miscarriage, and subsequently the results of 750 cases of European ancestry for more severe multiple consecutive miscarriage in the largest genetic study of miscarriage to date. Although there is a continuous discussion on where to draw the line for classifying miscarriages as recurrent, we aimed to capture the more severe end of the phenotypic distribution and to differentiate severe cases from sporadic miscarriage, and potentially identify any differences in the underlying genetic architecture for these two conditions, and thus defined sporadic miscarriage as 1–2 miscarriages and multiple consecutive miscarriage as having had ≥ 3 self-reported consecutive miscarriages, or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnosis code N96 for habitual abortion (Supplementary Note 1).

### Spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rates per woman among parous women with 1 or more pregnancies of 24 weeks or more [^116YcQM2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

43% of parous women experienced at least one spontaneous miscarriage. Miscarriage directly increases with age as well as parity. The more pregnancies, the more miscarriages are experienced. Grand multiparas have both more children and a higher prevalence of miscarriages. Those with 1–5 miscarriages also had an average of 3 living children, those with 6–16 miscarriages, had an average of 4 living children. Parous women until their late 30s, who have experienced multiple miscarriages, can be counseled that if they keep trying, they will likely carry a pregnancy to term.

### Spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rates per woman among parous women with 1 or more pregnancies of 24 weeks or more [^114SotEe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to quantify spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rates per woman among parous women. A vast amount of data has accumulated regarding miscarriage rates per recognized pregnancy as well as about recurrent miscarriage. This is the second study of miscarriage rates per woman in a parous population and the first study of recurrent and non-recurrent, spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rates per woman in a large parous population.

Methods

Extraction of the following variables from all delivery room admissions from both Hadassah Medical Centers in Jerusalem Israel, 2004–2014: # of first trimester spontaneous miscarriages, # live births; # living children; age on admission, pre-pregnancy height and weight, any smoking this pregnancy, any alcohol or drug abuse this pregnancy, blood type, history of ectopic pregnancy, history of cesarean surgery (CS) and use of any fertility treatment(s).

Results

Among 53,479 different women admitted to labor and delivery ward, 43% of women reported having had 1 or more first trimester spontaneous miscarriages; 27% reported having had one, 10% two, 4% three, 1.3% four, 0.6% five and 0.05% reported having 6–16 spontaneous first trimester miscarriages. 18.5% had one or more first trimester miscarriages before their first live birth. Eighty-one percent of women with 11 or more living children experienced one or more first trimester miscarriages. First trimester miscarriage rates rose with increasing age, increasing parity, after previous ectopic pregnancy, after previous cesarean surgery, with any smoking during pregnancy and pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 30.

Conclusions

Miscarriages are common among parous women; 43% of parous women report having experienced one or more first trimester spontaneous miscarriages, rising to 81% among women with 11 or more living children. One in every 17 parous women have three or more miscarriages. Depending on her health, nutrition and lifestyle choices, even a 39 year old parous woman with a history of 3 or more miscarriages has a good chance of carrying a future pregnancy to term but she should act expediently.

### Nomenclature for pregnancy outcomes: time for a change [^111m8Vjz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Traditionally, obstetricians have grouped together all pregnancy losses before the mid-second trimester as spontaneous abortions. However, this nomenclature is arbitrary, outdated, and not clinically useful. Using this system, miscarriages due to genetic abnormalities, fetal deaths associated with abnormal placental growth and development, and spontaneous preterm births of liveborn fetuses at previable gestations are lumped together in a single category. In addition, the term abortion is fraught with emotional connotations for families suffering the loss of a pregnancy. Thus, whereas the existing classification for pregnancy loss has served a somewhat pragmatic role, it ignores precepts of developmental biology and the clinical realities of these adverse pregnancy outcomes. In this article, we propose a more useful nomenclature for pregnancy loss and preterm births that is informative and is based on developmental periods in gestation and shared pathophysiology.

### Genetic causes of sporadic and recurrent miscarriage [^1165rFD3]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 80% of miscarriages happen within the first 12 weeks of gestation. More than half of early losses result from genetic defects, usually presenting as abnormal chromosome numbers or gene rearrangements in the embryo. However, the impact of genetics on pregnancy loss goes well beyond embryonic aneuploidy. For example, the use of big data has recently led to the discovery of specific gene mutations that may be implicated in sporadic and recurrent miscarriages. Further, emerging data suggest that genetic factors play a role in conditions for which there is a causative association with recurrent pregnancy loss. Here, we summarize the evidence on the genetics of miscarriage and provide an overview of the diagnosis and prevention of genetic causes associated with sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss.

### Spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rates per woman among parous women with 1 or more pregnancies of 24 weeks or more [^113erRpY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A search onfor the search words 'recurrent miscarriage' provides 8000 citations regarding the 1% of women who suffer recurrent miscarriage, the phenomenon of 3 or more consecutive first trimester miscarriages. A second search onfor the term 'Miscarriage Rates' reveals a large number of studies on miscarriage rates per pregnancy, establishing that 15% of pregnancies typically recognized after the woman misses her period, either by ultrasound or urine pregnancy test, spontaneously miscarry in the first trimester. The spontaneous miscarriage rate varies between from 10% to 20% where 10% refers to late recognition of pregnancy and 20% refers to research involving routinely testing for pregnancy before 4 weeks or 4 weeks after the last menstrual period.

Computerized patient records, tested for reliability, have been in use at Hadassah Hospital Delivery Rooms since 2004, where about 5000 women deliver per year. The labor and delivery units at Hadassah in Jerusalem admit women of 24 weeks of pregnancy or more. The patient record at Hadassah has separate fields for first trimester spontaneous miscarriage, induced abortion, second trimester spontaneous miscarriage and stillbirth over 500 g. Therefore, this database is equipped to carry out the goal of this study, which was to identify the prevalence of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage per woman in parous women.

### Spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rates per woman among parous women with 1 or more pregnancies of 24 weeks or more [^111deP6P]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The largest study of recurrent miscarriage concluded that 16% of women will miscarry the next pregnancy after their first miscarriage, 25% of women are expected to have a third consecutive miscarriage after 2 miscarriages, and 45% are expected to have a fourth and 54% are expected to have a fifth. The paper admits that 17% of the repeat miscarriages were not repeat miscarriages but re-admissions for diagnostic follow-up testing. Even if their rates were adjusted to accurately reflect the correct numbers as well as ages of the women, this research is only about recurrent miscarriage rates in the Danish population where miscarriage is routinely treated with dilation and curettage. Dilation and curettage could theoretically increase subsequent recurrent miscarriage due to the 25% rate of adhesions left after a single dilation and curettage, the same as after a single cesarean. To date, the influence of the routine use of dilation and suction vacuum aspiration on subsequent spontaneous miscarriage is unknown.

The bulk of published research on recurrent miscarriage concludes that recurrent miscarriage is associated with high rates of subsequent recurrent miscarriage and 'profound consequences' is a possible euphemism for inability to produce a live child. Quite the opposite was found in this study. Recurrent and non-recurrent miscarriage were associated with high parity. Eighty-one percent of women with 11 or more living children experienced one or more first trimester miscarriages. About 7% of grand multiparous women with 5 or more children had 3 or more miscarriages and 2% experienced as many as 5 miscarriages.

The 2 previous studies exploring the rate at which women experienced one or more non recurrent miscarriages are from Sweden. One is a prospective study intending to study 474 non-randomly recruited 'volunteers' to age 29, of unknown generalizability, and 320 non-randomly recruited volunteers up to age 39. Nearly half (48%) of the 794 women were lost to follow up during the study. The second study is a large study group but only concerned with primiparous women. The miscarriage rates in both studies might be artificially lowered by Sweden's induced abortion rate of 20%, since in the absence of induced abortion, spontaneous miscarriage rates are higher.

### Factors associated with fetal karyotype in spontaneous abortion: a case-case study [^1124U2o5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous abortion is a common complication in human reproduction. An estimated 60% of spontaneous abortions occur before or after implantation (termed preclinical losses), while 10–15% are confirmed by ultrasound or histological evidence (termed clinical miscarriage). Most clinical miscarriages occur during the first trimester, and the leading cause of miscarriage is embryonal chromosomal abnormalities. Although parental chromosomal structure abnormalities are the main genetic factor leading to recurrent miscarriages, the prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities in the affected couples is relatively low (2.78–4.1%). Few studies have investigated the parental karyotype of sporadic miscarriage. The frequency of balanced rearrangements in the general population is very low (0.4%).

Apart from inheritable factors, a variety of maternal factors have been found to be related to spontaneous abortion or embryonic chromosomal aberrations, including age, reproductive history, and immune or endocrine dysfunction. In addition, elevated maternal serum level of homocysteine was shown to increase the risk of fetal loss and stillbirth. Supplementation of folic acid can decrease the concentration of homocysteine and reduce the risk of pregnancy loss. Polymorphisms in folate metabolizing genes are associated with chromosome breaks and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy.

Apart from maternal factors, embryonic chromosomal abnormalities may be attributable to abnormal gametogenesis in father. Sperm DNA fragmentation index tends to increase with paternal age. Patients with high levels of sperm DNA damage showed a significantly higher miscarriage rate. Therefore, advanced paternal age may be associated with miscarriage, infertility, and birth defects.

Other non-hereditary factors implicated in embryonic chromosomal aberrations may include environmental factors. Prenatal exposure to environmental factors, such as drugs and pesticides, may increase the risk of birth defects or embryonic DNA damage. While several causes of teratogenesis have been identified, the etiopathogenetic mechanisms are not well characterized. There is a paucity of epidemiological evidence pertaining to the risk factors for embryonic chromosomal aberrations in cases of spontaneous abortion. Miscarriage is a distressing event for the affected women and their families. Therefore, exploring the etiopathogenesis of spontaneous abortion may help inform interventions to protect the developing embryo and prevent miscarriage. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for spontaneous abortions with and without embryonic chromosomal aberrations by investigating the clinical and demographic characteristics of these cases.

### Chromosomal analysis of 262 miscarried conceptuses: a retrospective study [^114bBgiF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of spontaneous abortion is about 10–15% of clinically recognized pregnancies, primarily during the first trimester. It is estimated that approximately 1–5% women will experience two or more consecutive miscarriages. The main causes of spontaneous abortion include: chromosomal abnormality, uterine factors (including congenital uterine malformation, intrauterine adhesions, uterine fibroids, etc.), endocrine disorders, autoimmune diseases, infections, hypercoagulation, environmental factors, sperm factors and unexplained factors. Chromosomal abnormality is the most important cause of spontaneous abortion in early pregnancy and 8–10% of intrauterine fetal death occurring in the second or third trimester are still caused by fetal chromosomal abnormalities, indicating the importance of chromosomal analysis of miscarried products of conception (POCs).

The types of chromosomal abnormalities include numerical abnormalities and structural abnormalities. The majority of chromosomal abnormalities are numerical abnormalities in spontaneous abortion, and the most common chromosomal abnormality is trisomy 16. Chromosomal structural abnormalities account for about 6–10%, including translocation, inversion, deletion, duplication, etc. and chromosomal chimerism accounts for 8%. Accurate cytogenetic identification of a pregnancy loss can provide important information for reproductive counseling. For those patients without chromosomal abnormal fetuses, the treatment should focus on other factors that influence the ongoing pregnancy, such as intrauterine malformations and endocrine diseases.

### Recurrent miscarriage clinics [^115eCF7p]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

A recurrent miscarriage clinic offers specialist investigation and treatment of women with recurrent first- and second-trimester miscarriages. Consultant-led clinics provide a dedicated and focused service to couples who have experienced at least two prior miscarriages. The best treatment strategy for couples with recurrent miscarriage is to discuss a treatment plan for a future pregnancy. Evidence-based up-to-date guidelines are required to reduce ineffective management of recurrent miscarriage couples, including overdiagnostics and underdiagnostics. Scientific research is necessary to study the effectiveness of new interventions, to study patient preferences, and to evaluate health care and costs or other outcomes.

### Progestogen for preventing miscarriage in women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology [^113BDMCw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg. Miscarriage is an early pregnancy loss. For women who have recurrent miscarriage, it has been suggested that a causative factor may be inadequate secretion of progesterone. Therefore, clinicians sometimes use progestogens (drugs that interact with the progesterone receptors), beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage. It is important to understand if this is beneficial or harmful. This is an update of the review, last published in 2019. Previous versions included two trials that have since been retracted. This update included an updated trial search and evaluation of all trials using the Cochrane Trustworthiness Screening Tool.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of progestogens as a preventative therapy against recurrent miscarriage.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2024). We also searched reference lists from relevant articles, attempted to contact trial authors where necessary, and contacted experts in the field for unpublished works.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in pregnant participants comparing progestogens with placebo or no treatment, given in an effort to prevent miscarriage. We included trials of participants who were diagnosed with recurrent miscarriage (usually of unknown origin) and who began treatment with progestogens in the first trimester of pregnancy. We excluded trials treating participants with threatened miscarriage or who had conceived by in-vitro fertilization.

Outcomes

The critical outcome was miscarriage. The main important outcomes were live birth rate and preterm birth (< 37 weeks' gestation). Other important outcomes were neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, stillbirth, low birthweight (< 2500 g), maternal adverse events and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Other maternal outcomes of interest were severity of 'morning sickness', thromboembolic events, depression, admission to special care unit and subsequent fertility.

Risk Of Bias

Two review authors assessed the studies using the RoB 1 tool for selection, performance, detection, attrition, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias.

Synthesis Methods

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Two reviewers assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We utilized a random-effects model to synthesize the results.

Included Studies

Nine trials with 1426 randomized participants met the inclusion criteria. Eight trials included analyzable data for 1276 participants. Overall, the risk of bias was low for six trials, while three had areas of concern. Because few studies reported on important outcomes, imprecision was high for those outcomes, limiting the certainty of those analyses.

Synthesis Of Results

Seven of the included trials compared treatment with placebo and the other two compared progestogen administration with no treatment. The trials were a mix of multicenter and single-center trials, conducted in Jordan, the UK, the Netherlands, and the United States. In three trials, participants had three or more consecutive miscarriages and in six trials, participants had two or more consecutive miscarriages. Route, dosage and duration of progestogen treatment varied across the trials. The majority of trials were at low risk of bias for most domains. Eight trials with 1276 participants contributed data to the analyses. Meta-analysis suggests that there is probably little to no difference in the miscarriage rate for women given progestogen supplementation compared to placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.07; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 1276 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses comparing placebo-controlled versus non-placebo-controlled trials, trials of participants with three or more prior miscarriages compared to women with two or more miscarriages, and different routes of administration showed no clear differences between subgroups for miscarriage. For women with recurrent miscarriage of unclear etiology receiving progestogen, there was probably little to no difference in live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 5 trials, 1063 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on the rate of preterm birth; there was probably little to no difference (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.41; 3 trials, 256 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No clear differences were seen for women receiving progestogen for the other important outcomes, including neonatal death, fetal genital abnormalities, or stillbirth. There was little or no data on other important outcomes of low birth weight, maternal adverse events, teratogenic effects, or admission to a special care unit. None of the trials reported on any other important maternal outcomes, including severity of morning sickness, thromboembolic events, depression, admission to a special care unit, or subsequent fertility.

Authors' Conclusions

For women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage, progestogen supplementation therapy probably results in little to no effect on outcomes in subsequent pregnancies.

### New insights into mechanisms behind miscarriage [^113dzNHa]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Sporadic miscarriage is the most common complication of early pregnancy. Two or three consecutive pregnancy losses is a less common phenomenon, and this is considered a distinct disease entity. Sporadic miscarriages are considered to primarily represent failure of abnormal embryos to progress to viability. Recurrent miscarriage is thought to have multiple etiologies, including parental chromosomal anomalies, maternal thrombophilic disorders, immune dysfunction and various endocrine disturbances. However, none of these conditions is specific to recurrent miscarriage or always associated with repeated early pregnancy loss. In recent years, new theories about the mechanisms behind sporadic and recurrent miscarriage have emerged. Epidemiological and genetic studies suggest a multifactorial background where immunological dysregulation in pregnancy may play a role, as well as lifestyle factors and changes in sperm DNA integrity. Recent experimental evidence has led to the concept that the decidualized endometrium acts as biosensor of embryo quality, which if disrupted, may lead to implantation of embryos destined to miscarry. These new insights into the mechanisms behind miscarriage offer the prospect of novel effective interventions that may prevent this distressing condition.

### Prevalence of chromosomal alterations in first-trimester spontaneous pregnancy loss [^115vHndx]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Worldwide, 23 million pregnancy losses occur every year, with a high prevalence of 10–15% of all clinically recognized pregnancies. Pregnancy loss primarily occurs before weeks 8–9 of gestation, and there is considerable additional loss in earlier stages of pregnancy that may go unnoticed. Overall, 10.8% of women experience at least one pregnancy loss, and 1.9% and 0.7% have two or three pregnancy losses, respectively. Identifying the cause of pregnancy loss can provide important prognostic, diagnostic and management recommendations to support future viable pregnancies. Chromosomal abnormalities, in particular aneuploidy, defined as an incorrect number of chromosomes, in the conceptus are the leading causes of pregnancy losses. It has been established that aneuploidies commonly occur during oogenesis – and in early embryogenesis –. The incidence of chromosomal aneuploidies increases with maternal age, which contributes to age-related infertility. This is due to the low fidelity of chromosome segregation in meiosis during oogenesis, and DNA replication stressduring mitotic cleavage divisions in pre-implantation embryogenesis. Previously, we and others demonstrated that, although chromosome instability (CIN) is common in early embryogenesis, it is not present at birth. This observation indicates that only embryos with sufficient genome integrity can survive to term and that both meiotic aneuploidies in oocytes and post-zygotic chromosome abnormalities in early embryogenesis may lead to implantation failure and pregnancy losses.

### COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and risk of early and late spontaneous miscarriages: a matched case-control population-based study [^115pPDb4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of COVID-19 during the first trimester on the rate of first- and second-trimester miscarriages. Secondary aims include the effect on stillbirths and the correlation between symptom severity and pregnancy outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective matched case-control population-based study extracted data from electronic medical records of a nationwide database of the second largest healthcare organization that provides medical services to over 2000000 patients in Israel. Pregnancy outcomes in COVID-19-positive pregnant patients in 2020 were compared with an age- and gestational-week-matched 1:2 case-control cohort of pre-pandemic pregnant patients that received medical care in 2019.

Results

Of 68485 pregnant women treated in 2020, 2333 were COVID-19-positive during pregnancy: 215 during the first trimester, 791 during the second trimester, and 1327 during the third trimester. We compared these data with the control cohort of 4580 pre-pandemic pregnant patients. The rate of spontaneous miscarriage was significantly higher 146/2187 (6.3%) in COVID-19-positive patients versus 214/4580 (4.7%), (P < 0.01, odds ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.094–1.691). Most miscarriages occurred during the first trimester in both groups, yet the rates were significantly higher in the study group (5.4% vs 3.8%, P < 0.01). There was no association between COVID-19 severity and miscarriage risk.

Conclusion

COVID-19 diagnosis during early pregnancy increased the rate of spontaneous miscarriage in our cohort compared with an age- and gestational-week-matched pre-pandemic control group.

### Spontaneous first trimester miscarriage rates per woman among parous women with 1 or more pregnancies of 24 weeks or more [^111XZoGa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Results

There were 65,541 admissions during the study period. Three hundred fourteen were excluded because they were women who were admitted more than once during the study period, leaving 65,227 women. There were a total of 237,755 documented pregnancies among 65,227 different women, documenting an average of 3.65 pregnancies per woman admitted, including 2.07 living children per woman before the study admission for delivery. Eighteen percent of the 65,541 patient files had a blank field for 'spontaneous miscarriage' meaning either no miscarriages or the field was accidently left empty. Calculations of miscarriage rates were calculated among the 53,479 women for whom a value was entered in the field for 'spontaneous miscarriage'. There were 35,862 miscarriages reported among the 237,755 pregnancies, finding that 15% of the documented pregnancies ended in first trimester miscarriages per pregnancy.

### Common and rare genetic variants predisposing females to unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss [^113hGqtv]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), also referred to as recurrent miscarriage, is a major issue in reproductive medicine, defined as the occurrence of two or more spontaneous losses of pregnancy –. The prevalence of RPL was reported to be approximately 2.6% of all pregnancies worldwide, and most of them occur in the first trimester. Maternal age at conception is a strong risk factor for miscarriage. In developed countries, where the female age at pregnancy has elevated year by year recently, the prevalence of RPL is increasing (e.g. 5.0% in Japan), becoming a topic of growing importance in reproductive health.

The underlying etiology of RPL is considered highly heterogeneous, involving immunologic, anatomic, cytogenetic, endocrinological, and infectious factors. Clinically identifiable causes of RPL include antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), uterine anatomic anomalies, and parental chromosomal abnormalities –. While these established causes account for nearly half of RPL cases, the remaining half show no apparent clinical causes, referred to as unexplained RPL (uRPL). The lack of etiological explanations poses a tough challenge for clinical management and exacerbates the patients' psychological distress. uRPL can be classified into aneuploid and euploid miscarriage according to the embryonic karyotype by examining their aborted products. Aneuploid and euploid miscarriage are different in their epidemiological characteristics and the cumulative live birth rate, indicating distinct underlying biology.

### Outcome of expectant management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage: observational study [^114YWUGV]. BMJ (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the uptake and outcome of expectant management of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage in an early pregnancy assessment unit.

Participants

1096 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of spontaneous first trimester miscarriage.

Methods

Each miscarriage was classified as complete, incomplete, missed, or anembryonic on the basis of ultrasonography. Women who needed treatment were given the choice of expectant management or surgical evacuation of retained products of conception under general anaesthesia. Women undergoing expectant management were checked a few days after transvaginal bleeding had stopped, or they were monitored at weekly intervals for four weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

A complete miscarriage (absence of transvaginal bleeding and endometrial thickness < 15 mm), the number of women completing their miscarriage within each week of management, and complications (excessive pain or transvaginal bleeding necessitating hospital admission or clinical evidence of infection).

Results

Two patients with molar pregnancies were excluded, and 37% of the remainder (408/1094) were classified as having had a complete miscarriage. 70% (478/686) of women with retained products of conception chose expectant management; of these, 27 (6%) were lost to follow up. A successful outcome without surgical intervention was seen in 81% of cases (367/451). The rate of spontaneous completion was 91% (201/221) for those cases classified as incomplete miscarriage, 76% (105/138) for missed miscarriage, and 66% (61/92) for anembryonic pregnancy. 70% of women completed their miscarriage within 14 days of classification (84% for incomplete miscarriage and 52% for missed miscarriage and anembryonic pregnancy).

Conclusions

Most women with retained products of conception chose expectant management. Ultrasonography can be used to advise patients on the likelihood that their miscarriage will complete spontaneously within a given time.

### Management of early pregnancy loss, with a focus on patient centered care [^113fo4Pc]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Early pregnancy loss is the most common complication in pregnancy. Management options for miscarriage include expectant management, medical intervention, or surgical aspiration. Non-surgical and surgical management are all safe and acceptable options for medically uncomplicated patients. Patient and provider preferences contribute profoundly to clinical decisions about miscarriage management. Shared-decision making and evidence based counseling have been shown to significantly improve patient satisfaction with early pregnancy loss care. This review article will discuss the epidemiology and risk factors of early pregnancy loss, current evidence and clinical practice guidelines around management options, and provider and patient preferences for early pregnancy loss management.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 200: early pregnancy loss [^113853mk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Early pregnancy loss, or loss of an intrauterine pregnancy within the first trimester, is encountered commonly in clinical practice. Obstetricians and gynecologists should understand the use of various diagnostic tools to differentiate between viable and nonviable pregnancies and offer the full range of therapeutic options to patients, including expectant, medical, and surgical management. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to review diagnostic approaches and describe options for the management of early pregnancy loss.

### First trimester screening can predict adverse pregnancy outcomes [^1112VDUT]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2014). Low credibility.

There has been an increasing drive over the last two decades to push the detection of women at risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes into the first trimester. This has led to a plethora of techniques, risk assessments and biomarkers, both fascinating and bewildering in its breadth. Despite the vast amount of knowledge available, it is often difficult to determine what is practicable and valuable for clinical practice. This is especially true as earlier diagnosis does not necessarily equate to improved outcomes for mother and child. We suggest that, at least for preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, spontaneous preterm birth and gestational diabetes, there are effective first trimester tests available to identify the women at risk of subsequently developing complications. Unfortunately, there are no currently reliable first trimester tests available for identifying women at risk of stillbirth. It is likely that this field will continue to develop over time, and we hope that new and better strategies will continue to emerge to target these clinically important pathologies.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 200: early pregnancy loss [^111VneQh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on early pregnancy loss:

- **Definition**: Early pregnancy loss is defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks of gestation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The majority of early pregnancy losses are due to chromosomal abnormalities, found in approximately 50–82% of cases. The most common are autosomal trisomies, particularly trisomy 15, 16, 21, and 22, along with triploidy, monosomy X, and structural rearrangements. These losses typically occur between 5 and 9 weeks of gestation. Immunologic factors, such as impaired regulatory T cell function or abnormal endometrial decidualization, can disrupt maternal tolerance of the fetus and contribute to EPL. Infections including CMV, HIV, rubella, and malaria have also been implicated, through direct placental infection, immune-mediated disruption, or maternal systemic illness.
- **Epidemiology**: Early pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 10–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies, with about 80% of losses taking place during the first trimester. The true incidence is likely underestimated, as many early miscarriages are not clinically diagnosed and may be misattributed to delayed or heavy menstrual bleeding.
- **Risk factors**: Advanced maternal age is a major nonmodifiable risk factor for early pregnancy loss, with risk increasing significantly after age 35 and reaching over 50% by age 45. Other maternal factors include a prior history of early pregnancy loss, adverse outcomes in previous pregnancies (such as preterm birth, stillbirth), and Black ethnicity. Structural uterine anomalies, such as septate, bicornuate, or unicornuate uteri, as well as fibroids, endometrial polyps, intrauterine adhesions, and subchorionic hematoma increase the likelihood of early pregnancy loss. Endocrine disorders, particularly poorly controlled diabetes, PCOS, and thyroid disease, are associated with higher rates of early pregnancy loss. Among autoimmune conditions, antiphospholipid syndrome and SLE are most clearly associated with recurrent losses. Modifiable risk factors include extremes in BMI, smoking, alcohol or illicit drug use, certain medications (such as prolonged NSAIDs use around conception), and environmental exposures such as air pollution and pesticides.
- **Disease course**: Early pregnancy loss most commonly presents with vaginal bleeding, pelvic cramping, abdominal pain, or passage of tissue. Bleeding may range from light spotting to heavy flow with clots or tissue and is often accompanied by lower abdominal or pelvic pain. The combination of moderate to heavy bleeding and cramping is strongly associated with early pregnancy loss. While most patients with early pregnancy loss experience symptoms, up to 38% may be asymptomatic, with pregnancy loss detected incidentally by ultrasound. This form, previously termed missed abortion, is now described as an asymptomatic incomplete abortion.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis after early pregnancy loss is generally favorable, with severe complications such as hypovolemic shock and septic miscarriage being rare. Fewer than 5% of patients experience two consecutive losses, and only about 1% have three or more.

### Miscarriage risk assessment: a bioinformatic approach to identifying candidate lethal genes and variants [^1117wxoQ]. Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human reproduction is inefficient, with ~70% of all conceptions not progressing to live birth across different developmental stages (Larsen et al; Tise and Byers). Reproductive failures often happen in the early stages after conception, where approximately 10–30% of embryos stop developing before implantation (Larsen et al; Montjean et al; Tise and Byers). An additional 30% of losses occur after implantation, within 3–4 weeks of gestation, before the pregnancy is even recognized (Larsen et al.). Finally, 10–20% of clinically recognized pregnancies are lost in the first trimester (Larsen et al.). Non-viable conceptions show a range of outcomes. Lethality can occur at various stages of fetal development, leading to outcomes such as early pregnancy loss, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, stillbirth, or death in neonatal or early childhood stages.

Fetal chromosomal abnormalities are associated with 50% of first-trimester miscarriages, while the etiology of pregnancy loss in the remaining 50% of cases with normal karyotype and chromosomal microarray analysis remains unexplained (Hardy and Hardy). Recent exome sequencing studies have begun to uncover deleterious variants in specific genes that cause euploid pregnancy loss (Najafi et al; Rajcan-Separovic; Robbins et al; Workalemahu et al; Xiang et al; Zhao et al.). However, the spectrum of genes associated with human lethality and pregnancy loss remains understudied.

Identifying genes linked to pregnancy losses in humans is challenging. This is mainly due to the lack of large-scale studies that assess pregnancy losses from fertilization to clinical presentation and appropriately categorize these losses. Moreover, damaging variants in some critical genes may affect early stages of development and not be associated with any particular phenotype archived in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] database.

### Prevalence of chromosomal alterations in first-trimester spontaneous pregnancy loss [^1148ZMWm]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, our study shows that as many as two-thirds of all pregnancy losses may be due to fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Furthermore, the ability to accurately determine the segregational and lineage origins of fetal genomic aberrations may enhance the efficacy of human natural and assisted conception and, thereby, improve reproductive genetic care in general.

### A lexicon for first-trimester US: society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference recommendations [^113FADd1]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Early pregnancy loss (EPL) — terminology, categories, and reporting language: "In 2013, sonographic criteria to diagnose first-trimester pregnancies that will not progress were established by an SRU consensus panel", and "The 2013 SRU Consensus Panel diagnostic criteria remain unaltered for the purposes of this lexicon". For classification, "There are five categories in this scenario: (a) IUP with findings that suggest the pregnancy may not progress, (b) IUP with findings that the pregnancy will definitely not progress, (c) GS in the lower endometrial cavity or endocervical canal in the process of expulsion, (d) residual pregnancy tissue or persistent GS, and (e) complete passage of a GS". Regarding patient-centered phrasing, "The alternate terms miscarriage or spontaneous abortion may substitute for EPL in these phrases", and "the panel suggests consideration of a statement in the report that spontaneous abortion is synonymous with miscarriage". Preferred wording changes include: "Concerning for EPL replaces 'suspicious for pregnancy failure'", and "An alternative term is IUP of uncertain prognosis, which replaces the phrase 'IUP of uncertain viability'".

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^114fDRGz]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Early pregnancy loss — confirmation and management states that early pregnancy loss during the first trimester is commonly known as miscarriage or spontaneous abortion; because many are unable to establish prenatal care until after the first trimester, providers of SRH care should be able to identify signs and symptoms of early pregnancy loss and be equipped to provide appropriate treatment or referrals, and all pregnant persons should receive information about signs and symptoms and be given instructions to report concerns for further evaluation; providers can confirm early pregnancy loss by reviewing medical history, identifying signs and symptoms such as vaginal spotting or bleeding with or without pain and bleeding and/or passage of tissue, and/or by conducting a physical exam that may include a pelvic ultrasound and quantitative β-hCG testing; pregnancy loss can be managed expectantly, with medications, or with uterine aspiration, with expectant management essentially "wait and watch" with no medical interventions; persons experiencing pregnancy loss may benefit from additional social support and providers can assess need and refer to appropriate counseling or supportive services.

### Do chromosomally abnormal pregnancies really preclude autoimmune etiologies of spontaneous miscarriages? [^112aHtrq]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

At least 60% of spontaneous pregnancy loss is considered genetic in nature. Miscarriages can, however, also be autoimmune-induced or have other etiologies. Current clinical dogma in rheumatology as well as obstetrics/gynecology holds that evidence of aneuploidy in products of conception establishes the cause of miscarriage and rules out other potential causes, including autoimmunity.

Methods

This communication reviews published evidence in potential support or repudiation of this dogma via a literature search of appropriate keywords via PubMed and Medline.

Results

The literature suggests that maternal autoimmunity, in itself, may increase the risk towards non-dysjunctional events and, therefore, aneuploidy prevalence in abortuses and offspring.

Conclusions

Detection of aneuploidy in products of conception should no longer be considered conclusive evidence of a chromosomally induced miscarriage and that autoimmune evaluations should be withheld. Indeed, an opposite conclusion may have to be reached, suggesting, at least in repeat aborters, careful evaluation of autoimmune status.

### The impact of unexplained spontaneous miscarriage history on cycle outcomes in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization: an analysis of 6535 patients [^115tZ2CR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Miscarriage is a common adverse outcome of pregnancy, with a reported prevalence of 12–15% among clinically recognized pregnancies by 20 weeks of gestation. Recurrent miscarriage, as an important part of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), defined as two or more miscarriages, not necessarily consecutive, represents a significant health problem. The exact incidence of recurrent miscarriage is difficult to estimate and varies widely between reports, but most studies report that RPL affects 1–5% of all couples attempting conception.

Spontaneous miscarriage following spontaneous pregnancy, especially recurrent miscarriage, potentially results from a complex interplay between parental age, genetic, hormonal, immunological, uterine, and environmental factors. These explanations allow for treatment interventions in the following pregnancy. Nonetheless, even after a comprehensive evaluation, a cause for recurrent miscarriage is identified in less than 50% of couples. Empirical treatments are usually recommended for unexplained recurrent miscarriage, including emotional support, nutritional optimization, close monitoring, and ultimately rely on natural conception. Most of these treatments show limited effects and offers little benefit to patients. Therefore, at present, unexplained recurrent miscarriage is a frustrating health problem, without effective treatments to improve the live birth rate.

Moreover, the number of previous spontaneous miscarriages is associated with the increased risk of subsequent pregnancy and perinatal complications, including early abortion, preterm birth, and perinatal death, which may also damage fertility. Therefore, even though the empirical therapies are not well defined for their effectiveness, they are still offered for patients with unexplained miscarriage history. Among them, assisted reproductive technique (ART), mainly referring to in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), usually serves as the most common treatment option. Meanwhile, patients with unexplained miscarriage history sometimes suffered from concurrent secondary infertility, in which IVF-ET becomes the compelling choice.

To date, whether couples with unexplained miscarriage histories can benefit from IVF-ET treatment is still a controversial issue and under a heated debate. Some studies believe that for patients with unexplained miscarriage history, especially for those diagnosed with RPL, IVF-ET treatment alone cannot improve the pregnancy efficiency, and may even prolong the time of the next pregnancy occurrence. Other studies have shown that, although there are some confounding factors, the implementation of IVF-ET treatment can significantly reduce the miscarriage rate. Moreover, the overall reproductive performance of women with unexplained miscarriage histories who have received IVF-ET treatment is unclarified purposefully and waiting for further investigations.

### Safety of artemisinins in first trimester of prospectively followed pregnancies: an observational study [^116PrR4V]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The associations between first-trimester malaria, treatment, and miscarriage remain poorly documented because these events often occur before women present to antenatal care. A single first-trimester malaria episode is associated with miscarriage, and women with first-trimester malaria who are not adequately treated are at high risk of placental malaria. Because women are usually not protected by preventive interventions until the second trimester, early diagnosis and effective treatment of first-trimester malaria are essential to limit the deleterious effects of malaria.

Artemisinin derivatives (hereafter referred to as artemisinins) are the most effective antimalarials available. Artemisinin-based combination therapies are recommended by the WHO for first-line treatment of falciparum malaria, except during the first trimester of pregnancy. Animal studies have raised concerns about the safety of artemisinins in the first trimester, but data for human beings are scarce. In animals, artemisinins are embryotoxic and teratogenic because they deplete embryonic erythroblasts, causing miscarriage and congenital malformations (mainly cardiovascular and skeletal). If artemisinins are also embryotoxic or teratogenic in human beings, the embryo-sensitive period is predicted to be between 6 weeks' and 13 weeks' gestation when erythroblasts are the primary form of circulating red blood cells. Because of these safety concerns, quinine is still recommended for uncomplicated first-trimester falciparum malaria rather than artemisinins, despite being an inferior treatment. Available data for first-trimester artemisinin safety comes from observational studies of inadvertent treatments, which are common but rarely documented. No specific adverse effects have been noted in human beings in 935 documented first-trimester artemisinin treatments (appendix p 1), which although reassuring, has not been sufficient to change treatment recommendations.

### Decreased serum vitamin D levels in early spontaneous pregnancy loss [^11514weg]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pregnancy loss (PL) is an adverse outcome of pregnancy in which conception does not result in a live-born child. Of clinically recognized pregnancies, 10–15% terminate with spontaneous loss. Early pregnancy loss (spontaneous miscarriage) is in China defined as the spontaneous termination of pregnancy before 12 gestational weeks. The great majority of pregnancy losses occur early, before 12 weeks' gestation; hence, the pathophysiology is enough to be of major concern. Several mechanisms have previously been described for the pathogenesis of recurrent PL, including chromosomal anomalies, hormonal problems, uterine abnormalities, infections, autoimmune disorders and thrombophilias, and up to 50% of cases of recurrent PL will not have a clearly defined etiology.

1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D 3 (1,25(OH) 2 D 3) is a lipid-soluble hormone that has well-established classic function in maintaining calcium homeostasis and promoting bone mineralization. In addition, vitamin D 3 has significant roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation and modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. Vitamin D status during pregnancy has been drawing great attention. There is some evidence suggesting that vitamin D modulates human reproductive processes. Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in childbearing age women and pregnant women in China. Poor vitamin D status during pregnancy has been associated with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, bacterial vaginosisand compromised intrauterine growth. However, the relationship of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in the first-trimester pregnancy with PL or non-gravid childbearing aged women with spontaneous pregnancy loss history is less clear. In addition, the vitamin D metabolic pathway involves multiple enzymatic reactions. Vitamin D is metabolized in the liver to the form 25(OH)D, which is used to determine a patient's vitamin D status; 25(OH)D is metabolized in the kidneys by 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha hydroxylase (CYP27B1) to its active form, 1,25-(OH) 2 D. The increased synthesis of 1,25-(OH) 2 D is linked to higher CYP27B1 activity in maternal kidney, placental trophoblasts and decidua. To date, little is known regarding the determinants of the levels of CYP27B1 in serum, nor have possible associations between the levels of the enzymes been explored in relation to PL in the first-trimester pregnancy. To determine whether altered vitamin D metabolic system is present in women with PL, we measured vitamin D and CYP27B1 in pregnant women with PL in the first trimester and non-gravid women displaying failed clinical pregnancy history in the first trimester. The objective of this study was to elucidate the association between maternal serum levels of 25(OH)D and CYP27B1 in the first-trimester pregnancy with the risk of PL in a population of Chinese women. In the same time, serum calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were measured.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^113R17bN]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The majority of miscarriages are sporadic and most result from genetic causes that are greatly influenced by maternal age. Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined by two or more failed clinical pregnancies, and up to 50% of cases of RPL will not have a clearly defined etiology.

### Non-mosaic trisomy 22: a report of 2 cases [^116Jtsd6]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2006). Low credibility.

Non-mosaic trisomy 22 is a common cause of first trimester miscarriage and has a livebirth incidence of 1 in 30,000–50,000. Consequently there is a paucity of information for counselling parents. Detection in the second trimester is rare. It is commonly associated with severe growth retardation and multiple structural abnormalities. Oligohydramnios is frequently seen and can make detection of other abnormalities difficult. The outlook is uniformly poor and survival beyond the first trimester may present management dilemmas. A thorough fetal assessment including high-resolution cytogenetics with or without FISH is required for counselling. Careful plans for intrapartum and neonatal management may be necessary. The recurrence risk is thought to be low but information is very limited as there have been no reported cases of recurrence. We present two case of non-mosaic trisomy 22 including the first to be diagnosed subsequent to investigation for a high serum screening Down's risk.

### Seasonal influenza A (H1N1) infection in early pregnancy and second trimester fetal demise [^116EkEqk]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Increased maternal illness and death appeared in early reports of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Three pregnancy-related complications associated with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were reported in May 2009: 1 postpartum maternal death, 1 preterm birth, and 1 early second trimester (weeks 14–20) loss. In April 2010, a summary of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 among 788 pregnant women demonstrated a disproportionately high risk for death; the rate of spontaneous miscarriage was 1.4%, but details were not provided. Correlating influenza exposure to pregnancy loss is not straightforward because first trimester miscarriage is common, second trimester loss before 24 weeks is not well studied, and viral identification in products of conception has rarely been attempted. We report a second trimester fetal demise that occurred after exposure to seasonal influenza A virus (H1N1) early in pregnancy.

### Assessing the true incidence of mosaicism in preimplantation embryos [^112kEbKK]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Modern technologies applied to the field of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy screening (PGD-A) have improved the ability to identify the presence of mosaicism. Consequently, new questions can now be addressed regarding the potential impact of embryo mosaicism on diagnosis accuracy and the feasibility of considering mosaic embryos for transfer. The frequency of chromosomal mosaicism in products of conception (POCs) of early miscarriages has been reported to be low. Mosaic embryos with an aneuploid inner cell mass are typically lost during the first trimester owing to spontaneous miscarriages. Most of the mosaics in established pregnancies would derive from placental mosaicism or placental aneuploidy, and mosaic embryos with aneuploid inner cell mass should be lost mainly due to first-trimester spontaneous miscarriages. The well described clinical outcomes of live births from mosaic embryos suggest a wide spectrum of phenotypes, from healthy to severely impaired. Therefore, there is a need to balance the risks of discarding a possibly viable embryo with that of transferring an embryo that may ultimately have a lower implantation potential.

Miscarriage is a relatively common occurrence with many knowns and unknowns and a profound psychological impact on individuals and couples. The editors felt it was time to publish a series of overviews for Views and Reviews on both sporadic miscarriage and recurrent miscarriage. The series starts with the prevalence of miscarriage and recurrent miscarriage and subsequently describes the psychological impact, what we know of the genetics, whether uterine natural killer cells may play a role, the association with infections, and potential interventions.

### Pitfalls in first-trimester bleeding [^114F8s7S]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The focus of this article is first-trimester bleeding. Vaginal bleeding during the first 3 months of pregnancy is a common event. It is important that the emergency physicians recognize patients with vaginal bleeding who may have an adverse outcome if misdiagnosed or not treated appropriately in the emergency department. Causes of first-trimester vaginal bleeding include implantation bleeding, spontaneous abortions, ectopic pregnancy, and lesions involving the female reproductive system and perineal area infections.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^112wbRXh]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) — definition, prevalence, and evaluation thresholds — recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a distinct disorder defined by two or more failed clinical pregnancies, while clinically recognized pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 15–25% of pregnancies. It is estimated that fewer than 5% of women will experience two consecutive miscarriages and only 1% experience three or more. For determining whether evaluation for RPL is appropriate, pregnancy is defined as a clinical pregnancy documented by ultrasonography or histopathological examination, and ideally a threshold of three or more losses should be used for epidemiological studies while clinical evaluation may proceed following two first-trimester pregnancy losses. Self-reported losses by patients may not be accurate, and in one study only 71% of self-reported clinical pregnancy losses could be verified in hospital records.

### Serum progesterone distribution in normal pregnancies compared to pregnancies complicated by threatened miscarriage from 5 to 13 weeks gestation: a prospective cohort study [^117HzKit]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Luteal phase deficiency (LPD) is a condition of insufficient progesterone to maintain a normal secretory endometrium and allow for normal embryo implantation and growth. This is one of many etiologies associated with early pregnancy loss. Two mechanisms have been proposed that results in LPD. The first and likely more common cause relates to the impaired function of the corpus luteum resulting in insufficient progesterone and estradiol secretion. The impaired function can be the result of improper development of the dominant follicle destined to become the corpus luteum or aberrant stimulation of a normally developed follicle, leading to deficiencies in progesterone production. The second mechanism suggests an inability of the endometrium to mount a proper response to appropriate estradiol and progesterone exposure.

Apart from LPD, there are other proposed causes of spontaneous miscarriage. More than half of clinically recognized pregnancy loss have been attributed to chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosomal abnormalities could be associated with changes in progesterone levels. Progesterone was shown to be lower in pregnancies with trisomy 13 and trisomy 18. Other causes of spontaneous miscarriage include maternal factors such as infections and maternal disease states.

In women with threatened miscarriage, serum progesterone concentration also increased linearly with gestation, but exhibited a downward displacement of the graph with lower median progesterone levels at every gestation week compared to the low risk group, converging towards the end of the first trimester with similar values at 13 weeks gestation. In women with ongoing pregnancies, vaginal bleeding may be due to disruption of decidual vessels at the maternal-fetal interface.

In the subgroup analysis of women with threatened miscarriage, those who experienced a spontaneous miscarriage at or before 16 weeks gestation have a lower serum progesterone level. Many prior studies have shown that the mean serum progesterone level in non-viable gestations are low, ranging between 6.8–12 ng/ml (21.6–38.2 nmol/L), but very few have described the distribution of progesterone in early pregnancy. Interestingly, we found that in women with spontaneous miscarriage at or before 16 weeks gestation, there was only a marginal increase in serum progesterone across gestations, with much lower serum progesterone levels between 20 nmol/L to 30 nmol/L. Unlike normal pregnancies, serum progesterone did not increase significantly regardless of gestation in women with spontaneous miscarriage.

### Recurrent miscarriage [^112wzZ9u]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Many human conceptions are genetically abnormal and end in miscarriage, which is the commonest complication of pregnancy. Recurrent miscarriage, the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies, affects 1% of couples trying to conceive. It is associated with psychological morbidity, and has often proven to be frustrating for both patient and clinician. A third of women attending specialist clinics are clinically depressed, and one in five have levels of anxiety that are similar to those in psychiatric outpatient populations. Many conventional beliefs about the cause and treatment of women with recurrent miscarriage have not withstood scrutiny, but progress has been made. Research has emphasised the importance of recurrent miscarriage in the range of reproductive failure linking subfertility and late pregnancy complications and has allowed us to reject practice based on anecdotal evidence in favour of evidence-based management.

### New insights into mechanisms behind miscarriage [^113VPUAJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Reproductive failure is a common complication in early pregnancy, with up to two-thirds of all fertilized oocytes not producing live births. Thus, a large number of conceptions either fail to implant or are categorized as biochemical pregnancies and clinical miscarriages. Although, the incidence of karyotypic abnormalities in the parents is low this high rate of early losses is most certainly connected to a high frequency of sporadic karyotypic abnormalities in the products of conception. In couples experiencing RM, however, a parental chromosomal anomaly is found ten times more frequently than in the background population and whether these couples should be offered PGD or await prenatal invasive diagnosis once a spontaneous pregnancy has been established is a matter under debate. Soon, sequencing of the entire fetal genome from free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation will be a standard procedure and will hopefully have the potential to increase our understanding of embryonic causes of both sporadic and RM.

Biomarkers associated with predisposition to thrombophilia or autoimmunity can be found with increased prevalence in women with RM and affect the prognosis negatively, but it is still unclear to what extent anticoagulation and immune modulation therapies can improve pregnancy outcome in these cases. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of genetically determined differences in capacity for hCG production and in markers of sperm DNA damage.

The emerging role of the endometrium as a biosensor of embryo quality, which may be less discerning in some women, also provides a novel mechanism underlying RM that merits further study. Sporadic miscarriage can be seen as representing nature's quality control system, preventing embryos with severe abnormalities in most cases from progressing beyond the peri-implantation period. Should this quality control be disrupted, such embryos may be allowed to establish implantation long enough to present as clinical pregnancy before failing, resulting in recurrent clinical miscarriage. Clearly, if an embryo is of high quality, then having a less selective endometrium will not have clinical consequences, and an ongoing pregnancy may ensue. Consistent with this, most women with RM will achieve an ongoing pregnancy if they persist in trying.

However, other concurrent medical conditions outlined in this article may prevent the ready establishment of ongoing pregnancy. Recent and ongoing research is clarifying the varying mechanisms underlying the very distressing condition of RM and offer new opportunities for developing effective interventions.

### Recurrent pregnancy loss [^115ePbjd]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss is a distressing pregnancy disorder experienced by ~2.5% of women trying to conceive. Recurrent pregnancy loss is defined as the failure of two or more clinically recognized pregnancies before 20–24 weeks of gestation and includes embryonic and fetal losses. The diagnosis of an early pregnancy loss is relatively straightforward, although progress in predicting and preventing recurrent pregnancy loss has been hampered by a lack of standardized definitions, the uncertainties surrounding the pathogenesis and the highly variable clinical presentation. The prognosis for couples with recurrent pregnancy loss is generally good, although the likelihood of a successful pregnancy depends on maternal age and the number of previous losses. Recurrent pregnancy loss can be caused by chromosomal errors, anatomical uterine defects, autoimmune disorders and endometrial dysfunction. Available treatments target the putative risk factors of pregnancy loss, although the effectiveness of many medical interventions is controversial. Regardless of the underlying aetiology, couples require accurate information on their chances of having a baby and appropriate support should be offered to reduce the psychological burden associated with multiple miscarriages. Future research must investigate the pathogenesis of recurrent pregnancy loss and evaluate novel diagnostic tests and treatments in adequately powered clinical trials.

### Building a machine learning-based risk prediction model for second-trimester miscarriage [^112V1KR9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Second-trimester miscarriage (STM) is a common adverse pregnancy outcome. Miscarriages occur in approximately 11–20% of clinical pregnancies, with STM accounting for 2–3% of all pregnancy losses. Miscarriage is undervalued in clinical practice because of its low prevalence. Nevertheless, with the prolongation of pregnancy, the effects of STM on a patient's physical and mental health become more pronounced. Notably, certain early clinical symptoms and pregnancy complications may predict adverse clinical pregnancy outcomes. Current medical technology and research have made some progress in predicting miscarriage using machine learning (ML) models. Most related studies have focused on early miscarriage and premature delivery, with little research on intermediate miscarriage. The risk factors for STMs are not fully known, and new predictive models and approaches must be developed to detect STMs.

Clinical risk prediction models are ubiquitous in many medical domains, and ML algorithms are gaining popularity as alternative approaches for prediction and classification problems. Since there are few studies on ML prediction models for STM, this research aims to establish a visual ML prediction model that can be used to predict the risk of STM.

### The effects of a postmiscarriage menstrual period prior to reconceiving [^115x2dYQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal interpregnancy interval after a single pregnancy loss is controversial. It is common obstetrical practice to recommend that women who have had a miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy should wait for 1 or more menstrual cycles before attempting to conceive again.

Objective

This study aimed to assess whether conception before the first menstrual period after a spontaneous pregnancy loss is associated with a risk of repeat miscarriage or adverse perinatal outcomes.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study included 107 women who had a spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy followed by a subsequent pregnancy with an interpregnancy interval of < 12 weeks. All miscarriages had ended in either spontaneous expulsion of the products of conception or medical or surgical evacuation of the uterus. The perinatal outcome measures of 57 women who conceived after the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage were compared with perinatal outcome measures of 50 women who conceived before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage. The primary outcome was rate of pregnancy loss, and the secondary outcomes were gestational age at delivery and birthweight.

Results

The rate of recurrent miscarriage was 10.4% for women who conceived before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage and 15.8% for those who conceived after (P = 0.604). There were no differences in the gestational age at delivery (38.9 vs 38.7 weeks; p = 0.66) or the birthweight (3347 ± 173 vs 3412 ± 156 g; p = 0.5) between the 2 groups. Other outcomes, such as mode of delivery and 5-minute Apgar score, were also similar for both groups. A multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that conception before the first menstrual period following a spontaneous miscarriage was not associated with a higher incidence of subsequent miscarriage (odds ratio, 1.74; p = 0.46) or any other untoward outcome.

Conclusion

Conception shortly after a spontaneous miscarriage without waiting for at least the first postmiscarriage menstrual period is not associated with adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes compared with those of women with similar interpregnancy intervals who conceived after their next menstrual period.

### New insights into mechanisms behind miscarriage [^1127SBVn]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Mechanisms and reasons for 'physiological' early pregnancy loss

It is a generally accepted assumption that sporadic pregnancy losses occurring before an embryo has developed represent a 'physiological' phenomenon, which prevents conceptions affected by serious structural malformations or chromosomal aberrations incompatible with life from progressing to viability. This concept is supported by clinical studies in which embryoscopy was used to assess fetal morphology prior to removal by uterine evacuation. Fetal malformations were observed in 85% of cases presenting with early clinical miscarriage. The same study also demonstrated that 75% of the fetuses had an abnormal karyotype. Fetal chromosomal aneuploidies arising from non-inherited and non-disjunctional events are common. Indeed, in a recent study using comparative genomic hybridization to study the chromosomal complement of all blastomeres in preimplantation human embryos, more than 90% were found to have at least one chromosomal abnormality in one or more cells. The clinical implications of minor, mosaic and possibly 'transient' aneuploidies remain unclear. However, while most fetuses with severe developmental defects will die in utero some aneuploidies can be compatible with survival to term. The most commonly encountered is trisomy 21, although 80% of affected embryos perish in utero or in the neonatal period. In most cases, the extra chromosome is of maternal origin and caused by a malsegregation event in the first meiotic division. The risk of this increases with maternal age and may be considered to be a biological rather than pathological phenomenon.

Although fetal chromosomal aberrations may be identified in 29% to 60% of cases in women with RM, the incidence decreases as the number of miscarriages increases suggesting other mechanisms as a cause of the miscarriage in RM couples with multiple losses.

In the near future diagnostic tests on fetal genetic material isolated from maternal plasma will be a routine procedure and probably substitute chorion villus sampling and amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis of fetal genetic diseases. Today, cell-free fetal DNA can be isolated from the maternal circulation from 7 weeks of gestation, and numerous studies have already been published where next generation sequencing techniques have been applied to detect fetal aneuploidies in cell-free fetal DNA. Since it will soon be possible to sequence the entire fetal genome from free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation, new insights will be achieved in relation to both chromosomal abnormalities and single gene disorders as a cause of sporadic and recurrent miscarriage.

### Pregnancy outcomes after first-trimester treatment with artemisinin derivatives versus non-artemisinin antimalarials: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^114MBEwz]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Participant eligibility, definition of exposure, and comparison groups

Women enrolled in included studies during pregnancy (ie, before pregnancy outcome was known) were included in the analysis. Pregnancies were excluded if data on the estimated gestational age (EGA) were missing, the fetus was confirmed to be unviable at enrolment, or exposure information was incomplete. Multiple gestation pregnancies (eg, twins) were also excluded as they have a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes than singleton pregnancies. Women were included on the basis of their exposure to antimalarials regardless of confirmation of malaria infection, malaria species, or disease severity. The baseline characteristics (ie, age, gravidity, parity, previous history of miscarriage or stillbirth, height, bodyweight, marital status, HIV status, smoking status, drinking habits, literacy, education, and IPTp doses received) and calendar year were extracted at the individual level. Country, and calendar year if year was not available at the individual level, was extracted at the study level.

Pregnancies were categorised as being exposed to ABT, exposed to non-ABT, or neither (ie, unexposed). Only exposures confirmed by at least one written medical record or multiple data sources were included. Pregnancies with unconfirmed exposures were excluded to avoid potential misclassification of exposure. Two exposure risk periods were defined: the entire first trimester (EGA from ≥ 2 weeks and 0 days to < 14 weeks and 0 days) or the putative embryo-sensitive period (EGA from ≥ 6 weeks and 0 days to < 13 weeks and 0 days). Ethics approval was not required for this analysis.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite of either miscarriage (spontaneous fetal loss before EGA 28 weeks), stillbirth (fetal loss at or after EGA 28 weeks), or major congenital anomalies. Secondary outcomes included miscarriage, stillbirth, fetal loss (ie, miscarriage or stillbirth), and major congenital anomalies. The rationale for the use of a composite primary outcome was to assess the overall embryotoxicity and fetal toxicity of the artemisinins shown in animals, which resulted in either pregnancy loss or major congenital anomalies among livebirths, and to account for the competing nature of these outcomes. Major congenital anomalies were defined as any structural anomaly deemed to be of surgical, medical, or cosmetic importance at birth, detected by surface examination of livebirths by trained birth attendants (appendix p 2). Congenital anomalies with a suspected genetic cause (identified with the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, code Q90–99) were excluded.

### Association of past Chlamydia trachomatis infection with miscarriage [^1165kry6]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

First-trimester miscarriages are commonly associated with chromosomal abnormality of the embryo (approximately 50% of cases). However, 15% of first-trimester and 66% of second-trimester miscarriages are attributed to reproductive tract infections. It has been suggested that Chlamydia trachomatis is a causative organism, but its association with miscarriage is inconsistently reported. This difference of opinion likely reflects the poor performance of major outer membrane protein (MOMP) peptide-based serology assays and the inability of nucleic acid amplification tests (which detect current infection) to detect previous exposure. It is now possible to accurately measure lifetime exposure to C trachomatis using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects antibodies to the chlamydial plasmid-encoded protein Pgp3. This ELISA is more sensitive (73.8%) and specific (97.6%) than commercial ELISAs, including the Medac MOMP-peptide ELISA, or previous serological antibody tests. Pgp3 is unique to C trachomatis, eliminating cross-reactivity with antibodies to C pneumoniae infection (a common respiratory pathogen), a major weakness of previous serological tests. The aim of this study was to provide an estimation of the association of previous C trachomatis infection with the risk of spontaneous first-trimester miscarriage.

### New insights into mechanisms behind miscarriage [^112MR2M1]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Epidemiology of sporadic and recurrent miscarriage

Human reproduction is characterized by its inefficiency. Prospective cohort studies using sensitive and specific daily urinary hCG assays in women trying to conceive have demonstrated that only around one-third of conceptions progress to a live birth. An estimated 30% of human conceptions are lost prior to implantation and a further 30% following implantation but before the missed menstrual period, that is in the third or fourth week of gestation. These are often termed preclinical losses (Figure 1). Finally, the incidence of early clinical pregnancy loss is estimated to be 15% of conceptions with a significant variation according to age. Thus, the incidence ranges from 10% in women aged 20 to 24 years to 51% in women aged 40 to 44 years. Late losses between 12 and 22 weeks occur less frequently and constitute around 4% of pregnancy outcomes.

Figure 1
The pregnancy loss iceberg: an overview of the outcome of spontaneous human conceptions. It is estimated that 70% of conceptions are lost prior to live birth. The majority of these losses occur prior to implantation or before the missed menstrual period, and since they are not revealed to the woman they are termed preclinical. In the pregnancy loss 'iceberg', they are therefore below the 'waterline'. Figure reproduced with permission from Oxford University Press.

Compared to sporadic miscarriage the prevalence of RM is considerably lower irrespective of whether biochemical losses are included or not. If only clinical miscarriages are included the prevalence is 0.8% to 1.4%. If, however, biochemical losses are included the prevalence is estimated to be as high as 2% to 3%. Since the incidence of RM is greater than would be predicted by chance, it is considered to represent a disease entity defined by a series of events, with a number of possible etiologies.

### Safety of artemisinins in first trimester of prospectively followed pregnancies: an observational study [^113f79op]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

Assessment of the safety of artemisinin derivatives requires weighing the risks of falciparum malaria against those of its treatment. We noted that first-trimester falciparum malaria increases the risk of miscarriage, especially after recurrence. However, there was no evidence that first-line treatment with an artemisinin derivative in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of miscarriage or congenital malformations compared with first-line quinine, which is currently recommended by the WHO. We compared first-line treatment with an artemisinin derivative with first-line quinine in women with first-trimester falciparum malaria in an area of low seasonal transmission, and accounted for confounding by indication and disease severity, thereby separating the effects of infection from the effects of treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to estimate the association between recurrent first-trimester malaria and miscarriage, and contributes a further 183 documented first-trimester artemisinin treatments. Left truncation, which adjusts for the temporally changing risks of miscarriage and varying gestation at presentation, was also accounted for and is essential to avoid significant bias.

Implications of all the available evidence

Effective treatment of first-trimester falciparum malaria is imperative. Our results add to a growing body of observational evidence that artemisinins, the most effective antimalarials available, are safe in the first trimester of pregnancy.

### Prevalence of chromosomal alterations in first-trimester spontaneous pregnancy loss [^115mbBiu]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The conventional karyotyping of POCs being applied in routine care is limited by its low resolution, contamination from maternal cells, high culture failure rates and overgrowth of (maternal) normal cells compared to abnormal cells, leading to low diagnostic yield. The quality also varies between samples and laboratories and is reliant on the expertise of technicians and cytogeneticists. Previously, we and others showed that low proliferative activity of extra-embryonic cells in vitro is a major limitation of conventional karyotyping of spontaneous pregnancy losses. Specifically, conventional cytogenetic analysis of miscarriages strongly depends on tissue culturing and is associated with a substantial culture failure rate, which varies from 5% to 42% in different laboratories –. This suggests that the use of sophisticated genome analysis methods that use DNA samples and do not require cell culturing in pregnancy loss samples carry clear advantages. Genome haplarithmisis can detect low-grade mosaicism (> 10%) from uncultured samples (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Methods) with higher resolution and allows for the detection of smaller subchromosomal CNVs (> 100 kb) (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Additionally, it can detect the parental and segregational origins of aberrations and maternal cell contamination(Fig. 2d and Extended Data Figs. 6 and 7). These features are well beyond the sensitivity of conventional methods, such as karyotyping and standard chromosomal microarray-based or sequencing-based copy number analyses that are being performed in routine care. There is an emerging need for prospective clinical studies comparing genome haplarithmisis with conventional methods to evaluate its clinical implementation and cost-effectiveness for management of pregnancy loss. The guidelines of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in RPL restated the limitation of conventional karyotyping and underscored the importance of future studies that explore the role of next-generation sequencing techniques. A strategy using genetic analysis of miscarriage tissue could help patients deal with the psychological impact of pregnancy loss and would limit the need for further expensive and elaborate maternal investigations for other causes of RPL.

### Construction of machine learning tools to predict threatened miscarriage in the first trimester based on AEA, progesterone and β-hCG in China: a multicentre, observational, case-control study [^1128sYZy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Miscarriage is a common complication in early pregnancy, occurring in around 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies, and approximately 11% women will experience threatened miscarriage. Threatened miscarriage is diagnosed by vaginal bleeding with or without abdominal pain. Surprisingly, 50% pregnancies with threatened miscarriage had an inevitable miscarriage.

Progesterone (P4) is secreted by the corpus luteum during pregnancy, which is essential at various stages of pregnancy. The deficiency of P4 in early pregnancy is associated with an increased miscarriage risk. Therefore, P4 supplementation has been used as a treatment for threatened miscarriage to prevent spontaneous pregnancy loss.

Human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) is a glycoprotein secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast. Recent studies demonstrated that the concentration of serum β-hCG in early pregnancy can predict pregnancy outcome. The serum β-hCG increased rapidly in the early stage of pregnancy and showed a linear increase in peak approximately 8 to 10 weeks of the pregnancy, and declined rapidly a few weeks before delivery.

Recent animal studies suggest that endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) is pivotal for both blastocyst development and endometrium implantation, and low AEA levels enhances implantation success. AEA is synthesized by N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) and binds both cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). AEA can be regulated by the enzyme named fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which metabolizes AEA into arachidonic acid (AA) and ethanolamine. Studies indicated that women with spontaneous or threatened miscarriage are associated with high AEA levels and low FAAH expression. The plasma AEA levels in women with threatened miscarriage are higher in those who subsequently spontaneously miscarried than in those who had live births. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a reliable early warning method for threatened miscarriage that could lead to early intervention and treatment for threatened miscarriage.

In this study, we recruited 119 normal pregnancy women in their first trimester and 96 women with threatened miscarriage including 58 cases with ongoing pregnancy and 38 cases with inevitable miscarriage. We aim to use machine learning tools combining the level of AEA, P4 and β-hCG to predict the risk of threatened miscarriage.

### Safety of artemisinins in first trimester of prospectively followed pregnancies: an observational study [^114SXy57]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Artemisinins, the most effective antimalarials available, are not recommended for falciparum malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy because of safety concerns. Therefore, quinine is used despite its poor effectiveness. Assessing artemisinin safety requires weighing the risks of malaria and its treatment. We aimed to assess the effect of first-trimester malaria and artemisinin treatment on miscarriage and major congenital malformations.

Methods

In this observational study, we assessed data from antenatal clinics on the Thai–Myanmar border between Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 2013. We included women who presented to antenatal clinics during their first trimester with a viable fetus. Women were screened for malaria, and data on malaria, antimalarial treatment, and birth outcomes were collected. The relationship between artemisinin treatments (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, or artemether) and miscarriage or malformation was assessed using Cox regression with left-truncation and time-varying exposures.

Findings

Of 55 636 pregnancies registered between 1994 and 2013, 25 485 pregnancies were analysed for first-trimester malaria and miscarriage, in which 2558 (10%) had first-trimester malaria. The hazard of miscarriage increased 1·61-fold after an initial first-trimester falciparum episode (95% CI 1·32–1·97; p < 0·0001), 3·24-fold following falciparum recurrence (2·24–4·68; p < 0·0001), and 2·44-fold (1·01–5·88; p = 0·0473) following recurrent symptomatic vivax malaria. No difference was noted in miscarriage in first-line falciparum treatments with artemisinin (n = 183) versus quinine (n = 842; HR 0·78 [95% CI 0·45–1·34]; p = 0·3645) or in risk of major congenital malformations (two [2%] of 109 [95% CI 0·22–6·47] versus eight (1%) of 641 [0·54–2·44], respectively).

Interpretation

First-trimester falciparum and vivax malaria both increase the risk of miscarriage. We noted no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or of major congenital malformations associated with first-line treatment with an artemisinin derivative compared with quinine. In view of the low efficacy of quinine and wide availability of highly effective artemisinin-based combination therapies, it is time to reconsider first-trimester antimalarial treatment recommendations.

### Influence of surgical evacuation on pregnancy outcomes of subsequent embryo transfer cycle following miscarriage in an initial IVF cycle: a retrospective cohort study [^115sSZKU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Miscarriage is defined as a spontaneous loss of an intrauterine pregnancy before the fetus is able to survive independently. First trimester miscarriage is defined as ≤ 12 weeks gestation of miscarriage. The occurrence of miscarriage was 10–20% in natural pregnant women, with 80% of pregnancy losses occurring in the first trimester. Studies had shown that the rate of miscarriage among in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) pregnant women was similar to that of natural pregnant women. A study showed that the miscarriage rate was 14.7% in 62,228 clinical pregnancies after IVF treatment in 1996–1998 in USA, which decreased to 9.5% in 2015. A retrospective cohort study of 112,549 IVF cycles during 1999–2008 in the UK showed the miscarriage rate was 8.3%.

Studies showed that miscarriage might have adverse effects on subsequent pregnancy. The outcome of an initial pregnancy seemed to have an important influence on the whole subsequent reproductive outcomes. The treatment methods of miscarriage may also impact subsequent pregnancies. The managements of miscarriage usually contain expectant management, medical evacuation and surgical evacuation. For many years, the standard management of early pregnancy loss was dilatation and curettage (D&C). In recent years, vacuum aspiration or suction curettage had also been commonly used in miscarriage management. It is difficult to fully distinguish these techniques in clinical practice, as curettage and aspiration techniques are commonly used in conjunction. Surgical evacuation may associated with complications such as bleeding, infection, endometrium trauma, intrauterine adhesions, scarring and perforation of the uterus. A study reported that surgical evacuation could lead to reduction of endometrium. And there were some studies showed that endometrium thickness was associated with pregnancy outcomes. However, the influence of surgical evacuation on pregnancy outcome remains controversial.

### Adverse effects of falciparum and vivax malaria and the safety of antimalarial treatment in early pregnancy: a population-based study [^114D34Fj]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

Our results show that a single episode of symptomatic or asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria can cause miscarriage. Adverse effects related to treatment were not seen with quinine, chloroquine, or artesunate but the numbers available for the artesunate group are small. A randomised trial of first-trimester artemisinin-based treatment is now needed to make firm recommendations on the safety of first-trimester malaria treatments with this class of antimalarial drug.

Malaria in the first trimester was associated with miscarriage, and the association is likely to be causal. Risk of miscarriage was higher for women with symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria than it was for women who did not have malaria in the first trimester (table 3). The odds were similar with P falciparum and P vivax. Thus both vivax and falciparum malaria contribute significantly to avoidable fetal and infant death. This finding emphasises the importance of early detection of malaria and prompt effective treatment for all pregnant women. The comparably increased odds of miscarriage in non-malaria febrile illnesses suggest a pathogenic role of fever and proinflammatory responses, while the increased risk of abortion with asymptomatic malaria suggests a more malaria-specific pathological process.

A single successfully treated episode of malaria in the first trimester without later infection did not significantly affect birthweight. This suggests either a minimal effect of first-trimester infections on fetal growth or an efficient recovery during the remaining gestation. Later in pregnancy, the importance of malaria-specific pathogenic processes such as those related to placental cytoadherence presumably increases. Nevertheless, these findings have serious implications for malaria treatment and prevention policies, which currently ignore the first trimester. Early detection and treatment will reduce the effects of symptomatic malaria on miscarriage but only prevention can eliminate the increased risk of miscarriage in women with asymptomatic disease. Preventive options are limited, especially in terms of effective and safe prophylaxis. Symptomatic malaria infections are less common in areas of high transmission, where women have greater immunity than in areas of low transmission, but the increased risk of miscarriage with asymptomatic malaria is of major concern because the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia in such areas is very high. Prospective studies in high-transmission settings are needed to assess these risks.

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^113nfw1y]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Based on published reports, and methotrexate's mechanism of action, methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman [see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In pregnant women with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis, Rasuvo is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. There are no animal data that meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

Published data from cases, literature reviews, and observational studies report that methotrexate exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death. Methotrexate exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of spontaneous abortions and multiple adverse developmental outcomes, including skull anomalies, facial dysmorphism, central nervous system abnormalities, limb abnormalities, and sometimes cardiac anomalies and intellectual impairment. Adverse outcomes associated with exposure during second and third trimesters of pregnancy include intrauterine growth restriction and functional abnormalities. Because methotrexate is widely distributed and persists in the body for a prolonged period, there is a potential risk to the fetus from preconception methotrexate exposure.

A prospective multicenter study evaluated pregnancy outcomes in women taking methotrexate less than or equal to 30 mg/week after conception. The rate of miscarriage in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate was 42.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 29.2–58.7), which was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (22.5%, 95% CI 16.8–29.7) and unexposed patients with non-autoimmune disease (17.3%, 95% CI 13–22.8). Of the live births, the rate of major birth defects in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate after conception was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.8 [95% CI 0.6–5.7]) and unexposed patients with non-autoimmune disease (adjusted OR 3.1 [95% CI 1.03–9.5]) (2.9%). Major birth defects associated with pregnancies exposed to methotrexate after conception were not always consistent with methotrexate-associated adverse developmental outcomes.

### Late miscarriage and stillbirth in asymptomatic and symptomatic hospitalised pregnant women in Belgium during the first and second waves of COVID-19: a prospective nationwide population-based study [^1147ocm6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The risk of late miscarriage or stillbirth was increased in SARS-CoV-2 infected women, compared to the general population during the same period. Some of the IUFD can be attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, but sometimes it was difficult to assess the causal linkage, especially when the placental examination was missing.

We observed a low rate of early miscarriages in our cohort. Most women who experience a first-trimester miscarriage will not be hospitalized, and thus not included in the registry, which underestimates the risk associated with the infection. A recent prospective cohort study that analysed, by self-reporting, the rate of miscarriage in pregnant women showed a, not statistically significant, higher risk in the infection group, compared to non-infected women (relative risk 1.7, 95% CI 1.0–3.0).

### Ultrasound assessment of premenopausal bleeding [^112JZyLc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Vaginal bleeding is the most common cause of emergency care in the first trimester of pregnancy and accounts for the majority of premenopausal bleeding cases. Ultrasound evaluation combined with a quantitative beta human chorionic gonadotropin test is an established diagnostic tool to assess these patients. Spontaneous abortion because of genetic abnormalities is the most common cause of vaginal bleeding; ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease are other important causes and in all patients presenting with first trimester bleeding, ectopic pregnancy should be suspected and excluded, as it is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. A thorough knowledge of the normal sonographic appearance of intrauterine gestation is essential to understand the manifestations of an abnormal gestation. Arteriovenous malformation of the uterus is a rare but important cause of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester, as it has to be differentiated from the more common retained products of conception, with which it is often mistaken.

Obstetrical and gynecological conditions — differential diagnosis outlines hallmark presentations and timing for abruptio placenta, placenta previa, ectopic pregnancy, and spontaneous abortion. Abruptio placenta "Most frequently occurs in third trimester of pregnancy; placenta prematurely separates from the uterus causing intrauterine bleeding", with features including "Lower abdominal pain, uterine rigidity (often not present until abruption is advanced)", that "Vaginal bleeding – this symptom may not occur in cases of concealed abruption", and possible "Shock, with minimal or no vaginal bleeding". Placenta previa is described as "placenta covers part or all of the cervical opening", occurring "Generally, late second or third trimester" with "Painless vaginal bleeding, unless in active labor". Ectopic pregnancy is "First trimester" with "Abdominal/pelvic pain with or without minimal bleeding" and that "Shock is possible even with minimal or no vaginal bleeding". Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is "Generally, first trimester" with "Intermittent pelvic pain (uterine contractions) with vaginal bleeding/passage of clots or tissue".

### Pre-pregnancy lifestyle characteristics and risk of miscarriage: the Australian longitudinal study on women's health [^114jWnGL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk of miscarriage is about 12–15% in recognized pregnancies. It is estimated that between 50 and 60% of miscarriages are due to genetic abnormalities. Less is known about the contribution of modifiable lifestyle characteristics in relation to the risk of miscarriage. This is important to clarify, to understand whether targeted interventions before pregnancy aimed at specific lifestyle factors could reduce the likelihood of miscarriage.

A recent meta-analysis of 25 studies supported a higher mean body-mass index (BMI) (adjusted difference 0.7 kg 2 /m; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.3) among women with a history of recurrent miscarriage (n = 3822) compared to controls (n = 4083). Furthermore, evidence from 30 cohort studies (265,760 women) support a positive association between both obesity (relative risk (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 1.15, 1.27) and underweight (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05, 1.11) with risk of miscarriage, highlighting the possibility of a nonlinear relationship between BMI and miscarriage risk. A meta-analysis of 50 studies (> 2 million women) also suggested a modest increased risk of miscarriage among women who were active smokers during pregnancy (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.16, 1.30). Another meta-analysis of 24 studies (231,808 women) indicated that women who consumed alcohol during first trimester had an increased risk of miscarriage (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12, 1.28).

### Second trimester pregnancy loss [^112HduLe]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Second trimester pregnancy loss is uncommon, but it should be regarded as an important event in a woman's obstetric history. Fetal abnormalities, including chromosomal problems, and maternal anatomic factors, immunologic factors, infection, and thrombophilia should be considered; however, a cause-and-effect relationship may be difficult to establish. A thorough history and physical examination should include inquiries about previous pregnancy loss. Laboratory tests may identify treatable etiologies. Although there is limited evidence that specific interventions improve outcomes, management of contributing maternal factors (e.g., smoking, substance abuse) is essential. Preventive measures, including vaccination and folic acid supplementation, are recommended regardless of risk. Management of associated chromosomal factors requires consultation with a genetic counselor or obstetrician. The family physician can play an important role in helping the patient and her family cope with the emotional aspects of pregnancy loss.

### Recurrent pemphigoid gestationis in the setting of first-trimester spontaneous abortions [^116VFN84]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

PG is generally regarded as a disease of a second and third trimester of pregnancy, unlikely to be associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality aside from prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction. Herein we present a unique case of a recurrent PG developing in the first trimester of pregnancy in association with a concurrent pregnancy loss. While onset in the first trimester has been reported in 16% to 31% of patients with PG, association between PG and pregnancy loss is not well-recognized. A 2020 systematic review of 109 articles including 140 PG patients, demonstrated a total of 7 spontaneous abortions and 1 stillbirth. Another study of 87 patients with PG (278 total pregnancies) demonstrated a much higher rate of spontaneous abortions at 16%. Importantly, of 44 spontaneous abortions, 34 (77.3%) occurred in the first trimester. Our case report adds to this growing body of evidence suggesting that PG may carry a higher risk of pregnancy loss than previously thought, especially when it develops in the first trimester of pregnancy. It has been suggested that placental insufficiency caused by antibody deposition within the chorionic villi may play a pathogenic role in poor fetal outcomes. It is plausible that early onset of PG in the first trimester of pregnancy leads to a more severe placental insufficiency and more serious fetal complications including spontaneous abortion. In any case, it is important to consider additional causes for first trimester spontaneous abortions, including the role of advanced maternal age in our case. Future studies are needed to clarify the association between PG and first trimester spontaneous abortions among other physiologic and pathologic factors.

### Mid-trimester pregnancy loss [^115rLopb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Mid-trimester pregnancy loss (MTL) occurs between 12 and 24 weeks' gestation. The true incidence of this pregnancy complication is unknown, because research into MTL in isolation is scarce, although the estimated incidence has been noted to be 2% to 3% of pregnancies. A comprehensive preconceptual screening protocol is recommended, because the cause for an MTL may be present in isolation or combined (dual pathology), and is often heterogeneous. Patients with a history of MTL are at an increased risk of future miscarriage and preterm delivery. This risk is increased further depending on the number of associative factors diagnosed.

### Prevalence of chromosomal alterations in first-trimester spontaneous pregnancy loss [^112VjGZW]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Even though CIN is common in early embryogenesis and leads to mosaic embryos carrying both chromosomally normal and abnormal cells, the abnormal cells are not predominantly present at birth. However, the effect of post-zygotic CIN on first-trimester prenatal development is not clear. In this study, we carried out parallel analysis of extra-embryonic mesoderm and chorionic villi samples from the same POCs, increasing the diagnostic yield of detecting genomic aberrations. Strikingly, mosaicism tended to be higher in extra-embryonic mesoderm relative to chorionic villi, which again suggests persistent involvement of abnormal fetal cells in pregnancy loss. Over 90% of pregnancy losses occur during the first trimester. Chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus are recognized as a primary cause of pregnancy loss. Previously, eight large studies (> 1,000 POC sample size, in total 42,500 POCs) showed a combined yield of approximately 53.7% fetal chromosomal abnormalities – (Supplementary Table 3), which is in line with the 53.1% reported rate in a recent meta-analysis. The study that applied high-density SNP arrays reported a higher yield of 67%, which is similar to what we found here, in the present study, after genome haplarithmisis. Thus, haplarithmisis gives a superior yield over karyotyping or standard microarray approach. In addition, six previous studies analyzed POCs that were classified as normal with conventional karyotyping – (Supplementary Table 4). The average frequency of additionally detected abnormalities found in these studies was 19.4%, which is nearly two-fold lower than the 35.1% identified in the present study. This difference can be explained by two major factors. First, the previous studies relied on single POC tissue analysis, primarily chorionic villi or placenta. Second, the conventional cytogenetic methods, including microarrays, are unable to distinguish the meiotic and mitotic origins of genomic aberrations and detect low-level mosaicism. Here we demonstrate that these shortcomings can be tackled using genome haplarithmisis.

### Recurrent pregnancy loss: evaluation and treatment [^113etCic]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a multifactorial condition. Approximately half of patients with RPL will have no explanation for their miscarriages. De novo chromosome abnormalities are common in sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss. Testing for embryonic abnormalities can provide an explanation for the miscarriage in many cases and prognostic information. Regardless of the cause of RPL, patients should be reassured that the prognosis for live birth with an evidence-based approach is excellent for most patients. The authors review current evidence for the evaluation and treatment of RPL and explore the proposed use of newer technology for patients with RPL.

### Prevalence of chromosomal alterations in first-trimester spontaneous pregnancy loss [^11128p3h]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Pregnancy loss is often caused by chromosomal abnormalities of the conceptus. The prevalence of these abnormalities and the allocation of (ab)normal cells in embryonic and placental lineages during intrauterine development remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed 1,745 spontaneous pregnancy losses and found that roughly half (50.4%) of the products of conception (POCs) were karyotypically abnormal, with maternal and paternal age independently contributing to the increased genomic aberration rate. We applied genome haplarithmisis to a subset of 94 pregnancy losses with normal parental and POC karyotypes. Genotyping of parental DNA as well as POC extra-embryonic mesoderm and chorionic villi DNA, representing embryonic and trophoblastic tissues, enabled characterization of the genomic landscape of both lineages. Of these pregnancy losses, 35.1% had chromosomal aberrations not previously detected by karyotyping, increasing the rate of aberrations of pregnancy losses to 67.8% by extrapolation. In contrast to viable pregnancies where mosaic chromosomal abnormalities are often restricted to chorionic villi, such as confined placental mosaicism, we found a higher degree of mosaic chromosomal imbalances in extra-embryonic mesoderm rather than chorionic villi. Our results stress the importance of scrutinizing the full allelic architecture of genomic abnormalities in pregnancy loss to improve clinical management and basic research of this devastating condition.

### First-trimester abortion in women with medical conditions: release date October 2012 SFP guideline # 20122 [^113djbqE]. Contraception (2012). Medium credibility.

First-trimester abortion epidemiology and safety in the United States show high volume and low mortality, with in 2005–2008 approximately 1.2 million abortions performed annually and in 1998–2005 a mortality rate related to induced abortion of 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions compared with a pregnancy-associated mortality rate of 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. More than 60% of abortions are performed at ≤ 8 weeks and more than 90% at ≤ 13 weeks gestation, and these data reflect the safety of first-trimester abortion, particularly in comparison with childbirth, and the general good health of the patient population. Little published research addresses the frequency or safety of abortion in women with medical problems; in one large survey, 12% of women reported a problem with their health as a reason for abortion, and the leading reasons for abortion-related mortality in the first trimester are infection, anesthesia complications, hemorrhage and embolism, with cardiac events accounting for 17% of first-trimester abortion-related deaths.

### Association between first-trimester vaginal bleeding and miscarriage [^112zUSiF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the strength of association between first-trimester bleeding and miscarriage, setting aside bleeding at time of loss.

Methods

Women enrolled in a community-based pregnancy cohort study before or during early pregnancy. Detailed first-trimester bleeding data were collected by telephone interview. Bleeding episodes proximal to miscarriage (within 4 days) were excluded. We used discrete-time hazard models to evaluate the association between bleeding and miscarriage. Models were adjusted for maternal age, prior miscarriage, and smoking. Exploratory regression tree analysis was used to evaluate the relative importance of other bleeding characteristics (duration, associated pain, color, timing).

Results

Of the 4,510 participants, 1,204 (27%) reported some first-trimester vaginal bleeding or spotting, and 517 miscarriages were observed. Eight percent of those with bleeding reported heavy bleeding episodes. When we evaluated any bleeding, including episodes of only spotting, the unadjusted relative odds ratio (OR) of miscarriage for women with bleeding (n = 1,204) was 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–1.3). However, women who reported heavy bleeding (n = 97) had nearly three times the risk of miscarriage compared with women without bleeding during the first trimester (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.9–4.6). Adjustment for covariates had little effect on estimates. Further analyses suggested that women with heavy bleeding accompanied by pain were the group accounting for most of the elevated risk.

Conclusion

Heavy bleeding in the first trimester, particularly when accompanied by pain, is associated with higher risk of miscarriage. Spotting and light episodes are not, especially if lasting only 1–2 days.

### New insights into mechanisms behind miscarriage [^1148kSHd]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Karyotypic disorders

A chromosomal abnormality in one partner is found in 3% to 6% of RM couples, which is ten times higher than the background population. The most commonly encountered abnormalities include balanced translocations and inversions that do not have any consequences for the phenotype of the carrier, but in pregnancy there is a 50% risk of a fetus with an unbalanced chromosomal abnormality that can result in a miscarriage. This risk is influenced by the size and the genetic content of the rearranged chromosomal segments. Whether or not to screen couples with RM for chromosomal abnormalities remains a topic of debate. The argument for performing this costly analysis is to optimize the counseling of RM couples with respect to any subsequent pregnancy and to avoid the birth of a child with congenital defects and mental handicaps due to an unbalanced karyotype by offering appropriate prenatal diagnostic screening.

The case against offering routine karyotyping for couples with RM rests primarily on the findings of a large index-control study with a mean follow-up period of 5.8 years. This study showed that carrier couples with at least two previous miscarriages had the same chance of having a healthy child as non-carrier couples with at least two miscarriages (83% and 84%, respectively), and more importantly a low risk (0.8%) of pregnancies with an unbalanced karyotype surviving into the second trimester. Current clinical guidelines do recommend parental karyotyping as part of the evaluation in RM couples with a high risk of carrier status but only if maternal age is low at the second miscarriage, or if there is a history of two or more miscarriages in first degree relatives.

Some clinicians recommend in vitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) as a treatment option in RM couples with carrier status in order to replace euploid embryos only. This may be beneficial in couples with coexisting infertility, but in couples with proven fertility the live birth rate seems to be comparable or maybe even higher after spontaneous conception including PGD.

### Fetal loss in symptomatic first-trimester pregnancy with documented yolk sac intrauterine pregnancy [^1176FwFq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The possibility of spontaneous miscarriage is a common concern among pregnant women in the emergency department (ED).

Objective

This study sought to determine fetal outcomes for women following ED evaluation for first-trimester abdominopelvic pain or vaginal bleeding who had an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) on ultrasound before a visible fetal pole ("yolk sac IUP").

Methods

A retrospective chart review of consecutive ED charts from December 2005 to September 2006 identified patients with a yolk sac IUP. Demographic data, obstetric/gynecologic history, and presenting symptoms were obtained. Outcomes were determined via computerized records. Fetal loss was diagnosed by falling β-human chorionic gonadotropin or pathology specimen. Live birth was diagnosed by viable fetus at 20-week ultrasound or delivery.

Results

A total of 131 patients were enrolled in this study. Of these, 14 were lost to follow-up (12%), leaving 117 patient encounters. Of the 117 women, 82 carried their pregnancies to at least 20-week gestation. Thirty-five patients miscarried. Fetal loss rate by chief complaint were as follows: 8 of 46 patients presenting with pain only, 14 of 34 presenting with vaginal bleeding only, and 13 of 37 with both vaginal bleeding and pain.

Conclusion

Seventy percent of women diagnosed with a yolk sac IUP in the ED carried their pregnancy to at least 20 weeks. The remaining women (30%) experienced fetal loss. Vaginal bleeding (with or without pain) increased the rate of fetal loss compared with women with pain only. These data will assist the emergency physician in counseling women with symptomatic first-trimester pregnancies.

### Low chorionic villous succinate accumulation associates with recurrent spontaneous abortion risk [^114643fq]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is a highly heterogeneous condition defined as three or more consecutive spontaneous abortions before 20 weeks of gestation and affects 1–2% of fertile women worldwide. Although etiological studies have reported various factors that affect RSA, including chromosomal and anatomical uterine abnormalities, endometrial infections, endocrine abnormalities, antiphospholipid syndrome, inherited thrombophilias, alloimmune causes, and genetic factors, – its underlying mechanism remains unclear and a large proportion of RSA cases remain unexplained.

Embryonic development requires placenta formation following blastocyst implantation in the maternal organism. The human placenta is characterized by the extensive invasion of trophoblasts into the maternal uterus at the maternal–fetal interface between the uterine mucosa and the extraembryonic tissues of the developing conceptus, allowing direct contact between trophoblasts and maternal blood. Abnormal placentation and incomplete formation of the maternal–fetal interface in the first trimester are believed to cause RSA. – After the initial nidation phase, human trophoblasts differentiate along either the villous or extravillous trophoblast pathways. Villous trophoblasts cover chorionic villi and are involved in gas and nutrient exchange between the mother and fetus, whereas extravillous trophoblasts invade deep into the uterine wall (as far as the myometrium) and are directly implicated in the anchoring of chorionic villi. During the first trimester, extravillous trophoblasts display high proliferation and invasion like malignant tumor cells; however, trophoblasts rarely become malignant or immortalized even if they disperse through the host vascular system. Proper trophoblast invasion and proliferation are crucial to embryonic implantation and placental development, which promote the establishment of an appropriate maternal–fetal relationship. The invasive/proliferative properties of human extravillous trophoblasts are known to increase during the first trimester and decrease following embryo implantation under physiological conditions yet decrease abnormally under pathological conditions; however, despite their importance, the underlying molecular mechanisms have been poorly characterized.

### Prevalence of chromosomal alterations in first-trimester spontaneous pregnancy loss [^116Emrxo]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

CIN leads to mosaic embryos that contain both chromosomally normal and abnormal cells. It has been shown that aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos can be progressively depleted during pre-implantation development. Self-correction of human embryos may operate via cellular fragmentation and blastomere exclusion of abnormal cellsor by rescue mechanisms, such as trisomy or monosomy rescue. Spatiotemporal allocation of abnormal cells or aneuploidy rescue mechanisms can lead to confined placental mosaicism, which is the main biological cause for discordant abnormal non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results, with normal fetus confirmed after invasive fetal testing. For instance, we previously showed that more than 70% of large (> 100 kilobase (kb)) de novo copy number variations (CNVs) are present only in the placental lineage.

The genomic landscape of second-trimester and third-trimester pregnancy losses and elective terminations of fetuses with abnormal in utero phenotypes has been characterized. However, little is known about the genomic landscape of first-trimester spontaneous pregnancy losses. This knowledge is essential to understanding in utero mechanisms of CIN separately for fetal and placental lineages and to developing strategies for the early detection of high-risk pregnancies leading to pregnancy loss. In this study, we profiled the chromosomal landscape of the chorionic villi and the extra-embryonic mesoderm of first-trimester (~7 weeks of gestational age) spontaneous pregnancy losses, which are derived from the embryonic trophectoderm and the inner cell mass, respectively.

First-trimester imaging and miscarriage risk after LT or HT: A routine dating ultrasound is generally between 8–9 weeks of gestation and a nuchal translucency scan is generally between 11–14 weeks of gestation, and access to first-trimester ultrasound should be made available as clinically indicated given the higher miscarriage rates (13.6%) among individuals with LT or HT. If miscarriage occurs in the first trimester, both medical (mifepristone and misoprostol) and surgical (vacuum aspiration) options for pregnancy termination may be suitable if necessary. Where available, an early anatomy ultrasound is performed between 11–16 weeks of gestation.

### Safety of artemisinins in first trimester of prospectively followed pregnancies: an observational study [^113qKvB6]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Artemisinins, the most effective antimalarials available, are not recommended for falciparum malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy because of safety concerns. Therefore, quinine is used despite its poor effectiveness. Assessing artemisinin safety requires weighing the risks of malaria and its treatment. We aimed to assess the effect of first-trimester malaria and artemisinin treatment on miscarriage and major congenital malformations.

Methods

In this observational study, we assessed data from antenatal clinics on the Thai-Myanmar border between Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 2013. We included women who presented to antenatal clinics during their first trimester with a viable fetus. Women were screened for malaria, and data on malaria, antimalarial treatment, and birth outcomes were collected. The relationship between artemisinin treatments (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, or artemether) and miscarriage or malformation was assessed using Cox regression with left-truncation and time-varying exposures.

Findings

Of 55636 pregnancies registered between 1994 and 2013, 25485 pregnancies were analysed for first-trimester malaria and miscarriage, in which 2558 (10%) had first-trimester malaria. The hazard of miscarriage increased 1·61-fold after an initial first-trimester falciparum episode (95% CI 1·32–1·97; p < 0·0001), 3·24-fold following falciparum recurrence (2·24–4·68; p < 0·0001), and 2·44-fold (1·01–5·88; p = 0·0473) following recurrent symptomatic vivax malaria. No difference was noted in miscarriage in first-line falciparum treatments with artemisinin (n = 183) versus quinine (n = 842; HR 0·78 [95% CI 0·45–1·34]; p = 0·3645) or in risk of major congenital malformations (two [2%] of 109 [95% CI 0·22–6·47] versus eight (1%) of 641 [0·54–2·44], respectively).

Interpretation

First-trimester falciparum and vivax malaria both increase the risk of miscarriage. We noted no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or of major congenital malformations associated with first-line treatment with an artemisinin derivative compared with quinine. In view of the low efficacy of quinine and wide availability of highly effective artemisinin-based combination therapies, it is time to reconsider first-trimester antimalarial treatment recommendations.

### Pantoprazole [^111DnJhj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a Relative Risk (RR) = 0.55, [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.08–3.95]. In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations OR = 1.12 ([95% CI 0.86–1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR = 1.29 [95% CI 0.84–1.97]).

### Safety of artemisinins in first trimester of prospectively followed pregnancies: an observational study [^114jgofV]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

The Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) screens pregnant women frequently for malaria because there are no effective preventive interventions (appendix p 3). Since 1986, prospective data have been collected on confirmed malaria infections, antimalarial treatment, and pregnancy outcomes of women attending SMRU antenatal clinics, providing an important source of observational evidence on first-trimester artemisinin safety. In this setting, a single first-trimester malaria episode (falciparum or vivax) increased the odds of miscarriage, but first-trimester artemisinin treatment was not associated with miscarriage. However, for analytic clarity in this earlier study women with recurrent infections were excluded, which reduced the number of artemisinin treatments to 44 and overestimated the effect of malaria, because a recurrent infection in pregnancy depends on the fetus surviving the initial infection. Here, we extend this seminal study by including women with recurrent malaria, which might be either novel, recrudescent, or a relapse in the case of vivax malaria, and added 3 further years of data. Assessment of the safety of artemisinins requires weighing the risks of malaria and its treatment. Therefore, we sought to assess the effect of both first-trimester malaria and artemisinin treatment on miscarriage and major congenital malformations.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched Scopus and PubMed for articles published up to Oct 5, 2015, in any language, that addressed the association between first-trimester artemisinin treatment and miscarriage using the search terms: "malaria or plasmodium", "pregnan", "artemisinin* OR ACT* OR artesunate OR artemether OR Coartem", "first-trimester OR 'first trimester' OR 'early pregnancy'", and "miscarriage* OR abortion". One study reported on the association between a single first-trimester malaria episode and miscarriage. No randomised controlled trials of first-trimester artemisinin treatment were identified. No studies have reported on the association between recurrent first-trimester malaria and miscarriage. Ten observational studies of first-trimester artemisinin treatment were identified totalling 935 documented treatments, and a systematic review published in 2007. These studies showed no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or major congenital malformations associated with first-trimester artemisinin treatment. Importantly, only one published study examining the association between first-line artemisinin treatment and miscarriage accounted for left truncation, which is necessary when women present at varying gestations due to the declining risk of miscarriage as a pregnancy progresses, and few were able to account for confounding by indication and disease severity.

### Ciprofloxacin (ciprofloxacin in dextrose) [^117LBSsU]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Human Data

While available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, published data from prospective observational studies over several decades have not established an association with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Available studies have methodological limitations including small sample size and some of them are not specific for ciprofloxacin. A controlled prospective observational study followed 200 women exposed to fluoroquinolones (52.5% exposed to ciprofloxacin and 68% first trimester exposures) during gestation. In utero exposure to fluoroquinolones during embryogenesis was not associated with increased risk of major malformations. The reported rates of major congenital malformations were 2.2% for the fluoroquinolone group and 2.6% for the control group (background incidence of major malformations is 1 to 5%). Rates of spontaneous abortions, prematurity and low birth weight did not differ between the groups and there were no clinically significant musculoskeletal dysfunctions up to one year of age in the ciprofloxacin exposed children.

Another prospective follow-up study reported on 549 pregnancies with fluoroquinolone exposure (93% first trimester exposures). There were 70 ciprofloxacin exposures, all within the first trimester. The malformation rates among live-born babies exposed to ciprofloxacin and to fluoroquinolones overall were both within background incidence ranges. No specific patterns of congenital abnormalities were found. The study did not reveal any clear adverse reactions due to in utero exposure to ciprofloxacin.

No differences in the rates of prematurity, spontaneous abortions, or birth weight were seen in women exposed to ciprofloxacin during pregnancy. However, these small postmarketing epidemiology studies, of which most experience is from short term, first trimester exposure, are insufficient to evaluate the risk for less common defects or to permit reliable and definitive conclusions regarding the safety of ciprofloxacin in pregnant women and their developing fetuses.

### Safety of artemisinins in first trimester of prospectively followed pregnancies: an observational study [^113ss4Ty]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Primary exposures were malaria and first-line artemisinin treatment in the first trimester, defined as less than 14 weeks' gestation. The primary outcome was miscarriage, defined as fetal death before 28 weeks' gestation because infant respiratory support is unavailable. The ability to determine gestation and fetal viability at SMRU improved after ultrasound was introduced in 2002 (appendix p 3). The date of miscarriage was recorded consistently as the date of expulsion of the uterine contents, either spontaneously or through surgical intervention, which can occur some time after intrauterine death. The secondary outcome was major congenital malformations. A surface examination was done on all newborns by trained staff; a physician verified all malformations, except for some early neonatal deaths. Artemisinin-based treatments were first deployed in the general population in 1994. Therefore, we included women who presented to antenatal clinics during their first trimester with a viable fetus between Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 2013.

Statistical analysis

We used Cox proportional hazards models accounting for left truncation (appendix p 5) and time-varying exposures for all miscarriage analyses, with censoring at the gestation time of miscarriage, gestation time when last seen, or 28 weeks' gestation. To assess the association between malaria and miscarriage, women entered the analysis at the gestation time of their first antenatal visit. Multivariable models adjusted for year of first consultation, gravidity, smoking, and first-trimester non-malaria febrile morbidity. To assess the association between first-line artemisinin treatment and miscarriage (primary analysis), we included women with first-trimester falciparum malaria, and compared first-line quinine treatment (including quinine plus clindamycin) with first-line mefloquine monotherapy, artemisinin treatment (all derivatives) following quinine failure (ie, artemisinin rescue), and first-line artemisinin treatment (all derivatives). Women entered the analysis at the gestation time of their first falciparum malaria episode. Treatments given after determination of fetal non-viability were excluded. Multivariable models adjusted for year of first consultation, disease severity pertaining to the first falciparum malaria episode (asymptomatic, symptomatic, or hyperparasitaemic or severe), and first-trimester non-malaria febrile morbidity. The prevalence of major congenital malformation was described by first-trimester falciparum malaria and first-line treatment. Malformations were grouped by organ system to increase the likelihood of detecting teratogenic signals. Data were analysed with Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

### Vaginal antimycotics and the risk for spontaneous abortions [^111n14mz]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous abortions are the most common complication of pregnancy. Clotrimazole and miconazole are widely used vaginal-antimycotic agents used for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. A previous study has suggested an increased risk of miscarriage associated with these azoles, which may lead health professionals to refrain from their use even if clinically indicated.

Objective

The aim of the current study was to assess the risk for spontaneous abortions following first trimester exposure to vaginal antimycotics.

Study Design

A historical cohort study was conducted including all clinically apparent pregnancies that began from January 2003 through December 2009 and admitted for birth or spontaneous abortion at Soroka Medical Center, Clalit Health Services, Beer-Sheva, Israel. A computerized database of medication dispensation was linked with 2 computerized databases containing information on births and spontaneous abortions. Time-varying Cox regression models were constructed adjusting for mother's age, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, obesity, hypercoagulable or inflammatory conditions, recurrent miscarriages, intrauterine contraceptive device, ethnicity, tobacco use, and the year of admission.

Results

A total of 65,457 pregnancies were included in the study: 58,949 (90.1%) ended with birth and 6508 (9.9%) with a spontaneous abortion. Overall, 3246 (5%) pregnancies were exposed to vaginal antimycotic medications until the 20th gestational week: 2712 (4.2%) were exposed to clotrimazole and 633 (1%) to miconazole. Exposure to vaginal antimycotics was not associated with spontaneous abortions as a group (crude hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–1.29; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.96–1.29) and specifically for clotrimazole (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.25) and miconazole (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.99–1.80). Furthermore, no association was found between categories of dosage of vaginal antimycotics and spontaneous abortions.

Conclusion

Exposure to vaginal antimycotics was not associated with spontaneous abortions.

### The relationship between fetal tissue chromosomal karyotype and clinical characteristics in patients with spontaneous abortion: a retrospective study [^114r1QEA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous abortion (SA) is one of the most common complications during pregnancy. According to the gestational age at the time of abortion, it can be divided into early SA, which is defined as pregnancy failure before 12 weeks of pregnancy, and middle-late SA. Most previous studies have shown that the incidence of SA in women of childbearing age is approximately 15%, and 3%−5% of these couples experience recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Currently, it is known that chromosomal abnormalities, anatomical abnormalities, immune abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities are common causes of SA. Among them, fetal chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause of early SA, accounting for 50% of cases or more.

Compared with traditional analytical methods, copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) has the advantages of high resolution, high accuracy and sensitivity, not being limited by specific genomic regions, as well as a faster experimental cycle. It is increasingly being used in the analysis of miscarriage material, and its combination with quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) can identify chromosomal aneuploidy, polyploidy, and copy number variants (CNVs).

In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of chromosomal abnormalities in miscarriage tissue and their relationship with clinical features, aiming to contribute to the treatment and prevention of miscarriages in clinical practice.

### Methotrexate [^1115Gzhr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Methotrexate tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women with non-neoplastic diseases [see Contraindications (4)].

Based on published reports and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], methotrexate can cause embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no animal data that meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies. Advise pregnant women with neoplastic diseases of the potential risk to a fetus.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Data

Human Data

Published data from case reports, literature reviews, and observational studies report that methotrexate exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of embryo-fetal toxicity and fetal death. Methotrexate exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of spontaneous abortions and multiple adverse developmental outcomes, including skull anomalies, facial dysmorphism, central nervous system abnormalities, limb abnormalities, and sometimes cardiac anomalies and intellectual impairment. Adverse outcomes associated with exposure during second and third trimesters of pregnancy include intrauterine growth restriction and functional abnormalities. Because methotrexate is widely distributed and persists in the body for a prolonged period, there is a potential risk to the fetus from preconception methotrexate exposure.

A prospective multicenter study evaluated pregnancy outcomes in women taking methotrexate less than or equal to 30 mg/week after conception. The rate of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate was 42% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 29, 59), which was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (22%; 95% CI: 17, 30) and unexposed patients with nonautoimmune disease (17%; 95% CI: 13, 23). Of the live births, the rate of major birth defects in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate after conception was higher than in unexposed patients with autoimmune disease (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.8 [95% CI: 0.6, 6]) and unexposed patients with non-autoimmune disease (adjusted OR 3.1 [95% CI: 1, 10]) (2.9%). Major birth defects associated with pregnancies exposed to methotrexate after conception were not always consistent with methotrexate-associated adverse developmental outcomes.

### Gene expression pattern of IGF2, PHLDA2, PEG10 and CDKN1C imprinted genes in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths [^116b6BJy]. Epigenetics (2010). Low credibility.

Genomic imprinting is defined as an epigenetic modification that leads to parent-of-origin specific monoallelic expression. Some current research on the fetal control growth has been focused on the study of genes that display imprinted expression in utero. Four imprinted genes, two paternally expressed (IGF2 and PEG10) and two maternally expressed (PHLDA2 and CDKN1C), are well known to play a role in fetal growth and placental development. Pregnancy loss in the general reproductive population is a very common occurrence and other genetic causes beyond chromosomal abnormalities could be involved in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths, such as alteration of expression in imprinted genes particularly those related to fetal or placental growth. Quantitative Real Time PCR was performed to evaluate gene expressions patterns of the four mentioned genes in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths from 38 women. Expression levels of PHLDA2 gene were upregulated in the first trimester pregnancy cases and all four imprinted genes studied were upregulated in the second trimester of pregnancy cases comparing with controls. In third trimester PEG10 was downregulated in fetal samples group. This is the first study presenting data from human imprinted genes expression in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths cases from the three trimesters of pregnancy.

### Early pregnancy loss… [^113ufhJP]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Early pregnancy loss is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy during the first trimester. Early pregnancy loss occurs in about 1 of 3 pregnancies and affects approximately 1 million pregnant individuals each year in the US. Causes of and Risk Factors for Early Pregnancy Loss. Early pregnancy loss is caused most commonly by fetal chromosomal abnormalities, which account for more than two-thirds of all early pregnancy loss between 6 and 10 weeks of gestation. Risk factors for early pregnancy loss include older age at onset of pregnancy, prior pregnancy loss, some medical conditions, and exposures during pregnancy that may harm a developing fetus. How Is Early Pregnancy Loss Diagnosed.

The diagnosis of early pregnancy loss can be made by clinical symptoms, such as vaginal bleeding, or by decreasing levels of β-human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone produced in pregnancy, in a patient whose vaginal examination reveals an open cervix. A vaginal ultrasound that shows either an empty uterus or a uterine gestational sac without an embryo can also diagnose early pregnancy loss. Management of Early Pregnancy Loss There are 3 management options for patients with early pregnancy loss who do not have vaginal bleeding or signs of infection. Expectant management: Without any intervention, 25% to 50% of patients with early pregnancy loss pass pregnancy tissue within 1 week, and more than 80% of patients with bleeding completely expel products of conception within 2 weeks. Patients who opt for expectant management should have access to a nearby emergency department, in case they experience excessive bleeding.

Potential Complications of Early Pregnancy Loss Treatments Rare complications following treatment of early pregnancy loss include infection, bleeding, retained products of conception, and surgical injury. For medication management, the rate of incomplete expulsion of pregnancy tissue, which results in the need for uterine aspiration, is lower when both mifepristone and misoprostol are given compared with misoprostol alone.

### Most early miscarriages Do not require surgical care… [^111ExkE6]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

At least 15 percent of clinically recognized pregnancies result in miscarriage during the first trimester, and many are routinely treated by surgical evacuation of the uterus. This surgery can have serious complications, including infection, perforation of the uterus, and damage to the bowel. Luise and colleagues investigated the acceptability and outcome of monitoring without surgical intervention in cases of spontaneous first-trimester miscarriage. They studied 1, 096 consecutive women attending a special early pregnancy assessment unit of a London teaching hospital because of suspected miscarriage during the first trimester. After assessment and ultrasonography, each miscarriage was classified as complete, incomplete, missed, or anembryonic, based on the guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Women with complete miscarriage were discharged with arrangements to follow up and promptly report any further signs or symptoms.

The 686 women with retained products of conception were given the choice of surgical evacuation of the uterus or expectant management. The women who chose expectant management had the option to request surgical evacuation at any time. Otherwise, progress was monitored by weekly ultrasonography for up to four weeks. Symptoms were monitored throughout the study, and completion of the miscarriage was assessed by cessation of vaginal bleeding and an endometrial thickness of less than 15 mm on ultrasound. Two patients with molar pregnancies were excluded, and 408 patients were classified as having completed the miscarriage at the initial assessment. Of the 686 remaining women, 478 opted for expectant management. Complete data were available on 451 of these women. Overall, 201 of the 221 incomplete miscarriages spontaneously completed with expectant management.

The rate of spontaneous completion for missed miscarriage was 105 of 138, and for anembryonic pregnancies it was 61 of 92. In the whole group, complications were documented in 11 women, and five of these were related to surgical evacuation of the uterus. Only six of the 451 women treated expectantly had any complications. The authors concluded that most women would choose expectant management of early miscarriage if they were assured of close monitoring and the availability of surgery if required or requested. They attribute much of this attitude to the extent and quality of patient support and counseling.

### Definition of spontaneous abortion-NCI dictionary… [^1177sfTg]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

spontaneous abortion An unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week of pregnancy. Most spontaneous abortions happen very early in pregnancy, often before a person even knows they are pregnant. Signs include vaginal spotting or bleeding, pain or cramping in the abdomen or lower back, and the passing of fluid or tissue from the vagina. Spontaneous abortions often occur because of genetic problems in the fetus. Maternal factors or conditions that could contribute to having a spontaneous abortion include problems with the uterus or cervix, infection, hormone problems, severe malnutrition, smoking, drinking alcohol, taking certain medicines, or exposure to radiation. Being older or having certain diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, uncontrolled diabetes, congenital heart disease, thyroid or kidney disease, and immune system disorders, may also put a person at higher risk of having a spontaneous abortion. Also called miscarriage.
