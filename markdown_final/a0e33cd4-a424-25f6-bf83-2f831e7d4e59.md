## Question

Severe light sensitivity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about severe light sensitivity, including its definition, mechanisms, etiologies, diagnostic approach, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the symptom and its core mechanisms. Then, I should categorize the major etiologies by organ system and highlight red flags. Next, I will outline a practical diagnostic algorithm and key tests. After that, I need to detail management principles, including condition-specific treatments and behavioral strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a pragmatic clinical approach with citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't conflate terms. Severe light sensitivity, or photophobia, is discomfort or pain from light exposure that is disproportionate to the stimulus and can be accompanied by avoidance behaviors; it spans ocular surface, neurologic, and systemic causes, and may reflect peripheral nociception or central amplification, including cortical hyperexcitability in some conditions [^d36447f8] [^8751e333].

> I need to check the core mechanisms next. Peripheral drivers include corneal and conjunctival nociceptors and trigeminal afferents, while central mechanisms include intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and cortical hyperexcitability; pupillary dysregulation and autonomic imbalance also contribute in migraine and related disorders, and these pathways can be amplified by neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, including opioids in experimental models [^24a92185] [^d075abc8] [^30004ce9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiologies without organizing them. I will categorize by system: ocular surface and anterior segment causes include dry eye, conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, and corneal dystrophies; neurologic causes include migraine, traumatic brain injury, and functional visual loss; systemic and medication-related causes include porphyrias, drug-induced photosensitivity, and photosensitive dermatoses; retinal and optic nerve causes include retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, and optic neuropathies; and finally, there are idiopathic or primary photophobia syndromes such as visual snow [^d47f9cce] [^13d27911] [^76ae2ef7] [^d075abc8] [^c9f66ff3] [^3ce785c5] [^caa96ba4] [^01af6bff] [^86acc368].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags that mandate urgent action. Acute painful photophobia with redness, discharge, or vision loss suggests corneal ulcer, uveitis, or acute angle closure; new-onset severe photophobia after trauma or surgery warrants urgent ophthalmology; and photophobia with neurologic deficits, papilledema, or progressive visual field loss requires emergent neuro-ophthalmology or neurology evaluation to exclude compressive or inflammatory etiologies [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and ensure it is practical. Start with a careful history of onset, tempo, associated symptoms, medication exposures, and migraine or TBI history; perform a focused ophthalmic exam including slit lamp, IOP, and funduscopy; and add targeted testing such as tear film assessment for dry eye, perimetry for field defects, and corneal topography for keratoconus; reserve neuroimaging for focal deficits, papilledema, or suspected compressive lesions, and consider EEG if photosensitive epilepsy is suspected [^d47f9cce] [^65a3b33e] [^55d6306f] [^ccff7c4d].

> I will now examine management principles, but I should confirm that they align with evidence. The foundation is to identify and treat the underlying cause, whether ocular surface disease, migraine, TBI, or medication-induced photosensitivity; concurrently, implement photophobia-specific strategies such as gradual desensitization, tinted lenses, and behavioral approaches, while avoiding excessive light avoidance that can worsen sensitivity over time [^c9f66ff3] [^e40ba530].

> Let me consider ocular surface disease first, since it is common and treatable. For severe dry eye, escalate to punctal occlusion, autologous serum drops, and scleral lenses as appropriate; for filamentary keratitis, debridement and mucolytics help; and for inflammatory conjunctivitis or uveitis, treat the underlying inflammation with topical steroids or other immunomodulatory therapy under ophthalmology supervision, as untreated inflammation can cause permanent damage [^a0a41822] [^13d27911].

> For migraine-related photophobia, I should double-check that both acute and preventive strategies are addressed. Acute therapy with triptans or gepants reduces attack severity and photophobia, and preventive options include CGRP monoclonals, beta-blockers, or anticonvulsants; behavioral strategies and education about triggers and premonitory symptoms are essential, and emerging evidence supports cortical hyperexcitability as a mechanistic target, which helps explain interictal photophobia and guides nonpharmacologic interventions [^76ae2ef7] [^8751e333] [^d36447f8].

> In traumatic brain injury, I need to ensure a multidisciplinary approach. Persistent photophobia after mTBI warrants referral to vision rehabilitation, neurology, and neuro-ophthalmology; autonomic dysfunction and ipRGC dysregulation are plausible contributors, and management includes tinted lenses, vestibular and vision therapy, sleep optimization, and treatment of comorbid PTSD or anxiety, with escalation if symptoms persist beyond 3 months [^8e9ff1e1] [^d075abc8] [^a6ddb3b9].

> For functional visual loss with severe photophobia, I should confirm that we avoid reinforcing avoidance. Management centers on graded exposure to light with education about maladaptive plasticity, and behavioral psychology support can facilitate weaning off sunglasses; this is counterintuitive for patients but effective when implemented stepwise with clear rationale and goals [^c9f66ff3].

> But wait, what if the photophobia is medication-induced. I need to check for common culprits such as fluoroquinolones, retinoids, and photodynamic agents; management is to discontinue the offending drug when feasible, provide strict photoprotection during the photosensitive window, and counsel on clothing and broad-spectrum protection, noting that conventional UV sunscreens may not protect against visible light photosensitivity in some syndromes [^caa96ba4] [^e40ba530] [^0b473b5f].

> I should also consider retinal and optic nerve disease, where photophobia may reflect cone dysfunction or global retinal sensitivity loss. In retinitis pigmentosa, patients may develop photophobia as cones fail; in diabetic retinopathy, capillary nonperfusion correlates with retinal sensitivity loss; and in early AMD, mesopic and scotopic sensitivity can be impaired even when acuity is preserved, guiding expectations and low-vision strategies [^01af6bff] [^fecdc520] [^82a000e1].

> Let me think about special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, photophobia is common after concussion and should be managed with return-to-learn and vision rehabilitation protocols; in older adults, cataract-related glare and photophobia may necessitate surgery even with relatively preserved Snellen acuity; and in shift workers, circadian misalignment and nocturnal light exposure can amplify sensory sensitivity, so sleep hygiene and light timing interventions are important adjuncts [^09c9a762] [^6b8f2d16] [^33eb83c8].

> Hold on, I should verify that my summary is actionable. Severe light sensitivity is a symptom with diverse mechanisms and etiologies; a structured approach prioritizes identifying the underlying cause, treating it directly, and implementing graded photophobia management to prevent chronicity; red flags guide urgency, and multidisciplinary care is often needed in neurologic and refractory cases, with behavioral strategies playing a key role in functional presentations [^d36447f8] [^c9f66ff3] [^8e9ff1e1].

Severe light sensitivity, or photophobia, is most often due to **ocular surface disease** (dry eye, corneal abrasion, uveitis) [^d47f9cce] [^13d27911], **migraine** [^76ae2ef7], or **medications** (fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, retinoids) [^caa96ba4] [^2da1e2d3]. Less common causes include **retinal disease** (retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration) [^01af6bff], **neurologic disorders** (meningitis, TBI, optic neuritis) [^d075abc8], and **systemic diseases** (porphyria, lupus) [^3ce785c5] [^c1a7b3a1]. Evaluation should include a focused history, ophthalmic exam, and targeted testing (slit lamp, funduscopy, visual fields, MRI if neurologic signs) [^notfound]. Management treats the underlying cause, uses tinted lenses, and avoids triggers; urgent care is needed for sudden photophobia with pain, redness, or vision loss [^notfound].

### Porphyria cutanea tarda… [^c1a7b3a1]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

WALDENSTRÖM1 has divided the porphyrias into the following groups: Porphyria congenita, a familial disease, probably recessive in character, present at birth and characterized by sensitivity to light, pigmented bones and teeth, and greatly increased coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin excretion, mainly of Series I. Porphyria cutanea tarda, a disease in which the porphyrinuria and sensitivity to light develop later in life and a sclerodermic tendency is noticeable. The occurrence of colic and the occasional excretion in the urine of uroporphyrin suggest a relationship with the group next to be described. Severe nervous symptoms have not yet been reported.
2. Porphyria acuta, a familial disease, dominant in character, accompanied with the excretion of coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin mainly of Series III.

### Light sensitivity in myasthenia gravis: clinical characteristics and impact on quality of life [^612635e9]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Ptosis and diplopia are common clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis (MG). With the emergence of novel therapies for MG, there is an increasing emphasis on understanding the full spectrum of MG‐related symptoms and optimizing patient‐centered care. Although some patients with MG report experiencing light sensitivity (LS), this symptom remains relatively underinvestigated. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and quality‐of‐life impact of LS in MG patients.

### Restoration of cone sensitivity to individuals with congenital photoreceptor blindness within the phase 1 / 2 sepofarsen trial [^3bce453c]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Until recently, LCA was not treatable and questions regarding structural and functional changes at the visual cortex resulting from congenital blindness and the potential to regain vision were academic. However, one genetic form of LCA has already become treatable, and promising interventions are being evaluated for other genetic forms of LCA. Improvement of partially retained vision seems to be possible, at least for some of the treatment methods and some of the individuals. What is least known is the recovery potential of visual perception for the most severe forms of LCA undergoing successful reversal of the molecular defect within photoreceptors. Do congenitally blind individuals start seeing when photoreceptor function improves as an adult?

Blindness resulting from LCA covers a very wide spectrum from impaired visual acuity (VA) with reduced light sensitivity and limited visual field to complete blindness, or no light perception (NLP). Toward the most severe end of this spectrum are eyes that can detect light, but lack any ability to distinguish spatial pattern or directionality of light; the clinical label is light perception (LP) without projection. Individuals with centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) mutations associated with LCA (CEP290 -LCA) tend to include the largest proportion of those with severe blindness in the LP or NLP category as compared with LCA with different molecular causation. The current study focused on 5 participants with CEP290 - LCA and binocular severe photoreceptor blindness who were treated monocularly with sepofarsen, which is an intravitreal antisense oligonucleotide that has shown preliminary evidence of vision improvement.

### Phototherapy in the pediatric population [^c4c5a97a]. Dermatologic Clinics (2020). Medium credibility.

Phototherapy has been used successfully to treat a wide range of pediatric skin conditions. It is a viable option in children with severe dermatologic disease or who have failed first-line treatments, and several studies have demonstrated its efficacy and safety in the pediatric population. Despite the growing body of evidence on the use of phototherapy in children, large controlled trials and long-term studies are lacking. Moreover, special considerations must be taken when using phototherapy in children. This review highlights the recent evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of phototherapy in children, with focus on the common light-sensitive pediatric skin conditions.

### Vision and concussion: symptoms, signs, evaluation, and treatment [^09c9a762]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Diagnosis — vision-related concussion history emphasizes common symptoms and prevalence: "Visual complaints are among the myriad symptoms that patients report after concussion", and "Blurred vision, light sensitivity, and double vision have been reported to occur in up to 40% of children and adolescents immediately after concussion". "Additional symptoms may include complaints of losing one's place or ocular fatigue while reading", and because "children are frequently unable to recognize or articulate specific visual complaints; thus, clinicians may need to have an appropriately elevated index of suspicion to identify vision-specific issues".

### Left-right and upper-lower light sensitivity asymmetry in visual field defects caused by pituitary adenoma: a retrospective observational study [^55d6306f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to quantitatively investigate light sensitivity asymmetry both between left and right eyes and between upper and lower quadrant in the 30-degree visual field of patients with visual field defects caused by pituitary adenoma.

Patients and Methods

Preoperative Humphrey 30–2 perimetry results were reviewed retrospectively using the charts of 28 pituitary adenoma patients who underwent surgery. Inter-eye light sensitivity comparisons of the temporal and nasal hemifields between the left and right eyes were conducted in each patient to study left-right asymmetry. Upper-lower asymmetry was investigated by comparing the frequency of severe scotoma (light sensitivity 5 dB or less) in the upper and lower visual field quadrants in the temporal and nasal hemifields.

Results

Left-right asymmetry was demonstrated in 61% of cases in the temporal hemifield and in 57% of cases in the nasal hemifield. Severe scotoma test points were investigated in the worse eye of each patient and were more frequent in the superotemporal quadrant of the visual field compared with the inferotemporal quadrant (P = 0.00029) and in the inferonasal quadrant compared to the superonasal quadrant (P = 0.00268).

Conclusion

Asymmetric visual field defects between left and right eyes are common in patients with pituitary adenoma. Severe scotoma is more frequent in the upper quadrant of the temporal hemifield and in the lower quadrant of the nasal hemifield.

### Enhanced pre-ictal cortical responsivity in migraine patients assessed by visual chirp stimulation [^ee972023]. Cephalalgia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a common paroxysmal brain disorder characterized by recurrent disabling attacks of severe headache with associated features such as nausea, vomiting, and enhanced sensitivity to sound and light. It remains an enigma exactly why and when attacks strike. It has been suggested that the initiation of an attack may involve variations in cortical responsivity to sensory inputs such as light, presumably as result of fluctuations in cortical excitability. Such dynamics in cortical responsivity may provide functional biomarkers of relevance for attack prediction. There is evidence pointing to the visual cortex as an area of the brain where changes in cortical responsivity in migraine are most apparent. Responsivity to light in migraineurs was particularly enhanced for the visual cortex as assessed in neuroimaging studies, and in some was reported to be most pronounced for migraine with aura.

### Rizatriptan benzoate (Maxalt-mlt) [^9b595c93]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

What is migraine and how does it differ from other headaches?

Migraine is an intense, throbbing, typically one-sided headache that often includes nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound. According to many migraine sufferers, the pain and symptoms from a migraine headache are more intense than the pain and symptoms of a common headache.

Some people may have visual symptoms before the headache, such as flashing lights or wavy lines, called an aura.

Migraine attacks typically last for hours or, rarely, for more than a day, and they can return frequently. The severity and frequency of migraine attacks may vary.

Based on your symptoms, your doctor will decide whether you have migraine.

Who gets migraine?

Migraine headaches tend to occur in members of the same family. Both men and women get migraine, but it is more common in women.

What may trigger a migraine attack?

Certain things are thought to trigger migraine attacks in some people. Some of these triggers are:

certain foods or beverages (e.g., cheese, chocolate, citrus fruit, caffeine, alcohol)
stress
change in a behavior (e.g., under/oversleeping; missing a meal; change in diet)
hormonal changes in women (e.g., menstruation)

You may be able to prevent migraine attacks or diminish their frequency if you understand what specifically triggers your attacks. Keeping a headache diary may help you identify and monitor the possible migraine triggers you encounter. Once the triggers are identified, you and your doctor can modify your treatment and lifestyle appropriately.

How does MAXALT work during a migraine attack?

Treatment with MAXALT:

Reduces swelling of blood vessels surrounding the brain. This swelling results in the headache pain of a migraine attack.
Blocks the release of substances from nerve endings that cause more pain and other symptoms of migraine.
Interrupts the sending of specific pain signals to your brain.

It is thought that each of these actions contributes to relief of your symptoms by MAXALT.

### Photopsia [^92434884]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

'Photopsia' describes the symptom of visual disturbances that are typically flash-like, sudden in onset and brief, and occurring without light entering the eye. Patients reporting photopsia often pose a diagnostic challenge, given the wide range of possible neurological and ophthalmological causes. We review the common causes of photopsia, discuss the assessment and workup of this symptom, and stress the importance of close interdisciplinary liaison to help with its diagnosis and management. We discuss a patient with acute zonal occult outer retinopathy to illustrate these points.

### Photophobia in migraine: a symptom cluster? [^8751e333]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Photophobia is one of the most common symptoms in migraine, and the underlying mechanism is uncertain. The discovery of the intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells which signal the intensity of light on the retina has led to discussion of their role in the pathogenesis of photophobia. In the current review, we discuss the relationship between pain and discomfort leading to light aversion (traditional photophobia) and discomfort from flicker, patterns, and colour that are also common in migraine and cannot be explained solely by the activity of intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. We argue that, at least in migraine, a cortical mechanism provides a parsimonious explanation for discomfort from all forms of visual stimulation, and that the traditional definition of photophobia as pain in response to light may be too restrictive. Future investigation that directly compares the retinal and cortical contributions to photophobia in migraine with that in other conditions may offer better specificity in identifying biomarkers and possible mechanisms to target for treatment.

### Light sensitivity in myasthenia gravis: clinical characteristics and impact on quality of life [^354b7038]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Introduction/Aims

Light sensitivity is occasionally reported in myasthenia gravis patients, yet its prevalence, clinical characteristics, and impact on disease severity and quality of life remain insufficiently explored. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency, clinical characteristics, and the correlation of light sensitivity with myasthenia gravis severity and quality of life in patients.

Methods

Myasthenia gravis patients consecutively admitted to Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli in Rome between March and October 2023 were considered for the study. A demographically matched group of healthy controls was also included. Patients and controls completed the Visual Light Sensitivity Questionnaire‐8 (VLSQ‐8). The patient cohort additionally received the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score, the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG‐ADL) scale, and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality‐of‐Life‐15 (MG‐QoL‐15) questionnaires.

Results

A total of 92 patients and 75 healthy controls participated. Light sensitivity was significantly more frequent among patients (36%, 33/92) than among controls (4%, 3/75). Patients with light sensitivity exhibited higher QMG (p < 0.0001), MG‐ADL (p < 0.0001), and a decreased quality of life with higher MG‐QoL‐15 (p = 0.0003) scores than those without light sensitivity. Notably, light sensitivity severity positively correlated with diminished quality of life.

Discussion

These findings suggest that light sensitivity may be a feature of myasthenia gravis, with clinically relevant implications for patient well‐being. This underscores the value of screening for and managing light sensitivity in routine myasthenia gravis care. Proactive identification and treatment strategies aimed at light sensitivity may help enhance overall quality of life.

### Utilizing visual symptoms to distinguish dry eye from glaucoma, cataract, and suspect glaucoma patients: a cross-sectional study [^d47f9cce]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, patients with dry eye can be differentiated from those without significant eye disease (suspected glaucoma), glaucoma, and cataracts with reasonable sensitivity and specificity using sets of visual symptoms, though in the real world these symptoms would supplement careful clinical examination. The most common symptom was light sensitivity in dry eye patients, and the presence of light sensitivity helped differentiate dry eye from both glaucoma suspect controls and glaucoma patients, while other symptoms (i.e. spots in vision, varying vision), helped distinguish dry eye and cataract patients. Several nonspecific symptoms that did not help distinguish dry eye from other conditions were identified, including glare (which differs from light sensitivity by the absence of pain), floaters, difficulty focusing, vision varying across the day, and halos. Similar associations were observed for severity of symptoms in distinguishing dry eye from other conditions, which is also important from a patient perspective. These data can help guide the specific situations in which symptoms reported by patients can be used to help distinguishing dry eye from other ocular conditions.

Light sensitivity and spots in vision, both of which can be a result of tear film disturbance, best distinguished dry eye from relatively normally-sighted controls (glaucoma suspects). Visual disturbances like spots in vision may reflect the perception of an imperfect ocular surface leading to wavefront aberrations and light scattering. Superficial corneal lesions (measured by OSS) caused by dry eye can lead to light sensitivity through irritation of trigeminal afferents. In agreement with our findings, dry eye has been suggested to be the most common cause of light sensitivity.

Light sensitivity was also more common in dry eye patients as opposed to those with glaucoma, though additional symptoms more common in glaucoma could also differentiate the conditions. Partly consistent with prior work describing the symptoms most strongly associated with glaucoma severity in a glaucoma population, we found that experiencing poor peripheral vision, better vision in one eye, and missing patches of vision differentiate glaucoma and dry eye patients. Indeed, these visual symptoms should only rarely occur in dry eye as visual problems should not vary across parts of the visual field. Notably, cloudy vision was non-specific and described at a similar frequency in both glaucoma and dry eye in our study, consistent with prior work showing cloudy vision symtpoms being more prevalent in dry eye related to contact lens wear.

### Restoration of high-sensitivity and adapting vision with a cone opsin [^eef9ecb8]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) lead to the progressive loss of rods and cones, beginning in the peripheral retina and underlie blindness in children and adults into middle age. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of severe vision loss in people over 50 years of age, also results from loss of photoreceptor cells, but in the central retina, impairing highest acuity vision. IRDs can result from defects in > 50 genes, and there are no clear single gene defects that cause AMD, making gene replacement costly or ineffective. Furthermore, gene replacement can slow progression but does not help in late stage disease.

An alternative approach is to endow light sensitivity to downstream neurons of the inner retina that survive following photoreceptor loss, either with synthetic photoswitches, which actuate native ion channels –, or by genetic introduction of a light-sensitive signaling protein. A number of light-sensitive signaling proteins have been tested, including two microbial opsins, the ion channel channelrhodopsin and ion pump halorhodopsin –, chemically engineered mammalian receptors, and two G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) opsins that are native to the retina, rhodopsin of rod photoreceptor cells and melanopsin of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells –. These light-gated systems, when delivered to the surviving neurons of the blind retina using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), restore light sensitivity, transmission of light-driven activity to higher order visual centers in the brain, and both innate and learned visually guided behaviors. However, each of these approaches encounters a significant limitation. The microbial opsins and the chemically engineered receptors have fast kinetics (~50–200 ms) and follow high frequency modulation of light (~20 Hz) but have a low sensitivity to light (requiring intensities of very bright outdoor light). The sensitivity is so low that a clinical trial for channelrhodopsin requires intensifying goggles, risking retinal photo-toxicity. In contrast, ectopic expression of rhodopsin and melanopsin are extremely sensitive to light (responding to indoor light), but so slow (seconds to tens of seconds) – that they may not support patterned vision given eye motion and movement of the subject and of visual objects. Moreover, the systems tested to date operate over a relatively narrow range of intensities. In contrast, normal photoreception combines speed with high sensitivity and adaptation that permits a sharp intensity-response curve to shift over 9 orders of magnitude. The sensitivity and adaptation emerge from the properties of G-protein signaling pathway of photoreceptor cells that both amplifies and modulates the light response. Our goal was to overcome the shortcomings of current vision restoration approaches by searching for a GPCR that could provide fast, sensitive and adapting light responses to surviving cells of the blind retina.

### Light-related cutaneous symptoms of erythropoietic protoporphyria and associations with light sensitivity measurements [^3ce785c5]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare and underdiagnosed genetic disease characterized by painful sensitivity to light. A better understanding and characterization of its light-induced cutaneous symptoms may aid in the identification of EPP in patients.

Objectives

To describe the cutaneous symptoms of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and to determine if these symptoms are associated with the degree of light sensitivity.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a cross-sectional study of adolescent and adult (≥ 15 years) patients with EPP across the US conducted by a single academic hospital via a remotely administered survey, measurements of light sensitivity by light dosimetry and by text message symptom assessments. Data analyses were conducted from November 2020 to April 2022.

Exposures

Sunlight exposure.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Self-reported symptoms and association with measured light sensitivity.

Results

The study sample consisted of 35 patients with EPP (mean [SD] age, 39.1 (15.5) years; 21 [60%] female; 14 [40%] male; 35 [100%] White individuals). The patients' median [range] skin tone was 3.0 (1.0–8.0), based on self-reporting from 1 (lightest) to 12 (darkest). A total of 24 participants completed the light dosimeter measurements. Phototoxic reactions were characterized by pain (97%; 34 patients), burning (97%; 34), tingling (97%; 34), pruritus (83%; 29), allodynia (89%; 31), improvement of symptoms with cold (89%; 31), achiness (24%; 12), fatigue (46%; 16), mild swelling (83%; 29), severe swelling (63%; 22), erythema (51%; 18), petechiae (40%; 14), skin cracking (43%; 15), scabbing (46%; 16), scarring (66%; 23), and other chronic skin changes (40%; 14). Patients with EPP reported that their hands, feet, and face were most sensitive to light and that their shoulders and legs were least sensitive; 25.7% (9 patient) reported no chronic skin changes, and 5.7% (2 patients) reported never having had any visible symptoms. None of these findings varied with the degree of light sensitivity except that lower overall light sensitivity was associated with lower ranked sensitivity of the neck and arms.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that patients with EPP have distinctive cutaneous symptoms that may aid in identification of this underdiagnosed disease. Characteristic EPP symptoms include light-induced cutaneous burning pain and occasional swelling, particularly over the hands, with a prodrome of pruritus and paresthesias. Minimal skin changes or the absence of visible skin changes during reactions to light, including lack of erythema, do not exclude an EPP diagnosis nor suggest low EPP disease burden.

### Migraine [^76ae2ef7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on migraine:

- **Definition**: Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent moderate-to-severe headaches, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity to light and sound.
- **Pathophysiology**: Migraine is due to complex brain network disorder involving the cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brainstem in genetically predisposed individuals.
- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of migraine over a 3-month period in the US adult population is 15.3%, affecting approximately 20.7% of females and 9.7% of males. The global lifetime prevalence of migraines is estimated at 14%.
- **Disease course**: The complex interplay between cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, brainstem involved in modulation of nociceptive signaling results in trigeminovascular system activation, cortical-spreading depression-like event, a slowly propagating wave of neuronal and glial cell depolarization and hyperpolarization causing unilateral, pulsating, moderate to severe intensity headache with or without aura.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute migraine therapies (triptans, ergotamines, NSAIDs) are ineffective and account for > 50% recurrence of migraine. Approximately 2.2–3.1% of people with episodic migraine progress to chronic migraine at 1-year follow up.

Management of persons with visual impairment — retinopathy-related visual deficits: Diabetic retinopathy ranks as the fifth most common cause of global blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment, and common visual impairments associated with diabetic retinopathy include reduced central visual acuity affecting near, intermediate, and distance visual function; central or para-central scotoma from diabetic maculopathy; loss of peripheral or mid-central visual field, secondary to retinal ischemia or PRP; reduced dark adaptation and increased lag times in seeing in dim light; difficulty with glare; vision loss resulting from VH, PRH, or traction retinal detachment; and decreased contrast sensitivity.

### Connections between intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and TBI symptoms [^d075abc8]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are classified as having a mild TBI. Despite being categorized as mild, these individuals report ongoing and complex symptoms, which negatively affect their ability to complete activities of daily living and overall quality of life. Some of the major symptoms include anxiety, depression, sleep problems, headaches, light sensitivity, and difficulty reading. The root cause for these symptoms is under investigation by many in the field. Of interest, several of these symptoms such as headaches, ocular pain, light sensitivity, and sleep disturbances may overlap and share underlying circuitry influenced by the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). These cells are light sensing, but non-image forming, and they influence corneal function, pupillary constriction, and circadian rhythm. In this review, we discuss these symptoms and propose a role of the ipRGCs as at least one underlying and unifying cause for such symptoms.

### Predictors of early diabetic retinopathy regression with ranibizumab in the RIDE and RISE clinical trials [^c252f73d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Plain Language Summary

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a vision-threatening complication of diabetes. It can range in severity from mild, moderate, or severe nonproliferative DR (NPDR) to proliferative DR (PDR; the most severe form of the disease). The most common cause of vision loss in DR is the development of fluid around the light-sensitive cells in the center of the retina (called diabetic macular edema [DME]). Effective treatments are available, but not all patients achieve the same level or speed of improvement following treatment with the same drug. The purpose of this study was to take a look back at the clinical trials that first demonstrated the efficacy of ranibizumab in eyes with DR and DME in order to determine which factors made it more likely that a patient would achieve a rapid, robust improvement in DR severity during treatment with ranibizumab. This study found that patients with the most robust early improvements in DR severity (by month 6) were more likely to have had moderately severe or severe NPDR or PDR at the start of treatment (rather than less severe DR) and had their DME disappear after just 3 months of treatment.

### Decreased sensitivity of the circadian system to light in current, but not remitted depression [^5e39bb24]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Misalignment of circadian timing in patients with depression has commonly been reported, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. Individual differences in the sensitivity of the circadian system to light affect how the biological clock synchronizes with the external environment and can lead to misalignment of rhythms. We investigated the sensitivity of the circadian system to light in unmedicated (for > 3 months) women with a current or previous diagnosis of major depression, and healthy controls.

Methods

Baseline melatonin levels in dim light (< 1 lux) were assessed, followed by melatonin levels in normal indoor lighting of 100 lux in order to determine melatonin suppression.

Results

Patients currently experiencing a depressive episode showed significantly lower levels of melatonin suppression to light compared to remitted patients and controls, with large effect sizes. Remitted patients and controls showed similar suppression.

Limitations

The relatively small sample, and lack of long-term, within subject assessments, make it difficult to determine the potential causal role of reduced light sensitivity in the development of circadian disruption.

Conclusions

We conclude that hyposensitivity of the circadian system to light may contribute to circadian misalignment in patients with depression. Interventions that increase sensitivity to light or provide stronger light cues may assist in normalizing circadian clock function.

### Drug-induced photosensitivity: new insights into pathomechanisms and clinical variation through basic and applied science [^caa96ba4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Drug-induced photosensitivity occurs when a drug is capable of absorbing radiation from the sun (usually ultraviolet A) leading to chemical reactions that cause cellular damage (phototoxicity) or, more rarely, form photoallergens (photoallergy). The manifestation varies considerably in presentation and severity from mild pain to severe blistering. Despite screening strategies and guidelines in place to predict photoreactive drugs during development there are still new drugs coming onto the market that cause photosensitivity. Thus, there is a continuing need for dermatologists to be aware of the different forms of presentation and the culprit drugs. Management usually involves photoprotection and cessation of drug treatment. However, there are always cases where the culprit drug is indispensable. The reason why some patients are susceptible while others remain asymptomatic is not known. A potential mechanism for the phototoxic reactions is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and there are a number of reasons why some patients might be less able to cope with enhanced levels of ROS.

### Rosacea, light, and phototherapy [^53faa6e9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The long-established notion that rosacea is worsened by light is of particular concern in the phototherapy of diseases such as psoriasis, eczema, or vitiligo, which often can be coexistent with rosacea. A literature search was conducted and much evidence was found to challenge this belief that light adversely affects rosacea. In fact, more patients actually improved with sunlight in a more recent published survey. Several other studies have also shown that rosacea patients were similar to control subjects in sun exposure, solar skin damage, and sun sensitivity. Additionally, all clinical trials to date have failed to find a difference between rosacea patients and control subjects when challenged with ultraviolet light. Thus, phototherapy with rosacea may be safer than is commonly believed.

### Left-right and upper-lower light sensitivity asymmetry in visual field defects caused by pituitary adenoma: a retrospective observational study [^6701c1e3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Upper–Lower Asymmetry

The test points for severe scotoma, defined as a light sensitivity less than or equal to 5 dB, are shown as red circles in the numeric display of Humphrey 30–2 perimetry results in the representative case in Figure 3. Average light sensitivity in the right eye (4.2 dB) was lower than in the left eye (12.0 dB), so in this case data from the right eye were analyzed to study upper-lower asymmetry.

Figure 3
Representative perimetry results from a pituitary adenoma patient. Grayscale light sensitivity map (upper panel) and its numeric display (lower panel) from a patient with pituitary adenoma are shown. Points with severe scotoma (≤ 5 dB) are indicated by red circles.

The frequency of severe scotoma test points in the 28 cases is shown in Figure 4. The value at each test point shows the percentage of patients with less than or equal to 5-dB light sensitivity at the corresponding test point in their worse eye.

Figure 4
Frequency of severe scotoma in the worse eye. Each figure indicates the frequency (%) of light sensitivity equal to or less than 5 dB at each test point in the visual field of the worse eyes of patients. Test points with frequencies equal to or higher than 50% are indicated with gray shading.

Test points that show severe scotoma at frequencies of 50% or higher are observed in ten out of 18 (56%) points in the superotemporal quadrant but only three out of 18 (17%) points in the inferotemporal quadrant. The frequency of severe scotoma at the 18 test points in the superotemporal quadrant was thus significantly higher than in the inferotemporal quadrant (P = 0.00029, Mann–Whitney U -test; Figure 5 left).

### Altered pupillary light response scales with disease severity in migrainous photophobia [^30004ce9]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Background Autonomic dysfunction and light sensitivity are core features of the migraine attack. Growing evidence also suggests changes in these parameters between attacks. Though sensory and autonomic responses likely interact, they have not been studied together across the spectrum of disease in migraine. Methods We performed digital infrared pupillometry while collecting interictal photophobia thresholds (PPT) in 36 migraineurs (14 episodic; 12 chronic; 10 probable) and 24 age and sex-matched non-headache controls. Quantitative pupillary light reflexes (PLR) were assessed in a subset of subjects, allowing distinction of sympathetic vs parasympathetic pupillary function. A structured questionnaire was used to ascertain migraine diagnosis, headache severity, and affective symptoms. Results Photophobia thresholds were significantly lower in migraineurs than controls, and were lowest in chronic migraine, consistent with a disease-related gradient. Lower PPT correlated with smaller dark-adapted pupil size and larger end pupil size at PPT, which corresponded to a reduced diameter change. On PLR testing, measures of both parasympathetic constriction and sympathetic re-dilation were reduced in migraineurs with clinically severe migraine. Conclusions In summary, we show that severity of photophobia in migraine scales with disease severity, in association with shifts in pupillary light responses. These alterations suggest centrally mediated autonomic adaptations to chronic light sensitivity.

### The spectrum of sensitive skin: considerations for skin care in vulnerable populations [^0ae3d3eb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sensitive skin is a multifactorial condition, where the underlying pathology is not fully understood, and the clinical signs may not always be present or obvious. Despite this challenge, there has been recent progress to understand the different subtypes of sensitive skin, as well as new methods to measure the sensorial response that may not be obvious from visual examination. Similarly, there has been progress in understanding in the management of symptoms through skin care regimens designed for sensitive skin. The implications of this new research indicate the potential of better clinical outcomes for sensitive skin sufferers, as well as regimens more personalized to different triggers in the full spectrum of sensitive skin.

### Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern [^6b8f2d16]. Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Adult cataract — supplemental ophthalmic testing notes that supplemental preoperative ophthalmic tests are not specific for a cataract but may help to identify both the cause and level of severity of an individual's visual symptoms as well as the extent to which comorbidities may be contributing to these symptoms, and that for most patients an ophthalmologist can determine whether a cataract is responsible for an individual patient's visual loss by comparing slit-lamp biomicroscopy findings with the patient's specific symptoms; occasionally, a patient presents with visual symptoms that are disproportionate to the degree of cataract formation, and visual acuity testing alone does not quantify certain visual symptoms, such as disability due to glare and reduced contrast sensitivity. Optical testing indicates that glare testing determines the degree of visual impairment in the presence of light scatter, cataracts may produce a severe visual disability in brightly lit scenarios, the visual acuity of some patients with cataract may be normal or near normal in a darkened examination room but may drop significantly in the presence of glare, significant reduction in visual acuity with glare testing is by no means specific for cataract, correlation with slit-lamp biomicroscopy findings is required to establish cataract as the etiology, and stray light (or light scatter) can be measured and may be used for the evaluation of glare and indication for cataract surgery; contrast sensitivity testing measures the patient's ability to detect subtle variations in shading and is a more comprehensive and time-consuming measure of visual function than Snellen testing, may demonstrate a loss of visual function that is not appreciated by Snellen testing alone, and is not a specific indicator of cataract.

### Casein kinase I δ mutations in familial migraine and advanced sleep phase [^b8e397de]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common disabling disorder with a significant genetic component, characterized by severe headache and often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and light sensitivity. We identified two families, each with a distinct missense mutation in the gene encoding casein kinase Iδ (CKIδ), in which the mutation cosegregated with both the presence of migraine and advanced sleep phase. The resulting alterations (T44A and H46R) occurred in the conserved catalytic domain of CKIδ, where they caused reduced enzyme activity. Mice engineered to carry the CKIδ-T44A allele were more sensitive to pain after treatment with the migraine trigger nitroglycerin. CKIδ-T44A mice also exhibited a reduced threshold for cortical spreading depression (believed to be the physiological analog of migraine aura) and greater arterial dilation during cortical spreading depression. Astrocytes from CKIδ-T44A mice showed increased spontaneous and evoked calcium signaling. These genetic, cellular, physiological, and behavioral analyses suggest that decreases in CKIδ activity can contribute to the pathogenesis of migraine.

### Photophobia and allodynia in persistent post-traumatic headache are associated with higher disease burden [^6ab9c784]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess photophobia and allodynia in subjects with post-traumatic headache and examine how these sensory hypersensitivities associate with clinical measures of disease burden.

Background

Post-traumatic headache is the most frequent and disabling long-term consequence of mild traumatic brain injury. There is evidence of sensory dysfunction in acute post-traumatic headache, and it is known from other headache conditions that sensory amplifications correlate with more severe disease. However, systematic studies in post-traumatic headache are surprisingly scarce.

Methods

We tested light and tactile sensitivity, along with measures of disease burden, in 30 persistent post-traumatic headache subjects and 35 controls.

Results

In all, 79% of post-traumatic headache subjects exhibited sensory hypersensitivity based on psychophysical assessment. Of those exhibiting hypersensitivity, 54% exhibited both light and tactile sensitivity. Finally, sensory thresholds were correlated across modalities, as well as with headache attack frequency.

Conclusions

In this study, post-traumatic headache subjects with both light and tactile sensitivity had significantly higher headache frequencies and lower sensitivity thresholds to both modalities, compared to those with single or no sensory hypersensitivity. This pattern suggests that hypersensitivity across multiple modalities may be functionally synergistic, reflect a higher disease burden, and may serve as candidate markers of disease.

### How do I manage functional visual loss [^c9f66ff3]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of photophobia

Photophobia is common in functional visual loss. A study looking at 34 consecutive patients who wear sunglasses in clinic found that 79% had functional visual loss, with nearly all of them citing photophobia and/or headache. The authors of the paper suggested this might be a phenomenon designed to emphasise visual loss or copy famous individuals with blindness such as Stevie Wonder. These authors considered use of sunglasses was not 'reasonable' in this group. However, in our experience, the behaviour develops primarily because of photophobia which can become extreme, for example sitting in a darkened room because taking the glasses off is uncomfortable. The use of sunglasses is therefore reasonable to the patient and has short term benefits, although in the longer term makes things worse. We recommend starting by explaining that the brain is sensitive, but the more you wear sunglasses the more sensitive it becomes. Management involves graded sensitisation to light which may involve a structured plan to have reductions in opacity of sunglasses or spend longer and longer without sunglasses. This kind of graded exposure is generically familiar territory for clinical psychology, for example in relation to insect or flying phobia, but they may need support to understand that this approach can also work for photophobia. A clinical psychologist may be helpful but is not always essential to help people wean themselves off sunglasses in our experience.

### Pain following endoscopic foreheadplasty surgery in women [^82e21c48]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Endoscopic foreheadplasty surgery (EFS) is a common procedure; however, little has been reported about the nature or treatment of postoperative headache pain and associated symptoms.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to describe the intensity, quality, location, and duration of headache pain in women following EFS. We also compared post-EFS symptoms with migraine, described medication use and efficacy, and measured emotional and functional outcomes.

Methods

This descriptive study used an observational repeated-measures design. Forty-two women (mean [standard deviation] age, 59.0[7.9] years) undergoing EFS were prospectively recruited from 12 private cosmetic practices in 3 California counties. Telephone interviews with the Acute Short-Form 12v2 and the Headache Pain Questionnaire were conducted on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, 7, and 30.

Results

On POD 1, 93% reported at least moderate pain and 64% severe pain. Severe pain was characterized as throbbing (71%), sharp (53%), dull (76%), exploding (41%), imploding (53%), continuous (53%), or intermittent (41%) on POD 1. Moderate pain was most frequent on POD 3 (21%) compared to POD 1 (19%), 7 (12%) and 30 (12%). Mild pain predominated on POD 3 (40%) and 7 (40%), with 20% remaining on POD 30. The majority (79%) of post-EFS symptoms included light sensitivity and nausea, and therefore met most International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for migraine. Analgesic use provided inconsistent relief. Functional and emotional status did not return to baseline throughout the 30-day postoperative period.

Conclusions

Immediately following EFS, most women experience moderate to severe headache pain, despite use of medications. Pain persists in many patients for up to 1 month. Headache is associated with migraine symptoms, including light sensitivity and nausea.

### Autonomic dysfunction in post-COVID patients with and witfhout neurological symptoms: a prospective multidomain observational study [^7c6a1be2]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Vision abnormalities have been reported in clinical practice by several COVID-19 and post-COVID individuals, including sore eyes and light sensitivity. Despite the possible influence of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization on ocular manifestations described in this sample, none of the participants reported eye complaints (e.g. acute conjunctivitis) during the acute phase of the disease, and an ANS involvement might be suspected. Indeed, pupil responses assessed with an automatic pupillometer were found impaired in patients recovering from COVID-19. Although this impairment might be present already during the acute phase in critically ill COVID-19 patients, controversial results have been found since ANS responses might be attenuated in the intensive care unit (ICU) population by ICU-related interventions, such as the administration of anesthetics, analgesics and inotropic medications that may have a prolonged effect. In our sample, about one-half of the participants reported ocular impairments, and light sensitivity was the most common complaint.

### Impaired rhodopsin generation in the rat model of diabetic retinopathy [^eca87283]. The American Journal of Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitusand the leading cause of severe vision loss and blindness in the working-age population in developed countries. Previous studies of DR were focused on microvascular damage in the retina. However, recent evidence strongly suggests that DR involves alterations in the neural retina. Patients with diabetes demonstrate functional deficits in dark adaptation, contrast sensitivity, and color perception. These functional changes can be identified before major retinal vascular pathologies, suggesting that they are due to a direct effect of diabetes on the function of the neural retina, rather than secondary to the vascular changes in diabetes. The molecular basis for these functional changes in early DR is unclear.

The major function of vitamin A in vision is to serve as a precursor for light-sensitive 11- cis- retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments. In vertebrates, vision begins with the absorption of photon by a light-sensitive visual pigment molecule, which is formed by an apoprotein opsin and a visual chromophore, 11- cis- retinal. On absorption of light, 11- cis -retinal is isomerized to all -trans- retinal. This isomerization leads to conformational changes of opsin and, thereafter, to phototransduction activation that initiates vision. The regeneration of 11- cis -retinal through a series of reactions between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the photoreceptor outer segment is referred to as the retinoid or visual cycle (Figure 1).

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^a0a41822]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Severe dry eye — beyond mild/moderate therapies, the following treatments may be considered for severe dry eye: permanent punctal occlusion can be accomplished by thermal or laser cautery with a stepwise approach so that no more than one punctum is cauterized in each eye at a session, and limited tarsorrhaphy for nonresponders. Autologous serum or autologous plasma rich in growth factors drops have been reported to improve ocular irritation symptoms and conjunctival/corneal dye staining in Sjögren's syndrome (I+, Insufficient, Strong), and a systematic review reported a benefit in symptoms with 20% autologous serum compared with artificial tears over 2 weeks; when repeated blood sampling is not possible, allogeneic serum eye drops have been shown to be an effective and safe alternative (I-, Insufficient, Discretionary). For filamentary keratitis, options include debridement (moistened cotton-tip applicator, cellulose sponge, or forceps), topical mucolytics such as N-acetylcysteine to decrease mucinous tear film viscosity, and soft contact lenses to prevent recurrence; if neurotrophic keratopathy is present, lenses should be used with caution due to infection risk, and insertion of a self-retaining or sutureless amniotic membrane in refractory cases should be considered with recognition of the short-term effect. Rigid gas-permeable scleral lenses have been used successfully for years, but use may be limited by fitting difficulties, cost, and patient ability to manage insertion and removal. Oral medications are available (I-, Moderate, Discretionary); cholinergic agonists such as cevimeline are FDA approved to treat dry mouth in Sjögren's syndrome, improve ocular irritation symptoms and aqueous tear production, and may have fewer adverse systemic side effects than oral pilocarpine. In a trial, pilocarpine 5 mg orally four times a day produced significantly greater improvement in the ability to focus during reading and in blurred vision versus placebo in Sjogren syndrome, but there was no improvement in light sensitivity, ocular discomfort, and other dry eye symptoms; the most common side effect was excessive sweating in over 40% of patients, and Two percent withdrew due to this and other drug-related side effects.

### Quantifying visual allodynia across migraine subtypes: the Leiden visual sensitivity scale [^48404553]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Enhanced sensitivity to light (photophobia) and patterns is common in migraine and can be regarded as visual allodynia. We aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire to easily quantify sensitivity to light and patterns in large populations, and to assess and compare visual allodynia across different migraine subtypes and states. We developed the Leiden Visual Sensitivity Scale (L-VISS), a 9-item scale (score range 0–36 points), based on literature and patient interviews, and examined its construct validity. Furthermore, we assessed ictal and interictal visual sensitivity in episodic migraine with (n = 67) and without (n = 66) aura and chronic migraine with (n = 20) and without (n = 19) aura, and in healthy controls (n = 86). Differences between migraine subtypes and states were tested using a linear mixed model with 3 fixed factors (episodic/chronic, with/without aura, and ictal/interictal). Test-retest reliability and construct validity of L-VISS were good. Leiden Visual Sensitivity Scale scores correlated in the expected direction with light discomfort (Kendall's τ = -0.25) and pattern glare tests (τ = 0.35). Known-group comparisons confirmed its construct validity. Within migraine subtypes, L-VISS scores were higher in migraine with aura versus without aura and in chronic versus episodic migraine. The linear mixed model showed all factors affected the outcome (P < 0.001). The L-VISS is an easy-to-use scale to quantify and monitor the burden of bothersome visual sensitivity to light and patterns in large populations. There are remarkable ictal and interictal differences in visual allodynia across migraine subtypes, possibly reflecting dynamic differences in cortical excitability.

### Looking for a beam of light to heal chronic pain [^e5cf2264]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The eyes are important visual organs. The eyes can perceive light and convert stimuli to electrical signals. Besides their function in imaging, they also have many nonimaging functions, participating in processes such as the circadian rhythm, sleep quality, mood, and learning. Recent studies also found that optical signals play an analgesic role. Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. It can be categorized as nociceptive (from tissue injury), neuropathic (from nerve injury), or nociplastic (from a sensitive nervous system). Chronic pain (CP) is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as "persistent or recurrent pain lasting longer than 3 months". Chronic pain is a very common disorder with an estimated global prevalence of about 20%. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 revealed that CP was the greatest cause of years lived with disability worldwide.

At present, treatment of CP is not efficient, causes side effects, and may lead to drug tolerance, which results in poor treatment outcomes and a heavy burden on patients. Although various nonpharmacological treatment methods are available, including surgery, regional anesthesia, neuromodulation, and rehabilitation programs, pain is not reduced to a sufficient degree in many CP patients. Generally speaking, pain is rarely completely eliminated, and highly effective treatment methods are still lacking. There is an urgent need to improve the pain treatment approaches without inducing adverse side effects.

Light therapy has several advantages; it is noninvasive, convenient, and cost-effective. Exposure to light of specific wavelengths and intensities has shown to be effective in the management of various health conditions, such as cancers, skin diseases, sleep disorders, and affective disorder. Recently, light therapy has been used for various pain conditions, including chronic nonspecific low back pain, fibromyalgia pain, migraine headaches, and neuropathic pain. Based on this technique, optogenetic techniques have been developed that enable the control of cellular activity through ectopic expression of light-activated optogenetic proteins in genetically modified target cells.

### Photophobia in migraine: a symptom cluster? [^d36447f8]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Closing remarks

The above review has considered photophobia in migraine only and has brought together the various components of visual discomfort that occur, under the assumption that cortical hyper-excitability provides a parsimonious common mechanism, at least for the interictal photophobia. The photophobia that occurs during a migraine attack is more extreme and may involve extra-cortical mechanisms. A limitation of the studies we have cited is that they have usually collected interictal data over relatively short time periods. Their findings may not reflect the performance of the visual system following hours in the dark, when longer term adaptive processes may ensue. Moreover, photophobia is a symptom in many disorders and cortical hyper-excitability is unlikely to provide a general explanation. Perhaps comparisons of the electroretinal and electroencephalographic response to light and pattern in the wide variety of conditions in which photophobia occurs will help to elucidate the retinal and cortical contributions to these complex symptoms and help identify the mechanisms specific to each condition.

### Conjunctivitis… [^13d27911]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. The conjunctiva is a thin membrane covering the inside of the eyelids and the white part of the eye. Inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva is called conjunctivitis. It can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi; allergy; exposure to chemicals or irritants; or long-term presence of a foreign body, such as hard or rigid contact lenses. Viruses causing the common cold can also result in conjunctivitis. The time course for viral conjunctivitis is similar to that of upper respiratory tract infections, with the worst symptoms occurring at 3 to 5 days and resolving in 7 to 14 days. Bacterial conjunctivitis is usually caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus. These bacteria live on human skin and can contaminate eye makeup or other products. Less commonly, chlamydia or gonorrhea infections can cause conjunctivitis.

Bacterial conjunctivitis usually resolves in 2 to 5 days without treatment but may need topical antibiotics. These types of infectious conjunctivitis are very contagious and easily spread between people. Signs and symptoms of conjunctivitis Redness Sensitivity to light Gritty sensation, itchiness, or burning Swollen eyelids Discharge Increased tears If symptoms do not resolve within the expected time frame, if you have a weakened immune system, or if any of the following symptoms are encountered, you should seek immediate medical attention. Moderate to severe eye pain or light sensitivity Decreased vision, blurred vision, or double vision that does not resolve after removing discharge from the eyes Increased redness of the eyes If someone has a cold or respiratory symptoms, conjunctivitis is likely caused by the same respiratory virus. Herpes conjunctivitis can occur when there are herpes-like blisters elsewhere on the body.

Bacterial conjunctivitis may cause thick yellow-green discharge. Watery discharge is more common with viruses.

### Retinal disease in the neurology clinic [^36ed484f]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Retinal disease can manifest with visual symptoms similar to those which result from central nervous system disorders. We provide a framework for considering retinal causes of common visual complaints presenting to a neurology clinic.

Recent Findings

Technological advances have afforded quicker detection and a more thorough understanding of these retinal entities and are crucial to consider when evaluating visual complaints in the neurology clinic.

Summary

It is essential to maintain a working knowledge of common retinal conditions that symptomatically overlap with common neurologic conditions. Furthermore, the ophthalmoscopic exam and retinal imaging modalities can both aid in the diagnosis and workup of visual complaints and neurologic disease.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^e4bc4d50]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Solar urticaria — management emphasizes avoidance of identified wavelengths of light, with broad-spectrum sunscreens generally reported to be of limited benefit because most patients are sensitive to visible wavelengths. H1-antihistamines have been reported variably to prevent or ameliorate symptoms with repeated sun exposure. Patients have also been desensitized using broadband UVB, narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB), UVA, and visible light therapy, and skin exposed to natural sunlight on a regular basis might become less reactive than skin routinely covered. In phototherapy-based desensitization, the usual starting dose is less than the previously determined MUD, and therapeutic irradiation of increasing dose is administered several times a week, requiring 15 to 20 treatments.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^8e9ff1e1]. DoD/VA (2021). High credibility.

Visual symptoms — background and urgent referral: Vision symptoms, including sensitivity to light, eye fatigue, difficulty focusing, and blurry vision occur acutely in some individuals who sustain mTBI, and most vision symptoms resolve within minutes or hours; however, for those with persistent difficulties, targeted assessments to guide symptom management during the first few weeks after mTBI are most effective. PCPs need to be aware of reasons for an urgent referral to an eye care provider, including vision loss or decline, diplopia, abnormal pupils, abnormal external eye exam, abnormal visual behavior, abnormal eye movements, or acute ocular symptoms; if visual symptoms persist and impact daily function, providers should refer patients to optometry, ophthalmology, neuro-ophthalmology, neurology, and/or vision rehabilitation team. Higher-order cognitive symptoms may be mistaken for ocular or vision issues, and occupational therapy vision assessment or behavioral neurology assessment may be very helpful in ruling out these symptoms.

### Utilizing visual symptoms to distinguish dry eye from glaucoma, cataract, and suspect glaucoma patients: a cross-sectional study [^2f400d0e]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Most common visual symptoms among different disease groups

Some symptoms were common amongst all groups (occurring in more than 50% of respondents in each group), including blurry vision, floaters, glare, and better vision in one eye. The most frequent symptoms for each group were light sensitivity (88%) in dry eye, better vision in one eye (62%) in glaucoma suspect and (94%) in glaucoma, and worsening vision (89%) in cataracts. Additionally, the symptoms that are more common in dry eye than any other group, and which occurred in more than half of dry eye patients, include glare (77%), floaters (73%), difficulty focusing (70%), vision that varies across the day (67%), halos (61%), and spots (56%). The seven symptoms that are more common in dry eye as compared to other groups is shown in Fig. 1, with significantly different distributions of frequency ratings (p < 0.05 for all) and severity ratings (p < 0.01) across disease groups.

Fig. 1
A Distribution of frequency responses for the seven symptoms most commonly experienced among at least 50% of dry eye patients. B Distribution of severity responses for the seven symptoms most commonly experienced among at least 50% of dry eye patients. Chi-squared test was used to compare the distribution of responses across all disease groups. ✱ p < 0.05, p < 0.001

Univariate analysis of symptoms that distinguish dry eye from glaucoma suspects, glaucoma, and cataract

In univariate analysis, comparison of frequency and severity of symptom associations with dry eye versus another disease yielded similar significant associations across symptoms. Therefore, the primary analysis for multivariable analysis was frequency of symptoms, as this is inclusive of the presence of having symptoms of any severity (i.e. patients who report symptoms of any severity must also experience the symptom at least rarely).

### Fatigue risk management in the workplace [^33eb83c8]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Night-shift light exposure — physiologic effects and intensity thresholds are noted as follows: During overnight shifts employees are much more sensitive to light, especially during the "window of circadian low" between approximately midnight and 6 AM in individuals synchronized to day work and nocturnal sleep, and there are three important effects of nocturnal light that can cause a mixture of desirable and undesirable outcomes: (1) phase resetting of the circadian clock; (2) stimulatory effects that directly increase levels of alertness, vigilance, and performance; and (3) increased health risks secondary to effects of nocturnal light exposure on neuroendocrine systems. Phase resetting can be produced by a single exposure to bright light (> 5000 lux) for 3 to 5 hours during nocturnal hours or multiple lower intensity exposures over several nights, either delaying the human circadian clock in the first half of the biological night or rapidly advancing the circadian clock when the light exposure occurs in the second half of the night. The 5000 lux illumination is quite low compared with natural outdoor lighting levels, which range higher than 100,000 lux on a bright sunny summer day to about 10,000 lux on a dark, cloudy day, whereas most indoor work places provide 50 to 200 lux or even less.

### Mindfulness based cognitive therapy modified for visual symptoms (MBCT-vision) (MBCT-vision) [^86acc368]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Overview This is a research study on Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for visual symptoms, to treat patients with debilitating symptoms of visual snow and is associated visual symptoms, severe light sensitivity and migrainous visual aura. Participants will receive an intervention of an 8-week MBCT course modified for visual symptoms, which will involve 8 weeks of once weekly group sessions and home practice between sessions. This is a research study on Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for visual symptoms, to treat patients with debilitating symptoms of visual snow and its associated visual symptoms, severe light sensitivity and migrainous visual aura. VS is a condition of persistent flickering dots, like that of an out-of-focus analog television screen, affecting the whole visual field. There can be associated visual symptoms such as after-images, and trailing of images.

No clinical trials for treatment have been done for VS. Instead, treatment data comes from patient case reports. Photophobia describes discomfort or pain to light stimulation. Causes include eye surface issues, migraine, or of an unknown trigger, and can be persistent despite optimum management of underlying causes. Patients with migrainous visual aura may have troublesome visual disturbances despite optimum migraine treatment. Previous studies have shown that dysfunction in brain pathways contribute to the above conditions. The investigators propose that MBCT, modified to incorporate aspects relevant to persistent and distressing visual symptoms, can improve these debilitating symptoms by modifying dysfunctional neural pathways and equip patients with skills that promote psychological resilience and improve coping with residual symptoms.

For this study, the investigators will assess the use of MBCT-vision in patients with visual snow or associated visual symptoms, migrainous visual aura or photophobia. This will be the first study of a mindfulness-based intervention in this population. Behavioral: Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy

### Retinal light toxicity [^d4deffb3]. Eye (2011). Low credibility.

The ability of light to enact damage on the neurosensory retina and underlying structures has been well understood for hundreds of years. While the eye has adapted several mechanisms to protect itself from such damage, certain exposures to light can still result in temporal or permanent damage. Both clinical observations and laboratory studies have enabled us to understand the various ways by which the eye can protect itself from such damage. Light or electromagnetic radiation can result in damage through photothermal, photomechanical, and photochemical mechanisms. The following review seeks to describe these various processes of injury and many of the variables, which can mitigate these modes of injury.

### Improved CoChR variants restore visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in a mouse model of blindness under ambient light conditions [^223225f7]. Molecular Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Severe photoreceptor cell death in retinal degenerative diseases leads to partial or complete blindness. Optogenetics is a promising strategy to treat blindness. The feasibility of this strategy has been demonstrated through the ectopic expression of microbial channelrhodopsins (ChRs) and other genetically encoded light sensors in surviving retinal neurons in animal models. A major drawback for ChR-based visual restoration is low light sensitivity. Here, we report the development of highly operational light-sensitive ChRs by optimizing the kinetics of a recently reported ChR variant, Chloromonas oogama (CoChR). In particular, we identified two CoChR mutants, CoChR-L112C and CoChR-H94E/L112C/K264T, with markedly enhanced light sensitivity. The improved light sensitivity of the CoChR mutants was confirmed by ex vivo electrophysiological recordings in the retina. Furthermore, the CoChR mutants restored the vision of a blind mouse model under ambient light conditions with remarkably good contrast sensitivity and visual acuity, as evidenced by the results of behavioral assays. The ability to restore functional vision under normal light conditions with the improved CoChR variants removed a major obstacle for ChR-based optogenetic vision restoration.

### Keratoconus disease classification with multimodel fusion and vision transformer: a pretrained model approach [^65a3b33e]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Keratoconus (KCN) is an eye condition characterised by the thinning and bulging of the cornea, which is the clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. This condition leads to visual distortions, sensitivity to light and other visual problems.KCN typically starts during the teenage years or early adulthood and progresses slowly over a period of several years. Although the precise cause of KCN not fully understood, it is believed to be a result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Treatment for KCN may include eyeglasses or contact lenses to improve vision, or more advanced treatments such as corneal cross-linking, which uses ultraviolet (UV) light and a special solution to strengthen the cornea or corneal transplant surgery. To detect KCN, it is important to have a comprehensive eye exam performed by an eye doctor or ophthalmologist. The exam may involve several tests to evaluate the shape, thickness and curvature of the cornea. Here are some common tests that are used to detect KCN:

### Restoration of visual function by transplantation of optogenetically engineered photoreceptors [^edf261ea]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Cell replacement therapy offers hope for the treatment of late-stage retinal degeneration, when the outer retinal photoreceptor layer is lost –. However, a remaining obstacle of photoreceptor replacement is that transplanted cells have to develop into functional photoreceptors with light sensitive outer segments (OS). Indeed, in mouse models of severe degeneration, the formation of light-sensitive OS by transplanted photoreceptors has been difficult to achieve –. Recent studies, using retinal sheet transplantation lead to major improvements in terms of OS formation and light sensitivity. Despite these promising results, a major problem has not yet been solved: photoreceptors need tight interaction with the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in order to maintain their structure and function via continuous disc shedding and renewal. Since in retinal degenerative diseases the RPE is often also compromised, the probability that transplanted photoreceptors stay sensitive to light is very low. To tackle this problem, we introduce optogenetic light sensors into photoreceptors, derived from the developing mouse retina as well as from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), and transplant them into mouse models of severe retinal degeneration. The key point of our approach is that these optogenetically-transformed photoreceptors stay functional based on the activity of the microbial opsin, even in the absence of properly formed OS and without the support from the RPE.

### Development and preliminary evaluation of a short self-report measure of generalized pain hypersensitivity [^a5aebc72]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite recently increased interest in identifying the presence or assessing the severity of generalized pain hypersensitivity, the GPQ is the first dedicated self-report measure that specifically assesses commonly associated symptoms. Most studies to date have used short screeners originally developed for assessing neuropathic pain symptoms instead of assessing generalized pain hypersensitivity. For instance, several recent studies have suggested that the PDQ, a short neuropathic pain screener, may also be useful for identifying individuals with abnormal central pain processing.–The GPQ arguably has higher content validity for assessing widespread pain hypersensitivity, since the questionnaire was developed based on typical symptoms for generalized pain hypersensitivity described in the literature, followed by a qualitative study with rheumatic patients with atypical pain symptoms suggestive of generalized pain hypersensitivity.

The Pain Sensitivity Questionnairealso measures self-reported pain sensitivity, but includes only items measuring intensity ratings of imagined painful situations, as opposed to actual complaints, such as those measured by the GPQ. Moreover, the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire includes only items related to allodynia (eg, walking across a cool tiled floor with bare feet) and hyperalgesia (eg, trapping your finger in a drawer), and does not include other important signs of generalized pain hypersensitivity, such as aftersensations and spreading of pain. Finally, another frequently used instrument is the Central Sensitization Inventory. This assesses a long list of 25 health-related symptoms that are common to central sensitization syndromes in general. However, only five of these items focus on pain-related symptoms, whereas the other items assess a wide range of aspecific symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating and sensitivity to light. Consequently, its length and content also limit is usefulness for those interested in measuring generalized pain-hypersensitivity symptoms per se.

### Clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide (neuac) [^94f8c7ea]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Colitis: Clindamycin can cause severe colitis, which may result in death. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of clindamycin. Neuac®(clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. (5.1)
Ultraviolet light and environmental exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps): Minimize sun exposure following drug application. (5.2)

5.1 Colitis

Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of clindamycin. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin. If significant diarrhea occurs, Neuac®(clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5% should be discontinued.

Severe colitis has occurred following oral and parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death.

Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically.

5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure

Benzoyl peroxide, a component of Neuac®(clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 1.2%/5%, may cause increased sensitivity to sunlight. Minimize sun exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps) following drug application. [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution.

5.13 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity

Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.14 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing moxifloxacin hydrochloride in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Retinal sensitivity changes in early / intermediate AMD: a systematic review and meta-analysis of visual field testing under mesopic and scotopic lighting [^82a000e1]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future research

The main limitation of this review lies in the argument that there are several other less onerous measures of low-light function such as low-luminance visual acuity and deficit which may produce similar sensitivity/specificity regarding AMD. However, these measures are yet to be systematically reviewed and are spatially indiscriminate. Visual fields can map functional changes in concordance with spatial patterns of AMD structural changes, providing spatial structure-function context as to which neuronal/synaptic, vascular, and/or physiological mechanisms may be impacted. As aforementioned, visual fields have not necessarily been propositioned to replace other diagnostic tools (such as colour fundus photography) for early/intermediate AMD, but rather as a supplementary tool to enhance diagnostic confidence and provide prognostic information in consideration of patients' visual function and QoL.

Additionally, there was a dearth of data regarding downstream effects of performing visual fields on patient-relevant outcomes. The data suggested that current measures of patient-relevant outcomes in the early stages of AMD may be insensitive to the magnitude and/or scope of changes, though this does not preclude patient relevance, particularly as the disease progresses in severity. Research that explores the advantage of performing a spatially delineated functional test in association with more practical scenarios, e.g. whether visual fields can predict orientation and mobility or driving capabilities, could be more beneficial in future.

### Perception and production of biological movement in patients with early periventricular brain lesions [^5dd1147d]. Brain (2003). Low credibility.

Recent neuroimaging and psychophysical findings suggest that perception and production of human body motion share a common representational network. In the present study, we address the issue of whether early disorders in production of biological movement correspond to impairment in biological motion perception. By using the simultaneous masking paradigm, we examined visual sensitivity to biological motion in adolescents (aged 13–16 years) who were born very preterm (at 27–33 gestational weeks). In a confidence rating procedure, the presence of a point-light walking figure embedded in a moving mask was judged. The participants differed in their locomotion ability, ranging from normal to a complete walking disability exhibiting signs of leg-dominated bilateral spastic cerebral palsy (BS-CP) caused by periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). Irrespective of an ability to produce movement, patients with a similar extent of PVL in the parieto-occipital complex exhibit nearly the same sensitivity to biological motion. Sensitivity correlates negatively with the extent of PVL over the parieto-occipital complex, whereas neither the severity of motor disorder nor the severity of pyramidal tract affection relate significantly to the sensitivity index. The data suggest that perception of biological motion is not substantially affected by an observer's early restrictions in body movement. Instead, the findings favour the assumption that the common network for perception and production of biological motion might be inherent for the brain. Motor experience per se does not appear to be necessary for the visual analysis of human movement.

### Warm acupuncture for fibromyalgia with increased cold sensitivity: a cross-over randomised controlled trial [^4a05c622]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Although approximately 85% of fibromyalgia patients exhibit increased sensitivity to cold, no therapy is available for this particular subgroup. This exploratory clinical trial to evaluate the effect of warm acupuncture, a traditional and common used acupuncture therapy, in treating fibromyalgia patients with high cold sensitivity.

Methods

This randomised, single-blinded, cross-over preliminary study involved an 8-weeks observation and 8-weeks intervention. Thirty-eight patients were assigned to either warm acupuncture group or observation group for 8 weeks randomly, then the assignment switched. The primary outcome was the change in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for cold sensitivity. Secondary outcomes included changes in sensitivity to pain, wind, noise, bright light, and odor assessed by VAS, and series of specialised scales regarding other common fibromyalgia symptoms. A modified intention-to-treat analysis was used to compare differences.

Results

The VAS for cold sensitivity decreased by 2.31-cm in the treatment period and by 0.83-cm in the observation period at week 8 (MD, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.28 to 2.67; p = 0.019), and the between-group difference became apparent starting at week 4 (MD, 1.16; 95% CI, -0.03 to 2.36; p = 0.015). The secondary efficacy measures, including the VAS for pain, wind, and the Polysymptomatic Distress Scale scores, showed greater improvement during the treatment period compared with that in the observation period at week 8. Adverse events were infrequent and minor.

Conclusions

Warm acupuncture may reduce the heightened sensitivity to cold, pain and wind, as well as the severity of the fibromyalgia in those patients with cold intolerance.

Colitis: Clindamycin can cause severe colitis, which may result in death. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of clindamycin. Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% should be discontinued if significant diarrhea occurs. (5.1)
Ultraviolet light and environmental exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps): Minimize sun exposure following drug application. (5.2)

5.1 Colitis

Systemic absorption of clindamycin has been demonstrated following topical use of clindamycin. Diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin. If significant diarrhea occurs, Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5% should be discontinued.

Severe colitis has occurred following oral and parenteral administration of clindamycin with an onset of up to several weeks following cessation of therapy. Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and/or worsen severe colitis. Severe colitis may result in death.

Studies indicate a toxin(s) produced by Clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C. difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically.

5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure

Benzoyl peroxide, a component of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel, 1.2%/5%, may cause increased sensitivity to sunlight. Minimize sun exposure (including use of tanning beds or sun lamps) following drug application. [See Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution.

### Sleep disturbances in traumatic brain injury: associations with sensory sensitivity [^a6ddb3b9]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Sleep disturbances following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Veterans are very common and often persist as chronic sequelae. In addition, sensory sensitivity, ie, discomfort upon exposure to light and noise, is common after TBI. However, the relationship between sleep disturbances and sensory sensitivity in Veterans following TBI has not yet been examined, yet both are established early markers of neurodegeneration.

Methods

Veterans (n = 95) in the chronic phase of recovery from TBI at the VA Portland Health Care System completed an overnight polysomnography and provided self-report data on sensory (eg, light and noise) sensitivity, and sleep disturbances. Participants were categorized into four sensory sensitivity groups: (1) "neither", neither light nor noise sensitivity (n = 36); (2) "light", only light sensitivity (n = 12); (3) "noise", only noise sensitivity (n = 24); and (4) "both", light and noise sensitivity (n = 23).

Results

Veterans with TBI reported sleep disturbances that were significantly correlated with the severity of their sensory sensitivity and associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Multiple linear regression revealed insomnia severity to be the strongest predictor of the relationship between sleep disturbances and sensory sensitivity. Furthermore, sensory sensitivity was associated with a higher mean heart rate during sleep, even after controlling for PTSD status.

Conclusions

These data are the first to report the prevalence and association between sensory sensitivity and sleep disturbances in Veterans with TBI. These data also suggest that the underlying mechanism of the sleep-sensory relationship could be due in part to comorbid PTSD and autonomic nervous system hyperarousal.

### Drug-induced photosensitivity [^e40ba530]. Dermatologic Clinics (2014). Low credibility.

Drug-induced photosensitivity is common. The principal mechanism of systemic drug photosensitivity is phototoxicity and the principal mechanism of topical drug photosensitivity is photoallergy. Photopatch testing is helpful to determine suspected topical agent photoallergies (eg, from ultraviolet filters in sunscreens) but generally not helpful in detecting systemic drug photosensitivity. Drug-induced photosensitivity is usually best managed by stopping the suspected drug. Other measures, including phototherapy using wavelengths that do not elicit the response, are sometimes necessary.

### Llevofloxacin (levofloxacin) [^63e30d00]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.14 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity

Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (e.g., burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, "V" area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Drug therapy should be discontinued if photosensitivity/phototoxicity occurs [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.15 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing levofloxacin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Ménière's disease (MD) evaluation and testing — Your health care provider will ask questions to get a history of your symptoms and may also send you for additional testing, with questions covering frequency, duration, severity, associated hearing loss and tinnitus, falls, headaches, light/sunlight sensitivity, motion sensitivity, and family history. Keeping a journal of symptoms can help your health care provider make an accurate diagnosis, and sometimes it takes many visits to diagnose MD. Your health care provider may have you get the following testing: an audiogram with no significant risk of testing and a duration of about 30 minutes; a video- or electronystagmogram with risks of vertigo and nausea, tests that are time-consuming (about 1 hour), and potential discomfort with changes in body positions; electrocochleography with risks that include discomfort in the ear; and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in which intravenous contrast is often required, patients with stainless-steel or non titanium implants may not be able to have MRI, and risks include allergy to contrast dye and discomfort with intravenous placement.

### Photic hypersensitivity in the premonitory phase of migraine – a positron emission tomography study [^3c127c10]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Sensitivity to light (photophobia) is a common ill-understood symptom of migraine, whose neurobiology is important in understanding the disorder.

Methods

Patients reporting premonitory symptoms before migraine headache were infused with nitroglycerin (GTN) at a first visit. Patients who responded with premonitory symptoms followed by a delayed headache resembling their migraine had positron emission tomography (PET) scans at least 1 week later, during which GTN infusion was repeated. H2 (15) O PET scans were performed during baseline (pain free), premonitory phase (pain free) and migraine headache. Patients were divided into two groups, with and without photophobia in the premonitory phase. The differences between the premonitory and baseline scans were analysed within groups and between groups using statistical parametric mapping.

Results

Thirteen patients participated in the PET study, 10 of whom had at least one PET scan during the premonitory phase in the absence of pain. Data from these 10 patients were included in the final analysis. Five patients had photophobia and five patients did not have photophobia in the premonitory phase. Comparing the premonitory scans to baseline scans, there was activation of extrastriate visual cortex (BA18) in patients with photophobia. This activation was significantly greater than in the patients without photophobia.

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that photic hypersensitivity is linked to activation of the visual cortex during the premonitory phase of migraine in the absence of headache.

### Quantifying visual allodynia across migraine subtypes: the Leiden visual sensitivity scale [^23402900]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

2.2. Development of Leiden Visual Sensitivity Scale and data collection

Items for the self-report scale to quantify sensitivity for light and patterns were based on the migraine literature, and structured in-depth interviews with patients with migraine. After several revisions, using the feedback of patients with migraine from think-aloud interview sessions, we selected the items. For all items, we used a 5-point Likert-type response scale, to measure the degree rather than presence of visual sensitivity, and 5-point scales yield the best data quality. Per item, these 5 options were provided: "not at all" (0 points), "slightly" (1 point), "moderately" (2 points), "severely" (3 points), and "very severely" (4 points). Outcome of the scale (L-VISS score) is defined as the sum of the responses to all 9 questions (range 0–36 points). Participants were instructed to complete the questionnaire (a web-based or identical printed version) based on their experiences during the last month. Controls completed the questionnaire once. Participants with migraine completed the questionnaire twice, once while focusing on the interictal state and once while focusing on the ictal state. Patients with chronic migraine could opt-out for the interictal part of the questionnaire if they felt unable to identify an interictal state.

2.3. Measuring pattern glare and light discomfort

As part of the validation process of L-VISS, pattern glare and light sensitivity were measured in subgroups of controls and participants with episodic migraine in-between attacks, ie, at least 3 days after the last attack and at least 3 days before the next attack. Those who got an attack within 3 days after the measurement day were excluded. Measurements took place on the same day on which the participants completed L-VISS for the first time: first the pattern glare test and then, after an interval of at least 5 minutes, the light discomfort test. Participants with chronic migraine were not included in these experiments because they were not expected to be free of migraine for 6 consecutive days. We considered ictal state tests too burdensome for patients.

### Highly robust and soft biohybrid mechanoluminescence for optical signaling and illumination [^63163ae5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Mechanoluminescence is a process of light emission caused by mechanical actions on a material, which can be easily detected in a dark environment –. Most mechanoluminescent materials are inorganic solids such as SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu 2+ and ZnS:Cu/Mn 2+, which are stiff and brittle, and thus not compatible with soft and stretchable devices –. Recently, mechanoluminescent ceramic particles have been embedded into elastomers to make a stretchable composite, which however still requires a large strain rate and stress to produce light. More recently, mechanophore molecules have also been incorporated into polymer networks to make soft and stretchable elastomers, most of which can emit light caused by bond breakage. However, the destructive feature does not allow the reuse of the material and the intensity of the generated light is usually very weak. In contrast, bioluminescent phenomena are quite common in nature, generating light with high energy efficiency –. Designing an electronics-free and soft biohybrid mechanoluminescent device with simple fabrication process, instantaneous response, high sensitivity, and a long lifetime may enable untethered, small scale, and intelligent systems. However, to our knowledge, such designs have not yet been achieved.

The goal of the present study is to explore the feasibility of building a soft and robust biohybrid mechanoluminescent device that incorporates bioluminescent dinoflagellates, unicellular marine algae that are common sources of ocean bioluminescence. Bioluminescent organisms are broadly distributed across the marine and terrestrial environments, with their light emission functioning in defense against predators, mate attraction, prey attraction and illumination, and intraspecific communication –. Here, we present a simple approach to integrate bioluminescent dinoflagellates with soft materials to build a highly stretchable, power-free, and ultra-sensitive mechanoluminescence. Dinoflagellate bioluminescence is a response to mechanical stress –, due to flow and touch, involving a complex intracellular signaling pathway –. Such bioluminescence is a visibly remarkable phenomenon often occurring in coastal areas (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Stress levels as low as several Pa can activate dinoflagellate bioluminescence with a latency from stimulus to response of only 15–20 ms –, resulting in ultra-high and near-instantaneous force sensitivity. Most notably, dinoflagellates can be very robust, tolerating different conditions with a functional bioluminescent response that serves as a reporter of mechanical stress for ocean, and laboratory – visualization (Supplementary Movie 1).

### Human photosensitivity: from pathophysiology to treatment [^ccff7c4d]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Photosensitivity is a condition detected on the electroencephalography (EEG) as a paroxysmal reaction to Intermittent Photic Stimulation (IPS). This EEG response, elicited by IPS or by other visual stimuli of daily life, is called Photo Paroxysmal Response (PPR). PPRs are well documented in epileptic and non-epileptic subjects. Photosensitivity rarely in normal individuals evolves into epilepsy. Photosensitive epilepsy is a rare refex epilepsy characterized by seizures in photosensitive individuals. The development of modern technology has increased the exposition to potential seizure precipitants in people of all ages, but especially in children and adolescents. Actually, videogames, computers and televisions are the most common triggers in daily life of susceptible persons. The mechanisms of generation of PPR are poorly understood, but genetic factors play an important rule. The control of visually induced seizures has, generally a good prognosis. In patients known to be visually sensitive, avoidance of obvious source and stimulus modifications are very important and useful to seizure prevention, but in the large majority of patients with epilepsy and photosensitivity antiepileptic drugs are needed.

### ACSM expert consensus statement: injury prevention and exercise performance during cold-weather exercise [^d83adbbc]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

Snow blindness — ultraviolet (UV) exposure risks, clinical course, and prevention are detailed: The structures of the eye are vulnerable to damage from exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, with risk increasing at high altitudes (increases 4% per 300 m ascent), and in a snowy environment at 2000 m, UV exposure is doubled. "Snow blindness" results from acute UV ocular injury with symptoms that begin 4 to 10 h after exposure and last < 48 h (or several days if severe). Prevention includes sunglasses or goggles with side protection, which absorb > 95% of all UV light; soft contact lenses that block UV-light and cover the pupil and limbus offer good protection; and brimmed hats for additional shade.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Skin irritation: Erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning may be experienced with use of AKLIEF Cream. Use a moisturizer from the initiation of treatment, and, if appropriate, reduce the frequency of application of AKLIEF Cream, suspend or discontinue use. (5.1)
Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure: Minimize exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Use sunscreen and protective clothing over treated areas when exposure cannot be avoided. (5.2)

5.1 Skin Irritation

Patients using AKLIEF Cream may experience erythema, scaling, dryness, and stinging/burning. Maximum severity of these reactions typically occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment, and severity decreased with continued use of the medication. Depending upon the severity of these adverse reactions, instruct patients to use a moisturizer, reduce the frequency of application of AKLIEF Cream, or suspend use temporarily. If severe reactions persist the treatment may be discontinued.

Avoid application of AKLIEF Cream to cuts, abrasions, or eczematous or sunburned skin. Use of "waxing" as a depilatory method should be avoided on skin treated with AKLIEF Cream.

5.2 Ultraviolet Light and Environmental Exposure

Minimize unprotected exposure to ultraviolet rays (including sunlight and sunlamps) during treatment with AKLIEF Cream. Warn patients who normally experience high levels of sun exposure and those with inherent sensitivity to sun to exercise caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided.

### Promethazine hci [^0fd2b3db]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of promethazine hydrochloride, antipsychotic drugs, if any, and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

Since recurrences of NMS have been reported with phenothiazines, the reintroduction of promethazine hydrochloride should be carefully considered.

Sulfite Sensitivity

Promethazine hydrochloride injection contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthma episodes, in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.

Visual Inspection

This product is light sensitive and should be inspected before use and discarded if either color or particulate is observed.

### Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells are the primary but not exclusive circuit for light aversion [^24a92185]. Experimental Eye Research (2012). Low credibility.

Photoallodynia (photophobia) occurs when normal levels of light cause pain ranging from uncomfortable to debilitating. The only current treatment for photoallodynia is light avoidance. The first step to understanding the mechanisms of photoallodynia is to develop reliable animal behavioral tests of light aversion and identify the photoreceptors required to initiate this response. A reliable light/dark box behavioral assay was developed that measures light aversion independently from anxiety, allowing direct testing of one endophenotype of photoallodynia in mice. Mice lacking intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) exhibit reduced aversion to bright light, suggesting these cells are the primary circuit for light aversion. Mice treated with exogenous μ opiate receptor agonists exhibited dramatically enhanced light aversion, which was not dependent on ipRGCs, suggesting an alternative pathway for light is engaged. Morphine enhances retinal electrophysiological responses to light but only at low levels. This suggests that for the dramatic light aversion observed, opiates also sensitize central brain regions of photoallodynia. Taken together, our results suggest that light aversion has at least two dissociable mechanisms by which light causes specific allodynia behaviors: a primary ipRGC-based circuit, and a secondary ipRGC-independent circuit that is unmasked by morphine sensitization. These models will be useful in delineating upstream light sensory pathways and downstream avoidance pathways that apply to photoallodynia.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^5f790e35]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Solar urticaria — clinical features and natural history describe rapid onset of wheals with sun exposure, generally within 1–3 minutes, with typical wheals developing within 1 to 3 minutes and a 1- to 3-hour delay reported but less typical. Symptoms usually resolve after stopping exposure, usually within 30 minutes and almost always within 24 hours, though in rare cases they can persist for more than 24 hours. It is initially present in pediatric and older adult (age > 65 years) patients, with a usual age of onset between 20 and 41 years, and retrospective studies suggest resolution in 15% to 86% of patients after 5 years of symptoms. Triggers include UVB (280–320 nm), UVA (320–400 nm), visible light (400–600 nm), and even infrared (> 600 nm) radiation.

### How well do vital signs identify children with serious infections in paediatric emergency care? [^ba1e403f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether vital signs identify children with serious infections, and to compare their diagnostic value with that of the Manchester triage score (MTS) and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) traffic light system of clinical risk factors.

Design

Prospective cohort of children presenting with suspected acute infection. We recorded vital signs, level of consciousness, activity level, respiratory distress, hydration and MTS category.

Setting

Paediatric assessment unit at a teaching hospital in England.

Participants

700 children (median age 3 years), of whom 357 (51.0%) were referred from primary care, 198 (28.3%) self-referrals and 116 (16.6%) emergency ambulance transfers. Just over half (383 or 54.7%) were admitted.

Main Outcome Measures

Severity of infection categorised as serious, intermediate, minor or not infection.

Results

Children with serious or intermediate infections (n = 313) were significantly more likely than those with minor or no infection (n = 387) to have a temperature ≥ 39 degrees C, tachycardia, saturations ≤ 94% or capillary refill time (CRT) > 2 seconds. Having one or more of temperature ≥ 39 degrees C, saturations ≤ 94%, tachycardia and tachypnoea was 80% (95% CI 75% to 85%) sensitive and 39% (95% CI 34% to 44%) specific for serious or intermediate infection. This was comparable to the MTS score (84% sensitive, 38% specific), and the NICE traffic light system (85% sensitive, 29% specific).

Conclusions

A combination of vital signs can be used to differentiate children with serious infections from those with less serious infections in a paediatric assessment unit and has comparable sensitivity to more complicated triage systems. The diagnostic value of combined vital signs and the NICE traffic light system remains to be determined in populations where the prevalence of severe illness is much lower.

### Cardiac troponin in patients with light Chain and transthyretin cardiac Amyloidosis: state-of-the-art review [^f9cf353b]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is an infiltrative disease caused by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the extracellular matrix, progressively leading to organ damage and dysfunction.CA now is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure, particularly with preserved ejection fraction. The 2 main types of amyloidosis that can involve the heart, amyloid light chain (AL) and amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis, are pathophysiologically different. In AL amyloidosis, the amyloid precursor proteins are immunologic light chains (LCs) most commonly produced by a plasma cell clone. In ATTR amyloidosis, either variant (hereditary) ATTR (ATTRv) amyloidosis or wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) amyloidosis, the precursor protein is ATTR, which is produced predominantly by the liver and serves as a carrier for thyroxine and retinol. Although the disease management, course, and prognosis of AL and ATTR CA are different, at present, effective treatment options exist for both. The efficacy of these treatment options is dependent on disease stage at the time of diagnosis, determined mainly by the severity of cardiac involvement, which can be assessed using cardiac biomarkers and imaging techniques. Cardiac troponin (cTn) is the biomarker of choice for the detection of myocardial injury, and it is frequently found to be elevated in patients with CA, in particular when high-sensitivity assays are used. The extent of abnormalities in cTn is of crucial prognostic significance in these patients. In this review, we elucidate the significant aspects of cTn biology, measurement, and interpretation when it is used adjunctively to assist in the management of patients with CA. The multiplicity of possible causes for myocardial injury in these patients are addressed, with particular focus on the relevant pathophysiological mechanisms and common clinical scenarios.

### Retinitis pigmentosa: burden of disease and current unmet needs [^01af6bff]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Disease Presentation and Progression

The initial symptoms of RP most commonly appear in young adulthood, with over three-quarters of patients developing symptoms by 30 years of age. However, due to delays in referral and diagnosis, diagnosis can often be delayed, with the average age of RP diagnosis reported to be 35.1 years (Figure 5).

Figure 5
RP diagnosis age based on the onset of symptoms, split by genotype. Data from these studies.

Both clinical presentation and the age of onset of symptoms varies widely, dependent on the genotype (Figure 5). 4 For example, individuals with the autosomal recessive (AR) form of RP will become symptomatic in their early teenage years, whereas those with autosomal dominant (AD) RP may not experience symptoms until aged 20–30 yearsor in some cases, until aged over 50 years.

As the pathophysiology of RP begins with the death of rod photoreceptors, patients initially present with night blindness and difficulties with dark adaptation. In some cases, RP patients can present with loss of mid-peripheral vision although this is not a common early symptom. As disease progresses, central cone degeneration leads to a decline in visual acuity, which typically becomes apparent in middle age. The central retina remains relatively preserved in the early stages of disease and patients only experience a narrowing field of vision as the disease progresses. In mid-stage disease, dyschromatopsia often becomes present and patients may become photophobic.

Patients of all genotypes will likely experience tunnel vision in the advanced stages of the disease (Figure 6). Due to severe restrictions in the visual field, most patients are classified as legally blind by the age of 40, ie, 20/200 vision or worse in the better eye or visual field restriction to ≤ 20° diameter, and typically, patients lose central vision by the age of 60. As visual acuity worsens, patients experience a greater impact on their daily lives (Table 3). Although most patients will become legally blind, complete loss of vision is relatively uncommon.

### Photophobia in a blind patient: an alternate visual pathway. case report [^581a91c7]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Photophobia is a common neurological and ophthalmological symptom that has been associated with a growing number of neurosurgical conditions, especially compressive lesions. The exact signaling pathways and neurophysiological features of the disorder are not well understood; however, data from multiple studies have shown the significance of the trigeminal system and the pretectal nuclei in its pathophysiology. The authors report on a rare case of a blind patient who presented with photophobia without evidence of light perception. They also review the literature and early experimental data in an effort to understand the possible neuronal pathways and structures involved in photophobia.

### Light-dark patterns mirroring shift work accelerate atherosclerosis and promote vulnerable lesion phenotypes [^d94485b4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The central clock synchronizes peripheral molecular clocks to the day‐night cycle, and light‐dark patterns reaching the retina are the primary entraining environmental cue to the 24‐hour solar day. 1 Circadian disruption resulting from disrupted light‐dark patterns, such as that experienced by shift workers, leads to metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, and compelling epidemiological data have linked shift work to a higher incidence of atherosclerosis‐related vascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. 2 Unfortunately, as a 24‐hour society we cannot eliminate shift work, and there is an urgent need to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop preventive strategies for at‐risk populations. Studies in mice have significantly advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis of a vast number of diseases, and mice are a common preclinical model for translational research. However, knowledge from lighting interventions in mice cannot be easily translated to humans, because, although mice and humans share some of the same photoreceptors, their sensitivities to light are very different. In most species the sensitivity of the circadian system to light is generally irradiance dependent, that is, once above threshold, the higher the irradiances at the cornea, the greater the response until it reaches a saturation point. In humans exposure to the normal indoor light in office environments at night induces intermediate levels of melatonin suppression. 3 However, mice are 3000 to 10 000 times more sensitive to optical radiation than humans. Typical indoor light in laboratory facilities, for example, is above saturation for the mouse circadian system. 4 Moreover, the spectral sensitivity in nocturnal rodents peaks close to 500 nm, whereas the spectral sensitivity of acute melatonin suppression peaks at 460 nm in humans. 4 In agreement with other studies, previously we determined that an irradiance ≈0.1 μW/cm 2 of green light (peak λ = 519 nm) is below threshold for activation of the murine circadian system, and saturation of the response was achieved at ≈10 μW/cm 2. An irradiance of 4 μW/cm 2 elicited an intermediate response that would be equivalent to that experienced by most humans in indoor work environments at night. 3, 4, 5 A subsequent study on glucose homeostasis demonstrated that mice subjected to rotating shift schedules (RSS) using 4 μW/cm 2 of green light develop glucose intolerance. 6 To investigate the effects on atherosclerosis development, here we have implemented a similar shift work paradigm on atherosclerosis‐prone low‐density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice. In line with epidemiological and longitudinal studies in human shift workers, we found that mice under RSS develop accelerated atherosclerosis and unstable plaque phenotypes, and identified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐induced apoptosis as a putative underlying mechanism.

### Retinal sensitivity loss and structural disturbance in areas of capillary nonperfusion of eyes with diabetic retinopathy [^fecdc520]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess light sensitivity and morphologic changes of capillary nonperfused areas in diabetic retinopathy.

Design

Prospective, observational cross-sectional study.

Methods

Seventeen consecutive patients (20 eyes) with areas of capillary nonperfusion resulting from severe nonproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy were included in the study. All eyes underwent fluorescent angiography and fundus-related microperimetry. Nonperfused areas of the retina were scanned with optical coherence tomography (OCT).

Results

In all 20 diabetic eyes, areas of capillary nonperfusion detected by fluorescein angiography were associated with the loss of retinal sensitivity. At the edges of the nonperfused area, retinal sensitivity tended to be reduced. The OCT images suggested a structural disturbance of the inner retina and high-reflectivity deposition located between the outer segments of photoreceptor and the retinal pigment epithelium corresponding to the areas of capillary nonperfusion.

Conclusions

Areas of capillary nonperfusion resulting from severe nonproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy show morphologic changes of the retinal structure, which may lead to a loss of sensitivity.

### Rods progressively escape saturation to drive visual responses in daylight conditions [^b7e20c5c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

When interpreting the results of visual experiments carried out at high backgrounds, especially when considering whether rods contribute to visual processing, several factors should be considered. First, in addition to stimulus contrast, is the sensitivity of the recording method: stimulus-evoked rod responses (Fig. 3) may not be apparent with a less sensitive method, such as ERG (Fig. 1). Second, thanks to the recovery of rod contrast sensitivity over time at photopic backgrounds, rod responses to moderate contrasts may re-emerge even after lacking for many minutes. Third, even more importantly, the recovery rate in contrast sensitivity is itself positively correlated with irradiance. High backgrounds are commonly used as an experimental strategy to study cone vision. Our experiments confirm that stepping to high backgrounds can indeed produce retinal responses that are strongly or even exclusively cone-driven. However, they further reveal that the duration of this exclusively cone-driven operational regime is shortest at higher light levels. Thus, care needs to be taken to limit exposure to photopic light levels if the aim is to exclude rod responses. Indeed, it is not safe to assume that rods stay silent at any background light intensity, and further irradiance increase, once in the photopic range, can actually be detrimental to the objective of isolating cone vision. Here, we were able to observe rod intrusion at high light levels in visually intact animals due to the distinct spectral sensitivities of rhodopsin and the cone opsins in the "red opsin" mouse model. Since wild-type mice have very similar spectral sensitivity of rhodopsin and M-opsin, unwanted rod intrusion at high light levels can easily go unnoticed.

5.4 Photosensitivity

All patients who receive PHOTOFRIN will be photosensitive and must observe precautions to avoid exposure of skin and eyes to direct sunlight or bright indoor light (from examination lamps, including dental lamps, operating room lamps, unshaded light bulbs at close proximity, etc.) for at least 30 days. Some patients may remain photosensitive for up to 90 days or more. The photosensitivity is due to residual drug, which will be present in all parts of the skin. Exposure of the skin to ambient indoor light is, however, beneficial because the remaining drug will be inactivated gradually and safely through a photobleaching reaction.

Therefore, patients should not stay in a darkened room during this period and should be encouraged to expose their skin to ambient indoor light. The level of photosensitivity will vary for different areas of the body, depending on the extent of previous exposure to light. Before exposing any area of skin to direct sunlight or bright indoor light, the patient should test it for residual photosensitivity. A small area of skin should be exposed to sunlight for 10 minutes. If no photosensitivity reaction (erythema, edema, blistering) occurs within 24 hours, the patient can gradually resume normal outdoor activities, initially continuing to exercise caution and gradually allowing increased exposure. If some photosensitivity reaction occurs with the limited skin test, the patient should continue precautions for another 2 weeks before retesting. The tissue around the eyes may be more sensitive, and therefore, it is not recommended that the face be used for testing. If patients travel to a different geographical area with greater sunshine, they should retest their level of photosensitivity.

Conventional ultraviolet (UV) sunscreens will only protect against UV light-related photosensitivity and will be of no value in protecting against induced photosensitivity reactions caused by visible light.

5.5 Ocular Sensitivity

Sensitivity to sun, bright lights, or car headlights, causing ocular discomfort, can occur in patients who receive PHOTOFRIN. For at least 30 days and until ocular sensitivity resolves, instruct patients when outdoors to wear dark sunglasses which have an average white light transmittance of < 4%.

### Drug-induced photosensitivity: photoallergic and phototoxic reactions [^dd2050b4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Drug-induced photosensitivity refers to the development of cutaneous disease due to the interaction between a given chemical agent and sunlight. Photosensitivity reactions can be classified as phototoxic or photoallergic. Sometimes, there is an overlap between these two patterns, making their distinction particularly difficult for the clinician. We review the drugs that have been implicated as photosensitizers, the involved mechanism, and their clinical presentations. The main topical agents that cause contact photosensitivity are the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, whereas the main systemic drugs inducing photosensitivity are antimicrobials, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, and cardiovascular drugs. Drug-induced photosensitivity remains a common clinical problem and is often underdiagnosed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of solar urticaria [^3815855e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Solar urticaria is one of the most annoying of the photodermatoses. It can be difficult to diagnosis because of phototesting problems, and it is not easy to treat. The different treatment modalities available all have their practical problems, so it is difficult to provide the patient with adequate protection. In many patients, however, treatment can reduce the symptoms and allow regular exposure of the skin to natural sunlight as the skin becomes more tolerant to the provoking wavelengths, the result being more complete protection.

Polymorphous light eruption — Polymorphous light eruption differs from solar urticaria in that onset usually occurs minutes to hours after sunlight exposure and the eruption lasts for days compared with solar urticaria, which is short-lived between exposures (D); eruptions occur typically in spring and early summer and the duration of the reaction lasts from days to rarely weeks at 1 site, and short courses (4–5 days) of oral corticosteroids might shorten the rash and pruritus.

### What is light? The visible spectrum and beyond [^3125c6d9]. Eye (2016). Low credibility.

In this International Year of Light, it is particularly appropriate to review the historical concept of what is light and the controversies surrounding the extent of the visible spectrum. Today we recognize that light possesses both a wave and particle nature. It is also clear that the limits of visibility really extend from about 310nm in the ultraviolet (in youth) to about 1100nm in the near-infrared, but depend very much on the radiance, that is, 'brightness' of the light source. The spectral content of artificial lighting are undergoing very significant changes in our lifetime, and the full biological implications of the spectral content of newer lighting technologies remain to be fully explored.

### Considerations for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 genomic surveillance: a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology and association of public health laboratories [^4266c4f2]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2025). High credibility.

Viral density and quality considerations for next-generation sequencing (NGS) note that there are no standardized quantitative inputs, but CT values may help; setting a pre-analytical criterion of a CT value < 28 to 30 is supported, and single-nucleotide polymorphism detection showed sensitivity > 90% for samples with CT < 28 but fell under 80% for CT values < 30. Some assays do not provide CT or relative light units and nonmolecular tests lack semiquantitative information; therefore, real-time PCR can be used as a screening test to identify specimens with a sufficiently high viral load before NGS.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^b20e3f7b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Solar urticaria — diagnosis with phototesting can be confirmed with phototesting to various wavelengths of light, most commonly using a xenon arc lamp with a monochromator to determine the minimal urticarial dose (MUD) at different wavelengths, typically on normally covered skin such as the middle and lower back; if not available, other light sources, including fluorescent black light, fluorescent sunlamp, infrared lamp, and even lasers, have been used. For each wavelength or light source, the MUD can be determined by exposing a 1-cm^2 area of skin at a distance of 10 cm from the light source, or provocative light exposure can be used without determining the MUD. Readings are made immediately after exposure and defined as a visible pruritic erythematous wheal that usually fades within a few minutes after the light is withdrawn; if the initial result is negative (no response after 1–3 minutes), testing can be repeated on the originally affected skin area and, if still negative, under direct sun light before the diagnosis of solar urticaria is excluded.

### Restoration of high-sensitivity and adapting vision with a cone opsin [^0e9df411]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Inherited and age-related retinal degenerative diseases cause progressive loss of rod and cone photoreceptors, leading to blindness, but spare downstream retinal neurons, which can be targeted for optogenetic therapy. However, optogenetic approaches have been limited by either low light sensitivity or slow kinetics, and lack adaptation to changes in ambient light, and not been shown to restore object vision. We find that the vertebrate medium wavelength cone opsin (MW-opsin) overcomes these limitations and supports vision in dim light. MW-opsin enables an otherwise blind retinitis pigmenotosa mouse to discriminate temporal and spatial light patterns displayed on a standard LCD computer tablet, displays adaption to changes in ambient light, and restores open-field novel object exploration under incidental room light. By contrast, rhodopsin, which is similar in sensitivity but slower in light response and has greater rundown, fails these tests. Thus, MW-opsin provides the speed, sensitivity and adaptation needed to restore patterned vision.
