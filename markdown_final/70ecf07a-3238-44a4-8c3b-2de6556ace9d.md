## Question

Wheeze description for a person that has asthma like inspiratory, expiratory and throughout

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to describe wheeze in asthma across inspiratory, expiratory, and biphasic phases, and how these relate to severity and diagnostic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and acoustic properties of wheeze. Then, I should verify the typical phase distribution in asthma and when biphasic wheeze occurs. Next, I will correlate wheeze characteristics with severity and airflow limitation. After that, I need to consider age-related patterns and the differential diagnosis. Finally, I should integrate objective testing and documentation standards to ensure the description is clinically actionable and aligned with guidelines [^115YkPkW] [^115ppn5R].

> Let me first confirm the definition and acoustic features of wheeze so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Wheeze is a high-pitched, continuous, musical adventitious lung sound generated by oscillation of narrowed or obstructed lower airways, typically in the frequency range of roughly 100–5000 Hz, and it reflects turbulent airflow through critical narrowing rather than a discrete "sound effect" from the upper airway [^112fn5Ax] [^115jhneu] [^113YQjtr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about phase distribution. I initially thought wheeze in asthma is "primarily expiratory", but wait, I should verify whether inspiratory or biphasic wheeze also occurs and what that implies. Classic teaching and guidelines emphasize that expiratory wheeze is most common in asthma, yet wheeze can be heard during inspiration and, when both phases are involved, it signals more severe or widespread obstruction; importantly, biphasic wheeze correlates with lower peak expiratory flow and greater airflow limitation than expiratory-only wheeze, so I need to correct my earlier overstatement and explicitly note the biphasic pattern as a marker of severity rather than dismiss inspiratory involvement [^114Xwco6] [^116xhNV8].

> I will now examine the phase-specific descriptors and their clinical meaning. Expiratory wheeze is the hallmark on auscultation in asthma and may be polyphonic, reflecting multiple narrowed airways; it can be absent or only heard on forced expiration in milder disease, which means I should actively listen during forced maneuvers when routine auscultation is unrevealing [^111ewHgk]. Inspiratory wheeze is less common but, when present, suggests more severe or diffuse obstruction and should prompt me to consider whether the patient is moving toward a higher-risk state or even a "silent chest" if airflow is profoundly reduced [^114Xwco6] [^111ewHgk]. Biphasic wheeze, spanning both inspiration and expiration, is associated with the lowest peak flows and indicates more severe, widespread small-airway involvement, so I should document it explicitly and escalate monitoring or therapy accordingly [^114Xwco6].

> Next, I should review how to characterize wheeze beyond phase, because pitch, intensity, and duration carry diagnostic and severity information. High-pitched, moderate-to-severe intensity wheeze that spans the entire respiratory phase correlates with more severe obstruction and lower PEFR, whereas softer, shorter wheeze segments reflect milder disease; I need to ensure I document these attributes rather than simply noting "wheeze present", since they track with physiologic impairment [^114Xwco6] [^111Tme2j]. But wait, what if I hear a low-pitched, snoring-like sound? That is more consistent with rhonchi from secretions rather than the classic musical wheeze of asthma, so I should double-check for mucus and consider cough or positional variation before labeling it as wheeze [^112fn5Ax].

> Let me consider age-related patterns so I don't overgeneralize. In children, wheeze is very common and often viral-associated; many have transient early wheeze that remits, while a subset develops persistent asthma, so I should correlate wheeze with triggers, atopy, and between-episode symptoms rather than equate any wheeze with asthma outright [^112tx1SR] [^113UVBVR]. In adults, wheeze remains a core asthma symptom but its absence does not exclude asthma, and chronic or fixed airflow limitation may blunt wheeze audibility; conversely, in COPD, inspiratory and/or expiratory wheezes can occur and do not confirm asthma, reinforcing the need for objective testing to distinguish overlapping phenotypes [^111ofsmf] [^111ewHgk].

> I should confirm the differential when wheeze is atypical or refractory to therapy. Inspiratory monophonic wheeze without bronchodilator response raises concern for tracheobronchomalacia, whereas paradoxical vocal cord motion can mimic wheeze or stridor and requires laryngoscopy for confirmation; foreign body aspiration may cause unilateral wheeze, and cardiac or upper airway causes can produce sounds misattributed to wheeze, so I need to check for red flags and alternative diagnoses when the pattern is incongruent with asthma [^113Xk7HW] [^115godtL] [^111ewHgk].

> Next, I should review objective testing because auscultation alone is insufficient. Spirometry with bronchodilator response, serial peak flow demonstrating variability, and, when needed, bronchial challenge testing provide the objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation required to confirm asthma; in children under 5, a structured symptom pattern plus a therapeutic trial of low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA, followed by reassessment, is acceptable when objective testing is not feasible, but I must document the basis for diagnosis and avoid anchoring on wheeze alone [^115ppn5R] [^111jHGkx] [^111qtuMA]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating any single test; no single measure is definitive, and diagnosis rests on integrating history, exam, and objective data, ideally captured before initiating controller therapy to preserve diagnostic clarity [^116aN6nP].

> I need to ensure my documentation is standardized and reproducible. I should record the phase distribution (inspiratory, expiratory, or biphasic), estimate pitch and intensity, note whether wheeze spans the entire phase, and specify location and number of pitches if polyphonic; this aligns with studies showing that intensity and phase-spanning characteristics track with severity and improves inter-observer clarity compared with vague descriptors [^111Tme2j] [^114Xwco6]. Let me reconsider whether to include numeric counts; while exact counts are impractical at the bedside, noting "multiple", "few", or "widespread" and whether they clear with cough or bronchodilator adds clinically useful information [^111Tme2j] [^112fn5Ax] [^113EzsM2].

> Finally, I should integrate this into a concise clinical description template. For example: "Polyphonic, high-pitched expiratory wheezes heard bilaterally, moderate intensity, spanning most of expiration; no inspiratory wheeze noted at rest, with improvement and partial clearance after two puffs of albuterol", or "Biphasic wheeze with high-pitched, loud musical sounds throughout inspiration and expiration, associated with accessory muscle use and oxygen saturation 91%, consistent with severe airflow limitation and high exacerbation risk", which ties the acoustic features to severity and immediate management needs [^111ewHgk] [^11247AmX].

---

In asthma, wheeze is a **high-pitched, musical sound** [^112uB6VK] [^114xhw1P] caused by turbulent airflow through narrowed lower airways [^notfound], most often heard on expiration but also possible during inspiration or throughout the entire respiratory cycle [^112uB6VK] [^114Xwco6]. Expiratory wheeze is the **classic hallmark** [^notfound] of asthma, reflecting variable airflow limitation [^notfound]; inspiratory or biphasic wheeze indicates more severe obstruction [^114Xwco6]. Wheeze may be absent in severe attacks ("silent chest") due to minimal airflow [^111ewHgk], and its presence alone is not diagnostic — confirm with objective testing [^111qtuMA] [^115ppn5R].

---

## Acoustic characteristics of wheeze in asthma

Wheezes in asthma have the following **acoustic features**:

- **Pitch**: High-pitched, typically 100–5000 Hz [^112fn5Ax].

- **Duration**: Continuous, musical sounds lasting > 100 ms [^notfound].

- **Timing**: Primarily expiratory [^111ewHgk]; inspiratory or biphasic wheeze suggests more severe obstruction [^114Xwco6].

- **Variability**: Changes with symptom severity, triggers, and treatment response [^111KL9Pn].

---

## Expiratory wheeze

Expiratory wheeze is the **most common** [^111ewHgk] auscultatory finding in asthma, reflecting turbulent airflow during expiration due to airway narrowing. It is typically polyphonic and heard diffusely over the lungs [^111qtuMA]. Expiratory wheeze is a hallmark of variable airflow limitation [^notfound] and is included in diagnostic criteria and severity assessment [^115ppn5R].

---

## Inspiratory wheeze

Inspiratory wheeze is less common than expiratory wheeze but may occur in asthma, particularly with **more severe airway obstruction** [^114Xwco6]. Inspiratory wheeze is typically monophonic and localized, suggesting focal airway narrowing or partial obstruction. It is often associated with more severe airflow limitation and may indicate increased risk of exacerbation [^114Xwco6].

---

## Biphasic wheeze

Biphasic wheeze — present during both inspiration and expiration — indicates **significant airway obstruction** [^114Xwco6] and is associated with more severe asthma. It reflects widespread airway narrowing and turbulence throughout the respiratory cycle. Biphasic wheeze is less common than isolated expiratory wheeze but is a marker of severe airflow limitation and increased risk of exacerbation [^114Xwco6].

---

## Clinical significance of wheeze timing

The timing of wheeze provides important information about the **severity and extent of airway obstruction** in asthma:

| **Wheeze timing** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Expiratory | - Most common <br/> - Indicates variable airflow limitation <br/> - Hallmark of asthma [^111ewHgk] |
| Inspiratory | - Less common <br/> - Suggests more severe obstruction <br/> - Localized narrowing [^notfound] |
| Biphasic | - Indicates significant obstruction <br/> - Widespread airway narrowing <br/> - Higher exacerbation risk [^notfound] |

---

## Absence of wheeze in asthma

Wheeze may be absent in some patients with asthma, particularly during **severe exacerbations** [^111ewHgk] with minimal airflow ("silent chest"). This absence does not exclude asthma and may indicate critical airway obstruction requiring urgent intervention. Objective testing (spirometry, peak flow) is essential to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity [^111qtuMA] [^115ppn5R].

---

## Clinical documentation of wheeze

When documenting wheeze in patients with asthma, clinicians should note:

- **Timing**: Inspiratory, expiratory, or biphasic [^114Xwco6].

- **Intensity**: Loudness and pitch (high-pitched, musical) [^111Tme2j].

- **Distribution**: Localized or diffuse [^111ewHgk].

- **Variability**: Changes with treatment or triggers [^111qtuMA].

- **Associated findings**: Accessory muscle use, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation [^11247AmX].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Recognizing wheeze timing and characteristics guides **management**:

- **Expiratory wheeze**: Typical of asthma; monitor control and adjust therapy as needed [^111ewHgk].

- **Inspiratory or biphasic wheeze**: Suggests severe obstruction; intensify therapy, monitor closely, and consider escalation [^114Xwco6].

- **Absence of wheeze**: Do not exclude asthma; rely on objective testing and clinical assessment [^111qtuMA].

---

Wheezing in asthma is a high-pitched, musical sound most often heard on expiration but also possible during inspiration or throughout the entire respiratory cycle. Expiratory wheeze is the **classic hallmark** of asthma, while inspiratory or biphasic wheeze indicates more severe obstruction. The timing and characteristics of wheeze provide valuable information about asthma severity and guide management [^114Xwco6].

### Asthma diagnosis: into the fourth dimension [^114YDJh4]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Acknowledging that asthma is an umbrella term covering this heterogeneity, in 2015, Global Initiative for Asthma simplified their asthma definition to aid diagnosis in clinical practice. This new definition highlights the cardinal features of variability in asthma: 'a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity" and "variable expiratory airflow limitation'. Despite this, the diagnostic guidelines continue to predominantly rely on using fixed and arbitrary cut-off values in the interpretation of tests, with little emphasis on the timing of measurements and how this may affect diagnostic accuracy. In this review, we will provide evidence that virtually all asthma diagnostic tests demonstrate diurnal and longer term variation; we will show how variability and timing impact asthma diagnosis and management. We provide an overview of the biological clock mechanism and highlight areas for future research.

### Asthma inception: epidemiologic risk factors and natural history across the life course [^117VrS1y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a descriptive label for an obstructive inflammatory disease in the lower airways manifesting with symptoms including breathlessness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing. From a clinician's point of view, asthma symptoms can commence at any age, although most patients with asthma-regardless of their age of onset-seem to have had some form of airway problems during childhood. Asthma inception and related pathophysiologic processes are therefore very likely to occur early in life, further evidenced by recent lung physiologic and mechanistic research. Herein, we present state-of-the-art updates on the role of genetics and epigenetics, early viral and bacterial infections, immune response, and pathophysiology, as well as lifestyle and environmental exposures, in asthma across the life course. We conclude that early environmental insults in genetically vulnerable individuals inducing abnormal, pre-asthmatic airway responses are key events in asthma inception, and we highlight disease heterogeneity across ages and the potential shortsightedness of treating all patients with asthma using the same treatments. Although there are no interventions that, at present, can modify long-term outcomes, a precision-medicine approach should be implemented to optimize treatment and tailor follow-up for all patients with asthma.

Presentation of asthma

Children with asthma typically present with a symptom triad of wheeze, shortness of breath and cough. However, 'asthma' is an umbrella term used to describe this collection of symptoms and, when present, should prompt practitioners to ask, 'What type of asthma is this?' There are a number of asthma subtypes that present and respond to treatment differently. Identification of the features of asthma and modifiable or treatable traits should only be the start of the diagnostic journey. Asthma symptoms are normally intermittent in nature and may not be present at the time of clinical review, making the diagnosis challenging in some cases. Additionally, disease phenotypes are not fixed and may evolve over time, necessitating ongoing review of symptoms and treatment.

Wheeze is a key feature of asthma and, if not present, a diagnosis of asthma in a child is unlikely. Wheeze is an expiratory high-pitched whistle that occurs as a result of inflammation and narrowing of the small airways. Parental understanding of wheeze varies, and clarifying what is meant when it is reported is key in making an accurate diagnosis.

The prevalence of 'preschool wheeze' is an additional challenge when diagnosing asthma in young children. In the first few years of life, many children will experience wheeze, but not all will go on to develop true asthma. The diagnosis of asthma should therefore be reviewed routinely to identify true asthma and alter treatment where necessary. Favourable response to an appropriate trial of asthma treatment is an important confirmatory piece of diagnostic evidence.

Clinical examination may be normal in children and adolescents with asthma if they present during asymptomatic periods. During acute attacks, use of accessory muscles of respiration and widespread wheeze may be present. Chest hyperinflation may be identified in acute and chronic disease settings.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — initial diagnosis of asthma: Typical variable respiratory symptoms include wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or cough, and are supported when symptoms occur variably over time and vary in intensity, are often worse at night or on waking, are often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air, and often appear or worsen with viral infections.

### The highs and lows of wheezing: a review of the most popular adventitious lung sound [^113YQjtr]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2018). Low credibility.

Wheezing is the most widely reported adventitious lung sound in the English language. It is recognized by health professionals as well as by lay people, although often with a different meaning. Wheezing is an indicator of airway obstruction and therefore of interest particularly for the assessment of young children and in other situations where objective documentation of lung function is not generally available. This review summarizes our current understanding of mechanisms producing wheeze, its subjective perception and description, its objective measurement, and visualization, and its relevance in clinical practice.

### Wheezes, crackles and rhonchi: simplifying description of lung sounds increases the agreement on their classification: a study of 12 physicians' classification of lung sounds from video recordings [^111Tme2j]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

In many previous studies, detailed descriptions of the sounds have been based on computerised analysis. Fine and coarse crackles have been identified by the duration of each crackle as shown on a phonogram. It is more difficult to differentiate the types of crackles by listening. It is, for instance, possible that the amplitude of crackles plays a role in how the sound is perceived. Loud crackles may be perceived to be coarser than faint crackles of the same duration.

It can also be difficult to differentiate between low-pitched and high-pitched wheezes by listening. Separation based on a 200 Hz cut-off has been recommended. Few observers can perfectly determine the pitch, and observer disagreement on this subclassification is therefore not surprising. Agreement on the presence of rhonchi was particularly poor in our study. This is in accordance with previous studies, where the agreement on rhonchi was much weaker than the agreement on crackles and wheezes. Since the terms 'rhonchi' and 'low-pitched wheezes' are used interchangeably, low agreement could be expected. The task force decided anyway to include 'rhonchi' as a separate category, thinking the term could be preferred for low-pitched wheezes that do not sound musical but more like snoring, With our results, it seems difficult to agree on this division of low-pitched continuous sounds.

Other characteristics of crackles and wheezes may be more important and also easier to identify than those applied in our classification. The number of crackles may be of importance and also the timing during inspiration. In terms of wheezes, both sound intensity and the duration of the wheezes in each respiratory phase are of importance. Shim and Williamsfound that the three characteristics high pitch, intensity and spanning the entire phase were linked to decreased peak expiratory flow rate in patients with asthma.

The 20 cases were from real patients with various lung diseases, both children and adults, and in eight cases more than one category of adventitious sound was presented. Six of the eight complex cases were recordings from children, and these might have been more difficult to classify than the recordings with only one kind of adventitious sound. This may have led to poorer agreement in the paediatric cases than in the adult cases.

### Asthma inception: epidemiologic risk factors and natural history across the life course [^116gLc81]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

"Asthma" is a descriptive label for a lower airway disease manifesting with symptoms including breathlessness, cough, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing, which is characterized by combinations of acute attacks and interval symptoms. Asthma is characterized by any or all of varying types of airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus hypersecretion, and an abnormal airway response to pathogens, all leading to variable airflow obstruction. Asthma is an umbrella term, and it is likely that different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to the clinical presentation and diagnosis. When feasible, age-appropriate lung function tests should be used to demonstrate variable airflow obstruction (and confirm asthma diagnosis from age 5 yr), and biomarkers and other investigations should be done to define clinical (phenotype) and biological (endotype) disease characteristics (i.e. the type of asthma). Heredity remains a very important risk factor for disease development, in addition to early-life (i.e. from conception to first 3 yr of life postnatally) conditions, such as recurrent airway infections, wheezing, and multiple aeroallergen IgE sensitization. Several lifestyle and environmental risk factors for asthma have been identified, including maternal/parental tobacco smoke exposure, air pollution, allergens, social deprivation, and, more recently, additional risk factors including chemical pollutants (e.g. phenols, phthalates) and extreme weather events related to climate change.

The asthmas are truly complex diseases, and, like many chronic diseases, there is no single determinant or causal factor. Despite major progress in experimental and clinical research, there are still many knowledge gaps in asthma inception and progression across the life course. What is the childhood asthma prevalence as of today, and when does asthma commence? Is there an early-life disease state before the onset of airway inflammation? What are the key drivers from childhood wheezing to asthma? Can we identify reliable biomarkers that enable distinction of different asthma phenotypes (beyond fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO] and blood eosinophils)? What is the long-term prognosis given the patient's type of asthma, and can we prevent asthma from becoming severe? In this review, we address some of these issues, with a focus on asthma inception and progression across the life course, from mechanisms to epidemiology and clinical applications. We have not covered asthma remission, which will be the subject of another review.

### Which wheezing preschoolers should be treated for asthma? [^115Qa4H2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Wheezing disorders in children younger than 5 years are common, but lack of clarity remains about which children should be treated to prevent symptoms and acute episodes. The aim of this review was to discuss a practical approach to deciding which children younger than 5 years with asthma should be treated, and if so, with which strategy. The importance of having a clear definition of "asthma" for this age group, determined by a collection of presenting respiratory symptoms, without assumptions about underlying mechanisms is addressed. Subsequent consideration should be given to timing, severity, and frequency of symptoms, together with assessment of objective biomarkers, including aeroallergen sensitization and blood eosinophils, to inform whether or not a preschooler with recurrent wheezing requires treatment. Numerous unanswered questions remain about the optimal management of nonallergic preschool wheezing and asthma, and areas of specific unmet need and future directions for research are highlighted.

### What is the best pulmonary diagnostic approach for wheezing patients with normal spirometry? [^1147h6Tf]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and variable air flow obstruction. The diagnosis of asthma, however, is often based upon nonspecific clinical symptoms of cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. Furthermore, the physical examination and measurements of pulmonary function are often unremarkable in patients with asthma, thereby complicating the diagnosis of the disease. The following discussion will review approaches to the diagnosis of asthma when lung functions are normal, and will largely focus on the use of bronchial provocation tests to detect underlying AHR.

### Menstrual cycle and respiratory symptoms in a general nordic-baltic population [^112BrVzv]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Rationale

There is little knowledge of variations in respiratory symptoms during the menstrual cycle in a general population, and potential modifying factors are not investigated.

Objectives

To investigate menstrual cycle variation in respiratory symptoms in a large general population, using chronobiology methodology, and stratifying by body mass index (BMI), smoking, and asthma status.

Methods

A total of 3,926 women with regular cycles less than or equal to 28 days and not taking exogenous sex hormones answered a postal questionnaire regarding the first day of their last menstruation and respiratory symptoms in the last 3 days. Moving 4-day means were computed to smooth uneven records of daily sampling; best-fitting 28-day composite cosine curves were applied to each time series to describe rhythmicity.

Measurements and Main Results

Significant rhythmic variations over the menstrual cycle were found in each symptom for all subjects and subgroups. Wheezing was higher on cycle Days 10–22, with a midcycle dip near the time of putative ovulation (approximately Days 14–16) in most subgroups. Shortness of breath was higher on days 7–21, with a dip just before midcycle in many subgroups. Cough was higher just after putative ovulation for subjects with asthma, BMI greater than or equal to 23 kg/m(2), and smokers, or just before ovulation and menses onset for low symptomatic subgroups.

Conclusions

Respiratory symptoms varied significantly during the menstrual cycle and were most frequent from the midluteal to midfollicular stages, often with a dip near the time of ovulation. The patterns varied by BMI, smoking, and asthma status. These relations link respiratory symptoms with hormonal changes through the menstrual cycle and imply a potential for individualized chronotherapy for respiratory diseases.

### Associations of wheezing phenotypes with late asthma outcomes in the avon longitudinal study of parents and children: a population-based birth cohort [^114BTYEU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This study adds to our previous description of wheezing phenotypes in children by extending knowledge of variation in the natural history of wheeze from infancy through the critical adolescent transition period to adulthood, during which the sex distribution of asthma changes and lung development nears its peak. We confirmed the importance of early childhood wheezing illness in lung function development and identified the temporal wheezing patterns most strongly associated with airway obstruction as wheeze starting before the age of 4 years and persisting throughout childhood. The challenge is to translate this knowledge by identifying clinically useful biomarkers associated with disease phenotypes that can be measured in early childhood and hence to enable the study of disease pathways associated with unfavorable prognosis and development of targeted interventions to modify the natural history of wheezing illnesses in young children, a population in whom treatment with corticosteroids appears to be ineffective in disease modification.

### The role of wheezing subtypes in the development of early childhood asthma [^1131z5BR]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Allergic respiratory diseases, including asthma and wheezing, are common in early childhood. Globally, asthma is one of the most frequent chronic respiratory diseases with a prevalence of 357.4 million individuals in 2019. Pediatric asthma is considered to have multiple unclear clinical indications and etiologies. Hence, asthma as a heterogeneous disorder incorporates multiple common conditions and treatments, and thus, there is no "gold standard" for its diagnosis. Studies suggest that there is an association between wheeze events in early childhood and later asthma diagnosis, and that this association may be related to the mode, persistence, and temporality of wheeze.

Thus, it has been suggested that asthma is best described via the scoring or assessment of signs and symptoms, namely the occurrence of wheezing – its timing, duration, severity, and etiology. Previous indexes, such as The Asthma Predictive Index, have used summative occurrence as partial proxies for asthma risk. However, to produce a more robust assessment, the patterns of wheezing temporality and occurrence have been investigated through group-based trajectory modeling. This approach condenses onset and duration of wheezing into classifications that may aid and hasten clinical interventions compared to observations of wheeze alone. Phenotypic trajectories of childhood wheeze have been developed previously and were described in a meta-analysis that identified consistent allocation of children into five wheeze trajectories in early childhood: "Never/Infrequent", "Early-Transient", "Early-Persistent", "Intermediate-Onset", and "Late-Onset". In the thirteen studies described by the meta-analysis, asthma was the most prevalent among children exhibiting persistent wheeze with an early onset, but later onset was important for children with already known risk factors for asthma.

However, previous studies have only assessed wheezing irrespective of potential differences in biological mechanisms of wheezing derived from infection or in the absence of infection. These wheezing types may differentially impact the development and pattern of wheeze and asthma in early childhood. This study addresses a gap in the literature by assessing not only non-specific wheezing (general), but also wheezing in the presence or absence of infection (i.e. infectious and non-infectious wheeze). In addition, this study provides evidence relating phenotypic trajectories to lung function and biomarker tests such as the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and forced expiratory volume (FEV1), which have both been proven useful in the discrimination of wheeze and asthma.

### Differential diagnosis of asthma [^111tzDXu]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma tends to be diagnosed too easily by clinicians without sufficient consideration being given to alternative possibilities. Most asthma is obvious, mild and easy to treat. Deviations from this typical picture should be a signal to consider carefully other diagnoses. Age of onset, pattern of symptoms, sputum production, diurnal variations or the lack thereof, associated upper respiratory symptoms, abnormal physical signs, poor control on standard inhaler therapy and unusual flow volume loops are all pointers to non-asthma diagnoses.

---

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aN6nP]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Making the initial diagnosis — diagnosis before treatment is started is based on identifying both a characteristic pattern of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath (dyspnea), chest tightness or cough, and variable expiratory airflow limitation; the symptom pattern matters because respiratory symptoms may be due to other acute or chronic conditions; evidence supporting the diagnosis should be documented when the patient first presents since characteristic features may improve spontaneously or with treatment; confirmation is often more difficult after starting ICS‑containing treatment because this reduces variability of both symptoms and lung function; and where access to spirometry is limited, advice is provided for using PEF in asthma diagnosis.

### The role of wheezing subtypes in the development of early childhood asthma [^111eeoyc]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

For example, a child exhibiting two reports of general wheezing at 36 months could be categorized as either "Persistent", "Progressive", or "Transient". Yet only the "Persistent" general wheeze trajectory increases asthma odds, which suggests that there is additional value to considerations of temporality and frequency in the differentiation of phenotypes into trajectories beyond just counts of wheeze episodes. Similarly, the mean reported level of wheeze by 72 months in "Early Occurrence" (1.71 events) and "Progressive" (2.35 events) non-infectious wheeze are indistinguishable, yet their phenotypes exhibit opposite timing – the count of reported wheeze could not differentiate the "Early Occurrence" and "Progressive" non-infectious wheeze without the added benefit of the temporality.

Moreover, this study assesses general wheeze using two subtypes. From this analysis we see that general and infectious wheeze are only risk factors for asthma when there is persistence of those wheeze types, while any non-infectious wheeze is a risk factor for asthma. This granularity may describe different biological pathways of the atopic march that are missed when only considering counts of general wheeze. Therefore, the combined consideration of wheeze type, temporality, and frequency of reported wheeze as described through trajectories provides additional context in the clinical setting.

### Recurrent wheezing and asthma-epidemiology and environmental determinants [^112uB6VK]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Wheeze is the musical continuous sound produced by oscillations in any critically narrowed airways, and heard mostly on expiration. It is common in preschool age, about half of all children will experience an episode of wheezing by their sixth birthday. Asthma is usually characterized by cough, wheeze, chest tightness and fast breathing. It is a significant global health issue and affects both children and adults. The prevalence is on the increase, especially in LMIC. Studies from different populations have revealed the key role influencing the progression from preschool wheezing to childhood asthma. Recurrent wheezing is four or more episodes in the preceding year and has a spectrum of phenotypes and with heterogeneous features. Phenotypes of wheezing were proposed to facilitate the identification of young children who are at risk of subsequent development of asthma. The epidemiology and environmental determinants of recurrent wheezing and asthma are discussed.

### Paediatric asthma-all that wheezes is not necessarily asthma-current diagnostic and management strategies [^115Nbz2n]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is a frequently encountered chronic medical condition encountered in paediatrics, affecting 7% of children under the age of 18 in the United States. Although asthma is one of the more common conditions that is associated with wheezing, there is a broad differential diagnosis to consider. The purpose of this review is to describe other causes of wheezing outside of asthma in a paediatric population and discuss diagnostic and management strategies to consider when evaluating a child or adolescent with wheezing.

Recent Findings

The characteristics of the wheezing along with other associated signs and symptoms can be helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. The age and the past medical history of the patient are also important aspects to consider when determining next steps in the evaluation and management of paediatric wheezing. In addition to considering other causes of wheezing, it is often necessary to assess for the presence of underlying asthma, and recently updated asthma guidelines from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute provide a graded review of various recommendations for making the diagnosis and managing asthma in the clinical setting.

Summary

It is important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating a paediatric patient with wheezing.

The term asthma (or strictly "ἄσθμα") was first used to describe a constellation of respiratory symptoms in the fourth century B.C. Long before we had any knowledge of the complexities underlying the pathophysiology of the disease, there were compellingly accurate descriptions of the symptom complex, namely wheeze, chest tightness, and breathlessness, sometimes with excessive cough. In the 20th century, there was a notable divergence between the guidelines industry, which favored a one size fits all approach, and investigators who realized personalized medicine was essential. Indeed, the one size fits all approach nearly cost us inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), oral corticosteroids, and the anti-IL5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab as treatments for asthma (reviewed in). Although so many people with asthma respond dramatically to low-dose ICS, for the many others who do not, paying careful attention to personalizing medicine is essential.

### The role of wheezing subtypes in the development of early childhood asthma [^117ATiVD]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The utilization of wheezing subtype to establish phenotypic trajectories of early childhood wheeze is a novel approach. Due to being identified at 36 months, wheezing phenotype trajectories provide insight into the development of asthma prior to diagnosis at 72 months. As in previous studies, we identify that persistence of general and infectious wheezing is an important indicator of asthma risk; however, we establish that there is no persistent phenotype of non-infectious wheezing. These non-infectious wheeze trajectories are not adequately described in the literature since there is no persistent non-infectious wheeze. Yet, we show that non-infectious wheezing of any phenotype increases asthma risk. Because these wheeze type specific trajectories consider the temporality, type, and frequency of wheeze, they can better describe a child's phenotype of wheeze prior to the diagnosis of asthma when compared to merely counting wheeze episodes. Clinicians should utilize not just frequency, but also wheeze type and temporality to assess wheezing as a risk factor for asthma. This may provide critical time to administer prophylaxis, treatment, or other interventions.

Asthma — questions to elicit features suggestive of asthma: Ask whether the child has wheezing, noting that wheezing is a high-pitched noise which comes from the chest and not the throat; whether the child wakes at night because of coughing, wheezing, or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or breathlessness; whether the child has to stop running or play less hard because of coughing, wheezing or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath; and whether coughing, wheezing or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath occurs when laughing, crying, playing with animals, or when exposed to strong smells or smoke. Additional prompts include whether the child has ever had eczema or been diagnosed with food allergy, and whether anyone in the family has had asthma, hay fever, food allergy, eczema, or any other disease with breathing problems.

### DeepBreath-automated detection of respiratory pathology from lung auscultation in 572 pediatric outpatients across 5 countries [^111LKrBp]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Dataset description

Recordings have one of four clinical diagnostic categories: control (healthy), pneumonia, wheezing disorders (asthma and bronchitis pooled together) and bronchiolitis. The diagnosis was made by an experienced pediatrician after auscultation and was based on all available clinical and paraclinical information, such as chest X-ray when clinically indicated. For the purposes of this study, obstructive bronchitis and asthma are grouped under the label "wheezing disorder" due to their similar audible wheezing sound profile and treatment requirements (bronchodilators).

Rather than having a single model with four output classes (listed above), we adopted a "one-versus-rest" approach where four separate binary classification models discriminate between samples of one class and samples of the remaining three classes. The combination of the outputs of the resulting ensemble of four models yields a multi-class output. Such an approach allows for separating the learned features per class, which in turn improves the interpretability of the overall model. Moreover, such a composite model more easily permits a sampling strategy that compensates for the imbalanced class distribution in the training set. For a fair comparison, an identical model architecture was used for all the diagnoses in this study. For a broader classification of pathological breath sounds, predictions from the three pathological classes are grouped into a composite "pathological" label.

Several clinical variables were collected for each patient. Age and respiratory rate (RR) are used in a clinical baseline model described below. Age was present for all patients. RR was recorded by clinical observation at the bedside and is present for 94% (n = 536/572) of the patients. The baseline is thus computed on this subset.

Recordings from the Geneva site (cases and controls) were annotated by medical doctors to provide time-stamped inspiration and expiration phases of the breath cycle. These will serve as a reference for the interpretation methods described below.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111jHGkx]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Symptoms suggestive of asthma in children 5 years and younger — diagnostic basis and controller trial follow-up: An asthma diagnosis in children 5 years and younger can often be based on symptom patterns (recurrent episodes of wheeze, cough, breathlessness (typically manifested by activity limitation), and nocturnal symptoms or awakenings), presence of risk factors for development of asthma (family history of atopy, allergic sensitization, allergy or asthma, or a personal history of food allergy or atopic dermatitis), therapeutic response to controller treatment, and exclusion of alternate diagnoses. The frequency and severity of wheezing episodes and the temporal pattern of symptoms should be considered, and any controller treatment should be viewed as a treatment trial, with follow up scheduled after 2–3 months to review the response. Diagnosis is based largely on recurrent symptom patterns plus careful clinical assessment and differential diagnosis; a positive family history or the presence of atopy or allergic sensitization provide additional predictive support, and early allergic sensitization increases the likelihood that a wheezing child will develop persistent asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111KL9Pn]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — patterns of respiratory symptoms characteristic of asthma are described, stating that features typical of asthma "increase the probability that the patient has asthma", including "Respiratory symptoms of wheeze, shortness of breath, cough and/or chest tightness", that "Symptoms are often worse at night or in the early morning", that "Symptoms vary over time and in intensity", and that "Symptoms are triggered by viral infections (colds), exercise, allergen exposure, changes in weather, laughter, or irritants such as car exhaust fumes, smoke or strong smells". Features that "decrease the probability that respiratory symptoms are due to asthma" include "Chronic production of sputum", "Shortness of breath associated with dizziness, light-headedness or peripheral tingling (paresthesia)", and "Exercise-induced dyspnea with noisy inspiration".

### Analysis of wheeze sounds during tidal breathing according to severity levels in asthma patients [^114hkzZ4]. The Journal of Asthma (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: This study aimed to statistically analyze the behavior of time-frequency features in digital recordings of wheeze sounds obtained from patients with various levels of asthma severity (mild, moderate, and severe), and this analysis was based on the auscultation location and/or breath phase. Method: Segmented and validated wheeze sounds were collected from the trachea and lower lung base (LLB) of 55 asthmatic patients during tidal breathing maneuvers and grouped into nine different datasets. The quartile frequencies F 25, F 50, F 75, F 90 and F 99, mean frequency (MF) and average power (AP) were computed as features, and a univariate statistical analysis was then performed to analyze the behavior of the time-frequency features. Results: All features generally showed statistical significance in most of the datasets for all severity levels [χ 2 = 6.021–71.65, p < 0.05, η 2 = 0.01–0.52]. Of the seven investigated features, only AP showed statistical significance in all the datasets. F 25, F 75, F 90 and F 99 exhibited statistical significance in at least six datasets [χ 2 = 4.852–65.63, p < 0.05, η 2 = 0.01–0.52], and F 25, F 50 and MF showed statistical significance with a large η 2 in all trachea-related datasets [χ 2 = 13.54–55.32, p < 0.05, η 2 = 0.13–0.33]. Conclusion: The results obtained for the time-frequency features revealed that (1) the asthma severity levels of patients can be identified through a set of selected features with tidal breathing, (2) tracheal wheeze sounds are more sensitive and specific predictors of severity levels and (3) inspiratory and expiratory wheeze sounds are almost equally informative.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111ofsmf]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Wheezing and chest tightness — In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inspiratory and/or expiratory wheezes and chest tightness may vary between days and over a single day, and widespread inspiratory or expiratory wheezes can be present on auscultation. Chest tightness often follows exertion, is poorly localized, is muscular in character, and may arise from isometric contraction of the intercostal muscles. An absence of wheezing or chest tightness does not exclude a diagnosis of COPD, nor does the presence of these symptoms confirm a diagnosis of asthma.

### Other asthma considerations [^113PZuzC]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome of cough, wheeze, dyspnea, and chest tightness. However, in a subset of patients, these symptoms may indicate a different underlying disease process with variable responsiveness to classic asthma therapies. Disease may progress while practitioners attempt conventional asthma therapy. Additionally, some types of asthma may require alternative approaches to relieve symptoms successfully. This article describes the differential diagnosis of asthma and discusses some of the more common asthma variants and asthma mimickers.

Asthma and wheezing in young children — burden, onset, and risk factors: Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and a leading cause of morbidity measured by school absences, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and it often begins in early childhood with symptoms commencing during childhood in up to half of people with asthma; onset is earlier in males than females. No intervention has yet been shown to prevent the development of asthma or modify its long-term course, and atopy is present in the majority of children with asthma who are over 3 years old, with allergen-specific sensitization (particularly multiple early-life sensitizations) cited as one of the most important risk factors for development of asthma.

Asthma physical examination — Physical examination in people with asthma is often normal, and the most frequent abnormality is expiratory wheezing (rhonchi) on auscultation, which may be absent or only heard on forced expiration; wheezing may also be absent during severe asthma exacerbations due to severely reduced airflow (so called 'silent chest'), but other physical signs of respiratory failure are usually present; wheezing may also be heard with inducible laryngeal obstruction, COPD, respiratory infections, tracheomalacia, or inhaled foreign body (when wheezing may be unilateral); crackles (crepitations) and inspiratory wheezing are not features of asthma; and nasal examination may reveal signs of allergic rhinitis or nasal polyps.

### Welcome to asthma neverland [^113a2hG1]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a multifactorial disease with heterogeneous clinical and pathophysiological phenotypes. Classical symptoms of asthma are wheeze, cough and breathlessness, and occasionally chest tightness. These symptoms are common to many respiratory and non-respiratory conditions, and misdiagnosis of asthma is frequent. There is no definitive test for the diagnosis of asthma, but a combination of a suggestive medical history, physical examination, lung function tests, and additional investigations will maximize the chances of making a correct diagnosis. Despite clear statements in international asthma guidelines, there are many gaps when performing diagnostic steps in current medical practice. An incomplete medical history, poor attention to the nature of respiratory sounds, failure to carry out objective tests, and inadequate estimation of the response to anti-asthma therapy are the main factors responsible for misdiagnosis of asthma. The use of wrong and potentially dangerous therapies, and high consumption of healthcare resources are the inevitable consequences of misdiagnosis. The main alternative diagnoses to asthma, clinical clues and objective tests useful for specific diagnoses are critically discussed.

### BTS / NICE / SIGN joint guideline on asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024)-summary of recommendations [^111qtuMA]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Initial clinical assessment

Clinical history

Obtain a structured clinical history in people with suspected asthma. Specifically, check for:

reported wheeze, noisy breathing, cough, breathlessness or chest tightness, and any variation (for example, worse during the night or early morning, or seasonal) in these symptoms
any triggers that make symptoms worse
a personal or family history of asthma or allergic rhinitis
symptoms to suggest alternative diagnoses (see theand.) [NICE 2017, BTS/SIGN 2019, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

Do not confirm a diagnosis of asthma without a suggestive clinical history and a supporting objective test. Code as suspected asthma until the diagnosis is confirmed. [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

If the diagnosis of asthma is confirmed, record the basis for this in the person's medical records, alongside the coded diagnostic entry. [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

Physical examination

Examine people with suspected asthma to identify expiratory polyphonic wheeze and signs of other causes of respiratory symptoms but be aware that even if examination results are normal, the person may still have asthma. [NICE 2017]

Initial treatment and objective tests for acute symptoms at presentation

Treat people immediately if they are acutely unwell or highly symptomatic at presentation, and perform objective tests that may help support a diagnosis of asthma (for example, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), spirometry or(PEF) before and after bronchodilator) if the equipment is available. [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

If objective tests for asthma cannot be done immediately for people who are acutely unwell or highly symptomatic at presentation, carry them out when acute symptoms have been controlled, and advise people to contact their healthcare professional immediately if they become unwell while waiting to have objective tests. [NICE 2017, amended BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]

Be aware that the results of spirometry andmay be affected in people who have been treated with inhaled corticosteroids (the test results are more likely to be normal). [NICE 2017]

### Among respiratory symptoms, wheeze associates most strongly with impaired lung function in adults with asthma: a long-term prospective cohort study [^1118ApKh]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Key messages

How does the type/number of respiratory symptoms associate with lung function decline on a long-term basis among women and men with asthma?
Among respiratory symptoms, wheeze associates most strongly with impaired lung function in women and men with asthma. For both sexes the greater number of respiratory symptoms, the lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s values over time.
Long-term population-based studies on lung function and respiratory symptoms among adults with asthma are scarce. This study gives new knowledge opening possibilities to future studies focusing on this field. The results may be used to assess a more accurate prognosis of asthma depending on the symptom presentation.

### Phenotypes of childhood asthma: are they real? [^116NcBta]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2010). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that there are several distinct phenotypes of childhood asthma or childhood wheezing. Here, we review the research relating to these phenotypes, with a focus on the methods used to define and validate them. Childhood wheezing disorders manifest themselves in a range of observable (phenotypic) features such as lung function, bronchial responsiveness, atopy and a highly variable time course (prognosis). The underlying causes are not sufficiently understood to define disease entities based on aetiology. Nevertheless, there is a need for a classification that would (i) facilitate research into aetiology and pathophysiology, (ii) allow targeted treatment and preventive measures and (iii) improve the prediction of long-term outcome. Classical attempts to define phenotypes have been one-dimensional, relying on few or single features such as triggers (exclusive viral wheeze vs. multiple trigger wheeze) or time course (early transient wheeze, persistent and late onset wheeze). These definitions are simple but essentially subjective. Recently, a multi-dimensional approach has been adopted. This approach is based on a wide range of features and relies on multivariate methods such as cluster or latent class analysis. Phenotypes identified in this manner are more complex but arguably more objective. Although phenotypes have an undisputed standing in current research on childhood asthma and wheezing, there is confusion about the meaning of the term 'phenotype' causing much circular debate. If phenotypes are meant to represent 'real' underlying disease entities rather than superficial features, there is a need for validation and harmonization of definitions. The multi-dimensional approach allows validation by replication across different populations and may contribute to a more reliable classification of childhood wheezing disorders and to improved precision of research relying on phenotype recognition, particularly in genetics. Ultimately, the underlying pathophysiology and aetiology will need to be understood to properly characterize the diseases causing recurrent wheeze in children.

### The all age asthma cohort (ALLIANCE)-from early beginnings to chronic disease: a longitudinal cohort study [^116m5bPE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Wheezing disorders and asthma are the most prevalent chronic respiratory diseases both in childhood and adulthood. About 25–30% of children have at least one episode of wheeze before their 3rd birthday, but considerable clinical heterogeneity exists. Many of these children become symptom-free between 3 and 8 years of age, but some go on to persistent asthma in later childhood and adulthood.

Although the characteristic clinical manifestations of asthma in children and in adults are rather uniform with wheezing, shortness of breath and cough, population-based clinical and genetic studies suggest that asthma is not one disease but many. Despite its prevalence, little is known about the diverse underlying pathomechanisms determining the different asthma phenotypes both in children and adults, including asthma transition (Fig. 1). Affected individuals vary with regard to severity and nature of their primary complaints, but also in relation to comorbidities, response to treatment, and to the course of the disease throughout life. The different asthma phenotypes and trajectories are presumably caused by diverse underlying pathophysiological processes. Recent related research also takes complex, explicit molecular data into account to better link biology to clinical presentation which may then be called an asthma endotype.

Fig. 1
Wheeze and asthma phenotypes during childhood and adulthood. About 25–30% of children have at least one episode of wheeze before their 3rd birthday, but considerable clinical heterogeneity exists (broken line box I). Children with transient wheeze become symptom-free before school-age, those with non-atopic asthma after about 8 years of age. However, some, especially those with persistent atopic wheeze and seasonal triggers of wheeze go on to persistent asthma in later childhood and adulthood. Interestingly, girls present with new-onset asthma in significant numbers during adolescence, thereby adding to turning the sex-based bias from male towards female sex. While there is also new-onset-asthma during adulthood, it is unclear whether differences between persistent childhood asthma phenotypes continue throughout transition (broken line box II) into adulthood

### Bronchiolitis needs a revisit: distinguishing between virus entities and their treatments [^114CMb3X]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bronchiolitis is most often described as a virus‐induced inflammation of small bronchioles and their surrounding tissue. According to different guidelines, its upper age limit varies from 6 or 12 months, 12 months being preferred by many European countries, to 2 years, used in the United States 1, 2, 3 Clinically, bronchiolitis is characterized by expiratory breathing difficulty in infants. Other symptoms include cough, tachypnea, hyperinflation, chest retraction, widespread crackles, and wheezing. Wheezing is generally not a mandatory criterion. Instead, it is a descriptive term, defined as a whistling sound during expiration, often accompanied by dyspnea. It can be caused by obstruction at any level of the lower airways. However, when bilateral/polyphonic, inflammation is probable.

Bronchiolitis presents a huge clinical burden. Depending on the definitions, the prevalence of bronchiolitis has been between 18% and 32% in the first and 9% and 17% in the second year of life. 2, 3 At the same time, the overall risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma is 70% before school‐age and 50% during school years. 1, 4 However, patient characteristics and the risk of asthma strongly vary inside the bronchiolitis cohort thus revealing different disease entities, some of which have a markedly high risk of subsequent asthma development.

To that end, we propose a differentiation of bronchiolitis subtypes by specific viruses and a broad inclusion of children by extending the upper age limit from 6 or 12 months up to 2 years. Recent data clearly indicate that the two major viral causes of bronchiolitis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), have distinct genetics, pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical characteristics, and responses to treatments both regarding short‐ and long‐term outcomes. 1, 5, 6, 7 Thus, a general bronchiolitis diagnosis should be revisited, as the identification of different viruses associated with severe bronchiolitis should improve our understanding of the disease and open avenues for precision medicine.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111nvJAc]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, diagnosis, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose asthma in children aged ≤ 5 years if they meet the following 3 criteria (record as suspected asthma if only 1 or 2 criteria are met)
| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Recurrent acute wheezing episodes with or without asthma-like symptoms between episodes|- At least 2 acute episodes (lasting > 24 hours) of asthma-like signs/symptoms (such as wheezing on expiration, accessory muscle use, difficult and/or heavy breathing), with wheezing confirmed during at least 1 episode, OR <br/> - At least 1 acute wheezing episode (lasting > 24 hours) with wheezing confirmed and with asthma-like symptoms between wheezing episodes (|
|No likely alternative cause for the respiratory symptoms|- No other condition (except for a concurrent viral respiratory infection) is likely to explain the asthma-like signs/symptoms based on a thorough medical history and examination <br/> - Avoid obtaining imaging or laboratory tests|
|Timely clinical response to acute or longer-term asthma treatment|- During an acute wheezing episode in a healthcare setting, confirmed improvement of respiratory symptoms and signs within 20–60 minutes after administration of short-acting β-agonist or, for more severe episodes, within 3–4 hours after short-acting β-agonist and oral corticosteroid are commenced, OR <br/> - At home, the parent/caregiver reports that the child's wheezing or difficulty breathing improves within 20–60 minutes after being given short-acting β-agonist, OR <br/> - During a 2–3-month trial of daily ICS (100–250 mcg/day fluticasone-propionate equivalent by pressurized metered-dose inhaler via spacer) plus as-needed short-acting β-agonist, the parent/caregiver reports a decrease in the severity and/or frequency of the child's acute wheezing episodes or asthma-like symptoms between acute wheezing episodes.|

### Understanding how asthma starts: longitudinal patterns of wheeze and the chromosome 17q locus [^116yLEpg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Are four wheezing patterns all there are? Whereas many longitudinal birth cohorts have identified these four patterns, two additional wheezing patterns have been described by latent class analysis of UK and Dutch birth cohorts, with an additional transient wheeze group (prolonged early wheeze) and an additional late-onset group, the intermediate-onset wheeze group, which is strongly associated with atopy. This illustrates the strength but also the limitation of data-driven methods: the ability to define wheezing phenotypes is indeed strongly driven by the data, such as the number of assessments of wheeze and number of children studied.

How does the description of longitudinal wheezing phenotypes advance our understanding of asthma development? No wheezing pattern was uniquely predictive of asthma; in fact, all wheezing patterns were associated with a higher chance of ever developing asthma. Interpretation of this analysis may be complicated by the fact that a doctor's diagnosis of asthma at any age was taken as an outcome, as many children obtained their asthma diagnosis in the first 3 years of life. However, other studies also indicate that there is no wheezing pattern that uniquely leads to asthma, defined by asthma at school age, reduced lung function, or airway hyperresponsiveness. Thus, the pattern itself has limited ability to predict asthma, and the fact that these wheezing patterns can only be defined retrospectively limits their clinical use.

Diagnosing asthma in children aged 5 years and under

It can be challenging to make the diagnosis of asthma in some children aged ≤ 5 years. Recurrent wheezing is very common in this age group, including in children without asthma, typically with viral upper respiratory tract infections. Routine assessment of airflow limitation or bronchodilator responsiveness in this age group is difficult and is not practical in primary care.

Asthma diagnosis in children aged ≤ 5 years can be based on symptom patterns, the presence of risk factors, therapeutic response to controller treatment, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses

A diagnosis of asthma in young children with a history of wheezing is more likely if they have wheezing or coughing that occurs with exercise, laughing or crying, or in the absence of an apparent respiratory infection, a history of other allergic disease (eczema, food allergy, or allergic rhinitis), atopy or asthma in first-degree relatives, clinical improvement during 2–3 months of controller treatment, and worsening after cessation.

The following questions can be used to elicit features suggestive of asthma in young children and features that help support the diagnosis:
Does your child have wheezing? Wheezing is a high-pitched noise that comes from the chest and not the throat. Use of a video questionnaire, or asking a parent to record an episode on a smartphone if available can help to confirm the presence of wheeze and differentiate from upper airway abnormalities.
Does your child wake up at night because of coughing, wheezing, or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or breathlessness?
Does your child have to stop running, or play less hard, because of coughing, wheezing or difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath?
Does your child cough, wheeze or get difficult breathing, heavy breathing, or shortness of breath when laughing, crying, playing with animals, or when exposed to strong smells or smoke?
Has your child ever had eczema, or been diagnosed with allergy to foods?
Has anyone in your close family had asthma, hay fever, food allergy, eczema, or any other disease with breathing problems?

In preschool children with wheeze, phenotypes have been proposed based on short-term symptom patternsor on symptom pattern trends over time –, but these have not proved to be clinically useful or accurate in predicting asthma in later childhood.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111NPZX7]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

What are the key content changes for primary care?

1. A new practical definition of asthma

'Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation'. This clinical definition, focussing on the two key features needed for the diagnosis of asthma (variable respiratory symptoms and variable airflow limitation), replaces a previous lengthy description of pathological and physiological features of asthma. For the first time, asthma is also defined as a heterogeneous disease.

2. Practical advice for confirming and documenting the diagnosis of asthma, to minimise under- or over-treatment

Tools include tables summarising criteria for variable expiratory airflow limitation, prioritised by reliability and feasibility for clinical practice. Clinicians are strongly encouraged to document the basis for diagnosis of asthma in individual patients; this is invaluable if the patient fails to respond to treatment or the diagnosis is in doubt. Specific advice is provided about confirming the diagnosis in special populations, e.g. the elderly, or patients presenting only with cough, and about strategies for confirming the diagnosis of asthma in patients already prescribed controller treatment.

3. Assess two domains of asthma control — symptom control and risk factors for adverse outcomes (also called 'future risk')

Past asthma control assessments have focussed on current symptom control (e.g. with the Royal College of Physicians 'three questions', Asthma Control Testor Asthma Control Questionnaire), but this is insufficient, as patients who report few symptoms may still be at risk of asthma exacerbations. Each patient's risk factors for future exacerbations, fixed airflow limitation and side effects (also called their 'future risk') should also be assessed. Poor symptom control itself is a well-known risk factor for exacerbations; GINA also includes an expanded list of other risk factors that are independent of the level of symptom control, including incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence and low lung function. A helpful table explains specific treatment for modifiable risk factors, as not all risk factors for exacerbations require a step-up in asthma treatment.

### Smart devices are poised to revolutionize the usefulness of respiratory sounds [^1123PY5V]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

The association between breathing sounds and respiratory health or disease has been exceptionally useful in the practice of medicine since the advent of the stethoscope. Remote patient monitoring technology and artificial intelligence offer the potential to develop practical means of assessing respiratory function or dysfunction through continuous assessment of breathing sounds when patients are at home, at work, or even asleep. Automated reports such as cough counts or the percentage of the breathing cycles containing wheezes can be delivered to a practitioner via secure electronic means or returned to the clinical office at the first opportunity. This has not previously been possible. The four respiratory sounds that most lend themselves to this technology are wheezes, to detect breakthrough asthma at night and even occupational asthma when a patient is at work; snoring as an indicator of OSA or adequacy of CPAP settings; cough in which long-term recording can objectively assess treatment adequacy; and crackles, which, although subtle and often overlooked, can contain important clinical information when appearing in a home recording. In recent years, a flurry of publications in the engineering literature described construction, usage, and testing outcomes of such devices. Little of this has appeared in the medical literature. The potential value of this technology for pulmonary medicine is compelling. We expect that these tiny, smart devices soon will allow us to address clinical questions that occur away from the clinic.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116cUwkc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma in children 5 years and younger — prescribing regular controller treatment notes that intermittent or episodic wheezing of any severity may represent an isolated viral-induced wheezing episode, an episode of seasonal or allergen-induced asthma, or unrecognized uncontrolled asthma, and that the initial treatment of wheezing is a SABA every 4–6 hours as needed until symptoms disappear, usually within 1 to 7 days; however, uncertainty surrounds the addition of other medications in these children, especially when the nature of the episode is unclear.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^112pbEV6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

FENO measurement in children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing — prediction of future asthma: In children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing, the Expert Panel recommends against FENO measurement to predict the future development of asthma (Strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The Clinician's Summary states that in children aged 4 years and younger with recurrent wheezing, FENO measurement does not reliably predict the future development of asthma, and test results should be interpreted with caution until more data are available; the Expert Panel recommends against using FENO testing to predict future development of asthma in this age group until additional research and clinical practice determinations are available. Evidence synthesis identified ten studies in children younger than 5 years to predict subsequent asthma in those aged 5 years and older; none were RCTs, seven were nonrandomized longitudinal studies and three were cross-sectional; in only a single study, a FENO level indicating increased risk yielded a positive predictive value of 58.0% for a composite of wheezing, diagnosis of asthma, or use of an ICS at age 7 years, with a negative predictive value of 78.2%. Additional context notes that FENO can be measured in young children with normal resting breathing and reference values exist for ages 1 to 5 years; in some preschool children with recurrent coughing and wheezing, an elevated FENO level more than 4 weeks after an upper respiratory tract infection may help predict physician-diagnosed asthma at school age, but the studies reviewed had conflicting results and provided low to moderate certainty; the acceptability of FENO measurement for predictive purposes is low and use of this testing is unlikely to change current treatment standards and could actually misdirect care.

### Intra-breath changes in respiratory mechanics are sensitive to history of respiratory illness in preschool children: the SEPAGES cohort [^117KB5QT]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Population description

Among the 384 children invited to perform oscillometry, 320 (acceptability rate = 83%) accepted and amongst them 281 (success rate = 88%) had at least 3 standard measures fulfilling the acceptability and reproducibility criteria (CV for R 7 ≤ 15%). For intra-breath oscillometry, the acceptance criterion was ≥ 3 regular and artefact-free breathing cycles; this was fulfilled in 291 of the 320 children (mean of breathing cycles: 9.1), success rate: 91%. Data from 251 children who performed both at least one 10 Hz intra-breath and 3 standard measurements were retained in the analysis (Fig. 1). On average the included children (n = 251) compared to the non-included children (220 children enrolled in the SEPAGES cohort, but without oscillometry measures) had higher weight and height at birth, had more often higher parental educational levels and less often a gestational duration less than 37 weeks (Table 1). The mean (sd) age of the study population was 37.4 (3.3) months (Table 2). Ever doctor-diagnosed asthma, wheezing, bronchitis and bronchiolitis were reported in 12.0%, 33.6%, 21.1% and 37.8% of the children, respectively. In the first 3 years of life, 9.6% of the children (n = 24) had been hospitalised for a respiratory problem. Oscillometry indices are described in Table 3.

Wheezing phenotypes — historical classification schemes in preschool children: In the past, two main classifications of wheezing were proposed, including a symptom-based classification that distinguished episodic wheeze (often with URTI and absent between episodes) from multiple-trigger wheeze (episodic wheeze with symptoms between episodes and triggered by sleep, activity, laughing, or crying), and a time trend-based classification derived from cohort data that included transient wheeze defined by symptoms that began and ended before the age of 3 years.

Lung function assessment timing — Lung function should be assessed at diagnosis or start of treatment, after 3–6 months of ICS-containing treatment to assess the patient's personal best FEV1, and periodically thereafter. In most adult patients, lung function should be recorded at least every 1–2 years, but more frequently in higher risk patients including those with exacerbations and those at risk of decline in lung function; lung function should also be recorded more frequently in children based on asthma severity and clinical course (Evidence D). Once the diagnosis of asthma has been confirmed, it is not generally necessary to ask patients to withhold their regular or as-needed medications before visits, but preferably the same conditions should apply at each visit.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for asthma, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose asthma in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients based on typical variable respiratory symptoms and confirmed variable expiratory airflow:

- **Wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough**: symptoms occurring variably over time and vary in intensity; symptoms often worse at night or on waking; symptoms often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air; symptoms worsen after end-exercise (very distinctive); symptoms often appearing or worsening with viral infections

- **Confirmed excessive variability in lung function (≥ 1 of the following)**: positive bronchodilator responsiveness test with spirometry (or peak expiratory flow); excessive variability in twice-daily peak expiratory flow over 2 weeks; increase in lung function after 4 weeks of ICS-containing treatment; positive bronchial challenge test; excessive variation in lung function between visits.

### The use of inhaled corticosteroids in the wheezy under 5-year-old child [^114bgzS9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2011). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids are established as the most effective long-term anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma. National and international treatment guidelines recommend the use of these agents for long-term asthma control in children. In children < 5 years, there are significant difficulties in diagnosing asthma. There are multiple non-asthma causes of wheeze, and there remains a lack of consensus in the description of wheezing phenotypes in this group of children. There is also a relative paucity of data concerning the short- and long-term effectiveness and side-effects in the under-fives: treatment recommendations have drawn heavily from experience of asthma treatment in school-age children and remains controversial. This article discusses the important recent advances in the evidence-base and current expert opinions which are helping to delineate improved outcomes for young children with wheeze.

### Blowing the whistle: what do African American adolescents with asthma and their caregivers understand by "wheeze? " [^114bzJ6a]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate what African American adolescents with asthma and their caregivers understand by "wheeze".

Methods

Caregivers (n = 35) and adolescents (n = 35) were each asked to describe what they understood by "wheeze". Respondents were also shown a video clip of an adolescent wheezing and asked: a) to describe the breathing of the adolescent in the video; and, b) whether the adolescent respondent's breathing had ever been similar to the video-presented symptoms.

Results

Most caregivers described wheeze in terms of sound alone (61.8%) while the majority of adolescents described wheeze as something that is felt (55.8%). Few caregivers and adolescents (5.8% each) included "whistling" in their descriptions of "wheeze". Most caregivers and adolescents used the word "wheeze" when describing the video clip, but nearly one-quarter of the caregivers and one-third of the adolescents felt that the adolescent's breathing was never similar to the video.

Conclusion

Caregiver and adolescents descriptions of wheeze are different from each other and both may be different from clinical definitions of the term. Study findings have implications for the ways in which questions about "wheeze" are framed and interpreted.

### Evaluation of obstructive lung disease with vibration response imaging [^113EzsM2]. The Journal of Asthma (2008). Low credibility.

As optimal treatment and prognosis differ between asthma and COPD, a new diagnostic approach to differentiating between the two disorders would be clinically desirable. We evaluated the utility of vibration response imaging in differentiating between asthma and COPD. Sixty-six subjects with asthma or COPD were recorded, before and after the administration of a short-acting bronchodilator, using a computerized lung sound analysis device. Gray-scale images of breath sound distribution in the lungs, quantitative data in breath sound graphs (timing, amplitude) and automatic crackle and wheeze detection programs were used to differentiate between asthma and COPD subjects. Imaging data were compared with the clinical diagnosis, made by the standard methods (medical history, physical examination, and spirometric indices). Blinded evaluation of images demonstrated a significantly higher rate of improvement in image dynamics, shape and overall improvement following bronchodilator in subjects with asthma compared with those with COPD. Quantitative data showed distinct patterns in timing and amplitude for these two pathologies. Combined analyses based on qualitative image evaluation and quantitative data demonstrated an overall 85% accuracy (84% for asthma, 86% for COPD) in differentiating between asthma and COPD. Combined qualitative and quantitative evaluations of lung sounds are quite sensitive in distinguishing between lung sound recordings of COPD and asthma individuals. Lung sound features of synchronization in timing and intensity provide objective data that may further differentiate these two airway disorders.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-", "medium-", and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### Digitally mapping the asthma journey-from diagnosis to remission [^116VQ94o]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

An accurate asthma diagnosis depends on both a reliable and detailed history of symptoms from the patient and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation with up to 20% variability. However, the reliability of patient report varies widely from patient-to-patient, and clinic-based spirometry may be normal at the time of assessment. Digital technology can aid asthma diagnosis by enabling objective recording of clinical manifestations and capturing variability in airflow limitation in near real-time from the patient's home, rather than depending on a cross-sectional consultation.

Smartphones, wheeze detectors, AI cough monitors and smartwatches can support the detection of asthma symptoms. Using their smartphones, patients or carers can record respiratory symptoms as they occur. These recordings can capture both sound characteristics (such as different types of cough and wheeze) and visual patterns of breathing through video recording of chest movements. For young children with recurrent coughing, commercially available wheeze detectors (e.g. WheezeScan®, StethoMe®) can be used at home to provide objective evidence of wheezing. Although still in research phases and requiring clinical validation, mobile apps integrating an AI cough-monitor (Hyfe cough®, Resguard Med®) to record cough types and patterns, and smartwatch asthma detection systems combining breathing and guttural sound signals to passively detect asthma symptoms, could contribute to future asthma diagnostic criteria.

Respiratory — Airway Management assessment directs clinicians to implement emergent interventions and monitoring and specifies key history and physical examination elements. History should assess time of onset of symptoms; associated symptoms and triggers for dyspnea (e.g., exertion, exercise, lying flat); history of asthma or other breathing disorders; choking or other evidence of upper airway obstruction; history of trauma; prior similar episodes and what has helped in the past, including home interventions; and severity of shortness of breath or sensation of dyspnea. Physical examination should assess for abnormal respiratory pattern, rate and/or effort; use of accessory muscles; ability to speak words or sentences; quality of air exchange including depth of respiration and equality of breath sounds; and abnormal breath sounds such as wheezing, rhonchi, rales, or stridor.

Diagnosis of asthma

It is critical to confirm the diagnosis of asthma

Primary care clinicians are consulted by patients with many hundreds of different medical conditions in any year. Every day, they are faced with the challenge of quickly arriving at an accurate diagnosis in limited time, and often with limited access to specialized investigations.

In order to ensure diagnosis of asthma is considered as early as possible, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when patients present with respiratory symptoms.

Over- and under-diagnosis of asthma are common and are usually due to the lack of objective lung function testing which can demonstrate variable expiratory airflow limitation that will support the diagnosis of asthma and help to exclude other causes. For continuity of care, it is important to ensure that the diagnosis is recorded in each patient's medical record, detailing the basis for the diagnosis, including objective measurements of variable airflow obstruction and airway inflammation, if available. These details are often lacking in the medical records of childrenand adults treated for asthma.

Medical records should also contain details of treatment prescribed, education given to help patients understand the chronic nature of their disease, and provision of a personal written action plan to enable them to change their treatment and seek assistance when needed.

Diagnosing asthma in adults, adolescents and children aged 6–11 years

Confirm the diagnosis of asthma before starting controller treatment, if possible

There is no single test for confirming the diagnosis of asthma. First, a clinical diagnosis starts with a history of respiratory symptoms (such as cough, wheeze, difficulty breathing and/or shortness of breath) that typically vary over time and intensity (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Symptoms of asthma are often worse at night and in the early morning, and may be triggered by factors such as viral infections, allergen exposure, exercise, strong smells, cigarette smoke, exhaust fumes and laughter. When taking a history, it may be helpful to show patients or carers a video depicting typical symptoms, such as the one developed by Wellington School of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Otago, New Zealand, available from the Global Asthma Network website. Physical examination may be entirely normal.

### Phenotypic differences between pediatric and adult asthma [^1169MjPD]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

The goal of asthma phenotyping is to understand disease mechanisms or optimize management. Phenotypes show age-related variation. The phenotypes of wheezing in the first year of life are little studied; many remit in the second year of life, and the children who remit do not have later-onset wheeze, as far as is known. Preschool wheeze is optimally phenotyped by symptom pattern, defined as either episodic viral or multiple-trigger wheeze, which allows rational treatment planning. In school age and adult life, most patients with mild asthma can be managed adequately without phenotyping, but severe asthma clearly falls into several phenotypic groups. Children with severe asthma have no gender bias and are highly atopic with relatively well-preserved lung function, in contrast to the female-preponderant, non-atopic bias seen in adults. Phenotyping has been mainly by proximal luminal cellularity. However, this does not take account of any variation of cellularity over time, distal airway changes, or the relative contribution of mucosal and luminal inflammatory changes. There may be a separate exacerbating phenotype, characterized by airway eosinophilia. Particular adult phenotypes include late-onset asthma and a phenotype characterized by progressive loss of lung function, but critical review suggests that these phenotypes may also have childhood roots. Longitudinal data are needed to determine the stability of phenotypes and their prognoses. Retrospective recall of childhood events is of limited value. In conclusion, a full understanding the multifaceted phenotypes of asthma requires a thorough knowledge of early life events and their consequences over many decades.

### Infantile wheeze: rethinking dogma [^116kaYD1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Wheeze is a common symptom in young children and is usually associated with viral illnesses. It is a major source of morbidity and is responsible for a high consumption of healthcare and economic resources worldwide. A few children have a condition resembling classical asthma. Rarer specific conditions may have a wheezy component and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Over the last half century, there have been many circular discussions about the best way of managing preschool wheeze. In general, intermittent wheezing should be treated with intermittent bronchodilator therapy, and a controller therapy should be prescribed for a young child with recurrent wheezing only if positively indicated, and only then if carefully monitored for efficacy. Good multidisciplinary support, attention to environmental exposition and education are essential in managing this common condition. This article analyses the pathophysiological basis of wheezing in infancy and critically discusses the evolution of the scientific progress over time in this unique field of respiratory medicine.

### Parents' accounts of wheeze and asthma related symptoms: a qualitative study [^113QFCFg]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine parents' accounts of how they recognise and judge respiratory symptoms in children, and to investigate their interpretations of respiratory survey questions about wheeze, shortness of breath, and cough.

Methods

Qualitative study using semistructured interviews. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method. Nineteen parents of children aged under 6 years were recruited from a cohort of parents who had responded to an earlier respiratory symptom survey and from one general practice.

Results

Parents judged respiratory symptoms using a range of cues, including changes in the sound of breathing and changes in appearance and behaviour. Experiential resources and contextual factors played an important role in parents' judgements. Interpretations of questions about respiratory symptoms were varied, particularly in relation to the terms "attacks of wheeze" and "shortness of breath". Parents' descriptions of wheeze differed from descriptions of the sound of wheeze used in some survey questionnaires. Parents drew fine distinctions between different "types" of cough and identified a distinct "asthma" cough.

Conclusions

Attention needs to be given to the complexity of reporting respiratory symptoms in children and to the importance of contextual factors in parents' judgements. We suggest that questions which require parents to report on children's internal feelings or states be avoided. Consideration should be given to providing parents with explicit direction on what cues to attend to or ignore in reporting symptoms, and to clarifying some questions that are currently used in clinical practice and in surveys.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: an evidence-based approach to the child with preschool wheeze [^114pVQpF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Preschool wheeze is very common and its prevalence is increasing. It consumes considerable healthcare resources and has a major impact on children and their families due to significant morbidity associated with acute episodes. History taking is the main diagnostic instrument in the assessment of preschool wheeze. Diagnosis and management is complicated by a broad differential and associations with many other diseases and conditions that give rise to noisy breathing, which could be misinterpreted as wheeze. Several clinical phenotypes have been described but they have limitations and do not clearly inform therapeutic decisions. New insights in aetiopathogenesis modify treatment options and lay foundation for further research. An understanding of the approach and available evidence to assess and manage wheeze informs best patient care and use of resources. Our objective is to demonstrate a focused history, examination and management options in a preschool child with wheeze.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111K9Vft]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis — In patients with chronic respiratory symptoms, diagnosis involves a stepwise approach beginning with whether the patient is likely to have chronic airways disease, then syndromic categorization as having typical asthma, typical COPD, features of both, and/or with other conditions such as bronchiectasis; lung function testing is essential to confirm persistent airflow limitation, and variable airflow obstruction can be detected with serial peak flow measurements and/or measurements before and after bronchodilator.

### Diagnosis and management of asthma in adults: a review [^1177XNRD]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on asthma:

- **Definition**: Asthma is a chronic disorder of the lower respiratory tract characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible airflow obstruction presenting with episodic or persistent symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea, and cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of asthma is complex and not fully understood. It involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors that lead to airway inflammation, hyperresponsiveness, and remodeling. Exposure to allergens triggers an inflammatory response in the airways, leading to bronchoconstriction, increased mucus production, and airway remodeling.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of asthma in the US is estimated at 8.2% in the general population involving all ages.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for asthma include a genetic predisposition, atopy, and exposure to environmental factors, such as air pollutants, volatile organic compounds, benzene, formaldehyde, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, xylenes, cleaning agents, insecticides, dampness, mould, and allergens. Additionally, respiratory infections and a personal or family history of allergies are significant risk factors.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of asthma include recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can vary in frequency and severity and are often worse at night or in the early morning.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of asthma can vary widely among patients. It is generally a controllable chronic condition that can lead to a good QoL with appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114BCza6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis of asthma in children 5 years and younger — key points and indicators: Recurrent wheezing occurs in a large proportion of children 5 years and younger and it may be difficult to recognize the initial presentation of asthma; previous classifications of wheezing phenotypes do not appear to identify stable phenotypes and their clinical usefulness is uncertain, although emerging research suggest more clinically relevant phenotypes and phenotype-directed therapy may be possible. A diagnosis of asthma in young children with a history of wheezing is more likely if they have wheezing or coughing with exercise, laughing or crying, or without an apparent respiratory infection; a history of other allergic disease, allergen sensitization or asthma in first-degree relatives; and clinical improvement during 2–3 months of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment plus as-needed short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) reliever with worsening after cessation.

### The coming era of a new auscultation system for analyzing respiratory sounds [^112fn5Ax]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In this review, we will check the limitations of the existing auscultation method by checking the types of abnormal breathing sounds and the accuracy of analysis through the existing stethoscope. Next, we will introduce the new auscultation methods developed so far (AI-assisted analysis and wireless or attached stethoscopes) and the current status of breath sound analysis using them. Furthermore, we will suggest further research directions in the future.

Classification of abnormal respiratory sounds

Respiratory sounds are produced by the airflow in the respiratory tract and are divided into two categories: Normal or abnormal sound. Normal respiratory sound is made when there is no pulmonary disorder and consist of tracheal, bronchial, bronchovesicular, and vesicular sounds. Abnormal respiratory sounds are caused by diseases at the lung or bronchus. They can be described by the mechanism of production, location they are detected in, characteristics (such as continuity, range of pitch, timing mostly heard), and acoustic features (Table 1).

Table 1
Classification of abnormal lung sounds and related diseases

Crackles are short, discontinuous, explosive sounds heard during inspiration and sometimes on expiration. Fine crackles are generated by inspiratory opening of small airways and associated with interstitial pneumonia or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and congestive heart failure (CHF). Coarse crackles are produced by gas passing through intermittent airway opening and are related to secretory diseases such as chronic bronchitis and pneumonia.

Wheezes are generated in the narrowed or obstructed airway. They have high frequency (> 100–5000 Hz) and sinusoidal oscillation in sound analysis. They usually occur in obstructive airway diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rhonchi are induced by the narrowing of airways, caused by the production of secretions, so rhonchi can disappear after coughing (Table 1).

Stridor is a high-pitched, continuous sound produced by turbulent airflow through a narrowed airway of upper respiratory tract. It is usually a sign of airway obstruction that requires prompt intervention. In patients with pleural inflammation such as pleurisy or pleural tumor, a visceral pleura becomes rough, and its friction with the parietal pleura generates crackling sounds, a friction rub (Table 1).

Although respiratory sounds are not difficult for a trained clinician to discern in usual cases, some sounds are ambiguous even for an expert to distinguish accurately. In addition, there are some cases where a mixture of several abnormal breathing sounds can be heard. Novel AI-assisted stethoscope can be useful for these challenging situations.

### Enigma variations: the multi-faceted problems of pre-school wheeze [^117921gP]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2022). Medium credibility.

Numerous publications on wheezing disorders in children younger than 6 years have appeared in the medical literature over the last decades with the aim of shedding light on the mechanistic pathways (endotypes) and treatment. Nevertheless, there is yet no consensus as to the appropriate way to manage preschool wheeze mainly because of the lack of a clear definition of "preschool asthma" and the paucity of scientific evidence concerning its underlying endotypes. A symptom-based approach is inadequate since the human airway can respond to external stimuli with a limited range of symptoms and signs, including cough and wheeze, and these manifestations represent the final expression of many clinical entities with potentially different pathophysiologies requiring different individualized treatments. Hence, new studies challenge the symptom-based approach and promote the importance of managing the wheezy child based on the "airway phenotype". This will enable the clinician to identify not only the child with a serious underlying pathology (e.g., a structural airway disorder or immunodeficiency) who is in need of prompt and specific treatment but also increase the specificity of treatment for the child with symptoms suggestive of an "asthma" syndrome. In the latter case, focus should be given to the identification of treatable traits. This review summarizes the current understanding in management of preschool wheezing and highlights the unmet need for further research.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11247AmX]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (evaluation), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to elicit brief focused history, perform a relevant physical examination, and obtain objective measurements, concurrently with the prompt initiation of therapy, in patients with asthma exacerbation presenting to primary care:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|History|- Timing of onset and cause (if known) of the present exacerbation <br/> - Severity of asthma symptoms, including any limiting exercise or disturbing sleep <br/> - Any symptoms of anaphylaxis <br/> - Any risk factors for asthma-related death <br/> - All current reliever and maintenance medications, including doses and devices prescribed, adherence pattern, any recent dose changes, and response to current therapy|
|Physical examination|- Signs of exacerbation severity and vital signs (level of consciousness, temperature, HR, respiratory rate, BP, ability to complete sentences, use of accessory muscles, wheezing) <br/> - Complicating factors (such as anaphylaxis, pneumonia, pneumothorax) <br/> - Signs of alternative conditions explaining acute breathlessness (such as cardiac failure, inducible laryngeal obstruction, inhaled foreign body, or PE)|
|Objective measurements|- Pulse oximetry (saturation levels < 90% in signal the need for aggressive therapy in pediatric and adult patients) <br/> - Peak expiratory flow in > 5 years old patients.|

### Wheezing exacerbations in early childhood: evaluation, treatment, and recent advances relevant to the genesis of asthma [^114qBHnm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Children who begin wheezing during early childhood are frequently seen by health care providers in primary care, in hospitals, and in emergency departments, and by allergists and pulmonologists. When a young child, such as the 2 year-old patient presented here, is evaluated for wheezing, a frequent challenge for clinicians is to determine whether the symptoms represent transient, viral-induced wheezing or whether sufficient risk factors are present to suspect that the child may experience recurrent wheezing and develop asthma. Most factors that influence prognosis are not mutually exclusive, are interrelated (ie, cofactors), and often represent gene-environment interactions. Many of these risk factors have been, and continue to be, investigated in prospective studies to decipher their relative importance with the goal of developing new therapies and interventions in the future. The etiologies of wheezing in young children, diagnostic methods, treatment, prognostic factors, and potential targets for prevention of the development of asthma are discussed.

### Clinical asthma syndromes and important asthma mimics [^111RtnWE]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple clinical phenotypes. Phenotypes can be grouped into clinical or physiological, trigger-defined, and inflammatory phenotypes. Treatment based on inflammatory phenotyping improves clinical measures of asthma morbidity. Further study of individual asthma phenotypes will improve understanding of their immunologic and pathologic characteristics and improve diagnosis and therapy. Because asthma is a common disorder with nonspecific presenting features, other disorders are often misdiagnosed as asthma. A high index of suspicion for alternative diagnoses must be maintained when evaluating a patient who presents with clinical features suggestive of asthma, particularly if the patient presents with atypical symptoms or fails to respond to therapy.

### Evaluation of clinically and physiologically atypical asthma: If it doesn' T wheeze it may still be asthma [^111BCGAW]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Children with asthma-like symptoms may not clinically wheeze. The objectives of this study were to evaluate if children, without physician-documented wheeze, wheeze during bronchial-challenge-testing (BCT), and if measurements of O 2 Sat and respiratory rate during BCT improve the BCT sensitivity?

Methods

Seven hundred and twenty-four children, who were referred for suspicion of asthma, performed a BCT. Positive BCT was determined by the provocation concentration (PC) which resulted in a 20% decrease in FEV 1 (PC 20), (in those who were able to perform spirometry, group B), or (in those unable to perform spirometry, group A) a 50% increase in respiratory rate (PC RR), or a 5% decrease in oxygen-saturation (PC O2-Sat) or appearance of wheezing (PC wheeze).

Results

Five hundred and seven BCTs were positive: group A n = 89 age, median (IQR), 3 (2.5–3.7) years (17.6%), were unable to perform spirometry, and group B n = 418 age 10.7 (6.8–15.6) years (82.4%), were able to perform spirometry. Children, without physician-documented wheeze in the total population (groups A plus B), were more likely (65.5%) to have a positive BCT without wheeze compared with those with physician-documented wheeze (41.0%, P < 0.001). In group A, adding PC RR and PC O2-Sat increased BCT sensitivity by 23.6%.

Conclusions

Many children in both groups did not wheeze despite reaching BCT endpoints. Children without physician-documented wheeze tended not to wheeze at BCT. This may result in clinical under-diagnosis of asthma if depending on the presence of wheeze. In young children, adding PC RR and PC O2-Sat substantially increases BCT sensitivity and may improve asthma diagnosis.

Asthma in children 5 years and younger — tests to assist diagnosis — notes that while no tests definitively diagnose asthma with certainty, the following are useful adjuncts: a therapeutic trial for at least 2–3 months with as-needed SABA and regular low-dose ICS may provide some guidance (Evidence D), with response evaluated by symptom control and frequency of wheezing and exacerbations; marked improvement on treatment and deterioration when stopped support a diagnosis, and a trial may need repeating; allergic sensitization can be assessed by skin prick testing or allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, is present in the majority once over 3 years of age, absence does not rule out asthma, and allergic sensitization is the best predictor for development of persistent asthma; chest radiographs are rarely indicated but may help exclude alternative diagnoses when doubt exists, with other imaging as appropriate; lung function, bronchial provocation, and other physiological tests do not have a major role at this age, though by 5 years many can perform reproducible spirometry with coaching; FeNO is not widely available and remains primarily a research tool, can be measured with tidal breathing with published normal reference values for children aged 1–5 years, and in preschool children an elevated FeNO recorded 4 weeks from any URTI predicted physician-diagnosed asthma at school age and increased the odds for wheezing, asthma and ICS use by school age.

Cough in children 5 years and younger — features supporting asthma and differential cues: Cough due to asthma is generally non-productive, recurrent and/or persistent, and is usually accompanied by wheezing episodes and breathing difficulties, while allergic rhinitis may be associated with cough in the absence of asthma. A nocturnal cough (when the child is asleep) or a cough that occurs with exercise, laughing or crying, in the absence of an apparent respiratory infection, supports a diagnosis of asthma, though the common cold and other respiratory illnesses including pertussis are also associated with coughing. Prolonged cough in infancy, and cough without cold symptoms, are associated with later parent/caregiver-reported physician-diagnosed asthma, independent of infant wheeze, and characteristics of cough in infancy may be early markers of asthma susceptibility, particularly among children with maternal asthma.

### Clinical assessment of asthma progression in children and adults [^113Mab9a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder with a variable course, characterized by episodes of cough, wheezing and shortness of breath, reversible airflow limitation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. It begins early in life in many subjects with intermittent symptoms occurring with viral respiratory tract infections. Over time, and in genetically susceptible children (those with an atopic predisposition), the disease becomes more persistent with symptoms occurring in the absence of respiratory tract infections. Children with persistent wheezing are eventually diagnosed with asthma, with those at greatest risk having developed allergic sensitization early in life. Among children with asthma, some will have lifelong asthma with active symptoms and progressive loss of lung function over time, whereas other children will undergo asthma remission in adolescence. Once in remission, the disease may remain quiescent, or it may relapse in midadult life. This review focuses on studies that have enhanced our understanding of the progression of asthma from infancy to adulthood. Studies evaluating progressive loss of lung function, the best-studied measure of asthma progression, are also reviewed, followed by a brief discussion of whether asthma progression can be modified by inhaled glucocorticoid therapy.

### Children with nocturnal asthma wheeze intermittently during sleep [^114QTGQu]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

Nocturnal asthma indicates poor overall control of asthma and adversely affects the quality of life of the patient. The purpose of the present study was to compare the objective measurement of nocturnal wheeze with clinical state, recall of symptoms, and changes in lung function. Nine asthmatic children aged 9 to 16 years were followed with an asthma diary and diurnal measurement of peak flow for a week before the nocturnal study; all but two were apparently well controlled. Breath sounds were recorded and analyzed continuously overnight to quantify wheeze using a phonopneumography sensor attached over the trachea. The analytical system (PulmoTrack) utilized an algorithm to detect wheeze and reject interference. The wheeze rate (Tw/Ttot = duration of wheeze/duration of recording) was calculated minute by minute throughout the night. Recordings lasted over 8 hours and all but two children had wheeze lasting for a total time of between 11 and 87 minutes. The pattern of wheezing was very variable during sleep, with episodes of wheeze separated by periods of quiet breathing. There was no relationship between subjective perception of nocturnal asthma, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) next morning, and the objective measurement of wheeze. Total overnight wheeze was significantly related to the total diary symptom score and to the (small) diurnal variability of peak expiratory flow (PEF). Four of the seven children with asthma who were apparently well controlled had considerable amounts of wheeze during the night that was episodic in nature and unrelated to conventional measures of lung function or nocturnal symptoms.

### Cough-variant asthma: a review of clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and pathophysiology [^1171qkfh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic cough is among the most common symptoms prompting medical care. Cough-variant asthma (CVA) is an asthma subset where cough is the primary symptom, without wheezing, chest tightness, or dyspnea. It is an important cause of chronic cough, estimated to account for 25% to 42% of cases, but likely underdiagnosed due to delayed recognition and pitfalls of diagnostic testing. Early recognition and treatment can reduce morbidity and delay its progression to more typical asthma. This review details the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of CVA and contrasts it with classic asthma and other causes of chronic cough.

### "To wheeze or not to wheeze": that is not the question [^111BXqrG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of asthma in young children is difficult and based on clinical assessment of symptoms and results of physical examination. Respiratory wheeze has traditionally been used to define asthma in young children.

Objective

We sought to compare the qualitative diagnosis of wheeze with a quantitative global assessment of significant troublesome lung symptoms during the first 3 years of life as a predictor of asthma by age 7 years.

Methods

Children born to asthmatic mothers (n = 411) were followed prospectively to age 7 years. Parents were instructed to visit the research clinic during the first 3 years of life each time the child had significant troublesome lung symptoms for 3 days. At the clinic, a research physician performed a physical examination, including auscultation for wheeze and excluding differential diagnoses. We tested whether wheeze was independently associated with asthma at age 7 years after adjusting for the total number of episodes.

Results

Three hundred thirteen children had full follow-up by age 7 years. In a multivariable analysis the total number of acute clinic visits for asthma symptom was significantly associated with later asthma (P < .0001), whereas the presence of wheeze at these visits was not (P = 0.5). The total number of acute clinic visits for significant troublesome lung symptoms was also significantly associated with later asthma in children who had never presented with any wheeze (P = 0.03).

Conclusion

A quantitative global assessment of significant troublesome lung symptoms in the first 3 years of life is a better predictor of asthma than assessment of wheeze. Doctor-diagnosed wheeze is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of asthma, and relying on the symptom of wheeze will likely be an important cause of undertreatment.

### Wheezing and vocal cord dysfunction mimicking asthma [^115godtL]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a respiratory disorder characterized by paradoxical closure of the vocal cords during the respiratory cycle leading to obstructive airway symptoms. The presenting symptoms vary from stridor to wheezing. VCD may coexist with asthma or masquerade as asthma. Misdiagnosis of VCD as asthma leads to inappropriate use of systemic steroids with its adverse effects, frequent emergency department visits, hospitalization, and, rarely, intubation and tracheostomy. Attenuation of the inspiratory flow volume loop on spirometry is suggestive of VCD. Laryngoscopic demonstration of the paradoxical vocal cord movements during an acute attack is the gold standard for the diagnosis of VCD. Patient education, speech therapy, and psychologic counseling are the therapeutic tools for treatment.

Viral-induced wheezing in young children — frequency and diagnostic challenges: Recurrent wheezing occurs in a large proportion of children aged 5 years or younger and is typically associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), which occur in this age group around 6–8 times per year; some viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus are associated with recurrent wheeze throughout childhood. A large proportion of wheezing episodes in young children is virally induced whether the child has asthma or not, making it difficult to determine whether wheeze with a respiratory infection is an isolated event versus a recurrent clinical presentation of childhood asthma; in children aged under 1 year, bronchiolitis may present with wheeze and is usually accompanied by chest signs such as crackles on auscultation.

### Associations of wheezing phenotypes with late asthma outcomes in the avon longitudinal study of parents and children: a population-based birth cohort [^115iqzVm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease that displays phenotypic variation throughout the life course. Prospective longitudinal studies date the origins of a high proportion of asthma cases to early childhood, and variations in the natural history of childhood wheezing are associated with different long-term outcomes. Therefore the search for causal factors influencing the development and natural course of asthma has focused on early life. Cohort studies recruited in pregnancy or soon after birth have examined associations between early-life influences and childhood asthma, but only a few factors with modest effects have been identified, and these do not explain recent increases in childhood asthma prevalence. A possible explanation for difficulties in identifying causes of childhood wheezing is that phenotypic heterogeneity is a manifestation of underlying differences in the pathophysiology of asthma endotypes, each having different genetic and environmental influences. Characterization of wheezing phenotypes in children might help clarify the underlying mechanisms through which asthma occurs and improve the power to detect causal factors.

A seminal example of a temporal approach to characterizing wheezing phenotypes reported in 1995 by the Tucson Children's Respiratory Studydrew attention to the distinction between transient early wheezing and persistent or later-onset wheezing in their associations with subsequent asthma history. Subsequently, we applied data-driven approaches to identify 6 wheezing phenotypes using repeated measures of wheezing in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Our methods and results have been replicated/validated in several independent cohorts, with remarkable similarity in the patterns of wheezing phenotypes characterized in different populations. Wheezing phenotypes defined by using this approach have clear differences in their associations with clinical markers of asthma, and we have also reported associations with early risk factorsand differences in genetic associations, suggesting that these are distinct biological entities. Others have shown face validity of statistically derived phenotypes compared with those defined by using conventional clinical criteria and identified a novel clinical phenotype characterized by unremitting wheeze, low lung function, and poor bronchodilator response but without an asthma diagnosis. However, to date, there have been few novel insights into how modifiable environmental factors might influence the onset of specific asthma subtypes, which would be a prerequisite for primary or secondary prevention of disease.

### Childhood asthma-predictive phenotype [^113oVoDV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Wheezing is a fairly common symptom in early childhood, but only some of these toddlers will experience continued wheezing symptoms in later childhood. The definition of the asthma-predictive phenotype is in children with frequent, recurrent wheezing in early life who have risk factors associated with the continuation of asthma symptoms in later life. Several asthma-predictive phenotypes were developed retrospectively based on large, longitudinal cohort studies; however, it can be difficult to differentiate these phenotypes clinically as the expression of symptoms, and risk factors can change with time. Genetic, environmental, developmental, and host factors and their interactions may contribute to the development, severity, and persistence of the asthma phenotype over time. Key characteristics that distinguish the childhood asthma-predictive phenotype include the following: male sex; a history of wheezing, with lower respiratory tract infections; history of parental asthma; history of atopic dermatitis; eosinophilia; early sensitization to food or aeroallergens; or lower lung function in early life.

### Detection of wheezing during maximal forced exhalation in patients with obstructed airways [^117GXZ1f]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Wheezing is a common clinical finding in patients with asthma and COPD during episodes of severe airway obstruction, and can also be heard in normal subjects during forced expiratory maneuvers; however, the properties of wheezing are difficult to perceive and quantify during auscultation. We therefore developed and evaluated a new technique for recording and analyzing wheezing during forced expiratory maneuvers in a group of patients with obstructed airways (asthma, COPD) and a control group of healthy subjects.

Material and Methods

Sixteen patients with asthma (9 men and 7 women), 6 patients with COPD (6 men), and 15 healthy subjects (7 men and 8 women) were enrolled. The patients had moderate-to-severe obstruction (FEV(1) of 40 to 53% predicted). A contact sensor on the trachea was used to record sound during forced expiratory maneuvers. Wheeze detection was carried out by a modified algorithm in a frequency-time space after applying the fast Fourier transform.

Results

More wheezes were recorded in patients with obstructed airways than in control subjects: asthma patients, 8.4 ± 6.4 wheezes; COPD patients, 10.4 ± 6.1 wheezes; and control subjects, 2.9 ± 2.0 wheezes (mean ± SD). The mean frequency of all detected wheezes was higher in control subjects than in patients with obstructed airways (asthma patients, 560.9 ± 140.8 Hz; COPD patients, 669.4 ± 250.1 Hz; and control subjects, 750.7 ± 175.7 Hz). The total number of wheezes after terbutaline inhalation changed more in patients with obstructed airways than in control subjects.

Conclusions

The new method that we describe for studying airway behavior during forced expiratory maneuvers is able to identify and analyze wheeze segments generated in patients with obstructed airways, as evidenced by the greater number of wheezes detected in the patient group, the main finding of this study. This method clearly and objectively identifies the presence of obstructive disease.

### American Thoracic Society / National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap workshop report [^112X7HUk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly prevalent chronic obstructive lung diseases with an associated high burden of disease. Asthma, which is often allergic in origin, frequently begins in infancy or childhood with variable airflow obstruction and intermittent wheezing, cough, and dyspnea. Patients with COPD, in contrast, are usually current or former smokers who present after the age of 40 years with symptoms (often persistent) including dyspnea and a productive cough. On the basis of age and smoking history, it is often easy to distinguish between asthma and COPD. However, some patients have features compatible with both diseases. Because clinical studies typically exclude these patients, their underlying disease mechanisms and appropriate treatment remain largely uncertain. To explore the status of and opportunities for research in this area, the NHLBI, in partnership with the American Thoracic Society, convened a workshop of investigators in San Francisco, California on May 14, 2016. At the workshop, current understanding of asthma-COPD overlap was discussed among clinicians, pathologists, radiologists, epidemiologists, and investigators with expertise in asthma and COPD. They considered knowledge gaps in our understanding of asthma-COPD overlap and identified strategies and research priorities that will advance its understanding. This report summarizes those discussions.

Overview of key questions and recommendations for intermittent ICS use

Given the range of options for intermittent ICS dosing and the number of comparisons embedded in the three key questions for this priority topic, the Expert Panel made five recommendations for intermittent ICS use to address these key questions. The majority of the studies in the systematic review reporton this topic used comparative efficacy designs as opposed to comparative effectiveness designs.

Table IV provides an overview of the questions on this topic, interventions and comparators that the Expert Panel considered, and resulting recommendations. As shown, in the opinion of the Expert Panel, the evidence was insufficient to support recommendations for all of the comparators in the questions.

In the remainder of this section, each key question is followed by recommendations that are relevant to the question, the evidence that supports the recommendation, and guidance for implementing each recommendation. The Expert Panel did not address the efficacy and safety of the following types of intermittent ICS treatment because they were not mentioned in the key questions:
As-needed ICS-formoterol versus as-needed SABA in Step 1 (intermittent asthma) or Steps 5 and 6 (severe asthma) treatment (Figs 2–4)
As-needed ICS-formoterol versus low-dose ICS treatment and as-needed SABA in Step 2 (mild persistent asthma) treatment (Figs 2–4)

Question 4.1

What is the comparative effectiveness of intermittent ICS compared to no treatment, pharmacologic therapy, or nonpharmacologic therapy in children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing?

Recommendation 9: In children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections and no wheezing between infections, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends starting a short course of daily ICS at the onset of a respiratory tract infection with as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy compared to as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy only.

### Modeling wheezing spells identifies phenotypes with different outcomes and genetic associates [^116cQFyu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We found that 5.7% of children with asthma diagnoses in adolescence belonged to the NWZ group (and a similar proportion to the ETW group). This emphasizes the heterogeneity of doctor-diagnosed asthma at the population level and the fact that children with other respiratory symptoms such as cough (even in the absence of wheezing) are diagnosed as being asthmatic.

One limitation of our study is that the population is not ethnically diverse. In addition, early-life pulmonary or airway function tests were not performed, which limits the inference to the potential role of premorbid lung function. We also acknowledge that our study was not able to investigate the relationship between wheeze treatment, disease severity, and patterns of wheeze spells. With respect to genetic analyses, further investigations are needed at a genomewide level to help distinguish mechanisms of early-life wheeze and subsequent asthma.

In conclusion, our data are consistent with the notion that in addition to shared pathophysiology, distinct wheezing phenotypes are underpinned by unique mechanisms and genetic associates. Modeling using multidimensional variables of wheezing spells identified a stable and consistent architecture of wheezing illness, including a novel intermittent phenotype associated with early lung function decline to early adulthood. We suggest that the transformation of binary data into a set of multidimensional variables may better capture the temporal characteristics of wheeze development and may provide a more robust input for phenotype derivation.

### Asthma history and presentation [^115sRRNd]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is suspected from a history of key symptoms, including cough, wheezing, dyspnea, chest tightness, and increased mucus production. A positive family or personal history of atopic diseases and diseases that are comorbid with asthma, such as allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, is also important. The differential diagnosis of asthma is broad and includes potentially life-threatening diseases. Pediatric asthma and psychiatric mimics require special attention to prevent misdiagnosis. Differentiating asthma from these other disease states by history alone is not always possible. Because accurate diagnosis is critical to successful treatment, objective testing by spirometry and methacholine challenge should be employed.

### Diagnosis, management, and prognosis of preschool wheeze [^112tx1SR]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Preschool children (ie, those aged 5 years or younger) with wheeze consume a disproportionately high amount of health-care resources compared with older children and adults with wheeze or asthma, representing a diagnostic challenge. Although several phenotype classifications have been described, none have been validated to identify individuals responding to specific therapeutic approaches. Several risk factors related to genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environment are associated with preschool wheezing. Findings from several cohort studies have shown that preschool children with wheeze have deficits in lung function at 6 years of age that persisted until early and middle adulthood, suggesting increased susceptibility in the first years of life that might lead to persistent sequelae. Daily inhaled corticosteroids seem to be the most effective therapy for recurrent wheezing in trials of children with interim symptoms or atopy; intermittent high-dose inhaled corticosteroids are effective in moderate-to-severe viral-induced wheezing without interim symptoms. The role of leukotriene receptor antagonist is less clear. Interventions to modify the short-term and long-term outcomes of preschool wheeze should be a research priority.

Challenges in clinical diagnosis — airflow patterns and age‑related presentation: Although asthma is characterized by variable expiratory airflow limitation, at least initially, and COPD is characterized by persistent airflow limitation, the definitions of asthma and COPD are not mutually exclusive; in children and young adults with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms the differential diagnosis differs from older adults and, once other conditions are excluded, the most likely chronic airway disease in children and young adults is asthma, whereas in adults with long‑standing asthma persistent airflow limitation may be found and patients with COPD may show evidence of reversible airflow obstruction when a rapid‑acting bronchodilator is administered, so in medical records such patients often are assigned both diagnoses.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^115VAsyn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for infection‑triggered wheezing in young children: In children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections and no wheezing between infections, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends starting a short course of daily ICS at the onset of a respiratory tract infection with as‑needed SABA for quick‑relief therapy compared to as‑needed SABA for quick‑relief therapy only. Conditional recommendation, high certainty of evidence. The target population is children aged 0 to 4 years who have had three or more episodes of wheezing due to apparent respiratory tract infections in their lifetime or two such episodes in the past year and are asymptomatic between infections, for whom a short (7‑10‑day) course of ICS daily with as‑needed SABA is recommended at the onset of signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection. One regimen used in two studies is budesonide inhalation suspension, 1 mg, twice daily for 7 days at the first sign of respiratory tract infection–associated symptoms. Caregivers can initiate intermittent ICS treatment at home when they have clear instructions, clinicians should give caregivers written instructions and review the action plan at regular intervals, clinicians should consider this intervention in children who are not taking daily asthma treatment, and caregivers should be confident deciding when to start treatment (ie, at the onset of a respiratory tract infection).

With regard to GINA guidelines patients were categorised as having controlled asthma when they had no limitation of daily activities, nocturnal symptoms and exacerbations, had none or twice or less a week of daytime symptoms and need for rescue medications as well as normal lung function (FEV1 > 80% predicted). Partly controlled were patients having any of the following – limitation of activities, nocturnal symptoms/awakenings, more than twice a week had symptoms during the day and required reliever medication, had one or more exacerbation per year and FEV1 below 80% predicted. All subjects who reported three or more of the features of partly controlled disease or exacerbation in any week were regarded as uncontrolled asthmatics.

### Relationship of wheezing to the severity of obstruction in asthma… [^114Xwco6]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Ninety-three asthmatic patients were examined on 320 occasions for wheezing and peak expiratory flow rate. The presence of a wheeze was associated with a significantly lower PEFR. Expiratory wheezing was usually accompanied by inspiratory wheezing; this biphasic wheezing was associated with a lower PEFR than only expiratory wheezing. Loudness and the high pitch of wheezing were associated with more severe obstruction. Most expiratory wheezing lasted throughout the entire expiration. Expiratory or inspiratory wheezing of high pitch, moderate to severe intensity, and spanning the entire phase of the breath was associated with a lower PEFR than wheezing without these characteristics. Although characterization of wheezing has a general relationship to the severity of airway obstruction, an objective measurement of expiratory flow rate is necessary for the evaluation of each patient's condition.

wheezingListen to pronunciationA high-pitched, whistling sound that can occur during breathing when the airways in the lungs become narrowed or blocked. Wheezing is a sign that a person may be having trouble breathing. There are many causes of wheezing, but the most common causes are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, and pulmonary edema. Other causes include cystic fibrosis, pneumonia or other respiratory infections, breathing a foreign object into the lungs, congestive heart failure, vocal cord problems, acid reflux disease, allergies, severe allergic reactions, certain medicines, smoking, or a tumor in the lung or airway.
