## Question

How long should a stroke patient stay on plavix

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a stroke patient should stay on Plavix (clopidogrel). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario, because duration depends on whether this is acute dual antiplatelet therapy after a minor stroke or TIA versus long-term monotherapy for secondary prevention. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence and guideline recommendations for each scenario. Next, I will examine the timing of initiation and the optimal duration, including any exceptions like intracranial atherosclerosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm dosing details and safety considerations, including drug interactions and peri-procedural management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenarios that change duration. For acute minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA, short-course dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel is indicated, whereas for long-term secondary prevention after any noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, single antiplatelet therapy is standard, with clopidogrel 75 mg daily as an option, and dual therapy is not recommended beyond 90 days due to excess bleeding risk [^28f3d012] [^4d9d2674] [^dce12099].

> I will now examine the acute minor stroke or high-risk TIA scenario. The pivotal trials CHANCE and POINT, along with pooled analyses, show that initiating aspirin plus clopidogrel within 24 hours reduces recurrent ischemic stroke, with most of the benefit concentrated in the first 21 days and no additional benefit after that, while bleeding risk rises with longer durations. This is why guidelines recommend 21 to 90 days of DAPT followed by single antiplatelet therapy, with many experts favoring 21 days to minimize bleeding exposure [^f0937252] [^8fd89506] [^28f3d012] [^0e54057e].

> Wait, let me verify the timing nuance. CHANCE enrolled within 24 hours and used 21 days of DAPT, whereas POINT enrolled within 12 hours and used 90 days. The pooled analysis confirms benefit confined largely to the first 21 days, and POINT's longer duration explains its higher bleeding signal, reinforcing that extending DAPT beyond 21 days adds bleeding without added ischemic benefit in most patients [^f0937252] [^8fd89506] [^6ef269d7].

> Hold on, I should also consider the INSPIRES trial, which extended the initiation window to 72 hours and still showed benefit of clopidogrel plus aspirin over aspirin alone for 90 days, albeit with a small increase in moderate-to-severe bleeding. This supports the concept that early initiation matters, but it does not overturn the principle that most benefit accrues early and that shorter DAPT may optimize net clinical benefit in many patients [^7fe450c8] [^7c8b0767].

> Next, I should review long-term secondary prevention. For noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, lifelong single antiplatelet therapy is recommended, with clopidogrel 75 mg daily as an equivalent option to aspirin or aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole. Dual therapy beyond 90 days increases major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage without reducing ischemic stroke, so it should be avoided outside special circumstances [^fc0f3d5b] [^4d9d2674] [^dce12099].

> But wait, what if there is severe symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis. I need to check that exception. In patients with recent noncardioembolic stroke or TIA attributable to 70–99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery, guidelines allow consideration of clopidogrel plus aspirin for up to 90 days, given the higher early recurrence risk in this phenotype, after which transition to monotherapy is advised [^8205505f] [^091ed382].

> I should confirm dosing and practical details. For DAPT, typical regimens use a clopidogrel loading dose of 300 mg on day 1 followed by 75 mg daily, with aspirin 75–325 mg daily, for 21 to 90 days, then transition to a single agent. For long-term monotherapy, clopidogrel 75 mg daily is standard, with attention to CYP2C19 interactions, especially avoiding omeprazole or esomeprazole when possible due to reduced antiplatelet effect [^3fa77c91] [^91725472].

> Let me synthesize a risk-stratified answer. For minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA, start DAPT ideally within 12–24 hours and continue for 21 days, extending to 90 days only if the bleeding risk is low and the ischemic risk remains high, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy. For all other noncardioembolic ischemic strokes or TIAs, use single antiplatelet therapy lifelong, with clopidogrel 75 mg daily as a reasonable option alongside aspirin or aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole, and avoid DAPT beyond 90 days in routine practice [^28f3d012] [^0e54057e] [^fc0f3d5b] [^4d9d2674].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the default DAPT duration was uniformly 90 days, but I should correct that. The most efficient, evidence-aligned approach for most patients is 21 days of DAPT, with 90 days reserved for selected cases where the ischemic risk clearly outweighs bleeding risk, and even INSPIRES, while showing benefit out to 90 days, reinforces that the net benefit wanes and bleeding accumulates over time, supporting individualized duration within the 21–90 day window [^f0937252] [^8fd89506] [^7fe450c8].

---

The duration of Plavix (clopidogrel) after ischemic stroke depends on the clinical scenario: for **minor stroke or high-risk TIA**, use dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin for **21–90 days** [^28f3d012] [^0e54057e], then transition to single antiplatelet therapy [^ae1c34cd]; for **major stroke or long-term prevention**, use clopidogrel monotherapy **indefinitely** unless contraindicated [^fc0f3d5b] [^e3bd6fd3]. DAPT beyond 90 days increases bleeding risk without added benefit [^4d9d2674] [^739deda7] and is not recommended [^dce12099]. Always individualize based on bleeding risk, stroke subtype, and comorbidities [^6ce1d113].

## Indications for clopidogrel use in stroke patients

Clopidogrel is indicated for **secondary prevention** of ischemic stroke or TIA [^a420f1e5] and for **acute management** of minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA [^28f3d012].

---

## Duration of clopidogrel therapy based on clinical scenario

### Minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA

- **Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)**: Aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21–90 days [^28f3d012] [^0e54057e], ideally initiated within 12–24 hours of symptom onset [^28f3d012] [^0e54057e].
- **Transition to monotherapy**: After DAPT, continue a single antiplatelet agent (aspirin, clopidogrel, or aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole) [^fc0f3d5b] [^65b27f93].
- **Rationale**: Early DAPT reduces early recurrence [^f0937252]; beyond 90 days, bleeding risk outweighs benefit [^4d9d2674] [^739deda7].

---

### Major ischemic stroke or long-term secondary prevention

For major ischemic stroke or long-term secondary prevention, **monotherapy** with clopidogrel 75 mg daily is recommended indefinitely unless contraindicated [^fc0f3d5b] [^e3bd6fd3]. The **rationale** is that clopidogrel is effective for long-term prevention of recurrent ischemic events [^745d7194] [^7bbb83f9].

---

## Evidence supporting duration recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Evidence supporting duration** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Minor stroke/TIA | CHANCE and POINT trials | - Early DAPT for 21–90 days reduces recurrent stroke [^f0937252] [^8fd89506] <br/> - Benefit confined to early period [^f0937252] [^8fd89506] |
| Major stroke/long-term prevention | CAPRIE trial and AHA/ASA guidelines | - Clopidogrel monotherapy effective for long-term prevention [^745d7194] [^7bbb83f9] <br/> - Indefinite therapy recommended [^fc0f3d5b] [^e3bd6fd3] |

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged clopidogrel therapy

Prolonged clopidogrel therapy offers ischemic benefits but increases bleeding risk; **balancing these risks** is essential [^6ce1d113].

- **Benefits**: Reduced recurrent ischemic stroke and cardiovascular events [^745d7194] [^7bbb83f9].
- **Risks**: Increased major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, especially with prolonged DAPT [^4d9d2674] [^739deda7].

---

## Special considerations

- **Bleeding risk**: Assess individually; adjust duration if high risk [^6ce1d113].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g. omeprazole) due to reduced efficacy [^91725472] [^3fa77c91].
- **Surgery**: Discontinue clopidogrel 5 days prior to elective surgery [^91725472] [^d9fd343e].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration of clopidogrel therapy** |
|-|-|
| Minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA | 21–90 days (DAPT with aspirin), then monotherapy |
| Major ischemic stroke or long-term prevention | Indefinite monotherapy (75 mg daily) |

---

The duration of clopidogrel therapy after ischemic stroke is **scenario-specific**: 21–90 days of DAPT for minor stroke or high-risk TIA, then monotherapy; indefinite monotherapy for major stroke or long-term prevention. Individualize based on bleeding risk, stroke subtype, and comorbidities [^28f3d012] [^fc0f3d5b].

### Clopidogrel and aspirin for mild ischemic stroke (...) [^7c8b0767]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The results of this study suggest that patients with mild ischemic stroke or TIA can benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin when initiated up to 72 hours after symptom onset, without an excess of risk of moderate-to-severe bleeding. Importance. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was new stroke within 90 days. The primary safety outcome was moderate-to-severe bleeding, according to Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries criteria. Results. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03635749 Acute mild ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack is associated with a high risk of subsequent stroke within 90 days. 1-3 Currently, dual antiplatelet therapy is considered to be a key strategy to prevent.

In the Intensive Statin and Antiplatelet Therapy for Acute High-Risk Intracranial or Extracranial Atherosclerosis trial, DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin initiated within 72 hours was superior to aspirin alone with a lower risk of new stroke within 90 days but a higher risk of moderate-to-severe bleeding. 10 The INSPIRES trial included 2552 patients with time to randomization of more than 24 hours to 48 hours and 2737 patients randomized to more than 48 hours to 72 hours after symptom onset. Figure 2A shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curve of new stroke as the primary end point by different times to randomization. Patients with acute ischemic stroke may have unstable atherosclerotic plaque and accelerated platelet aggregation in the early phase of the disease, resulting in a high risk of stroke recurrence and progression in the first few days. 11, 12, 17-19 The main benefit of the early intensive antiplatelet therapy is to prevent this early risk of stroke recurrence.

Extension of the treatment time window of DAPT may benefit more patients, since the current guidelines recommend a short time window of opportunity for secondary stroke prevention. 8, 9 Previous studies showed that the risk of new stroke was still high in the second and third days after symptom onset of minor stroke and TIA, 3, 11, 12 indicating potential benefit from delayed DAPT for these patients.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Plavix is a P2Y12platelet inhibitor indicated for:

Acute coronary syndrome
For patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)] including patients who are to be managed medically and those who are to be managed with coronary revascularization, Plavix has been shown to decrease the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke as well as the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or refractory ischemia. (1.1)
For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Plavix has been shown to reduce the rate of death from any cause and the rate of a combined endpoint of death, re-infarction, or stroke. The benefit for patients who undergo primary PCI is unknown. (1.1)
Recent myocardial infarction (MI), recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease. Plavix has been shown to reduce the combined endpoint of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new MI (fatal or not), and other vascular death. (1.2)

1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

For patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS [unstable angina (UA)/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)], including patients who are to be managed medically and those who are to be managed with coronary revascularization, Plavix has been shown to decrease the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke as well as the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or refractory ischemia.
For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Plavix has been shown to reduce the rate of death from any cause and the rate of a combined endpoint of death, re-infarction, or stroke. The benefit for patients who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention is unknown.

The optimal duration of Plavix therapy in ACS is unknown.

1.2 Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

For patients with a history of recent myocardial infarction (MI), recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease, Plavix has been shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new MI (fatal or not), and other vascular death.

14.3 Lack of Established Benefit of Plavix plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease

CHARISMA

The CHARISMA trial was a 15,603 subject, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study comparing Plavix (75 mg daily) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis. All subjects were treated with aspirin 75–162 mg daily. The mean duration of treatment was 23 months. The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of CV death, MI, or stroke. A total of 534 (6.9%) patients in the Plavix group versus 573 (7.4%) patients in the placebo group experienced a primary outcome event (p=0.22). Bleeding of all severities was more common in the subjects randomized to Plavix.

14.2 Recent Myocardial Infarction, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

CAPRIE

The CAPRIE trial was a 19,185-patient, 304-center, international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study comparing Plavix (75 mg daily) to aspirin (325 mg daily). The patients randomized had: 1) recent histories of myocardial infarction (within 35 days); 2) recent histories of ischemic stroke (within 6 months) with at least a week of residual neurological signs; or 3) established peripheral arterial disease. Patients received randomized treatment for an average of 1.6 years (maximum of 3 years).

The trial's primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new myocardial infarction (fatal or not), or other vascular death. Deaths not easily attributable to nonvascular causes were all classified as vascular.

As shown in Table 6, Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of outcome events, primarily MI. The overall relative risk reduction (9.8% vs. 10.6%) was 8.7%, p=0.045. Similar results were obtained when all-cause mortality and all-cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes (risk reduction 6.9%). In patients who survived an on-study stroke or myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events was lower in the Plavix group.

The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 8. The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3-year follow-up period.

The statistical significance favoring Plavix over aspirin was marginal (p=0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of Plavix is substantial.

The CAPRIE trial included a population that was randomized on the basis of 3 entry criteria. The efficacy of Plavix relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these randomized subgroups (p=0.043). It is not clear whether this difference is real or a chance occurrence. Although the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of Plavix over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups, the benefit appeared to be strongest in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral vascular disease (especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction) and weaker in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, Plavix was not numerically superior to aspirin.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^91725472]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity Due to Impaired CYP2C19 Function

Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning] and by concomitant medications that interfere with CYP2C19.

Proton Pump Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant use of Plavix with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .

5.2	 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including Plavix, increase the risk of bleeding. If a patient is to undergo surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, discontinue Plavix five days prior to surgery. In patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to CABG the rates of major bleeding were similar (event rate 4.4% Plavix + aspirin; 5.3% placebo + aspirin). In patients who remained on therapy within five days of CABG, the major bleeding rate was 9.6% for Plavix + aspirin, and 6.3% for placebo + aspirin.

Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7–10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of clopidogrel's active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.

5.3 Discontinuation of Plavix

Avoid lapses in therapy, and if Plavix must be temporarily discontinued, restart as soon as possible. Premature discontinuation of Plavix may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

5.4 Patients with Recent Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke

In patients with recent TIA or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events, the combination of aspirin and Plavix has not been shown to be more effective than Plavix alone, but the combination has been shown to increase major bleeding.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Acute coronary syndrome (2.1)
Non-ST-segment elevation ACS (UA/NSTEMI): 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily, in combination with aspirin (75–325 mg once daily)
STEMI: 75 mg once daily, in combination with aspirin (75–325 mg once daily), with or without a loading dose and with or without thrombolytics
Recent MI, recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease: 75 mg once daily (2.2)

2.1	Acute Coronary Syndrome

Plavix can be administered with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

For patients with non-ST-elevation ACS (UA/NSTEMI), initiate Plavix with a single 300 mg oral loading dose and then continue at 75 mg once daily. Initiate aspirin (75–325 mg once daily) and continue in combination with Plavix [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] .
For patients with STEMI, the recommended dose of Plavix is 75 mg once daily orally, administered in combination with aspirin (75–325 mg once daily), with or without thrombolytics. Plavix may be initiated with or without a loading dose [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] .

2.2 Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

The recommended daily dose of Plavix is 75 mg once daily orally, with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

2.3 CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers

CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status is associated with diminished antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Although a higher dose regimen in poor metabolizers increases antiplatelet response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], an appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established.

2.4 Use with Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI)

Avoid using omeprazole or esomeprazole with Plavix. Omeprazole and esomeprazole significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix. When concomitant administration of a PPI is required, consider using another acid-reducing agent with minimal or no CYP2C19 inhibitory effect on the formation of clopidogrel active metabolite [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^620c3bfc]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

In CURE, the use of Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of CV death, MI or stroke in patient populations with different characteristics, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE-inhibitors. The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75–325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, non-study antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

The use of Plavix in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the Plavix group, 126 patients [2.0%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the Plavix group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%). The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting), (2253 patients [36.0%] in the Plavix group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4.0%).

Figure 7: Fatal or Nonfatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE Study

The statistical significance favoring clopidogrel over aspirin was marginal (p=0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of clopidogrel is substantial.

The CAPRIE trial enrolled a population that had recent MI, recent stroke, or PAD. The efficacy of clopidogrel relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these subgroups (p=0.043) (see Figure 8). Nonetheless, this difference may be a chance occurrence because the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups. The benefit was most apparent in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral arterial disease and less apparent in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, clopidogrel was not numerically superior to aspirin.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy after stroke or transient ischaemic attack-how long to treat? The duration of aspirin plus clopidogrel in stroke or transient ischaemic attack: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^04610090]. European Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel for 90 days was recommended as the secondary prevention of minor ischaemic strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) in 2014. However, whether the duration of 90 days is optimal for each patient remains unclear. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of short-term (≤3 months) and prolonged (≥1 year) DAPT after stroke or TIA were assessed via a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

The Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov and PubMed were searched up to December 2014 and nine randomized controlled trials were included involving 21 923 patients.

Results

Short-term DAPT significantly reduced the risk of ischaemic stroke recurrence by 41% and major vascular events by 30%, without increasing the risk of intracranial haemorrhage. Prolonged DAPT reduced the risk of ischaemic stroke recurrence by 12% and major vascular events by 10%. However, the risk of major bleeding and intracranial haemorrhage increased.

Conclusions

Short-term DAPT appears to be superior to prolonged DAPT. However, the difference in efficacy outcome needs to be carefully explained and confirmed by further well-designed randomized controlled trials.

Bleeding of all severities was more common in the subjects randomized to clopidogrel.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^db3cc531]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps and future research—dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) has uncertain optimal duration and hemorrhage tradeoffs; most trials used aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 to 90 days, and whether the duration should be 21 days, 90 days, or some other amount of time is not fully established, and the exact duration at which hemorrhage risk outweighs stroke-prevention benefit is unknown. Older patients and those with more severe stroke appear to be at higher risk of ICH with DAPT. Triple antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole in TARDIS, compared with standard antiplatelet therapy, found no difference in stroke outcomes and a significantly increased risk of bleeding with triple therapy. There may be other non–stroke-related indications for DAPT beyond 90 days after stroke, but these indications should be clarified to ensure that DAPT is not continued indefinitely beyond the clinically recommended time frame.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of clopidogrel bisulfate PO (also known as Plavix): 
- Bleeding: use caution in patients taking other drugs increasing the risk of bleeding, including anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and long-term NSAIDs. Discontinue clopidogrel 5 days before elective surgeries with a major risk of bleeding.
- Cardiovascular events: use caution when discontinuing clopidogrel. Restart clopidogrel as soon as possible if temporarily discontinued.
- Drug hypersensitivity reaction: use caution in patients with hypersensitivity to other thienopyridines.
- TTP: maintain a high level of suspicion, as an increased incidence has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel.

### Prevention of vascular events in patients with cerebrovascular disease: efficacy and appropriate duration of antiplatelet therapy [^7851b38d]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy has shown consistent benefit in the prevention of secondary stroke. The paucity of head-to-head studies of different antiplatelet regimens, assessment of comparative efficacy, and optimal treatment duration requires evaluation and comparison of clinical studies that vary extensively in design and follow-up. Evidence for aspirin benefit in secondary stroke prevention is strong, but existing studies provide little guidance with regard to treatment duration. The efficacy of clopidogrel in secondary event prevention is significantly greater than that of aspirin for patients with a history of peripheral artery disease, but does not differ from that of aspirin for patients with a history of stroke or myocardial infarction. Relative to clopidogrel alone, the addition of aspirin to clopidogrel results in increased risk for life-threatening bleeding episodes similar in absolute magnitude to the reduction of secondary event risk in patients with stroke. Benefits associated with clopidogrel occur early in the course of therapy; few data support clopidogrel use for longer than 1 year after stroke. Monotherapy with extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) provides reduction in secondary stroke risk similar to aspirin; however, the combination of aspirin plus ER-DP significantly reduces risk relative to either agent alone. Compared with placebo and monotherapy with either agent, risk reduction for the aspirin plus ER-DP combination continued through 24 months, with no concomitant increase in bleeding risk. Additional clinical studies should provide needed comparisons of efficacy and guidance with regard to optimal duration of therapy.

The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 7. The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3-year follow-up period.

Figure 7: Fatal or Nonfatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE Study

The statistical significance favoring Plavix over aspirin was marginal (p=0.045). However, because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke, the effect of Plavix is substantial.

The CAPRIE trial enrolled a population that had recent MI, recent stroke, or PAD. The efficacy of Plavix relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these subgroups (p=0.043) (see Figure 8). Nonetheless, this difference may be a chance occurrence because the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of Plavix over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups. The benefit was most apparent in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral arterial disease and less apparent in stroke patients. In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction, Plavix was not numerically superior to aspirin.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Clopidogrel is a P2Y12platelet inhibitor indicated for:

Acute coronary syndrome
For patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS (unstable angina [UA]/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]), clopidogrel has been shown to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. (1.1)
For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), clopidogrel has been shown to reduce the rate of MI and stroke. (1.1)
Recent MI, recent stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease. Clopidogrel has been shown to reduce the rate of MI and stroke. (1.2)

1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

• Clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in patients with non–ST-segment elevation ACS (unstable angina [UA]/ non–ST -elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]), including patients who are to be managed medically and those who are to be managed with coronary revascularization. Clopidogrel should be administered in conjunction with aspirin.

• Clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the rate of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who are to be managed medically. Clopidogrel should be administered in conjunction with aspirin.

1.2 Recent MI, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or with a history of recent myocardial infarction (MI) or recent stroke clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the rate of MI and stroke.

14.2 Recent Myocardial Infarction, Recent Stroke, or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease

CAPRIE 

The CAPRIE trial was a 19,185-patient, 304-center, international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study comparing clopidogrel (75 mg daily) to aspirin (325 mg daily). To be eligible to enroll, patients had to have: 1) recent history of myocardial infarction (within 35 days); 2) recent histories of ischemic stroke (within 6 months) with at least a week of residual neurological signs; and/or 3) established peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Patients received randomized treatment for an average of 1.6 years (maximum of 3 years).

The trial’s primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of new ischemic stroke (fatal or not), new myocardial infarction (fatal or not), or other vascular death. Deaths not easily attributable to nonvascular causes were all classified as vascular.

As shown in Table 6, clopidogrel was associated with a lower incidence of outcome events, primarily MI. The overall relative risk reduction (9.8% vs. 10.6%) was 8.7%, p=0.045. Similar results were obtained when all-cause mortality and all-cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes (risk reduction 6.9%). In patients who survived an on-study stroke or myocardial infarction, the incidence of subsequent events was lower in the clopidogrel group.

### Optimal duration of aspirin plus clopidogrel after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^c7e6092f]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The role of aspirin plus clopidogrel (A+C) therapy compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack remains uncertain. We conducted this study to determine the optimal period of efficacy and safety of A+C compared with aspirin monotherapy. Methods- Ten randomized controlled trials (15434 patients) were selected using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (inception June 2018) comparing A+C with aspirin monotherapy in patients with transient ischemic attack or IS. The primary efficacy outcome was recurrent IS, and the primary safety outcome was major bleeding. The secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality) and all-cause mortality. We stratified analysis based on the short- (≤1 month), intermediate- (≤3 month), and long-term (>3 month) A+C therapy. Effects were estimated as relative risk (RR) with 95% CI. Results- A+C significantly reduced the risk of recurrent IS at short-term (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.78) and intermediate-term (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.90) durations. Similarly, major adverse cardiovascular event was significantly reduced by short-term (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.60-0.78) and intermediate-term (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.94) A+C therapy. However, long-term A+C did not yield beneficial effect in terms of recurrent IS (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63-1.04) and major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.07). Intermediate-term (RR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.19-5.60) and long-term (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.36-2.56) A+C regimens significantly increased the risk of major bleeding as opposed to short-term A+C (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.91-3.62). Excessive all-cause mortality was limited to long-term A+C (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10-1.93). Conclusions- Short-term A+C is more effective and equally safe in comparison to aspirin alone in patients with acute IS or transient ischemic attack.

Most of the benefit of clopidogrel occurred in the first two months, but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial (up to 12 months) (see Figure 2).

Figure 2: Cardiovascular Death, Myocardial Infarction, and Stroke in the CURE Study

The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various subgroups, as shown in Figure 3. The benefits associated with clopidogrel were independent of the use of other acute and long-term cardiovascular therapies, including heparin/LMWH, intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of aspirin (75 to 325 mg once daily). The use of oral anticoagulants, nonstudy antiplatelet drugs, and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE.

Figure 3: Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On-Study Concomitant Medications/Interventions for the CURE Study

The use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy (71 patients [1.1%] in the clopidogrel group, 126 patients [2%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 43%), and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (369 patients [5.9%] in the clopidogrel group, 454 patients [7.2%] in the placebo group, relative risk reduction of 18%).  The use of clopidogrel in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI (with or without stenting) (2253 patients [36%] in the clopidogrel group, 2324 patients [36.9%] in the placebo group; relative risk reduction of 4%).

### Indications for dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel: evidence-based recommendations for use [^7c2f5f71]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature assessing dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and subsequently provide evidence-based recommendations for appropriate indications and length of therapy.

Data Sources

An English-language MEDLINE search (1950-December 2007) was conducted using the search terms antiplatelet, aspirin, thienopyridine, and clopidogrel to identify articles assessing dual antiplatelet therapy. Evaluation of references from identified trials for possible inclusion was also conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that assessed treatment with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for any indication were included.

Data Synthesis

Aspirin and clopidogrel have complementary mechanisms of action to inhibit platelet function. Indications that have been studied include coronary artery disease (CAD), atherosclerotic ischemic stroke, and atrial fibrillation. This combination has been beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and in PCI patients without an acute event. There is a small but significant risk for increased bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy for these indications. When used in patients with a history of atherosclerotic ischemic stroke or for prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, this combination has been shown to increase bleeding, providing no clinical benefit, and to increase outcomes including stroke, myocardial infarction, and death, respectively.

Conclusions

There is evidence to support use of aspirin in combination with clopidogrel for patients presenting with all ACS types, as well as for patients presenting with PCI for any indication. The treatment duration varies, but patients who have received stenting should receive at least 1 year of combination therapy. There is no evidence to support this combination for primary prevention of CAD or atherosclerotic ischemic events, secondary prevention of stable CAD, or prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The possible benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy also must be weighed against the risk of bleeding.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel after minor ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA)—short-term parameters and effects: Recommendations for the short-term (21–90 days) use of DAPT are based on CHANCE and POINT, which initiated therapy early after onset (<24 and <12 hours, respectively) in minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score ≤3) or high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score ≥4) with treatment durations of 21 and 90 days, respectively. POINT used a 600-mg clopidogrel load then 75 mg daily plus aspirin 50 to 325 mg daily, whereas CHANCE used a 300-mg clopidogrel load then 75 mg daily plus an aspirin load of 75 to 300 mg followed by 75 mg daily; both trials demonstrated reduced recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days, with POINT showing benefit primarily in the first 21 days. Meta-analyses report DAPT reduces recurrent stroke versus aspirin monotherapy but benefit is limited if not started early (<7 days) after the index event, and most studies showed some increase in bleeding risk offset by stroke prevention benefit when limited to short-term use.

### Acute dual antiplatelet therapy for minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^2377f30f]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Key messages

Recent research on antiplatelet therapy has advanced the knowledge of early, intensive treatment for recurrent stroke in minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack
In patients with high risk, non-disabling ischaemic cerebrovascular events, including minor stroke and transient ischaemic attack, short term dual antiplatelet therapy should be given within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms and as early as possible
Further studies are needed to evaluate antiplatelet strategies, explore whether dual antiplatelet therapy could benefit broader patient population, and improve adherence of the recommended antiplatelet therapy

The risk of recurrent stroke and other vascular events is high in the first few weeks after index minor ischaemic stroke and high risk transient ischaemic attack (5-11.7%).Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), comprising clopidogrel and aspirin, is an effective strategy for reducing recurrence.An expert panel from the MAGIC group recently produced a strong rapid recommendation in The BMJ for starting DAPT within 24 hours of symptom onset and continuing for 10-21 days in patients with minor stroke or transient ischaemic attack.The evidence for this came from a systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical trials.Most current international guidelines,but not all,recommend early (within 24 hours) and short term (a duration of 21 days or 21-30 days) DAPT in patients with minor stroke or transient ischaemic attack (table 1).

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis [^8fd89506]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Meaning of the study

The evidence summarised in our review has important implications for the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy. The CHANCE trial continued dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days; the other trials for 90 days. The incidence curves from both CHANCE and POINT are striking in that they show that most stroke events occurred in the first seven days. Furthermore, separation of the incidence curves in the treatment and control groups happened within the first 10 days, with the curves thereafter essentially parallel (fig 3, table 3).

The failure of dual antiplatelet therapy to provide benefit beyond the first three weeks after treatment initiation is generally consistent with results from other studies examining the commencement of dual antiplatelet therapy substantially later than the first three days.These include the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) study, a randomised multicentre trial involving 3020 patients who failed to find a benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy but did show an increase in adverse events.

Conclusion

Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin given within 24 hours after high risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke reduces the risk of subsequent stroke by about 2%, with few serious adverse consequences. Discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy as early as 10 days, and no later than 21 days, after initiation is likely to maximise its net benefit.

These data provide direct evidence on the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin for patients who have experienced high risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke. The findings of this research paper raise questions about how the dual antiplatelet therapy should be used in clinical practice. In the linked article readers will find recommendations on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin for patients with high risk TIA or minor ischaemic stroke based on data from this paper. To do this a guideline panel has considered how direct this evidence is and using GRADE methodology has integrated this with for example the values and preferences of patients and resource implications. To read more about the guidelines please see the guideline article in this package.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis [^ef9e73eb]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

Strengths of this review include a comprehensive search for randomised, placebo controlled trials; explicit eligibility criteria with a focus on populations most likely to benefit from dual antiplatelet therapy; assessment of risk of bias; provision of important data not included in there published reports provided by the authors of the two large studies; use of the GRADE approach to determine our certainty in the evidence; and an innovative approach to creating a single incidence curve that informs the optimal duration for continuing clopidogrel from the two large studies. The consistent results across studies, and the clear benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy on recurrent stroke without evidence of important adverse effects, is likely to provide clear guidance for patients with high risk TIA and minor ischaemic stroke and for the clinicians responsible for their care.

Our study has some limitations. The loading dose and treatment onset time differed among the three studies: CHANCE and FASTER used a smaller loading dose of clopidogrel compared with POINT (300 mg v 600 mg) (table 1). This could leave clinicians with uncertainty as to which loading dose to choose. Our review does not address other populations of potential interest, including those who have experienced low risk TIA and those with moderate to severe ischaemic stroke.

No trial compared clopidogrel with dual antiplatelet therapy and the addition of aspirin. It is possible that different categories of ischaemic stroke subtypes—small vessel disease, large vessel stenosis, and cryptogenic—will respond differently to the addition of aspirin, and the net benefit of adding clopidogrel will therefore differ. The three trials did not address this issue in detail—to the extent they did, they failed to document convincing evidence of different subgroup effects according to different types of stroke. All three studies, however, enrolled populations heterogeneous for aetiology and excluded major cardioembolic causes with an indication for oral anticoagulant therapy, and the net benefit of adding clopidogrel across these heterogeneous population is clear.

Our review has important strengths compared with previous reviews.We focused on a specific population, used the GRADE approach to establish quality of evidence, chose an analytical strategy that clearly separated mortal and morbid events, obtained data from authors that allowed implementation of this plan, and conducted an innovative analysis that documented the duration of intervention effects. Most importantly, we included the recent POINT study conducted in heterogeneous Western populations with its striking replication of the previous Chinese CHANCE study.

For patients in the first year after an ACS who have undergone PCI with stent placement, we recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (including ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus low-dose aspirin 75-100 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus low-dose aspirin, or prasugrel 10 mg daily plus low-dose aspirin) over single antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B). We suggest ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily plus low-dose aspirin over clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus low-dose aspirin (Grade 2B). Remarks state that evidence suggests that prasugrel results in no benefit or net harm in patients with a body weight of less than 60 kg, age above 75 years, or with a previous stroke/TIA, and Food and Drug Administration labeling includes a boxed warning that the drug should not be used in patients with a history of TIA or stroke or urgent need for surgery, including CABG. For patients with ACS who undergo PCI with stent placement, we refer to sections 4.3.1 to 4.3.5 for recommendations concerning minimum and prolonged duration of treatment.

Dual versus single antiplatelet therapy (DAPT vs SAPT) for ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)—systematic review and meta-analysis methods: the clinical question asked “In patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA, what are the benefits and risks of DAPT compared to SAPT within 5 years for prevention of recurrent stroke?” The literature search covered English publications from December 1999 to December 5, 2019. Inclusion criteria were phase III or IV randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DAPT compared with SAPT that enrolled at least 100 subjects with TIA or ischemic stroke, and antiplatelet agents administered intravenously, not approved in the United States, or with other hypothesized modes of action (e.g., dipyridamole, cilostazol) were excluded. Title/abstract and full-text screening were performed independently by 2 evidence review committee (ERC) members with disagreements resolved by an ERC chair. Risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool v2.0, applied independently by 2 ERC members. Data were abstracted independently by 2 ERC members, capturing efficacy and safety outcomes including recurrent ischemic stroke (primary outcome), intracranial hemorrhage, all recurrent strokes, myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, vascular death, and major bleeding. Prespecified subpopulations included randomization within 72 hours of stroke/TIA onset and other clinical strata. Trials were categorized post hoc into short-duration (≤90 days) and long-duration (>90 days) studies, with short-duration trials randomly assigning subjects within 7 days after stroke/TIA. Summary treatment effects were estimated using random-effects meta-analyses.

### FDA review finds long-term treatment with blood-thinning medicine (...) [^4e2739cc]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Results from the DAPT trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2014. The DAPT trial compared treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months versus 30 months in patients who had undergone placement of a drug-eluting coronary stent. Compared to patients taking clopidogrel for 12 months, patients who were treated with clopidogrel for 30 months had lower rates of heart attacks and stent thrombosis but higher rates of death, primarily from cancer or trauma. 1 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that compared antiplatelet treatment for 30 months vs. 12 months following percutaneous coronary intervention and placement of a drug-eluting stent.

After stent placement, patients received 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin plus either clopidogrel or prasugrel and then were randomized to continued treatment for 18 additional months of dual antiplatelet therapy or to aspirin plus placebo. The investigators selected the antiplatelet agents patients received, with about two-thirds receiving clopidogrel and one-third receiving prasugrel. Acute coronary syndrome was the indication for the stent in about 46% of patients. The DAPT trial showed that the 30-month extended antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel or prasugrel decreased the risk of stent thrombosis and heart attacks, but increased the risk of bleeding and overall risk of death compared to the 12-month group. The higher rate of death was primarily due to a larger number of deaths from non-cardiovascular causes, principally cancer and trauma.

The increased rate of death was evident in patients receiving clopidogrel but not prasugrel.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of different durations of dual antiplatelet therapy in acute minor non-cardioembolic stroke: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^171440e2]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

International guidelines recommend short-course dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for secondary prevention in patients with acute minor stroke. However, the optimal duration of such therapy remains unclear. This review aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of different DAPT durations in the secondary prevention of acute minor ischemic stroke.

Methods

The present study systematically searched PubMed, Embase (via Ovid), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify relevant randomized-controlled trials. The primary outcome was the incidence of all recurrent strokes. Data synthesis was performed through network meta-analysis and paired meta-analysis methodologies.

Results

A total of 7 studies with 34,646 participants were included. Compared with aspirin alone, each course of DAPT reduced the risk of recurrent stroke but increased the risk of bleeding: aspirin-clopidogrel 21 day DAPT (OR 0.75,95% CI 0.66-0.85)/(OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16-1.89); aspirin-ticagrelor 30 day DAPT (OR 0.81,95% CI 0.70-0.95)/(OR 3.98,95% CI 1.74-9.10); aspirin-clopidogrel 90 day DAPT (OR 0.75,95% CI 0.60-0.93)/(OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.42-2.88). Compared with aspirin-clopidogrel 21 day DAPT, aspirin-ticagrelor 21 day DAPT was more efficacious with an increased risk of bleeding (OR 0.78,95% CI 0.65-0.92)/(OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39-2.49). Network meta-analysis showed that aspirin-clopidogrel 21 day DAPT had the best risk-benefit profile, followed by aspirin-ticagrelor 21 day DAPT and aspirin-clopidogrel 90 day DAPT, with aspirin alone being the least effective.

Conclusions

The risk-benefit profile of 21 day DAPT with aspirin-clopidogrel was superior to that of other short-course DAPTs.

Summary of current evidence

Our literature search identified four RCTs – which tested DAPT early after minor or moderate ischaemic stroke and TIA. Three RCTs (CHANCE, FASTER, POINT) tested the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel versus aspirin and placebo and have already been summarised in a systematic review and meta-analysis.Only people with minor ischaemic stroke (NIHSS ≤3) and high-risk TIA were included in these trials. Minor ischaemic stroke was defined as NIHSS of 3 or less in the POINT and CHANCE trials and high-risk TIA as an ABCD2 score of 4 or more. In the FASTER trial, people with TIA needed to have either weakness or speech disturbance as part of the symptom complex with a duration of 5 minutes or more to qualify for inclusion in the study.

One RCT (THALES) tested aspirin and ticagrelor versus aspirin and placebo in people with minor or moderate stroke and high-risk TIA.

Patients with lower-risk TIA or only possible TIA or patients not assessed by a stroke specialist were not included in any of the identified randomised trials. In forming this recommendation we included outcomes up to 90-days after randomisation.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^95710ca7]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article about treatment and prevention of stroke is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendations" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with acute ischemic stroke, we recommend administration of IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) if treatment is initiated within 3 h of clearly defined symptom onset (Grade 1A). For patients with acute ischemic stroke of > 3 h but < 4.5 h, we suggest clinicians do not use IV tPA (Grade 2A). For patients with acute stroke onset of > 4.5 h, we recommend against the use of IV tPA (Grade 1A). For patients with acute ischemic stroke who are not receiving thrombolysis, we recommend early aspirin therapy (Grade 1A). For acute ischemic stroke patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparins (Grade 1A). For long-term stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) [ie, atherothrombotic, lacunar, or cryptogenic], we recommend treatment with an antiplatelet agent (Grade 1A), including aspirin (recommended dose, 50-100 mg/d), the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (25 mg/200 mg bid), or clopidogrel (75 mg qd). In these patients, we recommend use of the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (25/200 mg bid) over aspirin (Grade 1A) and suggest clopidogrel over aspirin (Grade 2B), and recommend avoiding long-term use of the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B). For patients who are allergic to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel (Grade 1A). In patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent stroke or TIA, we recommend long-term oral anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. In patients with venous sinus thrombosis, we recommend unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) or low-molecular-weight heparin (Grade 1B) over no anticoagulant therapy during the acute phase.

With long-term use (>5 y), the benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in preventing major vascular events may be offset by a reduction in cancer-related mortality with regimens that contain aspirin.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to secondary prevention (antiplatelet therapy), AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating clopidogrel 75 mg/day, in addition to aspirin, for up to 90 days to further reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with recent (within 30 days) stroke or TIA attributable to severe stenosis (70-99%) of a major intracranial artery.

### Antiplatelet use in ischemic stroke [^040417de]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The current consensus is that DAPT is appropriate in the acute phase (defined as the first 30 days poststroke) postischemic stroke, especially when initiated promptly, but there appears to be no benefit in continuing this further.Guidelines from several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and China, recommend commencing DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel within 24 hours of minor stroke (defined as NIHSS ≤3) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD≥ 4, the ABCDscore being an estimate of stroke risk after TIA based on patients age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms, and presence of diabetes) and continuing for 21 days. - This is largely based on the CHANCE and POINT trials that showed that DAPT with aspirin plus clopidogrel for up to 21 days leads to a significant reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days compared with aspirin monotherapy (RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.61-0.8, NNT = 53), n = 10 301. Further work could investigate using several different combinations of antiplatelet agents which have not been trialed to date.

Changing long-term antiplatelet therapy after recurrent events—evidence summary: No randomized trials have specifically focused on changing long-term antiplatelet therapy to prevent recurrent stroke, though a meta-analysis across four studies suggested lower recurrent stroke risk with switching therapy (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54–0.92]). Trial data are mixed: in SPS3, adding clopidogrel to aspirin showed no benefit (risk of recurrent stroke, 3.1% versus 3.3%; HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.61–1.37]), whereas in a CHANCE subgroup already on aspirin, adding clopidogrel reduced recurrent stroke (12.3%–9.0%; HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.47–0.92]). A prospective registry found higher recurrence with maintaining aspirin (8.0%) compared with switching to another antiplatelet (6.9%) or adding another antiplatelet (6.6%).

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke within 72 hours of symptom onset: a prospective cohort study [^6986f2cd]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and mild stroke account for 65% of ischaemic strokes and they are both prone to early recurrence.The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) recommends dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for patients with acute minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≤3) or high-risk TIA started within 12 or 24 hours of symptom onset.A time-course analysis combining the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (PIONT) and Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) studies suggested an optimal 21-day DAPT duration.The benefits mainly manifest within 10 days, with limited or no reduction in stroke risk thereafter.Prolonging DAPT beyond this acute phase may increase bleeding risk without added benefits.

Previous studies have indicated that starting DAPT within 72 hours of stroke symptom onset might still be beneficial,with real-world studies showing a substantial spillover effect.In Korea, approximately one-third of mild stroke and patients with TIA receive DAPT within 48 hours.The risks and benefits of the ‘indication creep’ phenomenon, whereby the benefits of DAPT are uncertain in non-minor stroke patients, has not been resolved. The definition of mild stroke varies, with CHANCE and POINT using NIHSS ≤3, while thrombolysis and endovascular studies often consider it to mean NIHSS ≤5.The China Stroke Centre Alliance (CSCA) reported comparability of in-hospital outcomes between patients with NIHSS scores ≤5 and ≤3.Despite limited evidence, more than 40% of non-minor stroke patients receive DAPT according to the AHA/ASA study.Additionally, the Acute Stroke or TIA Treated With Ticagrelor and Acetylsalicylic Acid for Prevention of Stroke and Death trial indicated potential benefits of DAPT in patients with ischaemic stroke (NIHSS 4–5) started within 24 hours.

Therefore, we hypothesise that the spillover effect of DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel can extend to patients with NIHSS scores between 0 and 5 and within 72 hours and that a short duration of DAPT may be the most effective and safe treatment. We attempted to validate this hypothesis through a real-world cohort study.

### Clopidogrel versus aspirin for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^74a2d99a]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Aspirin monotherapy is recommended indefinitely for patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this individual patient level meta-analysis was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the comparative efficacy and safety of clopidogrel versus aspirin monotherapy in patients with established CAD, most of whom had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention or had acute coronary syndrome.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase to identify randomised trials published from database inception to April 12, 2025, comparing clopidogrel monotherapy with aspirin monotherapy in patients with established CAD who had discontinued or never started dual antiplatelet therapy. Randomised trials featuring an initial phase of dual antiplatelet therapy were eligible for inclusion in this individual patient data meta-analysis. In the main analysis, we used semi-parametric shared log-normal frailty models (one-stage analysis), including a random intercept to account for differences in the baseline hazard across trials, and a random slope to account for between-trial differences in treatment effects. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events [MACCE]); the primary safety endpoint was major bleeding. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42025645594).

Findings

Seven randomised trials including 28982 patients (14507 assigned to clopidogrel; 14475 assigned to aspirin) with a median follow-up of 2·3 years (IQR 1·1-4·0) were eligible and included. At 5·5 years, MACCE was less common in patients assigned to clopidogrel than in patients assigned to aspirin (929 events [2·61 per 100 patient-years] vs 1062 events [2·99 per 100 patient-years]; hazard ratio 0·86 [95% CI 0·77-0·96]; p=0·0082). Mortality and major bleeding (256 events [0·71 per 100 patient-years] with clopidogrel vs 279 events [0·77 per 100 patient-years] with aspirin; 0·94 [0·74-1·21]; p=0·64) did not differ.

Interpretation

These findings add to the evidence that clopidogrel monotherapy is superior to aspirin monotherapy for MACCE prevention with no increase in the risk of bleeding, and support the preferential use of clopidogrel over aspirin for secondary prevention in patients with established CAD.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^7a125918]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) after high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke—timing and duration—shows that when initiated soon after high-risk TIA or minor stroke and continued for 21 to 90 days, DAPT is more effective than SAPT for reducing recurrent ischemic stroke, and although pooled bleeding with early DAPT was not statistically higher, POINT showed a statistically significant higher risk of major bleeding, so the risk of bleeding should be considered and weighed against the potential benefits when initiated early after onset. When initiated within 1 to 2 months of stroke or TIA and continued for 2 to 3 years, DAPT is not associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke but is associated with more bleeding events and therefore is not recommended in this setting. However, uncertainty surrounding these conclusions must be recognized given that few trials were identified in the systematic review and included in the meta-analyses.

### Outcomes associated with clopidogrel-aspirin use in minor stroke or transient ischemic attack: a pooled analysis of clopidogrel in high-risk patients with acute non-disabling cerebrovascular events (CHANCE) and platelet-oriented inhibition in new TIA and minor ischemic stroke (POINT) trials [^f0937252]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin is effective for secondary prevention after minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Uncertainties remained about the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke or TIA.

Objective

To obtain precise estimates of efficacy and risk of dual antiplatelet therapy after minor ischemic stroke or TIA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This analysis pooled individual patient-level data from 2 large-scale randomized clinical trials that evaluated clopidogrel-aspirin as a treatment to prevent stroke after a minor stroke or high-risk TIA. The Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Non-Disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial enrolled patients at 114 sites in China from October 1, 2009, to July 30, 2012. The Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial enrolled patients at 269 international sites from May 28, 2010, to December 19, 2017. Both were followed up for 90 days. Data analysis occurred from November 2018 to May 2019.

Interventions

In the 2 trials, patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA were randomized to clopidogrel-aspirin or aspirin alone within 12 hours (POINT) or 24 hours (CHANCE) of symptom onset.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was a major ischemic event (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or death from ischemic vascular causes). The primary safety outcome was major hemorrhage.

Results

The study enrolled 5170 patients (CHANCE) and 4881 patients (POINT). Analysis included individual data from 10 051 patients (5016 in the clopidogrel-aspirin treatment group and 5035 in the control group) with a median age of 63.2 (interquartile range, 55.0-72.9) years; 6106 patients (60.8%) were male. Clopidogrel-aspirin treatment reduced the risk of major ischemic events at 90 days compared with aspirin alone (328 of 5016 [6.5%] vs 458 of 5035 [9.1%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.61-0.81]; P<.001), mainly within the first 21 days (263 of 5016 [5.2%] vs 391 of 5035 [7.8%]; HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.56-0.77]; P<.001), but not from day 22 to day 90. No evidence of heterogeneity of treatment outcome across trials or prespecified subgroups was observed. Major hemorrhages were more frequent in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, but the difference was nonsignificant.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this analysis of the POINT and CHANCE trials, the benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy appeared to be confined to the first 21 days after minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA.

Discussion

Our review summarises high quality evidence that in patients with minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack (TIA), clopidogrel and aspirin used within 24 hours of the event reduces the risk of subsequent stroke over a 30 to 90 day period (relative risk reduction 30%, absolute risk reduction 1.9%, table 2) without an apparent impact on all cause mortality (table 2). Although dual antiplatelet therapy may increase the risk of haemorrhagic stroke, recurrent ischaemic stroke is more common (786 v 23 events), resulting in a clear net benefit on recurrent stroke.

Dual antiplatelet therapy likely increases moderate or serious extracranial bleeding, but these events were much less common than recurrent ischaemic stroke (best estimate of increase in bleeding 0.2%) (table 2). The results provide high quality evidence of an increase in minor bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy, but the absolute effect is small (increase of 0.7%) and this outcome is far less important than a recurrent stroke. Results suggest that the impact of dual antiplatelet therapy on TIA, myocardial infarction, or functional status is limited or absent.

Most of the benefit in terms of strokes prevented with dual antiplatelet therapy occurs within the first 10 days after stroke; evidence strongly suggests no important reduction—and likely no reduction at all—after 21 days (fig 3, table 3). However, dual antiplatelet therapy consistently increases the risk of bleeding for the duration that patients receive treatment (fig 3, table 3).

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke within 72 hours of symptom onset: a prospective cohort study [^a9e9b2b9]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Data collection

The data were captured and handled utilising the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system.All researchers underwent training before data collection. We collected comprehensive demographic data, clinical characteristics, imaging results and laboratory findings. The detailed data collection process is described in the protocol.

Patients were classified into two groups based on their initial antiplatelet treatment on hospital arrival: single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), which involved either aspirin or clopidogrel, and DAPT, which consisted of aspirin combined with clopidogrel. Antiplatelet treatment commenced within a few hours of admission and continued for 90 days or less. In the DAPT group, patients received a combination of 75–300 mg of clopidogrel and 100–300 mg of aspirin on the first day, followed by guideline-based antiplatelet treatment for 90 days, and in the SAPT group, patients received a daily dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel or 100 mg of aspirin for 90 days. The treating physicians determined the administration schedule and dose adjustments based on careful consideration and patient preferences. The types and doses of the different therapies are provided in online supplemental table 1. Three trained investigators, blinded to the assigned treatments, independently assessed the occurrence of efficacy outcome events and bleeding events, whichever occurred first.

To determine the duration of medication use, we calculated the difference between the time of first DAPT administration and the time of confirmed DAPT cessation during the follow-up period. Based on predefined follow-up time points, the DAPT group was further divided into three groups: DAPT duration less than 10 days, DAPT duration between 10 and 21 days and DAPT duration greater than 21 days. Each subset was compared with the SAPT group.

Clinical outcomes

The primary outcome was a composite vascular event (including ischaemic stroke recurrence,TIA,symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage,myocardial infarction or angina attacksand vascular death) occurring during the 90 days of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included any vascular event during the 90 days of follow-up, with the definition provided in the Methods section in online supplemental materials. Safety endpoints involved severe bleeding (defined by the Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries)during the follow-up period.

All patients were followed up on days 1, 10, 21 and 90±7 postenrolment. The same neurologist assessed both the baseline and follow-up NIHSS scores. Trained personnel used uniformly structured questionnaires via telephone to complete the follow-up.

Short-duration trials—five randomized trials “tested randomly allocated treatments for 14 to 90 days,” with enrollment timing such that “participants were enrolled within 12 hours to 7 days after stroke/TIA.” The number of trials included in the meta-analyses was smaller because “The number of trials included in the systematic review (n=5) was greater than the number of trials included in the meta-analyses (n=3) because 2 trials did not report outcomes at required time points.” In terms of efficacy signal, “The risk of recurrent ischemic stroke was significantly lower in the DAPT than in the SAPT groups in the 2 larger trials,”

Loading and maintenance doses

The single loading dose of clopidogrel used in the trials varied from 300 mg to 600 mg. We suggest giving a single loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel in patients not already taking the relevant medication, followed by the daily maintenance dose for up to 21 days. The dose of aspirin used in the trials varied from 50 mg to 325 mg and was at the treating physician’s discretion for up to 21 days.

In the THALES study, a 180 mg loading dose of ticagrelor and a single loading dose of 300 or 325 mg of aspirin was used. This was followed by 90 mg twice daily of ticagrelor and 75 to 100 mg of aspirin. We suggest following this dosing regimen.

### Balancing the risks and benefits of long-term antiplatelet therapies for cardiovascular disease: clinical, research, and regulatory implications [^6ce1d113]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Second, balancing the risks and benefits with combinations of antiplatelet therapies for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is an evolving and challenging conundrum. Although treatment regimens with DAPT and those with vorapaxar plus aspirin or vorapaxar plus DAPT have been shown to reduce ischemic events, there has been a consistent increase in major bleeding events with additional and/or intensified antiplatelet agents beyond aspirin as a cornerstone therapy.Major bleeding events are clearly associated with a higher risk of mortality and other ischemic events, but the mechanisms behind this association are complex and likely are related to multiple concurrent factors including patient comorbidities that track with bleeding risk (eg, advanced age, renal insufficiency), adverse consequences of premature discontinuation of antiplatelet agents following a major bleeding event, and residual confounding. – Patients with prior stroke are an especially vulnerable group because they are at a disproportionate increased risk of bleeding, specifically intracranial hemorrhage, if treated with intensified antiplatelet therapy or combinations of antiplatelet agents. –,–, The ACC/AHA non‐ST elevation acute coronary syndrome practice guidelines provide a glimpse into the challenging nature of decision making for individual patients by designating a class IIaC recommendation for shorter durations of DAPT following stent implantation (<12 months) if the perceived risks of morbidity associated with bleeding outweigh the potential benefits of the recommended 12 months of DAPT in this setting.Notwithstanding the complex interplay between ischemic benefits and bleeding risks for multiple different antiplatelet regimens for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, improved risk prediction tools are needed to more precisely estimate patient‐specific long‐term ischemic and bleeding risks and to guide clinical decision making in the future.

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^14ffda18]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This article provides recommendations on the use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Methods

We generated treatment recommendations (Grade 1) and suggestions (Grade 2) based on high (A), moderate (B), and low (C) quality evidence.

Results

In patients with acute ischemic stroke, we recommend IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) if treatment can be initiated within 3 h (Grade 1A) or 4.5 h (Grade 2C) of symptom onset; we suggest intraarterial r-tPA in patients ineligible for IV tPA if treatment can be initiated within 6 h (Grade 2C); we suggest against the use of mechanical thrombectomy (Grade 2C) although carefully selected patients may choose this intervention; and we recommend early aspirin therapy at a dose of 160 to 325 mg (Grade 1A). In patients with acute stroke and restricted mobility, we suggest the use of prophylactic-dose heparin or intermittent pneumatic compression devices (Grade 2B) and suggest against the use of elastic compression stockings (Grade 2B). In patients with a history of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, we recommend long-term treatment with aspirin (75-100 mg once daily), clopidogrel (75 mg once daily), aspirin/extended release dipyridamole (25 mg/200 mg bid), or cilostazol (100 mg bid) over no antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1A), oral anticoagulants (Grade 1B), the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin (Grade 1B), or triflusal (Grade 2B). Of the recommended antiplatelet regimens, we suggest clopidogrel or aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole over aspirin (Grade 2B) or cilostazol (Grade 2C). In patients with a history of stroke or TIA and atrial fibrillation we recommend oral anticoagulation over no antithrombotic therapy, aspirin, and combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B).

Conclusions

These recommendations can help clinicians make evidence-based treatment decisions with their patients who have had strokes.

### Abstract (...) [^2e1d7a22]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Subacute management of ischemic stroke refers to the period from when the decision to not employ thrombolytics is made up until two weeks after the stroke occurred. Family physicians are often involved in the care of patients during the subacute period. Careful subacute treatment of patients in the hospital and later in outpatient settings is critical to preventing unnecessary complications, recurrent stroke, and death. All patients presenting with an ischemic stroke should be admitted to the hospital. 1 The goals of hospital care are listed in Table 2. Thrombolytic therapy can be considered for up to six hours after symptom onset, and physicians with expertise in these therapies should be consulted for management assistance. 2, 3 Patients who have been treated with thrombolytics should be admitted to an intensive care unit skilled in the management of postthrombolytic care. This article focuses on subacute treatment of patients who do not receive thrombolytics.

Monitoring for Neurologic Complications Following an ischemic stroke, patients are at risk of multiple neurologic complications, including cerebral edema, seizures, intracerebral hemorrhage, and evolution of neurologic deficits. Of these complications, cerebral edema is the leading cause of death in these patients. 6 Patients with greater than 70 percent carotid stenosis on the side of the neurologic deficit may have a reduced risk of future stroke if carotid endarterectomy is performed, preferably within two weeks of the ischemic event. 7, 8 Patients with moderate ipsilateral stenosis may benefit from early endarterectomy, depending on patient-specific factors, but the evidence is less clear. Surgical intervention has not been shown to benefit patients with ipsilateral carotid stenosis of less than 50 percent.
9.

Measures should be taken to avoid dehydration and malnutrition because both lead to poor outcomes after a stroke. 12 All patients who are unable to take nutrition or fluids orally should receive adequate intravenous maintenance fluids and enteral feedings via nasogastric or nasoduodenal tubes. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy can be considered if prolonged enteral nutrition is necessary and the patient desires it. LIPID THERAPY The lipid-lowering agent atorvastatin has been evaluated for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke.

### Oral antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndrome: a review [^2bcb10e3]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States with an annual incidence of approximately 1 million. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) reduces cardiovascular event rates after ACS.

Observations

In 2016, the updated guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommended aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 12 months for patients with ACS. Since these recommendations were published, new randomized clinical trials have studied different regimens and durations of antiplatelet therapy. Recommendations vary according to the risk of bleeding. If bleeding risk is low, prolonged DAPT may be considered, although the optimal duration of prolonged DAPT beyond 1 year is not well established. If bleeding risk is high, shorter duration (ie, 3-6 months) of DAPT may be reasonable. A high risk of bleeding traditionally is defined as a 1-year risk of serious bleeding (either fatal or associated with a ≥3-g/dL drop in hemoglobin) of at least 4% or a risk of an intracranial hemorrhage of at least 1%. Patients at higher risk are 65 years old or older; have low body weight (BMI <18.5), diabetes, or prior bleeding; or take oral anticoagulants. The newest P2Y12 inhibitors, prasugrel and ticagrelor, are more potent, with high on-treatment residual platelet reactivity of about 3% vs 30% to 40% with clopidogrel and act within 30 minutes compared with 2 hours for clopidogrel. Clinicians should avoid prescribing prasugrel to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack because of an increased risk of cerebrovascular events (6.5% vs 1.2% with clopidogrel, P=.002) and should avoid prescribing it to patients older than 75 years or who weigh less than 60 kg. The ISAR-REACT-5 trial found that prasugrel reduced rates of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 1 year compared with ticagrelor among patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (9.3% vs 6.9%, P=.006) with no significant difference in bleeding. Recent trials suggested that discontinuing aspirin rather than the P2Y12 inhibitor may be associated with better outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dual antiplatelet therapy reduces rates of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Specific combinations and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy should be based on patient characteristics-risk of bleeding myocardial ischemia.

### Trends in dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel and outcomes in ischemic stroke patients noneligible for POINT / CHANCE trial treatment [^c62c62f9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Long‐term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (DAPT‐AC) is not recommended for long‐term secondary prevention after ischemic stroke because reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke is counterbalanced by an increase in intracranial and major bleeding.However, short‐term DAPT‐AC was shown to confer net benefit with greater reductions in recurrent ischemic stroke than increase in bleeding complications, in the CHANCE (Clopidogrel in High‐Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) trial in 2013 and the POINT (Platelet‐Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) trial in 2018.In addition, DAPT‐AC is only recommended for very specific patients who have had a recent stroke associated with severe symptomatic intracranial stenosis (ie, 70%–99% stenosis) based on the SAMMPRIS (Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis) trial.Current guidelines, therefore, recommend short‐term use of DAPT‐AC, for the first 21 days or 90 days poststroke, for early secondary prevention in patients with acute (initiation within 24 hours of onset) minor (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] scores of 0–3 or 4) ischemic stroke or high‐risk transient ischemic attack.For most ischemic stroke patients not meeting these criteria due to more severe neurologic deficit or later time after onset, aspirin monotherapy, clopidogrel monotherapy, or combination of aspirin and extended‐release dipyridamole have been primarily considered.

However, recent studies have indicated that in routine clinical practice DAPT‐AC is frequently administered to patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria of the CHANCE or POINT clinical trials.In the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)‐Stroke registry, >40% of patients with nonminor stroke received DAPT‐AC despite lack of randomized trial evidence in this setting.However, these studies did not investigate temporal trends in the use of DAPT‐AC in trial‐ineligible patients nor variation in use among specific trial‐ineligible subsets.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the secular trends of DAPT‐AC use in patients with acute ischemic stroke who do not meet the eligibility criteria of recent DAPT‐AC clinical trials might suggest a temporal trend indicative of evolving clinical practices.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^d3d02c03]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend DAPT combining long-term, low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) for at least 12 months in patients with ACS undergoing PCI, irrespective of the stent type (BMS or DES) (class I).The use of potent P2Y 12 receptor antagonists (ticagrelor for patients at moderate-to-high risk of ischaemic events, including patients who were pretreated with clopidogrel, or prasugrel) should be preferred over clopidogrel (patients who cannot receive ticagrelor or prasugrel, or who require long-term OAC therapy).Prasugrel is not recommended for patients in whom coronary anatomy is not known (class III),or with history of stroke or TIA (class III).In patients at high bleeding risk or who develop significant bleeding, premature discontinuation of DAPT after 3or 6months may be reasonable (class IIb). In patients with low bleeding risk who have tolerated DAPT during 12 months without bleeding complications, long-term continuation of DAPT may be considered (class IIb)(figure 2).

Nevertheless, current recommendations on the optimal duration of DAPT in patients with ACS are not based on contemporary randomised evidence.Notably, the median duration of DAPT in the pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor in patients with ACS was 9–12 months with clopidogrel,14.5 months with prasugreland only 9.2 months with ticagrelor.Furthermore, no randomised evidence focused on patients with ACS is currently available comparing shorter versus standard or extended DAPT durations with respect to clinical outcomes in contemporary practice, whereas randomised data from prespecified ACS subgroup analyses of recent trials including patients treated with newer generation DES have consistently shown that shorter durations of DAPT (3–6 months) were non-inferior to 12or 24months with respect to composite endpoints of CV events or CV events plus major bleeding. The optimal duration of DAPT in patients with ACS treated with DES remains therefore still under debate. Large-scale randomised trials (REDUCE (NCT02118870), SMART-DATE (NCT01701453)) are currently investigating the efficacy and safety of a short-term DAPT strategy (3 months and 6 months, respectively) compared with the recommended 12-month DAPT duration in patients with ACS undergoing PCI with newer generation DES and should provide novel insights into this important clinical dilemma during the next years.

### European Stroke Organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^7f0ca811]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Choice of drug regimen

Some people with minor stroke and TIA would have been eligible for the included trials of clopidogrel based DAPT and the trial of ticagrelor based DAPT. Because there are three trials of clopidogrel based DAPT with relevant outcomes and there was no significant increase in intracranial haemorrhage, the level of certainty regarding the available evidence and the strength of the recommendation was rated higher for clopidogrel based DAPT than for ticagrelor based DAPT. However, it should be noted that the sample size of the THALES trial was similar to the combined sample size of the three clopidogrel based trials. In addition, the THALES trial allowed inclusion of people with more severe stroke so the bleeding rate cannot be directly compared across the clopidogrel and ticagrelor trials. DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin should be considered as an alternative to clopidogrel based DAPT, particularly in people known to be intolerant of clopidogrel or in people who have moderate stroke (NIHSS 4 or 5) and no other contraindication.

### European Stroke Organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^6d2eb89a]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Prevention of early recurrent ischaemic stroke remains a priority in people with TIA or ischaemic stroke. A number of trials have recently been completed assessing the efficacy of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy early after minor or moderate stroke or high-risk TIA. We present an Expedited Recommendation for use of dual antiplatelet therapy early after ischaemic stroke and TIA on behalf of the ESO Guideline Board. We make a strong recommendation based on high quality of evidence for use of 21-days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel in people with a non-cardioembolic minor ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24 hours. We make a weak recommendation based on moderate quality evidence for 30-days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor in people with non-cardioembolic mild to moderate ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24 hours.

DAPT group had a significantly lower rate of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke at 90 days than aspirin group (8.2% vs 11.7%, HR 0.68; p<0.001). The absolute risk reduction was 3.5%. There was no significant difference in the rate of haemorrhage between the two groups. The benefit persisted during 1-year follow-up.

### Antiplatelet therapy after endovascular intervention: does combination therapy really work and what is the optimum duration of therapy? [^44c2a4ea]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

The number of patients undergoing peripheral interventions has increased in recent years, highlighting the need for a safe and effective protective antithrombotic therapy. Platelet inhibition following coronary intervention is associated with a significantly reduced risk of graft occlusion, and has been acknowledged to be safe and effective in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Monotherapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel, reduces the rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death in patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease. Limited data from clinical trials investigating combination therapy of aspirin with ticlopidine or clopidogrel in patients undergoing endovascular interventions, have suggested the potential for a reduction in cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, the optimal duration of postintervention antiplatelet therapy remains to be defined.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis [^5373d7a2]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Minor ischaemic strokes or transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) put patients at risk of subsequent cardiovascular events, including devastating major strokes.Clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that patients who experience minor ischaemic strokes or TIAs benefit from antiplatelet therapy.Consequently, current guidelines for the management of acute ischaemic stroke and TIA recommend antiplatelet therapy—typically providing strong recommendations for use of a single agent, most commonly aspirin.One guideline provides a weak recommendation for clopidogrel and aspirin therapy, initiated within 24 hours of a patient presenting with minor stroke or TIA, and continuing for 21 days.

Several trials have tested the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone to prevent recurrent events in patients experiencing non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or TIA in both the acute phaseand the chronic phase.The Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial reported that adding clopidogrel to aspirin starting within 24 hours of a minor stroke or TIA and continuing for 21 days reduced stroke risk without increasing the risk of moderate or severe haemorrhage at three and 12 months.

Despite findings from the CHANCE trial, many guideline recommendations persisted in recommending single rather than dual agent clopidogrel and aspirin for the initial treatment of minor ischaemic stroke or TIA.Rationales provided by guideline authors for not recommending routine dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with minor stroke or TIA included the possibility that the aetiological case-mix of stroke in Chinese patients could differ from populations in other regions (Europe and North America), particularly in the higher frequency of intracranial atherosclerosis, and that secondary prevention strategies in China might differ in important ways from Western settings.Thus, guideline developers commented on the need to await findings from ongoing randomised controlled trials in more diverse populations.

Recently, the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischaemic Stroke (POINT) study,a randomised, blinded, placebo controlled trial, reported on the effectiveness and safety of clopidogrel and aspirin use versus aspirin alone. Although both POINT and CHANCE included patients with minor ischaemic stroke or TIA, the population in POINT was more ethnically and geographically diverse. The 28% reduction in hazard of stroke reported by the POINT authors mandates a new review to inform the optimal management of these patients.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke within 72 hours of symptom onset: a prospective cohort study [^5d07ff3c]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the POINT and CHANCE studies revealed that the earlier DAPT was initiated, the greater the benefit, mild strokes have the highest risk of recurrence within the first 3 weeks of onset.The time-dependent analysis conducted in the CHANCE and POINT studies revealed that the high risk of recurrent stroke in mild stroke patients is most pronounced within the first 3 weeks after stroke onset and then decreases significantly.Furthermore, a duration–benefit analysis revealed that the optimal treatment time for DAPT was 21 days, with a net benefit exceeding the effect of DAPT continued for more than 90 days.This means that a 21-day course of DAPT can reduce the risk of recurrent stroke without increasing the risk of bleeding.This finding is consistent with our findings (online supplemental figure 1). This implies that the spillover effect of DAPT depends on its duration, and short-term DAPT is the optimal approach for benefiting this population.

Further analysis of the effectiveness of secondary preventive treatment further confirmed this result: long-term DAPT did not have a superior effect compared with switching to SAPT after a short course of DAPT. This finding aligns with findings from studies such as the CHANCE and POINT trials, where visual inspection indicated that the benefits of DAPT are limited to the initial 21 days, and potential harm accumulates with ongoing clopidogrel use.

The subgroup analysis showed that patients in the no-RCT population seemed to benefit more from DAPT, which might be because more patients were treated within 24–72 hours. It is possible that our study had an insufficient sample size to clearly distinguish these periods. To find the best time for treatment, in-depth research is essential; at the same time, we also need to explore the optimal duration of DAPT to maximise the balance of risks and benefits.

The Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment TOAST) subgroup analysis revealed that DAPT may benefit patients with large artery atherosclerosis and other aetiologies, which is consistent with the findings of the CHANCE, POINT and INSPIRES studies.Clinical adjustments may be considered based on the results of cerebral vascular examination.The possibility of refining the duration of acute DAPT post hoc is intriguing. The INSPIRES study included patients who were treated within 72 hours of symptom onset and was designed with the idea that the duration of treatment with DAPT should not exceed 21 days.The results of the time effect analysis of this trial are expected in future.

### Acute dual antiplatelet therapy for minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^6ef269d7]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy

Risk of bleeding is the main harm of intensive dual or triple antiplatelet therapy. The CHANCE and POINT trials showed similar efficacy of DAPT with up to ~30% reduction of recurrent stroke (table 2), but the POINT trial also showed a 2.3-fold increase in the risk of major haemorrhage in the DAPT group compared with aspirin alone (P=0.02), whereas the CHANCE trial did not (P=0.73).This discrepancy is not completely understood, but a longer duration of DAPT (90 days in the POINT trial versus 21 days in the CHANCE trial) may be the explanation.A secondary time course analysis of the POINT trial provided further supportive evidence for the recent rapid recommendation.But more systematic studies are needed to determine how to choose the duration of DAPT more precisely—between 10 and 21 days in clinical practice.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^166d4512]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack may reduce recurrent stroke but also increase severe bleeding compared with single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT). The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association convened an evidence review committee to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and risks of DAPT compared with SAPT for secondary ischemic stroke prevention.

Methods

The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on December 5, 2019, to identify phase III or IV randomized controlled trials (n≥100) from December 1999 to December 2019. We calculated unadjusted relative risks (RRs) and performed meta-analyses of studies based on the duration of treatment (short [≤90 days] versus long [>90 days]).

Results

Three short-duration randomized controlled trials were identified that enrolled mostly patients with minor stroke or high risk transient ischemic attack. In these trials, DAPT, compared with SAPT, was associated with a lower 90-day risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55-0.83], I 2 =37.1%). There was no significant increase in major bleeding with DAPT in short-duration trials (pooled RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93-3.83], I 2 =8.9%). In 2 long-duration treatment randomized controlled trials (mean treatment duration, 18-40 months), DAPT was not associated with a significant reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79-1.02], I 2 =1.4%), but was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (pooled RR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.37-4.30], I 2 =75.5%).

Conclusions

DAPT was more effective than SAPT for prevention of secondary ischemic stroke when initiated early after the onset of minor stroke/high-risk transient ischemic attack and treatment duration was <90 days. However, when the treatment duration was longer and initiated later after stroke or transient ischemic attack onset, DAPT was not more effective than SAPT for ischemic stroke prevention and it increased the risk of bleeding.

### Recurrent ischemic stroke: strategies for prevention [^fb25f278]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Recurrent strokes make up almost 25% of the nearly 800,000 strokes that occur annually in the United States. Risk factors for ischemic stroke include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, and obesity. Lifestyle modifications, including tobacco cessation, decreased alcohol use, and increased physical activity, are also important in the management of patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke. The selection of antiplatelet therapy should be based on timing, safety, effectiveness, cost, patient characteristics, and patient preference. Aspirin is recommended as initial treatment to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke. Clopidogrel is recommended as an alternative monotherapy and in patients allergic to aspirin. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is not recommended for long-term use (more than two to three years) because of increased bleeding risk. Aspirin/dipyridamole is at least as effective as aspirin alone, but it is not as well tolerated. Warfarin should not be used for prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^cbf3a086]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Short-duration dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) meta-analysis—across three trials with a 90-day time point—found that compared with single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), DAPT reduced recurrent ischemic stroke by 90 days (pooled RR of 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55–0.83], I2=37.1%), reduced total recurrent stroke (pooled RR of 0.69 [95% CI, 0.56–0.85], I2=41.5%), and reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; pooled RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.64–0.92], I2=45.5%). There was no difference between antiplatelet regimens for intracerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, vascular death, or major bleeding (pooled RR of 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93–3.83], I2=8.9%). Results were similar when excluding one high–risk-of-bias trial, and both retained trials enrolled within 12 to 24 hours of symptom onset.

### Are drug eluting stents worth triple therapy? [^782e22cf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 8% patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention are on anticoagulation, which creates difficult choices regarding stent type and antiplatelet use. 1 Drug eluting stents (DES) are usually preferred over bare metal stents (BMS) because of less restenosis and fewer repeat revascularization procedures. However, DES require a longer duration of dual antiplatelet therapy to minimize the chance of stent thrombosis. Typically, this is 6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy for DES compared with 1 month for BMS in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. 2 In a patient already on anticoagulation, adding dual antiplatelet therapy (now triple therapy) poses a significant risk of bleeding: a 2‐ to 3‐fold increase per recent studies. 2 The need for triple therapy can be reduced by using a BMS, but is the decreased risk of bleeding worth the increased restenosis risk?

Ideally, we would know the benefits and risks of double versus triple therapy, different durations of each strategy, DES versus BMS, and the various permutations. Current European guidelines recommend only 1 month of triple therapy following a DES in those at high risk for bleeding, whereas North American guidelines suggest that triple therapy can be stopped after 3 months; with a switch to dual therapy, this is only a IIb recommendation. 2 However, this is only a IIb recommendation indicating it “may be considered” instead of using the usual 6 months of DAPT. These recommendations are supported, in part, by the ISAR‐TRIPLE (Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen‐Testing of a 6‐Week Versus a 6‐Month Clopidogrel Treatment Regimen in Patients with Concomitant Aspirin and Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Following Drug‐Eluting Stenting) study, which compared 6 weeks to 6 months of clopidogrel on top of warfarin and aspirin for those undergoing DES implantation. 3 Among 614 patients, the primary end point of death, myocardial infarction (MI), stent, thrombosis, stroke, or major bleeding at 9 months was slightly, but not significantly, higher in those treated with the shorter 6‐weeks of clopidogrel (9.8% versus 8.8%, P =0.63). 3 The secondary end point of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction major bleeding was also slightly, but not significantly, higher in the shorter triple therapy duration arm (5.3% versus 4.0%; P =0.44). Although seemingly small, an absolute 1% difference in death would be important to exclude, arguing for confirmatory studies. The benefits and harms of 1 month of triple therapy as recommended by the European guidelines versus 3 months as suggested by the North American guidelines are even less clear.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^6e482cc0]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

AHA/ASA systematic review—dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) for secondary ischemic stroke prevention found in short-duration treatment (≤90 days) among trials enrolling mostly patients with minor stroke or high risk transient ischemic attack that DAPT, compared with SAPT, was associated with a lower 90-day risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55–0.83], I2=37.0%) without a significant increase in major bleeding (pooled RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93–3.83], I2=8.9%). In long-duration trials (>90 days; mean treatment duration, 18–40 months), DAPT was not associated with a significant reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79–1.02], I2=1.4%) but was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (pooled RR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.37–4.30], I2=75.5%). The authors conclude that DAPT was more effective than SAPT when initiated early after the onset of minor stroke/high-risk transient ischemic attack with treatment duration <90 days, whereas when treatment was initiated later and lasted longer DAPT was not more effective than SAPT and increased the risk of bleeding.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate early dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel), ideally within 12-24 hours of symptom onset and at least within 7 days of onset and continued for 21-90 days, followed by single antiplatelet therapy, to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with a recent minor (NIHSS score ≤ 3) non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA (ABCD² score ≥ 4).

### Stroke: a new CHANCE for combination antiplatelet therapy? [^adbe1433]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor ischaemic stroke have a high risk of early recurrence. A new study in Chinese patients suggests that this risk is reduced following treatment with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone. However, whether the findings can be extrapolated to other populations remains unclear.

### P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy or dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary revascularisation: individual patient level meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^f29d3050]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis to answer the following PICOS question: in patients who have undergone percutaneous or surgical revascularisation for stable or unstable coronary artery disease, is P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy at least similarly effective for a composite of fatal and cardiovascular ischaemic endpoints and, if so, safer for bleeding endpoints, compared with DAPT among randomised trials that reported centrally adjudicated outcome data?

We excluded trials including patients with a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation under the rationale that concomitant oral anticoagulation further increases the risk of bleeding and mitigates the risk of ischaemic recurrences after aspirin withdrawal, and long term DAPT is no longer considered a valid standard of care in this setting.We implemented no further restrictions for study selection, such as the number of participants or duration of follow-up. Methods and reporting follow the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD).The study protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (international prospective register of systematic reviews) and is available online (, CRD42020176853).

Search strategy

Two investigators (MV, FG) determined trial eligibility criteria; a third investigator (RM) was involved in case of disagreement. Randomised trials were identified by a search in Ovid Medline, Embase, and three websites. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand searched. We imposed no language restrictions. The search strategy is provided in the appendix.

Outcome measures

The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke throughout the duration of the randomised comparison of protocol mandated P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy versus DAPT. The key safety endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3 or type 5 bleeding.Other secondary endpoints are shown in the appendix. The outcome definitions were largely consistent among the included trials (supplementary methods).

### Monotherapy with a P2Yinhibitor or aspirin for secondary prevention in patients with established atherosclerosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^183f8271]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet therapy is recommended among patients with established atherosclerosis. We compared monotherapy with a P2Y 12 inhibitor versus aspirin for secondary prevention.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, all randomised trials comparing P2Y 12 inhibitor with aspirin monotherapy for secondary prevention in patients with cerebrovascular, coronary, or peripheral artery disease were evaluated for inclusion. On Dec 18, 2019, we searched PubMed, Embase, BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Additionally, we reviewed references from identified articles and searched abstracts from 2017 to 2019 presented at relevant scientific meetings. Data about year of publication, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, baseline patients' features including the baseline condition determining study inclusion (ie, cerebrovascular, coronary, or peripheral artery disease), P2Y 12 inhibitor type and dosage, aspirin dosage, endpoint definitions, effect estimates, follow-up duration, and percentage of patients lost to follow-up were collected. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were used as metric of choice for treatment effects with random-effects models. Co-primary endpoints were myocardial infarction and stroke. Key secondary endpoints were all-cause death and vascular death. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I 2 index. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018115037).

Findings

A total of nine randomised trials were identified and included in this study, and 42108 patients randomly allocated to a P2Y 12 inhibitor (n=21043) or aspirin (n=21065) were included in our analyses. Patients who received a P2Y 12 inhibitor had a borderline reduction for the risk of myocardial infarction compared with those who received aspirin (OR 0·81 [95% CI 0·66-0·99]; I 2 =10·9%). Risks of stroke (OR 0·93 [0·82-1·06]; I 2 =34·5%), all-cause death (OR 0·98 [0·89-1·08]; I 2 =0%), and vascular death (OR 0·97 [0·86-1·09]; I 2 =0%) did not differ between patients who received a P2Y 12 inhibitor and those who received aspirin. Similarly, the risk of major bleeding (OR 0·90 [0·74-1·10]; I 2 =3·9%) did not differ between patients who received a P2Y 12 inhibitor and those who received aspirin. The number needed to treat to prevent one myocardial infarction with P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy was 244 patients. Findings were consistent regardless of the type of P2Y 12 inhibitor used.

Interpretation

Compared with aspirin monotherapy, P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy is associated with a risk reduction for myocardial infarction and a comparable risk of stroke in the setting of secondary prevention. The benefit of P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy is of debatable clinical relevance, in view of the high number needed to treat to prevent a myocardial infarction and the absence of any effect on all-cause and vascular mortality.

### Contemporary antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a narrative review of current literature and guidelines [^a2151568]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

To determine if the results transcend to a broader population, POINT (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischaemic Stroke) trial was conducted in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.It showed a significant risk reduction in recurrent ischaemic events (5.0% vs 6.5%, p=0.02 but increased rate of bleeding (0.9% vs 0.4%, p=0.02) with DAPT. Of note, there were some differences in the study design between POINT and CHANCE. The POINT trial included a higher loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg) and longer DAPT duration (90 days). These differences may explain the increased risk of bleeding in the POINT trial.

The (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated with Ticagrelor and ASA for Prevention of Stroke and Death) trial randomised patients with a mild-to-moderate acute noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke (NIHSS score ≤5) or TIA within 24 hours of symptom onset to either ticagrelor plus aspirin or placebo plus aspirin for 30 days.There were significant lower rates of stroke or death (5.5% vs 6.6%, HR, 0.83; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96; p=0.02) and ischaemic stroke (5.0% vs 6.3%, HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.93; p=0.004), but higher rate of severe bleeding (0.5% vs 0.1%, p=0.001) in the DAPT group. Exploratory analysis showed that ticagrelor plus aspirin was associated with lower rate of disabling stroke or death than aspirin alone (4.0% vs 4.7%, p=0.001).For every 1000 patients, DAPT would prevent 11 strokes or deaths at the cost of four severe haemorrhages. The number needed to treat to benefit one patient is 143. In subgroup analysis of patients with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis, ticagrelor plus aspirin was associated with lower rate of stroke or death than aspirin alone (8.1% vs 10.9%, p=0.023), resulting in a number needed to treat of 34 (95% CI 19 to 171).

### Time course for benefit and risk of ticagrelor and aspirin in acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^ac04d649]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this post hoc exploratory analysis of the THALES trial, we found that ticagrelor-aspirin treatment in patients with mild to moderate acute ischemic stroke or TIA reduced the risk of major ischemic events predominately in the first week, an effect that persisted throughout the 30-day period, with a low and constant increase of major hemorrhage from the first week to the following weeks. The net clinical impact favored ticagrelor-aspirin treatment in the first week, an effect that persisted during the entire 30-day treatment period. This finding supports treating for the full 30-day course of DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin as originally tested in the trial, which is consistent with the recent guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Associationand a European Stroke Organization expedited recommendation.

Besides a reduction in the risk of recurrent ischemic events, antiplatelet drugs are associated with a small but relevant increased risk of serious bleeding.Increased risk of bleeding is the major concern when prolonged intensive antiplatelet therapy is administrated in clinical practice.A shortened duration of DAPT may reduce the risk of bleeding.Recent meta-analyses indicated that short-term (within 1 month) DAPT may decrease the risk of recurrent stroke without increasing the risk of hemorrhage compared to monotherapy in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA. In the prespecified secondary analysis of the POINT trial, DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin was more beneficial for 7-day and 30-day treatment courses compared to the full 90-day treatment period evaluated in the trial.The secondary analysis of the POINT trialand the pooled analysis of the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Non-Disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) and POINT trialsdemonstrated that the benefit of DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin was confined to the first 21 days after minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA and that prolonged DAPT may increase hemorrhagic risk without additional ischemic benefit.

### Ischemic and bleeding risk after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with prior ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke [^9541001d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with prior stroke constitute 8% to 12% of the population undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). 1, 2 Patients with prior stroke are generally regarded as having high bleeding risk, in whom consideration might be needed to shorted the duration of a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after PCI. In patients with acute (<12–24 hours) ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), 3 previous studies, CHANCE (the Clopidogrel in High‐Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events), SOCRATES (the Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated with Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes), and POINT (the Platelet‐Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke) suggested that short‐term (≈90 days) DAPT or ticagrelor monotherapy as compared with aspirin monotherapy significantly reduced ischemic stroke without increase in hemorrhagic stroke. 3, 4, 5 However, in patients with recent (≈90–180 days) ischemic stroke or TIA, 3 other previous studies, MATCH (the Management of Atherothrombosis with Clopidogrel in High‐Risk Patients), PRoFESS (the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes), and SPS3 (the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes) demonstrated that long‐term (1.5–3 years) DAPT as compared with clopidogrel or aspirin monotherapy increased major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) without reduction in ischemic stroke. 6, 7, 8 Therefore, in the 2018 American Stroke Association/American Heart Association guidelines, DAPT initiated within 24 hours is recommended for early secondary prevention during the initial 90 days, but is not recommended for routine long‐term secondary prevention after a minor stroke or TIA. 9 DAPT is also not recommended for routine long‐term secondary prevention after major stroke. 10

Trials of potent DAPT after acute coronary syndrome have excluded patients with prior hemorrhagic stroke, but not prior ischemic stroke/TIA. The risk for ICH was higher in patients with prior stroke than those without when treated with more potent P2Y12 inhibitors such as prasugrel, ticagrelor, or vorapaxar, while it was discordant when treated with clopidogrel. 11, 12, 13 The current PCI guidelines do not provide recommendations on DAPT duration specific for patients with prior ischemic stroke. 14, 15 Furthermore, there is a paucity of data about DAPT in patients with prior hemorrhagic stroke. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the impact of prior stroke, stratified by hemorrhagic or ischemic subtypes, on ischemic and bleeding events after PCI in a large Japanese database.

### Analysis of prescriptions for dual antiplatelet therapy after acute ischemic stroke [^c789b4ad]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel is not recommended for routine secondary prevention after ischemic stroke. However, from 2013 to 2018, evidence has increasingly supported the use of short-term (21-90 days) DAPT in patients with minor ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score ≤3) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). Based on findings from the CHANCE (Clopidogrel in High Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events)and POINT (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke)clinical trials, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) issued a new class 1 (strong recommendation), level of evidence A (high-quality evidence from >1 randomized clinical trial [RCT], meta-analyses of high-quality RCTs, or ≥1 RCT corroborated by high-quality registry studies), recommendation for short-term use of DAPT for 21 days in patients presenting with minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke (NIHSS score ≤3) or high-risk TIA in 2019,which was updated to use of DAPT for 21 to 90 days in 2021.

Although DAPT is recommended only for specific patients with minor ischemic stroke and high-risk TIA, a recent studyfound substantial underuse of evidence-based DAPT in patients with minor ischemic stroke and potential overuse of DAPT in patients with nonminor ischemic stroke in US practice. Some variation in DAPT use may be expected based on an individual’s risk profile or preferences; however, the extent to which meaningful variations remain after accounting for patient characteristics is unknown. This information is important to develop a true understanding of the extent to which practice patterns are inconsistent with evidence-based guidelines. Therefore, we analyzed data from the AHA/ASA Get With The Guidelines–Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) registry to (1) quantify the proportion of patients with minor and nonminor acute ischemic stroke who received discharge DAPT prescriptions after the release of new AHA/ASA guideline recommendations between October 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020; (2) identify patient and hospital factors associated with DAPT use; (3) quantify the hospital-level variation in DAPT use after accounting for patient characteristics; and (4) evaluate the correlation between hospital-level DAPT use in patients with minor stroke vs nonminor stroke.

Regarding medical management for transient ischemic attack, more specifically with respect to antithrombotic therapy, intracranial atherosclerotic disease, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating clopidogrel 75 mg/day, in addition to aspirin, for up to 90 days to further reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with a recent (within 30 days) TIA attributable to severe stenosis (70-99%) of a major intracranial artery.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for preventing cardiovascular events [^f663ea3d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Aspirin is the prophylactic antiplatelet drug of choice for people with cardiovascular disease. Adding a second antiplatelet drug to aspirin may produce additional benefit for people at high risk and people with established cardiovascular disease. This is an update to a previously published review from 2011.

Objectives

To review the benefit and harm of adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy for preventing cardiovascular events in people who have coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or were at high risk of atherothrombotic disease, but did not have a coronary stent.

Search Methods

We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 6), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 4 July 2017) and Embase (Ovid, 1947 to 3 July 2017) on 4 July 2017. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP portal, and handsearched reference lists. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials comparing over 30 days use of aspirin plus clopidogrel with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone in people with coronary disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, or at high risk of atherothrombotic disease. We excluded studies including only people with coronary drug-eluting stent (DES) or non-DES, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data on mortality from cardiovascular causes, all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke, major and minor bleeding. The overall treatment effect was estimated by the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), using a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel); we used a random-effects model in cases of moderate or severe heterogeneity (I 2 ≥ 30%). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used GRADE profiler (GRADE Pro) to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

The search identified 13 studies in addition to the two studies in the previous version of our systematic review. Overall, we included data from 15 trials with 33,970 people. We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The risk of bias was low in four trials because they were at low risk of bias for all key domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data), even if some of them were funded by the pharmaceutical industry.Analysis showed no difference in the effectiveness of aspirin plus clopidogrel in preventing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10; participants = 31,903; studies = 7; moderate quality evidence), and no evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; participants = 32,908; studies = 9; low quality evidence).There was a lower risk of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90; participants = 16,175; studies = 6; moderate quality evidence). There was a reduction in the risk of fatal and non-fatal ischaemic stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.91; participants = 4006; studies = 5; moderate quality evidence).However, there was a higher risk of major bleeding with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin plus placebo or aspirin alone (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.64; participants = 33,300; studies = 10; moderate quality evidence) and of minor bleeding (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.36; participants = 14,731; studies = 8; moderate quality evidence).Overall, we would expect 13 myocardial infarctions and 23 ischaemic strokes be prevented for every 1000 patients treated with the combination in a median follow-up period of 12 months, but 9 major bleeds and 33 minor bleeds would be caused during a median follow-up period of 10.5 and 6 months, respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence demonstrates that the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease and people with established cardiovascular disease without a coronary stent is associated with a reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke, and an increased risk of major and minor bleeding compared with aspirin alone. According to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence was moderate for all outcomes except all-cause mortality (low quality evidence) and adverse events (very low quality evidence).

Antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention—short-duration dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) vs single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with early initiation: In 3 trials with early initiation (<1 week) and short-term treatment duration (<90 days), DAPT was superior to SAPT for prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke, any recurrent stroke, and MACE in people with minor stroke or high-risk TIA who were at low risk of bleeding; however, a meta-analysis of 2 trials found a pooled increase in risk of 88% for major bleeding with DAPT compared to SAPT, with a wide confidence interval from a reduction of 7% to an increase of 283%. Trial-specific bleeding results included increased major bleeding with DAPT in POINT (RR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.10–4.86]) whereas CHANCE did not (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.25–4.00]); CHANCE classified very few bleeding events as severe, 4 in each arm, despite 20 ICH in the DAPT and 16 ICH in the SAPT groups. Thus, use of DAPT in the early setting after high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke should take into consideration the potential for an increased risk of bleeding.

### Dual antiplatelet treatment up to 72 hours after ischemic stroke [^7fe450c8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study INSPIRES (antiplatelet therapy) was published by Ying Gao and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the INSPIRES (antiplatelet therapy) study, the trial question was: what is the role of dual antiplatelet treatment initiated within 72 hours after stroke onset? In the INSPIRES (antiplatelet therapy) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the INSPIRES (antiplatelet therapy) study, the population was: 6100 patients (2185 female, 3915 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with mild ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA of presumed atherosclerotic cause who had not undergone thrombolysis or thrombectomy. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of thrombolysis or endovascular therapy; receipt of an additional anticoagulant, defibrinogenation, or antiplatelet therapy except for clopidogrel and aspirin after the index event; presumed cardioembolic TIA or ischemic stroke. In the INSPIRES (antiplatelet therapy) study, the interventions were: n=3050 clopidogrel-aspirin (clopidogrel at a loading dose of 300 mg on the first day, followed by 75 mg daily on days 2 to 90 plus aspirin at a dose of 100-300 mg on day 1, then 100 mg daily for days 2 to 21) n=3050 aspirin (matching clopidogrel placebo for 90 days plus aspirin at a dose of 100-300 mg on day 1, then 100 mg daily for days 2 to 90). In the INSPIRES (antiplatelet therapy) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of new stroke within 90 days (7.3% vs. 9.2%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94). In the INSPIRES (antiplatelet therapy) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in cardiovascular event (7.5% vs. 9.3%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.96) Significant decrease in ischemic stroke (6.8% vs. 9%; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.9) Significant decrease in TIA (0.7% vs. 1.3%; HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.91). In the INSPIRES (antiplatelet therapy) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in bleeding, hepatotoxic effects, muscle toxic effects, death from any cause. significant difference in moderate-to-severe bleeding (0.9% vs. 0.4%). In the INSPIRES (antiplatelet therapy) study, the conclusion was: in patients with mild ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA of presumed atherosclerotic cause who had not undergone thrombolysis or thrombectomy, clopidogrel-aspirin was superior to aspirin with respect to the rate of new stroke within 90 days.
