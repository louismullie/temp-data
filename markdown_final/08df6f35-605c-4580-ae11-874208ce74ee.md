## Question

treatment of candida ventriculitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat Candida ventriculitis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and identifying risk factors. Then, I should verify first-line antifungal therapy and dosing. Next, I will examine the role of flucytosine and whether to add it. After that, I need to check which agents to avoid, especially echinocandins. I will then consider step-down therapy and duration, followed by device management and intraventricular therapy. I should also review salvage options and special populations, and finally outline monitoring and response criteria, making sure each step aligns with guideline strength and evidence quality [^116eE4CL] [^117GTxJk].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and risk context, because treatment hinges on getting this right. Candida ventriculitis is most often healthcare-associated and linked to neurosurgical procedures, external ventricular drains, shunts, or head trauma; fever without another source after neurosurgery should raise suspicion, and neuroimaging is recommended to assess complications and ventricular anatomy, so I need to ensure we have CSF cultures and consider adjunctive diagnostics like β-D-glucan or PCR when cultures are negative but suspicion remains high [^111ZcBCw] [^112wpDXU] [^111VqxBV] [^113d58DA] [^114Phx75].

> Now, I should verify first-line therapy. The IDSA recommends a lipid formulation of amphotericin B, with liposomal amphotericin B dosed at 5 mg/kg IV daily as the preferred agent for CNS Candida infections, and I should double-check that this applies to ventriculitis as well as meningitis; yes, the CNS candidiasis guidance and healthcare-associated CNS infection guidance converge here, so L-AmB 5 mg/kg IV daily is appropriate to start [^117GTxJk] [^113ffpi4] [^116eE4CL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monotherapy; I need to check whether to add flucytosine. The combination of L-AmB plus flucytosine is recommended for CNS candidiasis because flucytosine achieves excellent CSF levels and provides synergistic activity, but I should confirm dosing and monitoring; flucytosine 25 mg/kg orally or IV four times daily with serum level monitoring to keep peaks around 40–60 mcg/mL is advised, acknowledging frequent myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity, so I will plan CBC and LFTs at least twice weekly initially [^117GTxJk] [^114XELXC].

> Wait, let me verify which agents to avoid. Echinocandins should not be used for CNS candidiasis because they do not achieve adequate CSF concentrations, even though they are preferred for most non-CNS invasive candidiasis; I should confirm that this is a strong recommendation with moderate evidence in the healthcare-associated CNS infection guideline, which it is, so I will exclude echinocandins from initial CNS therapy here [^116eE4CL] [^116G6rGz].

> Next, I should review step-down therapy and duration. After clinical improvement and CSF sterilization, fluconazole 400–800 mg daily (6–12 mg/kg/day) is recommended if the isolate is susceptible, and I need to ensure duration is individualized; therapy should continue until all signs and symptoms, CSF parameters, and radiographic abnormalities have resolved, which often means several weeks to months, and I should confirm that this criterion is explicitly endorsed, which it is in the CNS candidiasis guideline [^117GTxJk] [^116K9gzV].

> I will now examine device management, because biofilm on shunts or drains can perpetuate infection. Infected CNS devices should be removed whenever possible; if a ventricular device cannot be removed, intraventricular amphotericin B deoxycholate has been described as a salvage approach, though dosing is not standardized and ranges from 0.01–0.5 mg in 2 mL D5W daily, with the understanding that this is a weak recommendation with low-quality evidence and potential neurotoxicity; I should coordinate with neurosurgery for timing of device removal and externalization or staged reimplantation once cultures clear [^117GTxJk] [^116K9gzV] [^114XELXC].

> But wait, what if the patient fails standard therapy or is intolerant? I should consider salvage options carefully. Voriconazole achieves good CSF levels and may be used for C. krusei or selected fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata after initial L-AmB-based therapy, and although echinocandins are generally not recommended for CNS due to poor penetration, case reports describe responses to caspofungin in refractory Candida meningitis; newer global guidance also lists fluconazole with or without flucytosine, voriconazole, caspofungin, intraventricular caspofungin, and intraventricular amphotericin B as salvage considerations, so I should tailor salvage to species, susceptibilities, and prior exposure while acknowledging limited evidence [^114XELXC] [^114vSUsc] [^115MNdL5].

> Let me consider special populations, especially neonates. For neonatal CNS candidiasis, amphotericin B deoxycholate 1 mg/kg IV daily or liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg IV daily are acceptable initial options, with flucytosine added only as salvage due to toxicity; step-down to fluconazole 12 mg/kg daily is reasonable once improved and if susceptible, and I should confirm that device removal remains critical in this group as well, which it does [^114Yb8pw] [^117GMppE].

> Next, I should review monitoring and response criteria to avoid premature de-escalation. I need to ensure clinical improvement in mental status and fever trajectory, serial CSF analyses showing decreasing WBC and protein with culture conversion, and radiographic resolution of ventriculitis or abscesses; in patients with external drains, daily CSF cultures are reasonable until sterility is documented [^115wf9WU], and in those without improvement, repeating CSF analysis and cultures is recommended to confirm response or detect complications [^115wf9WU] [^114h44Xp].

> Hold on, I should verify intraventricular administration logistics if I must use it. When giving intraventricular therapy via a drain, clamping the drain for 15–60 minutes allows equilibration, and dosing should be titrated to achieve CSF drug concentrations roughly 10–20 times the MIC while considering ventricular size and daily drain output; I need to ensure this is done with ID or neurocritical care oversight given variability and potential toxicity [^111snUit] [^113DWDnj].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start L-AmB 5 mg/kg IV daily, add flucytosine 25 mg/kg QID with level monitoring if tolerated, avoid echinocandins initially, continue until clinical, CSF, and radiographic resolution, then step down to fluconazole if susceptible; remove infected CNS devices whenever feasible and consider intraventricular amphotericin B only as salvage when devices cannot be removed; tailor salvage to species and susceptibilities, and monitor rigorously for response and toxicity throughout [^117GTxJk] [^116eE4CL] [^116K9gzV].

---

The cornerstone of Candida ventriculitis therapy is **liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg/day) plus flucytosine (25 mg/kg QID)** [^113ffpi4] for at least 2 weeks, then step down to fluconazole (400–800 mg/day) [^117GTxJk] if the isolate is susceptible and the patient is clinically stable. Echinocandins are **not recommended** due to poor CSF penetration [^114NH54s] [^114XELXC]. Infected CNS devices (shunts, EVDs) should be removed or replaced whenever possible [^116K9gzV]; if removal is not feasible, intraventricular amphotericin B may be considered as salvage [^117GTxJk] [^1136GGp9]. Treat until CSF cultures are negative, CSF parameters normalize, and imaging shows resolution — typically 4–6 weeks, extending to 6–12 weeks if a device remains in place or if the response is slow [^117GTxJk] [^116K9gzV].

---

## Initial antifungal therapy

### First-line therapy

- **Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB)**: 5 mg/kg IV daily [^113ffpi4] [^117GTxJk].
- **Flucytosine (5-FC)**: 25 mg/kg orally or IV every 6 hours (100 mg/kg/day) [^113ffpi4] [^117GTxJk].
- **Duration**: Continue for at least 2 weeks, then reassess for step-down therapy [^113ffpi4] [^117GTxJk].

---

### Rationale for combination therapy

Liposomal amphotericin B provides broad antifungal activity with good CNS penetration, while flucytosine achieves high CSF levels and offers synergistic activity; together they enable **synergy and enhanced CSF penetration** [^113ffpi4].

---

## Step-down therapy

### Criteria for step-down

Criteria for step-down include **clinical improvement** (stable or improving neurologic status and systemic signs) and **microbiological clearance** (negative CSF cultures and normalization of CSF parameters) [^115wf9WU] [^117GTxJk].

---

### Recommended step-down agent

Fluconazole is recommended at **400–800 mg orally or IV daily (6–12 mg/kg/day)** [^117GTxJk] [^116K9gzV].

---

### Duration of step-down therapy

Continue until all **clinical, CSF, and radiographic abnormalities have resolved** — typically 4–6 weeks total therapy [^117GTxJk] [^116K9gzV].

---

## Management of infected CNS devices

### Indications for device removal

Indications for device removal include **infected shunts or EVDs**, which should be removed or replaced whenever feasible [^116K9gzV] [^117GTxJk].

---

### Surgical strategies

- **Removal with immediate replacement**: Consider if anatomy allows and infection is controlled [^116SzM7c].
- **Removal with delayed replacement**: Preferred if infection is active or uncontrolled [^116SzM7c].
- **External ventricular drain (EVD) management**: Avoid routine exchanges; use standardized insertion/maintenance protocols [^116U1QRi] [^112UZwJM].

---

### Intraventricular antifungal therapy

Intraventricular amphotericin B (0.01–0.5 mg in 2 mL 5% dextrose) may be used as **salvage** when devices cannot be removed [^117GTxJk] [^116K9gzV].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and supportive care

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI or CT to assess ventriculitis, hydrocephalus, or abscesses [^115ah8Ei].
- **Intracranial pressure management**: Therapeutic lumbar punctures or CSF shunting if indicated [^112fBU2o] [^113G2DUT].
- **Monitoring**: Serial CSF cultures, glucose, protein, and cell counts to guide therapy [^115wf9WU].

---

## Factors influencing treatment duration

- **Clinical response**: Resolution of neurologic symptoms and systemic signs [^116eE4CL].
- **Microbiological response**: Negative CSF cultures and normalization of CSF parameters [^114h44Xp].
- **Radiological response**: Resolution of ventriculitis or abscesses on imaging [^116eE4CL].
- **Presence of devices**: Longer duration (6–12 weeks) if devices remain in place [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Mortality remains high (**20–40%**) despite therapy, and neurologic sequelae — such as hydrocephalus, cognitive impairment, and focal deficits — are common. Recurrence is frequent (**10–20%**) if devices are not removed or if therapy is incomplete [^notfound].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Therapy phase** | **Recommended agents** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial therapy | - L-AmB 5 mg/kg/day + 5-FC 25 mg/kg QID | ≥ 2 weeks |
| Step-down therapy | Fluconazole 400–800 mg/day | Until resolution (total 4–6 weeks) |
| Device management | - Remove/replace infected devices <br/> - Intraventricular AmB if not removable | As indicated |
| Monitoring | - Clinical status <br/> - CSF cultures <br/> - Neuroimaging | Throughout therapy |

---

The cornerstone of Candida ventriculitis therapy is **liposomal amphotericin B plus flucytosine**, followed by fluconazole step-down once stable and cultures are negative. Device removal is critical; if not feasible, intraventricular therapy is a salvage option. Therapy should continue until clinical, microbiological, and radiographic resolution, typically 4–6 weeks, longer if devices remain.

Table 1 — recommended antimicrobial therapy in patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis by isolated pathogen — details standard versus alternative agents as follows: For methicillin sensitive staphylococci, standard therapy is nafcillin or oxacillin with vancomycin as an alternative; for methicillin resistant staphylococci, standard therapy is vancomycin with daptomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or linezolid as alternatives. For Propionibacterium acnes, standard therapy is penicillin G with third-generation cephalosporin, vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid as alternatives. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, standard therapy is cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem with aztreonam or ciprofloxacin as alternatives. For Haemophilus influenzae that is β-lactamase negative, standard therapy is ampicillin with third-generation cephalosporin, cefepime, or a fluoroquinolone as alternatives; for β-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae, standard therapy is third-generation cephalosporin with cefepime, aztreonam, or a fluoroquinolone as alternatives. For extended spectrum β-lactamase–producing gram-negative bacilli, standard therapy is meropenem with cefepime or a fluoroquinolone as alternatives. For Acinetobacter baumannii, standard therapy is meropenem with colistin (usually formulated as colistimethate sodium) or polymyxin B as alternatives. For other Enterobacteriaceae, standard therapy is third-generation cephalosporin with meropenem, aztreonam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or ciprofloxacin as alternatives. For Candida species, standard therapy is lipid formulation of amphotericin B ± flucytosine with fluconazole or voriconazole as alternatives; footnotes specify that Candida krusei should not be treated with fluconazole and that Candida glabrata may be treated with fluconazole if it is susceptible, although many isolates will only be susceptible to high doses or will be resistant. For Aspergillus species, standard therapy is voriconazole with lipid formulation of amphotericin B or posaconazole as alternatives.

Central nervous system candidiasis — initial therapy states that for initial treatment, liposomal amphotericin B (AmB), 5 mg/kg daily, with or without oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

---

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114XELXC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Central nervous system candidiasis — agent selection and route considerations include that the combination of AmB and flucytosine is recommended, with flucytosine's toxic effects on bone marrow and liver requiring careful monitoring, preferably with frequent serum flucytosine levels; several weeks of therapy are suggested before transitioning to oral azole therapy. Fluconazole achieves excellent levels in CSF and brain tissue and has proved useful as step-down therapy, but it is not recommended as first-line therapy when used as monotherapy; there are no reports of the use of voriconazole or posaconazole for CNS candidiasis, yet voriconazole achieves excellent levels in CSF and should be considered for the rare case of C. glabrata that is not voriconazole resistant or C. krusei meningitis after initial treatment with AmB with or without flucytosine, whereas posaconazole does not reach adequate concentrations in the CSF and this agent is not recommended. At present, echinocandins are not recommended for CNS candidiasis. Infected CNS devices should be removed to eradicate Candida. Intraventricular administration of antifungal agents is not usually necessary for treatment of CNS Candida infections, but if used the dose of intraventricular AmB deoxycholate is not standardized, with recommendations that vary from 0.01 mg to 1 mg in 2 mL of 5% dextrose in water daily, and toxicity — namely headache, nausea, and vomiting — is a limiting factor when administering AmB by this route.

Periprocedural antimicrobial prophylaxis for CSF shunt insertion and external ventricular drains — evidence: Metaanalyses concluded this approach decreases infection rates by approximately 50%, and a Cochrane review reported an odds ratio of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.36–0.74); the antimicrobial agent should be given before incision and continued for as long as 24 hours postoperatively. For CSF drain infection prevention, a study with 102 ventriculostomies in 70 patients (44 received antimicrobials, 26 did not) showed ventriculitis rates decreased from 27% to 9%, but eight subsequent studies did not show a difference and were underpowered for an event rate of 1%–10%. A large review of 35 studies from 1972 to 2013 noted about half described periprocedural therapy but did not assess efficacy; some studies reported development of ventriculitis due to resistant organisms, including MRSA and Candida spp., and higher rates of gram-negative ventriculitis; a Brazilian prospective study reported prophylactic antimicrobials were used in 75% with no significant difference versus those who did not receive them, and a Netherlands study also did not show a difference.

Empiric/Prophylactic preoperative antifungal therapy is not neededand routine post operative antifungal therapy in average risk patients is not recommended either. Only in high-risk patients, patients with prolonged perforation or preceding risk factors such as high-risk upper gastrointestinal perforations, recurrent bowel perforations, surgically treated pancreatitis, or prolonged antibiotic therapy can benefit from antifungal therapy. Additionally, the Candida score remains a useful tool, however, we recommend it be applied in the context of the data from the SIS. For instance, promptly treated bowel perforation in the absence of other risk factors should not be counted as a reason toward empiric fungal therapy based on recent evidence.

Ventriculitis

Question

In patients with ventriculitis, what is the most appropriate treatment?

Recommendations

A common antibiotic regimen for ventriculitis consists of vancomycin plus cefepime to cover hospital-acquired organisms. Removal of foreign body (ventricular shunt or external ventricular drain (EVD) may aid bacterial clearance. The duration of treatment is generally 10−14 days and can be longer for recurrent culture positivity or for S. aureus.

Discussion

Ventriculitis in hospitalized patients most commonly occurs in association with neurosurgical procedures, trauma resulting in dural tears and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, or the insertion of a central nervous system (CNS) device such as a shunt or EVD. Diagnosis involves the biochemical profile and cultures of CSF and sometimes imaging such as CT or MRI to detect complications of ventriculitis including abscess. The organism may not always grow on culture media or may grow in a delayed fashion so the clinical context must be closely considered. Attention to CSF penetration must be given in antibiotic selection. In cases refractory to systemic antimicrobials, limited data support consideration of intraventricular administration. Specific recommendations about device-related infections, relative need for neuroimaging, and timeline of removal and re-implantation are beyond the scope of this article.

VII. What is the role of intraventricular antimicrobial therapy — recommendations specify that intraventricular antimicrobial therapy should be considered for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis that responds poorly to systemic therapy alone, that when given via a ventricular drain the drain should be clamped for 15–60 minutes to allow equilibration throughout the cerebrospinal fluid, and that dosages and intervals should be adjusted based on cerebrospinal fluid antimicrobial concentrations to 10–20 times the minimum inhibitory concentration of the causative microorganism as well as ventricular size and daily drain output; all are graded strong, low.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee collaborated with partner organizations to convene a panel of 10 experts on healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis. The panel represented pediatric and adult specialists in the field of infectious diseases and represented other organizations whose members care for patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis (American Academy of Neurology, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, and Neurocritical Care Society). The panel reviewed articles based on literature reviews, review articles and book chapters, evaluated the evidence and drafted recommendations. Questions were reviewed and approved by panel members. Subcategories were included for some questions based on specific populations of patients who may develop healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis after the following procedures or situations: cerebrospinal fluid shunts, cerebrospinal fluid drains, implantation of intrathecal infusion pumps, implantation of deep brain stimulation hardware, and general neurosurgery and head trauma. Recommendations were followed by the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation. Many recommendations, however, were based on expert opinion because rigorous clinical data are not available. These guidelines represent a practical and useful approach to assist practicing clinicians in the management of these challenging infections.

Intraventricular antimicrobial therapy in healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis — evidence and agent selection includes that intraventricular vancomycin was shown to be safe and efficacious, and intraventricular aminoglycosides were also shown to be effective; when intraventricular gentamicin was combined with intravenous monotherapy there were no relapses. In a study of 34 consecutive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infections in 30 children, high-dose intraventricular antimicrobial therapy sterilized CSF cultures in 100% of 26 children treated for 3 days or longer. Successful uses include intravenous and intraventricular quinupristin/dalfopristin for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, intraventricular teicoplanin in 7 patients with staphylococcal neurosurgical shunt infections, and intraventricular daptomycin in CSF shunt and drain infections caused by methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and resistant enterococci. Intraventricular colistin (usually formulated as colistimethate sodium) and polymyxin B have been used for gram-negative ventriculitis and meningitis; however, these agents should be reserved for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms. Intraventricular amphotericin B deoxycholate may be required for Candida shunt infections that fail to respond to parenteral therapy and shunt removal.

β-D-glucan and galactomannan testing in suspected fungal ventriculitis or meningitis. Candida meningitis may be difficult to diagnose because the sensitivity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures is low and CSF Candida mannan antigen and anti-mannan antibodies may be useful additional tests when cultures are negative; CSF galactomannan has been evaluated in patients with CNS Aspergillus infections and may be useful before culture is positive. In 5 patients, 3 had elevated CSF (1, 3)-β-D-glucan concentrations (range, 39–2396 pg/mL) and responded to antifungal therapy, and measurement using the manufacturer's cutoff of ≥ 80 pg/mL was highly sensitive (96%) and specific (95%) for proven fungal meningitis associated with contaminated methylprednisolone injections.

IDSA 2017 healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis — monitoring for response to treatment includes specific recommendations and supporting evidence: Patients with healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis should be monitored for response to treatment based on clinical parameters (strong, low). In those with an external drainage device, monitoring of CSF cultures is recommended to ensure that they become negative (strong, low), and in patients with no definite clinical improvement, additional CSF analysis is recommended to ensure that the CSF parameters have improved and the cultures become negative (strong, low). For external CSF drains not being used in the treatment of CSF shunt infection, daily CSF cultures and analysis are not recommended unless clinically indicated (strong, low). There is no evidence that monitoring of inflammatory markers (ie, peripheral white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein) is useful in monitoring response to therapy; monitoring of CSF cultures should be performed and typically cultures should be negative for several days before a new shunt is placed. In a retrospective pediatric series with external ventricular drains, routine daily CSF cultures failed to identify infections before clinical symptoms developed, and all 7 patients with infection had fever.

Candida spp.

Candida CNS infections typically present as meningoencephalitis or as ventriculitis associated with foreign bodies such as shunts or, rarely, as brain abscesses. Candida microabscesses could be discovered at autopsy, while CT and CSF analysis not always show clearly pathological findings in this situation. Neuroimaging might show hydrocephalus in Candida meningitis and MRI is considered to be more sensitive than CT scan. In the case of Candida meningitis, yeasts can be detected by CSF staining in ∼40% and in ∼40%–80% by fungal cultures [A]. The PCR technique as well as the detection of (1 → 3)-β — Glucan or the Candida mannan antigen might also be useful to diagnose Candida meningitis from CSF, but these methods are not yet considered as clinical routine procedures [C].

Most data on the treatment of Candida CNS infection are derived from pediatric patients. The use of D-AmB with 5-FC has been suggested as the optimal initial therapy for many years due to the excellent CSF penetration of 5-FC, the documented synergism of both compounds in vitro and in vivo and their documented clinical activity in Candida infections. The rationale for the use of L-AmB is mainly reasoned by studies in experimental Candida meningoencephalitis and clinical data from preterm newborns. Since L-AmB has an improved toxicity profile compared with D-AmB, the combination of L-AmB and 5-FC should be preferred to treat Candida CNS infections [BIII]. Fluconazole, alone or in combination with 5-FC, may be used as an oral consolidation therapy [BIII]. Voriconazole is a reasonable therapeutic option for Candida CNS infection [CIII]. Animal models suggest the potential usefulness of the echinocandins in Candida CNS infection, although higher doses might be required (as studied for micafungin). Clinical data are limited to case reports; thus this approach cannot be recommended for routine use yet [DIII]. Any indwelling device such as a ventricular drain or a central venous line should be removed in invasive Candida infection [BIII].

### A rare central nervous system fungal infection resulting from Brown heroin use [^114rFqiy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fungal nervous system infection can be a difficult diagnosis to make, due to the fact that there are no specific manifestations of the disease and laboratory confirmation is difficult to confirm.

Case Report

We report a young male who presented to our emergency department with a variety of unilateral visual field complaints. While he initially denied recent IV drug abuse, his physical examination was highly suggestive of a fungal infection known to result from brown heroin use. He was ultimately diagnosed with meningitis, ventriculitis, and endogenous endophthalmitis believed to result from a Candida species. The response to treatment with vitrectomy and broad-spectrum antimicrobials gave support to the presumed diagnosis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We provide a rarely described report of a possible complication from the use of IV brown heroin that led to a central nervous system infection involving vision loss by fungal infection.

### Device-related infections in children [^117FGuSG]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Management of device-related infections includes device removal for some catheter-related bloodstream infections and all ventriculoperitoneal shunt-related infections. The isolation of certain organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida spp) in children with central catheters should prompt consideration of disseminated infection. Future research may determine the impact of increasing catheter use in non-intensive care hospital settings and in home care. New technologies, such as antimicrobial-impregnated central venous catheters and ventricular shunts, show promise in reducing the infection rates of these devices.

### Biofilm on ventriculo-peritoneal shunt tubing as a cause of treatment failure in coccidioidal meningitis [^11219JUR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Discussion

This case has several unusual features. First, the C. immitis in the ventricular shunt tubing was present in the hyphal phase. C. immitis is a dimorphic fungus that in nature is usually found in the mycelial phase. When the fungus infects humans, it is normally present in tissues in the yeast phase. With rare exceptions, autopsy studies have demonstrated C. immitis to be in the yeast phase in the CSF and meninges of patients with coccidioidal meningitis. The biofilm infection on the shunt tubing may have been responsible for reversal of the normal human yeast phase. Second, in spite of the 4-year duration of the infection, C. immitis organisms recovered from the patient demonstrated an antimicrobial sensitivity to fluconazole. One possibility was that the hyphal form of C. immitis conveyed fluconazole resistance. However, this possibility was precluded since the Mycology Reference Laboratory routinely used the mycelial form of fungi in their antimicrobial testing. Third, fungal persistence continued in spite of the patient's taking fluconazole in a dosage that usually, but not always, produces clinical improvement. Since our patient did not have a fungal peritonitis or evidence of systemic coccidioidal infection from CSF containing C. immitis that would have normally exited the shunt tubing into the peritoneal cavity, we thought that noncompliance in taking the fluconazole could not account for the treatment failure. Instead, we concluded that the fungal biofilm was the most likely explanation for the fluconazole failure. Antimicrobial-drug resistance is known to develop when fungi or bacteria form a biofilm. In vitro studies with strains of pathogenic Candida spp. that were sensitive to fluconazole and amphotericin B in the planktonic state developed marked resistant to these antifungal drugs when the fungi were within a biofilm.

Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans have been shown to produce biofilms on catheters; our case demonstrates that C. immitis can also produce a biofilm on indwelling catheters. Fungal biofilms should be considered as a potential cause for treatment failure of systemic fungal infections, especially if catheters or other artificial prostheses are indwelling in the patient.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^111ZcBCw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline — healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis executive summary scope: Meningitis may not only be acquired in the community setting, but may be associated with a variety of invasive procedures or head trauma, and the latter group has often been classified as nosocomial meningitis because a different spectrum of microorganisms (ie, resistant gram-negative bacilli and staphylococci) is more likely the etiologic agents. Although many of these patients present with clinical symptoms during hospitalization, ventriculitis and meningitis may develop after hospital discharge or even many years later. The term "healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis" is preferred to be more representative of the diverse mechanisms (that include placement of devices) that can lead to these serious illnesses. The document summarizes recommendations for the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis, specifically addressing infections associated with cerebrospinal fluid shunts, cerebrospinal fluid drains, intrathecal drug (eg, baclofen) therapy, deep brain stimulation hardware, and neurosurgery and head trauma. These infections may be difficult to diagnose because changes in cerebrospinal fluid parameters are often subtle, making it hard to determine if the abnormalities are related to infection, related to placement of devices, or following neurosurgery, and many recommendations are based on expert opinion because rigorous clinical data are not available and the likelihood that clinical trials will be conducted to answer some of these questions is low.

IDSA 2017 healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis — CSF shunt infection management is characterized by variable outcomes across strategies: Early nonoperative antimicrobial-only management had low success (34%–36%) and carried a high mortality rate. An observational nonoperative regimen using systemic and intraventricular antimicrobials cured 84% of 43 patients, with a 92% success rate for infections caused by bacteria other than S. aureus; however, in a randomized study, no shunt removal was associated with a 70% recurrence rate. Combining shunt hardware removal with immediate shunt replacement plus intravenous and/or intrathecal antimicrobial therapy cured approximately 90% of patients, although other studies reported only approximately 65%–75% cure. The most commonly practiced approach removes some or all infected shunt components and inserts a ventricular drain; once drainage cultures become negative, the drain is removed and a new shunt inserted, yet treatment failures still occur in 10%–20% of cases. For device-related infections, removal was required in all patients with deep-seated intrathecal baclofen pump infections, and deep brain stimulation–associated infections require surgical removal with follow-up targeted antimicrobial therapy for 2–6 weeks.

### Candida meningitis post gliadel wafer placement successfully treated with intrathecal and intravenous amphotericin B [^1176r9Kh]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of Candida meningitis post Gliadel wafer (polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implant) placement successfully treated with the combination of intrathecal and intravenous amphotericin B.

Case Summary

A 33-year-old white female with a history of recurrent oligodendroglioma was admitted to the neuroscience intensive care unit with acute mental status changes. Computed tomography of the head demonstrated a cystic dilation of the right frontoparietal tumor resection cavity with Gliadel wafers in place and the presence of a large fluid collection. The cavity was debrided surgically and a ventriculostomy catheter was left in place. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures were positive for Candida albicans and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Antiinfective therapy with intrathecal and intravenous amphotericin B as well as flucytosine and vancomycin was started. The patient had subsequent improvement in clinical manifestations, resolution of CSF leukocytosis, and mycologic cure.

Discussion

Candida meningitis occurs primarily in the setting of immunosuppression, intravenous drug abuse and following neurosurgical procedures. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections have been reported following Gliadel wafer placement in patients with brain tumor resection. Candida meningitis has traditionally been treated with intravenous amphotericin B with or without oral flucytosine. There have been reports of treatment with intrathecal amphotericin B with variable clinical outcomes.

Conclusions

This case demonstrates successful treatment of Candida meningitis post Gliadel wafer placement with the combination of intrathecal and intravenous amphotericin B. This treatment modality may provide an effective therapeutic option for other patients with Candida meningitis, especially those unresponsive to intravenous therapy.

CM hydrocephalus — monitoring and temporizing measures: In an asymptomatic patient with CM who has radiologic evidence of hydrocephalus, medical treatment alone should be continued with serial imaging obtained every 3–6 months until stability has been determined. In the presence of typical symptoms that reflect increased intracranial pressure (ICP), placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is very likely to be necessary, and this may carry as high as a 12.5-fold increased mortality in patients with CM. Placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD) should be considered as a temporizing measure to control elevated pressure; an EVD provides a means to measure ICP, obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for serial analysis, and drain CSF to decrease ICP, although it is unlikely that the typical patient with CM would achieve CSF sterility with an EVD. There are a variety of shunt systems including set pressure valves and adjustable valves, with no evidence in the literature to suggest superiority of one type of system over the other, and although some neurosurgeons are reluctant to perform shunting when the CSF is actively infected, there is no real evidence that expeditious shunting imposes undue risks and the dangerous effects of prolonged increased ICP greatly exceed the theoretical potential of an infectious nidus at the end of the catheter.

Ventricular shunts are the most common neurosurgical procedure performed in the United States. This hydrocephalus treatment is often complicated by infection of the device with biofilm-forming bacteria. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis of shunt infection, as well as the implications of the biofilm formation on treatment and prevention of these infections. Many questions remain, including the contribution of glia and the impact of inflammation on developmental outcomes following infection. Immune responses within the CNS must be carefully regulated to contain infection while minimizing bystander damage; further study is needed to design optimal treatment strategies for these patients.

### Intraventricular fungus ball: a unique manifestation of refractory intracranial candidiasis in an immunocompetent neonate [^113TGsiQ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

The authors report on a case of intracranial candidiasis in an immunocompetent neonate with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. The child was known to be colonized with yeast as she had been treated for oral thrush; however, she did not have systemic candidiasis. Despite initial treatment with antifungal medication, intraventricular fungus balls developed that were visible on imaging and confirmed with pathological analysis. Multiple endoscopic intraventricular operations were required for excision of the initial and recurrent fungus balls, multiple fenestrations of loculations and cysts were performed, and ultimately 3 ventriculoperitoneal shunts were placed. The finding of an intraventricular fungus ball is a unique manifestation of intracranial candidiasis, and to the authors' knowledge has not been previously reported in the English literature.

### Micafungin sodium (micafungin) [^113GwEwi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A randomized controlled trial evaluated a micafungin dose regimen of 10 mg/kg once daily in pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age with suspected or proven Candida meningoencephalitis. Fungal-free survival at 1 week after end of therapy was observed in 60% of micafungin-treated vs. 70% of amphotericin B-treated patients, and all-cause mortality was 15% vs. 10%, respectively. However, because this study was terminated early and enrolled only 30 pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age (20 treated with micafungin and 10 treated with amphotericin B) which was 13% of the planned enrollment for the study, no conclusions can be drawn regarding efficacy of micafungin at this dose regimen.

In six uncontrolled, open-label studies, and a neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) medical records database, pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age with suspected Candida meningoencephalitis or disseminated candidemia received micafungin at dose regimens ranging from 5 to 15 mg/kg once daily. Across the entire micafungin development program, only 6 pediatric patients with proven Candida meningoencephalitis were treated with dosages of 2 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg once daily. Micafungin was detected in the CSF of pediatric patients with suspected Candida meningoencephalitis. No conclusions regarding the efficacy of a particular dosage of micafungin or the penetration of micafungin into the CSF can be drawn due to limitations of the data, including but not limited to, multiple confounding factors, variable study designs, and limited numbers of patients. No new safety signals were observed with the use of micafungin at dosages of 5 to 15 mg/kg once daily in pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age, and there was no discernible dose-response for adverse events.

Although the dosage for the treatment of candidemia with meningoencephalitis has not been established, antifungal activity in various CNS compartments in the rabbit HCME model and limited clinical trial data suggest that in patients younger than 4 months of age, dose regimens 10 mg/kg once daily or higher may be necessary for the treatment of candidemia with meningoencephalitis. Safety data from clinical studies for micafungin at dose regimens of 10 to 15 mg/kg once daily in pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age did not reveal new safety signals.

### Post-cardiac surgery fungal mediastinitis: clinical features, pathogens and outcome [^1158LF91]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Postoperative Candida mediastinitis should be treated by surgical debridement, followed by echinocandin or fluconazole in the absence of invasive circulatory support and in the absence of underlying aorta prosthesis. As recommended for endocarditis, the preferred treatment among patients with invasive devices or vascular prosthesis is either lipid formulation amphotericin B (sometimes associated with flucytosine), or high dose echinocandin. Step-down therapy to fluconazole can be considered in patients who have fluconazole-susceptible Candida isolates and quite stable clinical condition, that is after 2 weeks of initial amphotericin or echinocandin treatment. Optimal treatment duration is unknown, but usually requires several months. For ventricular assist devices that cannot be removed, chronic suppressive therapy with fluconazole is recommended, if the isolate is susceptible, as long as the device remains in place.

In cases of Aspergillus spp. mediastinitis, voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B should be preferred as first-line antifungal therapy, analogous to the treatment of extrapulmonary aspergillosis. Long-term treatment with oral voriconazole is recommended after initial therapy. Eventually, Trichosporon spp. mediastinitis medical treatment relies on voriconazole or posaconazole, given the fact that these yeasts are intrinsically resistant to echinocandins. This point is of utmost importance in the critically ill patients, because guidelines recommend favoring empiric echinocandins treatment in patients with invasive fungal infection.

### Intradural cauda equina Candida abscess presenting with hydrocephalus: case report [^115koGc6]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) candida infections are often associated with a poor prognosis. Typically, CNS candidiasis presents as meningitis or microabscesses. Here, the authors report a patient with a challenging presentation of a CNS Candida infection as a discrete, large cauda equina abscess. The patient initially presented with ventriculomegaly due to fourth ventricular outflow obstruction and a cauda equina mass. The patient was treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and underwent a lumbar laminectomy for exploration of the lumbar lesion. An intradural abscess was encountered during surgery. Fungal wet mount revealed fungal elements and polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of Candida albicans. The patient did not have any known predisposition to fungal infections; therefore, the authors performed whole-exome sequencing using peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA. They found heterozygous missense variants in the following genes: colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) and Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (RASGRF1)-genes that have been specifically associated with protection from CNS candidiasis via caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) signaling, and phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCG2)-a lectin receptor involved in candidiasis. The authors' experience suggests that C. albicans can present as a cauda equina abscess. Hydrocephalus, a result of diffuse arachnoiditis, is a potential complication from intradural fungal abscesses.

External ventricular drain exchange interval — risk of CSF infection: Reducing the ventricular catheter exchange frequency beyond every 5 days does not significantly decrease the likelihood of CSF infection, and in one study in 103 patients who required external ventricular drains for more than 5 days the CSF infection rate was 7.8% for exchange every 5 days and 3.8% for no-change (P = 0.5). This suggests that a single external ventricular drain can be used for as long as clinically indicated unless a change is necessary because of CSF infection or catheter malfunction, and no significant difference was found in intensive care unit stay, ward stay, or clinical outcome between the 2 groups.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^112fBU2o]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Monitoring and adverse events — raised intracranial pressure (ICP) management in cryptococcal meningitis includes that "At the time of diagnosis and on subsequent lumbar punctures, all patients with cryptococcal meningitis should have their lumbar opening pressure measured". Patients with symptoms of increased ICP "should be managed using measures to decrease ICP". An approach is to "measure pressure continuously or repeatedly during the lumbar puncture procedure and to remove CSF until the pressure is approximately half the opening pressure but still no lower than normal", and "This may be repeated as often as every day until symptoms and signs consistently improve". In children, "a cutoff opening pressure of 28 cm of water has been proposed… above which the pressure should be considered elevated". "CSF shunting through a lumbar drain or ventriculostomy can be considered… (BIII)", and "Corticosteroids and mannitol have been shown to be ineffective in managing ICP in adults with cryptococcal meningitis".

### Management of nosocomial external ventricular drain-related ventriculomeningitis [^112KGWym]. Neurocritical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neurocritical care patients requiring external ventricular drainage are at risk for the development of a device-related infection. Infection rate of external ventriculostomy catheters is high with reported incidences ranging from 5% up to more than 20%. Nosocomial ventriculitis or ventriculomeningitis are potential life-threatening conditions which may contribute to a permanent adverse outcome of the patient. Reducing morbidity and mortality is strongly dependent on prompt diagnosis and on the initiation of appropriate antiinfective therapy.

Scientific Background

Management of nosocomial ventriculitis is challenging and needs to consider the most likely pathogens involved, local resistance patterns, the nature of the underlying disease, patient factors such as age, comorbidity, and immune status. Further, decisions on catheter exchange and the type and duration of systemic or local antimicrobial therapy have to be made. Because so many factors have to be taken into account, it is evident that the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to nosocomial ventriculitis is difficult to standardize. Staphylococci are the pathogens most frequently identified in nosocomial ventriculitis. Therefore, initial treatment with an antistaphylococcal agent with adequate cerebrospinal fluid penetration may be considered as first-line therapy for this infection.

Conclusion

In the review of a contemporary case we will discuss important issues in the management of device-related ventriculitis.

### Treatment and prophylaxis of invasive candidiasis [^114Qvt1T]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Invasive candidiasis (IC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Even if successfully treated, IC can cause significant neurodevelopmental impairment. Preterm infants are at increased risk for hematogenous Candida meningoencephalitis owing to increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, so antifungal treatment should have adequate central nervous system penetration. Amphotericin B deoxycholate, lipid preparations of amphotericin B, fluconazole, and micafungin are first-line treatments of IC. Fluconazole prophylaxis reduces the incidence of IC in extremely premature infants, but its safety has not been established for this indication, and as yet, the product has not been shown to reduce mortality in neonates. Targeted prophylaxis may have a role in reducing the burden of disease in this vulnerable population.

### Micafungin [^1122XBqw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A randomized controlled trial evaluated a micafungin dose regimen of 10 mg/kg once daily in pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age with suspected or proven Candida meningoencephalitis. Fungal-free survival at 1 week after end of therapy was observed in 60% of micafungin -treated vs. 70% of amphotericin B-treated patients, and allcause mortality was 15% vs. 10%, respectively. However, because this study was terminated early and enrolled only 30 pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age (20 treated with micafungin and 10 treated with amphotericin B) which was 13% of the planned enrollment for the study, no conclusions can be drawn regarding efficacy of micafungin at this dose regimen.

In six uncontrolled, open-label studies, and a neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) medical records database, pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age with suspected Candida meningoencephalitis or disseminated candidemia received micafungin at dose regimens ranging from 5 to 15 mg/kg once daily. Across the entire micafungin development program, only 6 pediatric patients with proven Candida meningoencephalitis were treated with dosages of 2 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg once daily. Micafungin was detected in the CSF of pediatric patients with suspected Candida meningoencephalitis. No conclusions regarding the efficacy of a particular dosage of micafungin or the penetration of micafungin into the CSF can be drawn due to limitations of the data, including but not limited to, multiple confounding factors, variable study designs, and limited numbers of patients. No new safety signals were observed with the use of micafungin at dosages of 5 to 15 mg/kg once daily in pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age, and there was no discernible dose-response for adverse events.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115gtQNp]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Monitoring of response to therapy and adverse events (including IRIS) in cryptococcal meningitis — intracranial pressure (ICP) management, procedures, and medication guidance: ICP elevations can cause clinical deterioration despite a microbiologic response, and they are more likely to occur if the CSF opening lumbar pressure is ≥ 25cm H2O; in 1 large clinical trial, increased ICP was associated with 93% of deaths during the first 2 weeks of therapy and 40% of deaths during weeks 3 to 10. Lumbar opening pressure should be measured in all patients with cryptococcal meningitis at the time of diagnosis. Drainage of CSF via lumbar puncture is recommended for initial management, and one approach is to remove a volume of CSF (typically 20–30 mL) that at least halves the opening pressure and repeat daily until symptoms and signs consistently improve. CSF shunting through a lumbar drain or ventriculostomy should be considered for patients who cannot tolerate repeated lumbar punctures or in whom signs and symptoms of cerebral edema persist after multiple lumbar taps (BIII). Corticosteroids and mannitol have been shown to be ineffective in managing ICP and are not recommended (AIII), and acetazolamide should not be used as therapy for increased ICP management since it may cause hyperchloremic acidosis and does not result in a decrease in ICP (AI). A randomized study compared a 6-week course of a tapering dose of dexamethasone among 451 Asian and African patients with HIV infection and cryptococcal meningitis who received amphotericin B deoxycholate plus fluconazole; compared to placebo, there was no improvement in survival at 10 weeks and dexamethasone was associated with more adverse events, supporting that corticosteroids should not routinely be used during induction therapy for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis unless they are being used for IRIS (AI). After the first 2 weeks of treatment, many experts would advocate a repeat lumbar puncture; even with clinical improvement, positive CSF cultures after 2 weeks of therapy are predictive of future relapse, and some experts would continue amphotericin B plus flucytosine until the CSF cultures are negative (BIII). Monitoring titers of cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen in serum or CSF is of no value in determining response to therapy and is not recommended, and if new symptoms or clinical findings occur later, a repeat lumbar puncture with measurement of opening lumbar pressure and CSF culture should be performed. Patients treated with amphotericin B formulations should be monitored for dose-dependent nephrotoxicity and electrolyte disturbances, and pre-infusion administration of 500 to 1000 mL of normal saline appears to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity during amphotericin B treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116G6rGz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis antifungal selection — echinocandins have emerged as preferred agents for most episodes of candidemia and invasive candidiasis except central nervous system (CNS), eye, and urinary tract infections. This preference is based on a strong safety profile, convenience, early fungicidal activity, a trend toward better outcomes, and the emergence of azole-resistant Candida species, but the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida species further complicates therapy and there are no good prospective data to guide therapy. Additionally, voriconazole is as effective as sequential AmB and fluconazole for candidemia, but few would choose voriconazole because there is little advantage and potentially greater toxicity compared to other therapies.

IDSA 2016 candidiasis guideline — Candida endocarditis (native and prosthetic valves): For native valve endocarditis, lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, with or without flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily, OR high-dose echinocandin (caspofungin 150 mg daily, micafungin 150 mg daily, or anidulafungin 200 mg daily) is recommended for initial therapy (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Step-down therapy to fluconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/kg) daily, is recommended for patients who have susceptible Candida isolates, have demonstrated clinical stability, and have cleared Candida from the bloodstream (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Oral voriconazole, 200–300 mg (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily, or posaconazole tablets, 300 mg daily, can be used as step-down therapy for isolates that are susceptible to those agents but not susceptible to fluconazole (weak recommendation; very low-quality evidence). Valve replacement is recommended; treatment should continue for at least 6 weeks after surgery and for a longer duration in patients with perivalvular abscesses and other complications (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For patients who cannot undergo valve replacement, long-term suppression with fluconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/kg) daily, if the isolate is susceptible, is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For prosthetic valve endocarditis, the same antifungal regimens suggested for native valve endocarditis are recommended and chronic suppressive antifungal therapy with fluconazole, 400–800 mg (6–12 mg/kg) daily, is recommended to prevent recurrence (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Ventriculostomy-related infections: a critical review of the literature [^111b8Eoh]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a critical evaluation of the published literature describing risk factors for ventriculostomy-related infections (VRIs) and the efficacy of prophylactic catheter exchange.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search was performed, and data were extracted from studies published from 1941 through 2001.

Results

Published criteria for diagnosing VRIs are highly variable. Intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cranial fracture with cerebrospinal fluid leak, craniotomy, systemic infections, and catheter irrigation all predispose patients to the development of VRIs. Extended duration of catheterization is correlated with an increasing risk of cerebrospinal fluid infections during the first 10 days of catheterization. Prophylactic catheter exchange does not modify the risk of developing later VRIs in retrospective studies.

Conclusion

Categorizing suspected cerebrospinal fluid infections as contaminants, colonization, suspected or confirmed VRIs, or ventriculitis more accurately describes the patient's clinical condition and may indicate different management strategies. A prospective, randomized clinical trial is required to further evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic catheter exchange in limiting the incidence of VRIs during prolonged catheterization. Although prophylactic catheter exchange remains a practice option, the available data suggest that this procedure is not currently justified.

Candida chorioretinitis without vitritis — pharmacologic evidence notes that intravenous amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate has the greatest clinical experience but does not achieve adequate posterior chamber concentrations; in rabbits, liposomal AmB achieved higher concentrations than AmB deoxycholate in serum and aqueous, but not in vitreous, and in humans vitreous concentrations with lipid formulations have not been reported. Flucytosine provides adjunctive synergistic activity with AmB, should not be used as monotherapy, attains excellent ocular levels including vitreous, and requires weekly serum level monitoring due to common toxicity. Fluconazole achieves excellent ocular concentrations in animals and in humans the vitreous is approximately 70% of serum; despite no large published series defining efficacy, it is routinely used for Candida endophthalmitis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116UQdfn]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Coccidioidal meningitis — initial therapy and specialist management are outlined as follows: Treatment of coccidioidal meningitis requires consultation with a specialist in the treatment of coccidioidal meningitis (AIII), and intravenous amphotericin B alone is ineffective as treatment for coccidioidal meningitis. Treatment with a triazole antifungal is recommended instead with the early addition of the polyene, with fluconazole (800 to 1,200 mg daily) the preferred regimen (AII) and itraconazole 400 to 600 mg daily also successfully used (BII). Therapy with voriconazole (BIII), posaconazole (CIII), and isavuconazole (CIII) has been limited and described in individual case reports but has been successful. Despite appropriate antifungal therapy, some patients may develop hydrocephalus and require CSF shunting; in some instances triazole antifungals are ineffective and intrathecal amphotericin B deoxycholate is recommended (AIII), and when required intrathecal therapy should be administered by someone very experienced in this drug delivery technique.

Cryptococcosis treatment failure — definition and salvage approaches — are outlined as follows: Treatment failure is defined as worsening or lack of improvement in signs and symptoms after 2 weeks of appropriate therapy or relapse after an initial clinical response, and optimal management is unknown. If cultures remain positive, antifungal susceptibilities can be considered; patients in whom initial azole-based therapy fails should be switched to amphotericin B–based therapy, ideally with flucytosine, and potential drug interactions causing sub-therapeutic azole levels should be explored. Use of liposomal amphotericin B should be considered because one study suggests improved cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sterilization versus standard amphotericin B. Some data indicate higher dosages "400–800 mg/day" of fluconazole with flucytosine also can be considered for salvage therapy, and refractory or intolerant cases have been treated with posaconazole or voriconazole with variable success.

### Current practices of intraventricular antibiotic therapy in the treatment of meningitis and ventriculitis: results from a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^115GLCvF]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Central nervous system (CNS) infections are particularly prevalent in the adult neurocritical care patient population and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Factors relevant to the nature of CNS infections pose significant challenges to clinicians treating afflicted patients. Intraventricular (IVT) administration of antibiotics may offer several benefits over systemic therapy; however, the outcomes and current practices of such treatments are poorly described in the literature.

Objective

To describe current practices and outcomes of patients receiving intraventricular antibiotic treatment for CNS infections in neurological intensive care units of academic medical centers nationwide.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients admitted to intensive care units who received IVT antibiotic treatment at participating centers in the United States between January 01, 2003, and December 31, 2013. Clinical and laboratory parameters, microbiology, surgical and antimicrobial management, and treatment outcomes were collected and described.

Results

Of the 105 patients included, all received systemic antimicrobial therapy along with at least one dose of IVT antimicrobial agents. Intraventricular vancomycin was used in 52.4% of patients. The average dose was 12.2 mg/day for a median duration of 5 days. Intraventricular aminoglycosides were used in 47.5% of the patients, either alone or in combination with IVT vancomycin. The average dose of gentamicin/tobramycin was 6.7 mg/day with a median duration of 6 days. Overall mortality was 18.1%. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture sterilization occurred in 88.4% of the patients with a rate of recurrence or persistence of positive cultures of 9.5%.

Conclusion

Intraventricular antimicrobial agents resulted in a high CSF sterilization rate. Contemporary use of this route typically results in a treatment duration of less than a week. Prospective studies are needed to establish the optimal patient population, as well as the efficacy and safety of this route of administration.

Candida endocarditis — clinical suspicion, risk factors, species distribution, and management principles include that the incidence of Candida endocarditis has increased concurrent with the general increase in Candida infections, that endocarditis should be suspected when blood cultures are persistently positive, when a patient with candidemia has persistent fever despite appropriate treatment, or when a new heart murmur, heart failure, or embolic phenomenon occur in the setting of candidemia, that most cases occur following cardiac valvular surgery with other risk factors including injection drug use, cancer chemotherapy, prolonged presence of CVCs, and prior bacterial endocarditis, that cases are fairly evenly divided between C. albicans and non-albicans Candida species, that the optimum therapy for both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis in adults is a combination of valve replacement and a long course of antifungal therapy, that fluconazole monotherapy is associated with an unacceptably high rate of relapse and mortality, that lifelong suppressive therapy with fluconazole has been used successfully and advocated to prevent late recurrence of Candida prosthetic valve endocarditis, and that because Candida endocarditis has a propensity to relapse months to years later, follow-up should be maintained for several years after treatment.

### Use of ventriculoperitoneal shunts to treat uncontrollable intracranial hypertension in patients who have cryptococcal meningitis without hydrocephalus [^113Eya3S]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Between 1997 and 2000, 4 human immunodeficiency virus-negative patients in our institution had cryptococcal meningitis with uncontrollable intracranial hypertension. All 4 patients were treated with antifungal drugs as well as ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts for intracranial hypertension. Neurological deficits that were unresponsive to pharmacologic treatment were resolved by use of the VP shunt. Uncontrollable elevation of intracranial pressure associated with cryptococcal meningitis can be resolved by use of a VP shunt, even when imaging studies do not reveal hydrocephalus.

### The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go [^114geuHD]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The individualization of treatment duration for candidemia and/or IC remains challenging.

The prolonged use of antibiotics can disrupt the host's microbiota and induce resistance in pathogens, leading to suggestions from guidelines such as the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's sepsis and septic shock guidelines to use shorter courses of treatment whenever possible. However, these suggestions are limited to bacterial causes of pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, excluding candidemia and/or IC. Currently, treatment continues for two weeks after two negative blood cultures, following infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) and European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines, to prevent recurrence. However, this "one-size-fits-all" approach may not suit all patients and could unnecessarily prolong hospital stays, increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and antibiotic resistance, and escalate healthcare costs.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116BCvfJ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis in people with HIV — elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) risk and early therapeutic lumbar puncture: Elevated ICP can cause clinical deterioration despite a microbiologic response, and complications are more likely when the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lumbar opening pressure is ≥ 25 cm CSF in the lateral decubitus position. Increased ICP was associated with 92% of deaths during the first 2 weeks of antifungal therapy. In a clinical trial, people with HIV who received at least one therapeutic lumbar puncture within 7 days after diagnosis (median time of 3 days) had a 69% relative reduction in the risk of death through 11 days, regardless of initial opening pressure. Those with symptoms and signs of increased ICP require immediate clinical intervention to reduce ICP.

### Refractory candidal meningitis in an immunocompromised patient cured by caspofungin [^114vSUsc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Candidal meningitis is a rare infectious disease that usually leads to substantial morbidity and mortality. We present a case of candidal meningitis refractory to systemic antifungal therapy (amphotericin B and fluconazole). A 63-year-old female with lymphoblastic lymphoma and myelodysplasia with leukemia transformation developed prolonged fever and headache on the seventh day following intrathecal prophylactic chemotherapy. A lumbar puncture showed neutrophilic pleocytosis, and a cerebrospinal fluid culture yielded Candida albicans. The clinical course was complicated by brain edema, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and hydrocephalus. Parenteral therapy with amphotericin B alone or amphotericin B in combination with fluconazole or intrathecal administration of amphotericin B failed to eradicate C. albicans in the cerebrospinal fluid. After 7 days of caspofungin therapy, however, the cerebrospinal fluid became sterile and the patient gradually regained consciousness. She was discharged 1 month after completing 4 weeks of caspofungin therapy. There were two critical issues we thought to be relevant to the favorable outcome of this case. First, isolation of C. albicans was achieved by inoculating enriched liquid medium with cerebrospinal fluid. Second, there is a potential therapeutic benefit of caspofungin in treating a fungal infection of the central nervous system.

### The insertion and management of external ventricular drains: an evidence-based consensus statement: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^114m32kr]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Intraventricular antimicrobials for VRI treatment — indications, outcomes, and limitations are summarized as follows: "Intraventricular antimicrobials might be necessary when patients do not respond to intravenous antimicrobials alone or when organisms have high-minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to intravenous antimicrobials that do not achieve high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations", but "no antimicrobial agent has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for intraventricular use". "CSF sterililty and normalization of CSF parameters were achieved sooner with intraventricular and intravenous use when compared with intravenous use alone". In a prospective randomized trial of early intraventricular gentamicin plus systemic antibacterials, "CSF was sterilized within 1 to 2 days as compared to intravenous therapy". In a study of 34 patients, intraventricular or lumbar intrathecal antimicrobials achieved sterilization "within 24 h in 50% and within 48 h in an additional 18%", with "Only three patients had adverse effects", and outcomes "improved in 50% and stayed unchanged in 29%". Another study reported 25 patients received intraventricular and systemic antimicrobials versus 23 systemic alone, with significantly shorter times and stays "(p < 0.05 and p < 0.005 respectively)" "(p < 0.002)" and "(p < 0.001)". Nonetheless, "The literature is not sufficiently robust to make a recommendation for a specific antimicrobial or duration of treatment".

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117FYG8d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2016 guideline — symptomatic Candida cystitis treatment and catheter management is as follows: For fluconazole-susceptible organisms, oral fluconazole, 200 mg (3 mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks is recommended (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily for 1–7 days OR oral flucytosine, 25 mg/kg 4 times daily for 7–10 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). For C. krusei, AmB deoxycholate, 0.3–0.6 mg/kg daily, for 1–7 days is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Removal of an indwelling bladder catheter, if feasible, is strongly recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). AmB deoxycholate bladder irrigation, 50 mg/L sterile water daily for 5 days, may be useful for treatment of cystitis due to fluconazole-resistant species, such as C. glabrata and C. krusei (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### A phase 3 study of micafungin versus amphotericin B deoxycholate in infants with invasive candidiasis [^111XJZWf]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Persistent fungal infection occurred in 2 (10%) infants in the MCA and in 2 (20%) infants in the AmB-D groups, respectively. The persistent infections were because of C. parapsilosis in both MCA-treated infants and Candida glabrata and C. albicans in AmB-D-treated infants (Table 1). The MCA MICs of the baseline isolates for the 2 persistent infections in the MCA group were 1 mg/L (CLSI and EUCAST methodologies) for 1 infection and 1 mg/L (CLSI) and 0.5 mg/L (EUCAST) for the other infection (within the CLSI susceptible criteria for C. parapsilosis of ≤ 2 mg/L, and between the EUCAST susceptible and resistant breakpoints for C. parapsilosis of 0.002 and 2 mg/L, respectively). Both infants were enrolled with candidemia and received 19 and 16 days of study drug, respectively, before discontinuing treatment. The estimated duration of persistent fungal infection was 36 and 35 days, respectively. MICs for the follow-up isolates collected on day 19 for both MCA-treated infants did not increase (CLSI MIC value of 1 mg/L and EUCAST 1 and 0.25 mg/L). One of 2 MCA-treated infants was diagnosed on day 19 with end-organ dissemination to the CNS/brain based on head ultrasound, which revealed coagulation in ventricles and nodules consistent with fungal sepsis.

Similarly, infants in the AmB-D group with persistent infection caused by C. glabrata and C. albicans were treated for baseline candidemia with 11 and 10 days of study drug before discontinuing treatment. The estimated duration of persistent fungal infection was 21 and 19 days, respectively. The MIC values of both baseline isolates (1 mg/L CLSI methodology and 0.5 mg/L EUCAST methodology) were at the CLSI and EUCAST susceptibility breakpoint of 1 mg/L. The infant with C. glabrata had subsequent isolates with identical MICs to baseline. This infant also had end-organ dissemination to the peritoneal cavity diagnosed on day 15. Similarly, the infant with C. albicans candidemia had follow-up cultures on day 9 but MICs had not changed from baseline (1 mg/L CLSI method and 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L for EUCAST methodology). This infant was also diagnosed on day 11 with end-organ dissemination in the bowel.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1125tVJZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of patients with invasive candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous guidelines published in the 15 January 2004 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have or are at risk of these infections. Since 2004, several new antifungal agents have become available, and several new studies have been published relating to the treatment of candidemia, other forms of invasive candidiasis, and mucosal disease, including oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. There are also recent prospective data on the prevention of invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates and adults and on the empiric treatment of suspected invasive candidiasis in adults. This new information is incorporated into this revised document.

### Treatment of candidiasis… [^1157SL71]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- **Antifungal medications come in different forms**: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:

- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7–14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations.

For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Invasive Candidiasis. Length of treatment For bloodstream Candida infections, treatment should continue for 2 weeks after signs and symptoms have resolved and Candida yeasts are no longer in the bloodstream. Other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period of time.

### Clinical overview of invasive candidiasis… [^111QXTCt]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of invasive candidiasis are non-specific but often include fever and chills.
- Blood cultures are used to diagnose invasive candidiasis.
- Candidemia is the most common type of bloodstream infection in the U. S.
- **Other forms of infection include**: endocarditis, peritonitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, and endophthalmitis.
- Echinocandin antifungals are the most common treatment; antifungal susceptibility testing may be necessary. Prevention In healthcare settings, these measures are important to prevent invasive candidiasis:

- Adhering to hand hygiene recommendations
- Following recommendations for placement and maintenance of central venous catheters
- Practicing antimicrobial stewardship Some groups of patients may benefit from antifungal prophylaxis:

- Some solid organ transplant recipients
- High-risk ICU patients
- Patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia
- Stem cell transplant recipients with neutropenia.

Diagnosis Invasive candidiasis is primarily diagnosed with blood culture. Newer culture-independent diagnostic methods are promising but are not yet widely used. The Beta-D-glucan assay is approved as an adjunctive diagnostic tool but is not a very specific test for Candida. Determining the species of Candida causing the infection is important to guide appropriate antifungal treatment. Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis Initial treatment For most adult patients with candidemia, an echinocandin is recommended as initial therapy. Fluconazole is an alternative initial treatment in patients who are not critically ill when fluconazole-resistance is considered unlikely. Other treatments include voriconazole and amphotericin B formulations. Transitional treatment The infectious Diseases Society of America recommends retesting patients every day or every other day. Once blood cultures clear transition to fluconazole if susceptible to azoles.

Duration of treatment In general, treatment should continue for two weeks after clearance of Candida and resolution of symptoms. Intravenous catheter removal is recommended for non-neutropenic patients and can be considered for neutropenic patients. For neonatal candidiasis, the recommended primary treatment is amphotericin B deoxycholate or fluconazole. The treatment duration is two weeks after clearance of Candida from the bloodstream and symptom resolution. Treatment for invasive candidiasis including candidemia vary by type of infection.

Treatment Short-course topical formulations effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy. Over-the-Counter Intravaginal Agents. Clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days OR Clotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days OR Miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days. Treatment Most episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans respond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer duration of initial therapy is recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen. Oral fluconazole weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term. Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist. Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Severe VVC is associated with lower clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses is recommended.
