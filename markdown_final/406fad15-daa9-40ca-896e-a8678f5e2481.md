## Question

Recommended anticoagulants for PICC line associated DVTs according to the CHEST guidelines?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended anticoagulants for managing PICC-associated DVT according to the CHEST guidelines, including whether to remove the catheter, which anticoagulant to choose, how long to treat, and how to handle special populations like cancer and bleeding risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and baseline risk of PICC-related thrombosis. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and whether ultrasound suffices. Next, I will review catheter management principles. After that, I need to check the anticoagulant selection strategy, including DOACs versus LMWH and VKA, and the initial parenteral phase. Then, I should confirm the duration of therapy and when to extend. Finally, I will consider special scenarios such as high bleeding risk, thrombocytopenia, and the role of thrombolysis or IVC filters, and close with a concise, practical recommendation summary anchored to CHEST and related guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. PICC lines are associated with an increased risk of upper-extremity DVT compared with centrally inserted catheters, with contemporary meta-analyses showing roughly a two-fold increase in DVT risk, though absolute rates vary widely with technique and patient factors, and best-practice insertion reduces risk substantially, which frames the baseline risk discussion and the importance of catheter factors in management decisions [^111yjbme] [^111GwrKV].

> I need to verify the diagnostic approach. Duplex ultrasound is the first-line test for suspected upper-extremity DVT, with high sensitivity and specificity for axillary, subclavian, and brachial veins, and it is appropriate to use serial ultrasound if initial studies are negative but suspicion remains high; contrast venography or cross-sectional venography is reserved for indeterminate ultrasound or when central veins must be visualized, so I should not jump to invasive imaging unless the clinical picture demands it [^113xMwQN] [^116MSQ8X].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about catheter removal. The general principle is that a functional, well-positioned, noninfected PICC does not need to be removed solely because of DVT; instead, treat with anticoagulation while keeping the line, and reserve removal for infection, malfunction, malposition, or when the catheter is no longer needed, which aligns with ISTH and CHEST-aligned oncology guidance and is echoed by ASH for cancer-associated CVC thrombosis [^113p3TBg] [^117FFpTX] [^114QbRvu].

> Next, I should review anticoagulant selection. For patients without cancer, DOACs are reasonable first-line options for VTE treatment, with CHEST suggesting apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban over VKA for the first 3 months. However, I need to ensure the initial parenteral phase is respected when required, noting that rivaroxaban and apixaban do not require initial LMWH, whereas dabigatran and edoxaban do, and VKA requires overlap until therapeutic INR, so I should double-check the agent-specific initiation rules before choosing [^114E5vVk] [^111CRN3P].

> For patients with cancer, I should confirm the preferred approach. CHEST suggests LMWH over VKA for the first 3 months of cancer-associated thrombosis, and ISTH similarly supports LMWH as the initial agent for catheter-related thrombosis in cancer, given stronger evidence in this population. DOACs are increasingly used, but high-quality comparative data in CRT are limited, so if a DOAC is chosen, it should be with caution and shared decision-making, and I need to ensure I am not over-extrapolating beyond the available evidence [^113cLW6N] [^117FFpTX] [^112n8r1c].

> Wait, let me verify the initial parenteral phase details. If using UFH, weight-based IV dosing with an 80 units/kg bolus followed by 18 units/kg/h infusion is standard, with aPTT monitoring and adjustment. If using LMWH, once- or twice-daily subcutaneous dosing based on weight is typical, with anti-Xa monitoring considered in special populations such as renal impairment or extremes of body weight, so I should tailor the parenteral choice to renal function, bleeding risk, and outpatient feasibility [^113rjtBn] [^112pzqTe].

> I should confirm the duration of therapy. The baseline duration for proximal DVT, including upper-extremity DVT, is 3 months, and this applies to PICC-associated DVT as well; in cancer, extended anticoagulation is often favored if the malignancy is active and bleeding risk is acceptable, with periodic reassessment, so I need to align duration with the presence of ongoing risk factors such as active cancer or the continued need for the catheter [^116ceJ2x] [^112geCkt] [^113tE5sk].

> But wait, what if the patient has a high bleeding risk or thrombocytopenia. In high bleeding risk, catheter removal alone with close surveillance can be considered, accepting a trade-off of slightly higher recurrence risk; in thrombocytopenia, decisions should be individualized, balancing platelet count, procedural needs, and bleeding risk, and I should double-check institutional thresholds for platelet support around catheter manipulation and anticoagulation decisions [^117CGg2G] [^112maANE] [^112KF6f7].

> I will now examine the role of thrombolysis and IVC filters. Routine catheter-directed thrombolysis is not recommended for most DVT, including upper-extremity cases, and is reserved for select scenarios with severe symptoms and low bleeding risk; similarly, IVC filters are not indicated when anticoagulation can be given, so I should avoid interventional escalation unless there is limb threat or a compelling indication [^116AqaQD] [^115eNseC] [^1114WPxb].

> Let me synthesize a practical, CHEST-aligned approach. For a patient with PICC-associated upper-extremity DVT, I would confirm the diagnosis with duplex ultrasound, keep the PICC if it is functional, well-positioned, and noninfected, initiate therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH or a DOAC tailored to cancer status and renal function, ensure appropriate initial parenteral therapy when required, continue for at least 3 months, extend therapy if cancer is active or risk persists, and reassess periodically, reserving catheter removal for infection, malfunction, or when access is no longer needed [^1117FHrK] [^114E5vVk] [^113tE5sk] [^113p3TBg].

---

Per CHEST guidelines, **anticoagulation is indicated** for PICC-associated DVT [^116ceJ2x], with **LMWH preferred** in cancer and DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) or VKA acceptable in non-cancer patients [^114E5vVk] [^113moVnU]. Treat for **at least 3 months** [^112geCkt]; if the catheter remains in place or cancer is active, continue anticoagulation and reassess periodically [^113tE5sk] [^117D9sTx]. Catheter removal is not required if functional, well-positioned, and noninfected [^113p3TBg]; remove only if infected, malfunctioning, or no longer needed [^113AhLwo]. Routine thrombolysis or IVC filters are not recommended [^115eNseC] [^1114WPxb].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Ultrasound is the **initial diagnostic test** for suspected PICC-DVT, with high sensitivity and specificity [^116MSQ8X]; reserve contrast venography for inconclusive ultrasound or high clinical suspicion [^116MSQ8X].

---

## Indications for anticoagulation

Anticoagulation is **recommended** for PICC-associated DVT [^1117FHrK] to prevent thrombus extension, pulmonary embolism, and post-thrombotic syndrome [^notfound].

---

## Choice of anticoagulant

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended anticoagulant** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Cancer patients | LMWH (e.g. enoxaparin) | - Preferred based on evidence and guidelines [^113cLW6N] [^113moVnU] <br/> - Lower recurrence risk than VKA [^notfound] |
| Non-cancer patients | - DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) <br/> - VKA (warfarin) | - DOACs are noninferior to VKA with less monitoring [^114BZgG8] <br/> - VKA is an alternative if DOACs are contraindicated [^111CRN3P] |

---

## Duration of anticoagulation

- **Minimum duration**: 3 months for all patients with PICC-DVT [^114tREFd].
- **Extended therapy**: Continue as long as the catheter remains in place or if cancer is active, with periodic reassessment [^113tE5sk] [^117D9sTx].
- **Catheter removal**: If the catheter is removed and no active cancer, stop anticoagulation after 3 months [^notfound].

---

## Catheter management

Keep the catheter if it is **functional, well-positioned, and noninfected** [^113p3TBg]; **remove** if infected, malfunctioning, or no longer needed [^113AhLwo].

---

## Special considerations

- **Thrombolysis**: Not routinely recommended; consider only in severe cases with limb-threatening ischemia [^116AqaQD].
- **IVC filters**: Not recommended unless anticoagulation is contraindicated [^1167MBZy].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Anticoagulation**: Indicated for PICC-DVT [^114tREFd].
- **LMWH**: Preferred in cancer patients [^113cLW6N].
- **DOACs or VKA**: Acceptable in non-cancer patients [^114E5vVk].
- **Duration**: Minimum 3 months; extend if catheter remains or cancer is active [^112geCkt] [^113tE5sk].
- **Catheter**: Keep if functional and noninfected; remove if infected or malfunctioning [^113p3TBg] [^114QbRvu].

---

CHEST recommends **anticoagulation for PICC-DVT**, with LMWH preferred in cancer and DOACs or VKA in non-cancer patients, for at least 3 months, extending if the catheter remains or cancer is active; remove the catheter only if infected or malfunctioning.

## References

### Association of anaesthetists guidelines: safe vascular access 2025 [^114tREFd]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The presence of a CVAD is a major predisposition to thrombosis, with PICCs having a higher incidence than other central venous catheters. Thrombosis is avoided using an insertion technique designed to limit damage to the vein, including ultrasound guidance; choice of a catheter with the smallest calibre possible; minimising the catheter‐to‐vein ratio; and positioning the tip of the catheter at or near to the cavo‐atrial junction. The femoral vein has a higher rate of thrombosis than the internal jugular vein and axillary/subclavian vein. The evidence for relative thrombosis rates between the internal jugular vein and axillary/subclavian vein is equivocal.

Left‐sided catheters may have a higher rate of thrombosis than right‐sided catheters. Peripherally inserted central catheters have a higher rate of venous thrombosis than centrally inserted catheters. In general, for catheter‐related central venous thrombosis, if the catheter is still required, in a good position, not infected, working and the limb is not threatened, then the line can be left in situ and the patient should be anticoagulated; local protocols should be developed. Anticoagulation for at least 3 months is recommended.

### 2008 SOR guidelines for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis associated with central venous catheters in patients with cancer: report from the working group [^111DFQS8]. Annals of Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In view of the lack of recommendations on central venous catheter (CVC)-associated thrombosis in cancer patients, we established guidelines according to the well-standardized Standards, Options and Recommendations methodology.

Material and Methods

A literature review (1990–2007) on CVC-associated thrombosis was carried out. The guidelines were developed on the basis of the corresponding levels of evidence derived from analysis of the 36 of 175 publications selected. They were then peer reviewed by 65 independent experts.

Results

For the prevention of CVC-associated thrombosis, the distal tip of the CVC should be placed at the junction between the superior cava vein and right atrium; anticoagulants are not recommended. Treatment of CVC-associated thrombosis should be based on the prolonged use of low-molecular weight heparins. Maintenance of the catheter is justified if it is mandatory, functional, in the right position, and not infected, with a favorable clinical evolution under close monitoring; anticoagulant treatment should then be continued as long as the catheter is present.

Conclusions

Several rigorous studies do not support the use of anticoagulants for the prevention of CVC-associated thrombosis. Treatment of CVC-associated thrombosis relies on the same principles as those applied in the treatment of established thrombosis in cancer patients.

Treatment of catheter-associated DVT

Manifestations include failure to draw blood from the port or failure of infusion. Thrombolytic therapy has been described to reverse these complications. All these complications may delay the chemotherapy course. Management of catheter-associated thrombosis has not been well studied in patients with cancer. A prospective study looking at the use of anticoagulation for CRT in patients with cancer found no recurrent VTE and three cases of major bleeding in 74 patients with cancer who were treated with 5–7 days of LMWH followed by warfarin for 3 months. After 3 months, 57% of patients had functional catheters, and the remaining patients had their catheters removed for reasons other than progressive thrombosis or device failure. Catheter-associated thrombosis is thought to be associated with a low risk of recurrent VTE and post-thrombotic syndrome. Thus, venous catheters should be removed only in select situations, such as when the catheter is defective or no longer needed. Although malignancy is a risk factor for CRT, the main reason and determinant for CRT is the placement of the catheter tip high in the superior vena cava. Placement of the catheter tip high in the superior vena cava results in a higher incidence of thrombosis than when the catheter tip is placed low in the superior vena cava.

The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis guidelines currently recommend that patients with cancer with catheter-associated thrombosis should be treated with therapeutic anticoagulation for 3 months. In patients with cancer with catheter-associated thrombosis, although LMWH is the suggested agent, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) can also be used given the lack of direct comparative studies. Furthermore, CVCs can be kept in place if they are functional, well positioned and not infected. Currently, there is no standardised anticoagulation duration, whether the catheter is kept or removed.

The European Society for Medical Oncology recommends anticoagulation with LMWH, VKAs or LMWH followed by VKAs for 3–6 months. If CVC is no longer needed or long-term anticoagulation is contraindicated, a short course of 3–5 days is advised. CVC removal is only required in cases of concomitant DVT, sepsis or a non-functioning line.

Remarks: Initial parenteral anticoagulation is given before dabigatran and edoxaban, is not given before rivaroxaban and apixaban, and is overlapped with VKA therapy.

The selection of a prophylaxis regimen to prevent symptomatic pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is a balance between efficacy and safety. The latest American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline recommended that either chemoprophylaxis or mechanical prophylaxis be used after total joint arthroplasty but did not recommend specific agents. However, the latest evidence-based American College of Chest Physicians guideline recommended a variety of chemoprophylaxis and mechanical agents for a minimum of 10 to 14 days after total joint arthroplasty. Risk stratification is the key to the selection of the appropriate prophylaxis regimen for the individual patient, but the optimal risk stratification protocol still needs to be developed.

Key Points for Practice
- In-hospital and home treatment of PE provide similar outcomes, although home treatment of DVT produces better outcomes.
- After primary DOAC treatment for three to six months, decisions for indefinite anticoagulation depend on risk factors associated with initial VTE.
- When VTE is unprovoked or associated with chronic factors, indefinite anticoagulation reduces recurrent VTE with a slightly increased risk of major bleeding. MEDICATION Although direct oral anticoagulant treatment has similar effects on mortality and subsequent VTE risk as vitamin K antagonists, the risk of major bleeding is lower using DOACs. DOAC treatment appears to reduce cost by eliminating monitoring requirements. Patients who have antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or morbid obesity, or who have had bariatric surgery, are poor candidates for DOAC treatment. No particular DOAC is recommended.

After VTE that is unprovoked or provoked by a chronic factor, indefinite anticoagulation should be considered. For unprovoked VTE, indefinite anticoagulation with a DOAC reduces recurrent PE and DVT, although with an increase in major bleeding. Although aspirin reduces long-term VTE risk, anticoagulation is more effective. Aspirin does not definitively reduce bleeding risk compared with anticoagulants but does increase the risk of recurrent PE and recurrent DVT. Limited study suggests that indefinite treatment with lower doses of DOACs does not reduce bleeding and recurrent VTE compared with standard dosing. Recommendations from these groups differ somewhat. The ACCP recommends three months of primary treatment for VTE, whereas the American Society of Hematology recommends between three and six months.

1 ACCP guidelines support aspirin for unprovoked VTE if anticoagulation is stopped because they found bleeding risk with aspirin was similar to no treatment, whereas the American Society of Hematology recommends against aspirin because they found bleeding risk with aspirin was similar to that with anticoagulants. 1 Although the ACCP guidelines are four years older, this difference is likely based on different interpretations of uncertain evidence.

### Updated American College of Chest Physicians guideline… [^1167MBZy]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Bottom Line The guideline covers a lot of ground. Key updates include a clear preference for direct oral anti-coagulants, including in patients with cancer, and low-dose apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended-phase anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked VTE. There is greater leeway for observation only of selected patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism or isolated distal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and outpatient treatment of selected patients with PE. Synopsis The latest update to the American College of Chest Physicians guideline regarding antithrombotic therapy for VTE adds four new recommendations and updates eight others. The authors identified an initiation phase when anticoagulants are first given, a treatment phase of three months, and an extended phase for selected patients beyond three months.

For patients with acute isolated distal DVT, the guidelines recommend two weeks of serial imaging, with anticoagulation only if the DVT extends or the patient has severe symptoms or risk factors for extension. A direct oral anticoagulant is recommended as first-line therapy. An exception should be made for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, for whom warfarin is recommended during the treatment phase. Extended-phase low-dose anticoagulation with apixaban, 2. 5 mg twice daily, or rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily, is recommended for all patients with unprovoked VTE. This has only been studied for two to four years, so extending anticoagulation beyond that is of uncertain benefit. Aspirin is recommended when patients discontinue extended-phase anticoagulation.

For patients with PE, thrombolytics are recommended only for patients with hypotension initially or who deteriorate clinically, assuming they do not have high bleeding risk. For those with a high bleeding risk or for those whom thrombolysis was ineffective, catheter-assisted thrombus removal is recommended. Inferior vena cava filters are recommended only for patients with DVT who have a contraindication to anticoagulation. For patients with cerebral vein or venous sinus thrombosis, anticoagulation is recommended. Compression stockings are not recommended for patients with acute DVT.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111CRN3P]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the leg or pulmonary embolism (PE) without cancer — anticoagulant selection: For long-term (first 3 months) therapy, we suggest dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (all Grade 2B), and for patients not treated with these agents, we suggest VKA therapy over LMWH (Grade 2C). Remarks specify that initial parenteral anticoagulation is given before dabigatran and edoxaban, is not given before rivaroxaban and apixaban, and is overlapped with VKA therapy, and in patients with VTE and cancer ("cancer-associated thrombosis"), we still suggest LMWH over VKA.

Values and preferences in AT9 recommendations — each chapter includes a summary, quantitative wherever possible, of the key values and preferences, and when judgments are particularly relevant or controversial, explicit statements accompany individual recommendations. Because studies showed extensive heterogeneity of patient values and preferences, the developers mandated circumspection in making strong recommendations and "restricted strong recommendations to situations in which the desirable consequences of an intervention substantially and convincingly outweighed the undesirable consequences (or the reverse)" and to unusual situations in which values and preferences are relatively uniform.

### Low incidence of pulmonary embolism associated with upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis [^1156Hy71]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Most recent Chest 2008 guidelines counsel at least 3 months of anticoagulation for acute upper-extremity deep venous thrombosis (UEDVT). These guidelines are inconsistently followed, perhaps owing to relatively limited information regarding clinical outcomes among patients with UEDVT. Our institution maintains an UEDVT registry of consecutively encountered patients with sonographically confirmed UEDVT. We analyzed patient characteristics, treatment, and outcomes among these patients.

Methods

Between April 2005 and November 2008, 300 consecutively encountered peripheral vascular laboratory patients with UEDVTs were identified. Data on UEDVT sonographic characteristics, patient demographics, anticoagulation treatment, pulmonary embolism (PE) incidence and diagnostic modality, hemorrhagic complications, and mortality were then extracted.

Results

Among the 300 patients, there was deep venous obstruction in the distal innominate (n = 69), internal jugular (n = 146), subclavian (n = 161), axillary (n = 107), and brachial (n = 91) veins. Two hundred forty-six patients (82%) had UEDVTs identified as clearly acute or acute on chronic, based on sonographic appearance. Most patients with UEDVTs were symptomatic (n = 265, 88%). One hundred six patients had documented malignancy (35%), 92 were postoperative or trauma patients (31%), and 76 patients were obese (body mass index: > 30, 25%). Additionally, 240 patients had associated or previous indwelling central venous lines or leads (80%). One hundred twenty-eight patients (43%) were initially anticoagulated with heparin, whereas 121 of these patients were converted to warfarin therapy (40%) for variable lengths of time. One hundred sixty-seven patients were not treated with anticoagulation (56%), of whom 16 had documented contraindication to anticoagulation. Although the anticoagulated subset of patients tended to be younger, the decision to anticoagulate patients correlated significantly with the sonographically documented acute nature of the deep venous thrombosis, and its extent. Six patients (2%) suffered PE in association with their UEDVT diagnosis. There was no PE-related mortality. However, among anticoagulated UEDVT patients, there were four patients who suffered intracranial hemorrhage resulting in three deaths, and an additional three patients who required rehospitalization for upper gastrointestinal (n = 2) or stomal (n = 1) hemorrhage.

Conclusions

Anticoagulation therapy is inconsistently used to treat UEDVT and most often used for patients with multiple vein segments involved and with sonographically acute UEDVT components. However, regardless of the decision to anticoagulate, the incidence of PE attributable to UEDVT is small (2%), regardless of treatment with anticoagulation. Given the observed mortality associated with anticoagulation in this fragile patient cohort, the risk-benefit analysis for anticoagulation does not favor routine anticoagulation among these patients.

### Interventional treatment of venous thromboembolism: a review [^1142wpfL]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is the third most common cardiovascular disease after coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in the general population. Full dose anticoagulation is the standard therapy for VTE, both for the acute and the long-term phase. The latest guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians recommend treatment with a full-dose of unfractioned heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or thrombolysis for most patients with objectively confirmed VTE. Catheter-guided thrombolysis and trombosuction are interventional approaches that should be used only in selected populations; interruption of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with a filter can be performed to prevent life-threatening PE in patients with VTE and contraindications to anticoagulant treatment, bleeding complications during antithrombotic treatment, or VTE recurrences despite optimal anticoagulation. In this review we summarize the currently available literature regarding interventional approaches for VTE treatment (vena cava filters, catheter-guided thrombolysis, thrombosuction) and we discuss current evidences on their efficacy and safety. Moreover, the appropriate indications for their use in daily clinical practice are reviewed.

### Clinical challenges in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis: Canadian expert consensus recommendations [^111E5qwe]. Current Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for catheter-related thrombosis, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, CCG-CAT 2015 guidelines recommend to treat catheter-related cancer-associated DVT if the thrombus involves the deep veins, such as the axillary and subclavian, or more proximal veins.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected upper extremity deep vein thrombosis [^113xMwQN]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

This publication includes the appropriate imaging modalities to assess suspected deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremities. Ultrasound duplex Doppler is the most appropriate imaging modality to assess upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis. It is a noninvasive test, which can be performed at the bedside and used for serial evaluations. Ultrasound can also directly identify thrombus by visualizing echogenic material in the vein and by lack of compression of the vein walls from manual external pressure. It can indirectly identify thrombus from altered blood-flow patterns. It is most appropriate in the evaluation of veins peripheral to the brachiocephalic vein. CT venography and MR venography are not first-line imaging tests, but are appropriate to assess the central venous structures, or to assess the full range of venous structures from the hand to the right atrium. Catheter venography is appropriate if therapy is required. Radionuclide venography and chest radiography are usually not appropriate to assess upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113cAQFs]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We update recommendations on 12 topics that were in the 9th edition of these guidelines, and address 3 new topics.

Methods

We generate strong (Grade 1) and weak (Grade 2) recommendations based on high- (Grade A), moderate- (Grade B), and low- (Grade C) quality evidence.

Results

For VTE and no cancer, as long-term anticoagulant therapy, we suggest dabigatran (Grade 2B), rivaroxaban (Grade 2B), apixaban (Grade 2B), or edoxaban (Grade 2B) over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy, and suggest VKA therapy over low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; Grade 2C). For VTE and cancer, we suggest LMWH over VKA (Grade 2B), dabigatran (Grade 2C), rivaroxaban (Grade 2C), apixaban (Grade 2C), or edoxaban (Grade 2C). We have not changed recommendations for who should stop anticoagulation at 3 months or receive extended therapy. For VTE treated with anticoagulants, we recommend against an inferior vena cava filter (Grade 1B). For DVT, we suggest not using compression stockings routinely to prevent PTS (Grade 2B). For subsegmental pulmonary embolism and no proximal DVT, we suggest clinical surveillance over anticoagulation with a low risk of recurrent VTE (Grade 2C), and anticoagulation over clinical surveillance with a high risk (Grade 2C). We suggest thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism with hypotension (Grade 2B), and systemic therapy over catheter-directed thrombolysis (Grade 2C). For recurrent VTE on a non-LMWH anticoagulant, we suggest LMWH (Grade 2C); for recurrent VTE on LMWH, we suggest increasing the LMWH dose (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

Of 54 recommendations included in the 30 statements, 20 were strong and none was based on high-quality evidence, highlighting the need for further research.

### New antithrombotic drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115mL15Y]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

New antithrombotic drugs — scope and clinical context are outlined: the article "focuses on new antithrombotic drugs that are in or are entering phase 3 clinical testing", notes development was driven by limitations of existing agents and covers drugs "focusing primarily on those in phase 2 or 3 clinical testing", with advances mainly in antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants while "the development of new fibrinolytic agents has lagged". Arterial and venous thrombosis are highlighted as major causes of morbidity and mortality; arterial thrombosis causes myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and limb gangrene, and venous thrombosis includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) that "can be fatal or can lead to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension". Arterial thrombi form under high shear as "platelet aggregates held together by small amounts of fibrin", guiding strategies that "focus mainly on drugs that block platelet function" while also using anticoagulants to prevent cardioembolic events in atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves. Venous thrombi form under low shear and are "composed mainly of fibrin and trapped RBCs and contain relatively few platelets", consistent with anticoagulants being "the mainstay for the prevention and treatment of VTE". Fibrinolytic therapy roles are specified: fibrinolytics are used for rapid restoration of flow in acute MI without primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and for acute ischemic stroke, and "systemic or catheter-directed fibrinolytic therapy is used for treatment of massive PE and for management of selected patients with submassive PE", with catheter-directed therapy used in some patients with extensive iliofemoral DVT.

### Percutaneous implantation of peripherally inserted totally implantable venous access systems in the forearm in adolescent patients [^116bwSzR]. Pediatric Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The impact of the implantation site and thus catheter length on the clinical outcome has revealed different, sometimes contradicting results. In this context, Fallon et al. found higher rates of catheter migration and the need for operative revision when placed in a lateral inframammary position compared to a subclavicular or medial inframammary position. The authors hypothesized that the longer catheter length and the devices´ exposure to higher movement rates increase the risk for catheter displacement. In contrast, other large-scale retrospective studies revealed overall complication rates in peripherally inserted port systems in the forearm not exceeding those in chest ports.

A study published in 2002 found that longer catheter lengths and smaller diameters in peripherally inserted port systems are associated with higher rates of deep venous thrombosis and thrombotic catheter dysfunction. Another study revealed port catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis to be a common finding on magnetic resonance venography in pediatric patients with cancer, with a thrombosis rate of 39.5%. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that most of the reported deep vein thromboses remained clinically asymptomatic. In our study, investigation of port systems for thrombotic complications was not performed routinely, only in cases of malfunction or where there was clinical suspicion of thrombosis. Nor did we routinely perform pre-interventional ultrasound to identify unknown thrombosis, since subclinical thromboses are quite rare in children and adolescent patients. Instead, we evaluated history of thrombosis, as well as factors that could potentially increase the risk for thrombosis, during the informed consent conversation, and analyzed existing CT or MRI imaging for direct or indirect signs of thrombosis. With a total of 14.3%, the rate of thrombotic complications found in our cohort might be judged as high. However, it should be noted that, unlike other studies, catheter tip thromboses were also rated as thrombotic complications, even if the management did not include the systems´ removal. Another study from 2014 analyzing thrombotic complications in pediatric patients with pectoral port systems revealed symptomatic thrombosis in 20% of their patients. Apart from the catheter access site, (with increased rates of thrombotic complications with the catheter in a subclavian position), further risk factors were not identified. Pharmacological prophylaxis did not appear to influence the thrombosis rate and there are no guidelines/standards recommending the regular use of any anticoagulation regimens to prevent catheter-related thrombosis. A differential diagnosis of thrombus formation at the catheter tip is the presence of a fibrin sheath. The latter is indicated by difficulty aspirating blood from the catheter, whereas flushing/injection of fluid still remains possible.

### Central catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis in cancer: clinical course, prophylaxis, treatment [^112n8r1c]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

CRT is a moderately common clinical scenario in the oncological patient bearing a CVC. Although some devices are associated with greater risk, these patients harbour the risk of thrombosis regardless of the type of device used. Several factors relating both to technical aspects, patient and pathological characteristics may predispose to its occurrence; but until more studies on the subject are executed, their role and impact will remain unclear. Figure 1 depicts the most important risk factors found in association with CRT.

What this study adds

Figure 1
Risk factors featuring the strongest and/or most consistent association with CRT in the context of malignancy. CRT, catheter-related thrombosis; CVC, central venous catheter; DVT, deep vein thrombosis; PICCs, peripherally inserted central catheters.

Despite its frequency, the optimal management strategy when facing this complication is still undetermined. A summary of the possible treatment strategies is provided in figure 2. It is not clear whether thromboprophylaxis is effective and/or required for CRT prevention. The existing evidence seems to suggest the best alternative for treatment in most cases is anticoagulation without CVC removal as long as the line is functional and free from infection and the benefits of anticoagulation outweigh the risks. Regarding the choice of anticoagulant, most seem to favour LMWH but the evidence about which agent to use is inconclusive. More research on the efficacy and safety of LMWH, VKA and direct oral anticoagulant, as well as studies comparing these drugs, is required in order to make an evidence-based decision.

Peripherally inserted central catheters

PICCs have been commonly placed in patients for anticancer therapies. They offer many advantages in avoiding mechanical complications such as pneumothorax and haemorrhage secondary to puncture. PICCs are non-tunnelled, central catheters inserted through a peripheral vein of the arm; they are 50–60 cm long and are usually made of silicone or second or third-generation polyurethane. A potential problem is that they deteriorate patients' veins and can obstruct vessels in the long term that can delay chemotherapy cycles.

Their duration depends on the technique of insertion, stabilisation of the venous access device, patient compliance and nurse competence in the maintenance of the device. It is very useful in the haematology and oncology setting, especially for ambulatory therapy, because they can be safely used even in patients with extremely low platelet counts or at high risk of haemorrhage.

PICCs are currently being used extensively in clinical practice due to their multiple benefits, featuring a simple insertion procedure, cost-effectiveness and greater patient comfort. Nonetheless, these devices have disadvantages as well, one of those being an increased risk of CRT. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported an association with an OR of 2.55 between PICCs and VTE, the risk increases even more in the subgroup of patients with cancer with an OR of 6.67.

One study showed no significant difference in complication rates, including thrombotic events, in which PICC and non-tunnelled devices were compared. According to the CDC guideline, PICCs had a lower rate of infection than NTCs, and totally implantable catheters had the lowest risk of CRBSI. A systematic review found that although PICCs were associated with a lower risk of CRBSI than other CVCs in outpatients, hospitalised patients might be just as likely to experience CRBSI with PICCs as with other CVCs.

### Association of infectious disease physician approval of peripherally inserted central catheter with appropriateness and complications [^116FNHZV]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are central venous catheters used ubiquitously in medical care. Compared with central venous catheters placed in the neck or chest, PICCs are placed in upper-extremity veins in adults and consequently avoid many of the immediate insertion complications associated with device placement. As PICC use has increased, however, reports of complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), have emerged. One strategy to reduce the risk of PICC-related complications is to consider the appropriateness of PICC use, including aspects such as device characteristics and use of alternatives. For example, use of single-lumen (vs multilumen) devices can reduce the risk of DVT or CLABSI. Similarly, use of PICCs with a smaller cross-sectional diameter (ie, catheter gauge) is known to be associated with fewer thrombotic complications. Furthermore, because safer alternative devices are available, PICC use should be avoided if access is needed for a brief period (ie, ≤ 5 days) or for patients with chronic kidney disease. Collectively, these findings have led to Choosing Wisely recommendationsand appropriateness criteriato inform and benchmark PICC use.

One of the most common indications for PICC insertion is intravenous antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, infectious disease (ID) physicians are often involved in decision-making related to PICC use. If they are consulted early, ID physicians may be able to prevent inappropriate PICC use — for example, for patients who could have their antimicrobials discontinued or switched to oral therapy. Similarly, because ID physicians often treat CLABSIs, they may be more likely to recommend interventions to reduce the risk of CLABSI, such as the use of single-lumen PICCs or antimicrobial catheters in patients who are at high risk of adverse events. Despite this, little is known about the association of ID physician approval with PICC appropriateness and outcomes. Because device complications are common in patients receiving intravenous antimicrobials, there may be an opportunity to improve patient safety by engaging ID physicians prior to PICC insertion.

The Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety Consortium (HMS) is a statewide quality collaborative aimed at preventing adverse events in hospitalized medical patients. Since 2015, the HMS has collected detailed data on PICCs, allowing for assessment of PICC appropriateness, and patient outcomes. We sought to evaluate whether ID physician approval of PICC use prior to placement for intravenous antimicrobials is associated with appropriate device use and fewer complications.

Importance

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common, potentially lethal condition with acute morbidity.

Objective

To review the etiology of VTE and the 3 phases of VTE treatment: acute (first 5–10 days), long-term (from end of acute treatment to 3–6 months), and extended (beyond 3–6 months).

Evidence Review

Cochrane reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials, as well as other clinical trials for topics not covered by the former, were reviewed. Literature searches using broad terms were used to find meta-analyses published in the last 15 years. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Therapy Guidelines was used to supplement the literature search. Guidelines from specialty organizations were consulted when relevant. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health was searched for relevant cost-effectiveness studies. We also searched our own literature database of 8386 articles for relevant research.

Findings

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) along with with vitamin K antagonists and the benefits and proven safety of ambulation have allowed for outpatient management of most cases of DVT in the acute phase. Development of new oral anticoagulants further simplifies acute-phase treatment and 2 oral agents can be used as monotherapy, avoiding the need for LMWH. Patients with PE can also be treated in the acute phase as outpatients, a decision dependent on prognosis and severity of PE. Thrombolysis is best reserved for severe VTE; inferior vena cava filters, ideally the retrievable variety, should be used when anticoagulation is contraindicated. In general, DVT and PE patients require 3 months of treatment with anticoagulants, with options including LMWH, vitamin K antagonists, or direct factor Xa or direct factor IIa inhibitors. After this time, decisions for further treatment are based on balancing the risk of VTE recurrence, determined by etiology of the VTE (transient risk factors, unprovoked or malignancy associated), against the risk of major hemorrhage from treatment. Better prediction tools for major hemorrhage are needed. Experience with new oral anticoagulants as acute, long-term, and extended therapy options is limited as yet, but as a class they appear to be safe and effective for all phases of treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

The mainstay of VTE treatment is anticoagulation, while interventions such as thrombolysis and inferior vena cava filters are reserved for limited circumstances. Multiple therapeutic modes and options exist for VTE treatment with small but nonetheless important differential effects to consider. Anticoagulants will probably always increase bleeding risk, necessitating tailored treatment strategies that must incorporate etiology, risk, benefit, cost, and patient preference. Although great progress has been made, further study to understand individual patient risks is needed to make ideal treatment decisions.

### Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in patients with solid tumors: a narrative review and clinical guidance for daily care [^113WMEsm]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Central venous access devices (CVADs) including central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are essential in the treatment of cancer. Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) is the most frequent non-infectious complication associated with the use of central lines. The development of CRT may cause to delays in oncologic treatment and increase morbidity leading to potentially life-threatening complications. Several local and systemic risk factors are associated with the development of CRT and should be taken into account to prevent CRT by standardizing appropriate catheter placement and maintenance. The use of primary pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in order to avoid CRT is not routinely recommended, although it can be considered in selected cases. Recommendations for the management of established CRT are based on the extrapolation of anticoagulation for lower limb venous thrombosis. The present review summarizes the current evidence and recommendations for the prevention and management of CRT and identifies areas that require further research.

### Peripherally inserted central catheters inserted with current best practices have low deep vein thrombosis and central line-associated bloodstream infection risk compared with centrally inserted central catheters: a contemporary meta-analysis [^111yjbme]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripherally inserted central catheters and centrally inserted central catheters have numerous benefits but can be associated with risks. This meta-analysis compared central catheters for relevant clinical outcomes using recent studies more likely to coincide with practice guidelines.

Methods

Several databases, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and EBM Reviews were searched for articles (2006–2018) that compared central catheters. Analyses were limited to peer-reviewed studies comparing peripherally inserted central catheters to centrally inserted central catheters for deep vein thrombosis and/or central line-associated bloodstream infections. Subgroup, sensitivity analyses, and patient-reported measures were included. Risk ratios, incidence rate ratios, and weighted event risks were reported. Study quality assessment was conducted using Newcastle-Ottawa and Cochrane Risk of Bias scales.

Results

Of 4609 screened abstracts, 31 studies were included in these meta-analyses. Across studies, peripherally inserted central catheters were protective for central line-associated bloodstream infection (incidence rate ratio = 0.52, 95% confidence interval: 0.30–0.92), with consistent results across subgroups. Peripherally inserted central catheters were associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (risk ratio = 2.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.47–2.94); however, smaller diameter and single-lumen peripherally inserted central catheters were no longer associated with increased risk. The absolute risk of deep vein thrombosis was calculated to 2.3% and 3.9% for smaller diameter peripherally inserted central catheters and centrally inserted central catheters, respectively. On average, peripherally inserted central catheter patients had 11.6 more catheter days than centrally inserted central catheter patients (p = 0.064). Patient outcomes favored peripherally inserted central catheters.

Conclusion

When adhering to best practices, this study demonstrated that concerns related to peripherally inserted central catheters and deep vein thrombosis risk are minimized. Dramatic changes to clinical practice over the last 10years have helped to address past issues with central catheters and complication risk. Given the lower rate of complications when following current guidelines, clinicians should prioritize central line choice based on patient therapeutic needs, rather than fear of complications. Future research should continue to consider contemporary literature over antiquated data, such that it recognizes the implications of best practices in modern central catheterization.

### Peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombosis rate in modern vascular access era-when insertion technique matters: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111GwrKV]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Technical factors at the moment of catheter insertion might have a role in peripherally inserted central catheter-related thrombotic risk. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to define the actual rate of peripherally inserted central catheter-related symptomatic deep vein thrombosis in patients in whom catheter insertion was performed according to ultrasound guidance, appropriate catheter size choice, and proper verification of tip location.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Only prospective observational studies published in peer-reviewed journals after 2010 up to November 2018 reporting peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep vein thrombosis rate were included. All studies were of adult patients who underwent peripherally inserted central catheter insertion. Results were restricted to those studies which included in their methods ultrasound guidance for venipuncture, catheter tip location, and a catheter size selection strategy. Random-effect meta-analyses and arcsine transformation for binomial data were performed to pool deep vein thrombosis weighted frequencies.

Results

Of the 1441 studies identified, 15 studies involving 5420 patients and 5914 peripherally inserted central catheters fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The weighted frequency of peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep vein thrombosis was 2.4% (95% confidence interval = 1.5–3.3) and remained low in oncologic patients (2.2%, 95% confidence interval = 0.6–3.9). Thrombotic rate was higher in onco-hematologic patients (5.9%, 95% confidence interval = 1.2–10). Considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 74.9) was observed and all studies were considered at high risk of attrition bias.

Conclusions

A proper technique is crucial at the moment of peripherally inserted central catheter insertion. Peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep vein thrombosis rate appears to be low when evidence-based technical factors are taken into consideration during the insertion procedure.

### Central line thrombosis in patients with cancer [^112eRyaP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Central venous catheters are used frequently to care for patients with cancer and often serve as long-term venous access. Catheter-related central venous thrombosis is a serious and common complication in these patients. The incidence of this event ranges from 2 to 40%. Potential risk factors are catheter position, size of the catheter, and perhaps site of insertion. The diagnosis of catheter-associated deep venous thrombosis may be difficult. Doppler ultrasound has a lower accuracy in this setting than it does in symptomatic lower extremity venous thrombosis. No clinical management studies have validated the practice of withholding anticoagulant therapy in patients with a negative Doppler ultrasound. The practice of prophylaxis with low-dose warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin has been recommended, although results from recent studies have called this into question. Larger, prospective, randomized trials with a uniform population of patients or stratification of risk factors will be essential to address this issue further.

Cancer-associated thrombosis initial long-term therapy — In patients with DVT of the leg or PE and cancer, for the first 3 months of anticoagulant therapy, we suggest LMWH over VKA therapy, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, with stated grades of evidence. Remarks clarify that initial parenteral anticoagulation is given before dabigatran and edoxaban, not given before rivaroxaban and apixaban, and is overlapped with VKA therapy.

### Central catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis in cancer: clinical course, prophylaxis, treatment [^117CGg2G]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

A recent Cochrane Database Systematic Review was published that studied the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in people with cancer with a CVC. The evidence was not conclusive for the effect of LMWH compared with no LMWH on mortality, the effect of VKA compared with no VKA on mortality and CRT, and the effect of LMWH compared with VKA on mortality and CRT. They found moderate-certainty evidence that LMWH reduced CRT compared with no LMWH. In considering anticoagulation in patients with cancer with a CVC, the practitioner should assess the potential haemorrhagic complications associated with anticoagulants.

Although most guidelines recommend anticoagulation for the treatment of CRT, the management of CRT with catheter removal alone may be considered for patients with a high risk of bleeding. A recent retrospective review comparing PICC removal alone versus PICC removal plus anticoagulation concluded that catheter removal alone results in significantly less major bleeding events at the expense of a small but significant increase in secondary VTE events and risk of VTE progression. An older retrospective study compared different treatment modalities for CRT: anticoagulation alone, CVC removal and anticoagulation, CVC removal alone and CVC replacement. CRT replacement was the only modality that did not result in a 100% symptom resolution rate, with 4 out of 12 patients presenting persistent symptoms related to thrombosis. If no anticoagulation is being considered, whether central vascular access will be further needed, should be acknowledged.

Other risks of CVCs in patients with cancer

The NTCs in the internal jugular vein or subclavian vein cost less than other CVCs and are used when the chemotherapy process is short. Complications of NTCs were reported more than PICCs and ports.

Additionally, the use of venous ultrasound guidance has increased during venous puncture making CVC placement safer in patients with profound thrombocytopenia. Regarding risk associated with vascular access, the Consensus Guidelines for Periprocedural Management of Coagulation Status and Hemostasis Risk in Percutaneous Image-guided Interventions recommended the transfusion of platelets for any platelet count of less than 50×10 9 /L.

The Dutch guideline (recommends increasing the trigger to 20×10 9 /L in case of fever and to 50×10 9 /L for the use of anticoagulation. The British Committee for Standards in Hematology, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American Association of Blood Banks recommend likewise a more liberal transfusion policy in these conditions, but they do not specify triggers. The same heterogeneity in recommendations is seen in invasive procedures, such as lumbar punctures and insertion and removal of CVCs. Therefore, the decision to transfuse is based on the opinion of the treating physician and may differ significantly.

Prior to the removal of a CVC, 29% used a trigger of 10×10 9 /L, 12% of 20×10 9 /L and 59% used triggers between 30×10 9 /L and 100×10 9 /L. The guideline advises maintaining the trigger of 10×10 9 /L.

A prospective study that assessed haemorrhagic complication in 143 PICC implantations in 101 patients with thrombocytopenic cancer showed that 65% of the procedures were performed with a platelet count 20–50×10 9 /L and 35% had lower than 20×10 9 /L. No major haemorrhage was observed. Minor oozing was observed in six implantations and mild haematoma in two for a total of eight minor haemorrhagic adverse events (5.5%). In patients with a platelet count < 20×10 9 /L, 1 of 50 (2%) had minor oozing and there were no cases of a minor haematoma. The authors suggest that PICCs in patients with a platelet count between 20×10 9 /L and 50×10 9 /L and lower than 20×10 9 /L are safe even without platelet transfusions, provided that the patient does not have an associated secondary haemostatic abnormality and did not receive drugs that may have affected haemostatic status.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113Xpz9Z]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the 2nd update to the 9th edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.

Methods

We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

Results

The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations, covering aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the 9th edition (2012) or 1st update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modified from the 1st update.

Conclusion

New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.

### Peripherally inserted central catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis: a narrative review [^116MSQ8X]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although common, little is known about factors associated with peripherally inserted central catheter-related deep vein thrombosis (PICC-DVT). To better guide clinicians, we performed a comprehensive literature review to summarize best practices for this condition.

Methods

A systematic search of the literature for studies reporting epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of PICC-DVT was conducted. Algorithms for diagnosis and management were compiled using available evidence.

Results

The incidence of PICC-DVT varied between 2% and 75% according to study population, testing modality and threshold for diagnosis. Studies evaluating the diagnostic utility of clinical symptoms suggested that these were neither sensitive nor specific for PICC-DVT; conversely, ultrasonography had excellent sensitivity and specificity and is recommended as the initial diagnostic test. Although more specific, contrast venography should be reserved for cases with high clinical probability and negative ultrasound findings. Centrally positioned, otherwise functional and clinically necessary PICCs need not be removed despite concomitant DVT. Anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin for at least 3 months represents the mainstay of treatment. The role of pharmacologic prophylaxis and screening for PICC-DVT in the absence of clinical symptoms is unclear at this time.

Conclusions

PICC-DVT is common, costly and morbid. Available evidence provides guidance for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of this condition.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of thrombosis associated with central venous catheters in patients with cancer [^112P5NUk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although long-term indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) and loss of the CVC, there is lack of consensus on management of CVC-related thrombosis (CRT) in cancer patients and heterogeneity in clinical practices worldwide.

Objectives

To establish common international Good Clinical Practices Guidelines (GCPG) for the management of CRT in cancer patients.

Methods

An international working group of experts was set up to develop GCPG according to an evidence-based medicine approach, using the GRADE system.

Results

For the treatment of established CRT in cancer patients, we found no prospective randomized studies, two non-randomized prospective studies and one retrospective study examining the efficacy and safety of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) plus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). One retrospective study evaluated the benefit of CVC removal and two small retrospective studies were on thrombolytic drugs. For the treatment of symptomatic CRT, anticoagulant treatment (AC) is recommended for a minimum of 3 months; in this setting, LMWHs are suggested. VKAs can also be used, in the absence of direct comparisons of these two types of anticoagulants in this setting [Guidance]. The CVC can be kept in place if it is functional, well-positioned and non-infected and there is good resolution under close surveillance; whether the CVC is kept or removed, no standard approach in terms of AC duration has been established [Guidance]. For the prophylaxis of CRT in cancer patients, we found six randomized studies investigating the efficacy and safety of VKA vs. placebo or no treatment, one on the efficacy and safety of unfractionnated heparin, six on the value of LMWH, one double-blind randomized and one non randomized study on thrombolytic drugs and six meta-analyses of AC and CVC thromboprophylaxis. Type of catheter (open-ended like the Hickman(®) catheter vs. closed-ended catheter with a valve like the Groshong(®) catheter), its position (above, below or at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium) and method of placement may influence the onset of CRT on the basis of six retrospective trials, four prospective non-randomized trials, three randomized trials and one meta-analysis. In light of these data: use of AC for routine prophylaxis of CRT is not recommended [1A]; a CVC should be inserted on the right side, in the jugular vein, and distal extremity of the CVC should be located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium [1A].

Conclusion

Dissemination and implementation of these international GCPG for the prevention and treatment of CRT in cancer patients at each national level is a major public health priority, needing worldwide collaboration.

### Central catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis in cancer: clinical course, prophylaxis, treatment [^113AhLwo]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for VTE in patients with cancer recommend anticoagulation for at least 3 months or for as long as the catheter is maintained. There are no specific drug recommendations from the NCCN. The CVC should be removed in case of persistent thrombosis symptoms, infection, dysfunctional line or when the line is no longer needed.

Generally, treatments for these patients may include LMWH bridged to warfarin or LMWH monotherapy, generally without line removal unless it is no longer required, it is defective or infection has been detected.

A retrospective analysis limited to 83 patients with CVC-associated DVT treated with rivaroxaban showed a line failure rate of 3.6% and a major bleeding rate of only 2.4% leading the authors to conclude that rivaroxaban was a safe and effective option.

In a prospective study of rivaroxaban for CVC-associated UEDVT in patients with cancer, the authors demonstrated in 70 patients that preservation of line function was 100% at 12 weeks. The risk of recurrent VTE at 12 weeks was 1.43%, with one episode of fatal PE, and nine patients (12.9%) experienced 11 total bleeding episodes. They concluded that rivaroxaban showed promise in treating CVC-UEDVT in patients with cancer, resulting in preserved line function. However, bleeding rates and a fatal PE on treatment are concerning safety outcomes necessitating further study before rivaroxaban can be recommended.

Another study compared the efficacy and safety profile of rivaroxaban (20 mg/day) with LMWH and VKAs in the treatment of PICC-associated UEDVT. Rivaroxaban led to faster resolution of PICC-associated UEDVT than LMWH/VKAs without any increase in bleeding.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^117DfR4w]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) — catheter-based early thrombus removal efficacy and recommendation are as follows: We suggest percutaneous catheter-based techniques (pharmacologic or pharmacomechanical) as first-line therapy for early thrombus removal in patients meeting the criteria in 1.1 (Grade 2C). Compared with standard anticoagulant therapy, catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolytic therapy is associated with significant reductions in the risks of the postthrombotic syndrome (relative risk [RR], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07–0.48), venous reflux (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09–0.53), and venous obstruction (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17–0.84). These results are consistent with a previous systematic review demonstrating a significant reduction in postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47–0.94) with thrombolytic treatment. Among 103 randomized patients, 6-month patency was significantly better in those who received catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis (64.0% vs 35.8%; p = 0.004), whereas the incidence of femoral vein reflux was similar (60.0% vs 66.0%; p = 0.53).

### Catheter-related thrombosis: lifeline or a pain in the neck? [^114EPhWZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Central venous catheters (CVCs) are used extensively in cancer patients for the administration of therapy and phlebotomy. An important complication of CVCs is the development of catheter-related thrombosis (CRT), which becomes symptomatic in approximately 5% of the patients. Several factors, such as insertion location and position of the catheter tip, increase the risk of CRT. Prevention of CRT with systemic anticoagulant prophylaxis has largely been ineffective. In addition, the optimal diagnostic strategy and anticoagulant treatment are unclear due to the lack of well-designed studies. The most recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend (color) Doppler ultrasound more than venography as the initial diagnostic test in patients with suspected arm thrombosis. Only if the ultrasound is negative and clinical suspicion is high is further testing with D-dimer, serial ultrasound, or venography advocated. In case of CRT, removal of the catheter is not necessary if it is functional and needed for chemotherapy. Anticoagulant treatment of CRT consists of treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists for at least 3 months. Whether long-term treatment with LMWH is more effective than vitamin K antagonists in cancer patients with CRT is unknown, but LMWH may be advocated following the recommendations in lower limb thrombosis and cancer. In addition, the effect of new anticoagulants in CRT has not been studied.

### Systematic review of anticoagulant treatment of catheter-related thrombosis [^111nvEti]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Central venous catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) is a complication seen in patients requiring long-term intravenous access. Treatment of CRT is not standardized and international guidelines for treatment are based on extrapolation of evidence from lower extremity thrombosis. We performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate if duration of anticoagulation affects the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis, post-thrombotic syndrome, or major hemorrhage. We searched PubMed, Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, and ACP Journal club for studies of CRT treated with anticoagulation. Of 1648 titles and abstracts, 23 studies met our inclusion criteria. No randomized trials were identified. Duration of anticoagulation varied from 8 days to more than 6 months. Outcomes of patients with upper extremity thrombosis due to CRT or other etiologies were often combined. The incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome varied between 0 and 75% depending on the definition used. Seven percent of patients with upper extremity thrombosis treated with anticoagulation experienced recurrent deep vein thrombosis and 2.8% experienced pulmonary embolism. Major hemorrhage was reported in 2.8–4.9% of anticoagulated patients. Prospective studies evaluating the optimal duration of anticoagulation in patients with CRT are needed.

### Catheter-related thrombosis: risks, diagnosis, and management [^117SVAyr]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

Symptomatic thromboembolic complications of central venous catheters (CVCs) occur in 5% or less of general oncology patients. Asymptomatic CVC-related thrombi are more common, but their clinical significance is unclear. Thrombotic risk may be increased by primary thrombophilic disorders, especially the factor V G1691A (Leiden) mutation, thrombogenic catheter material, larger catheter diameter and greater number of lumens, catheter tip malposition, left-sided placement, percutaneous or multiple insertion attempts, a previous CVC or preexisting venous obstruction, prothrombotic therapeutic agents, catheter-associated infections, and fibrinous catheter lumen occlusion. Three recent randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trials observed no benefit of routine low-dose warfarin or low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing catheter-associated thrombosis. Nevertheless, thromboprophylaxis may be appropriate and safe for selected high-risk patients. Duplex ultrasound can accurately detect CVC-related thrombi involving the jugular, axillary, distal subclavian, and arm veins. Contrast venographic imaging is required for indeterminate duplex findings and to evaluate the deep central veins and pulmonary arteries. Therapeutic anticoagulation, with or without catheter removal, is indicated for patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism who have no contraindications. Catheter removal alone, with close follow-up, may be sufficient when bleeding risk precludes safe anticoagulation. Approaches to managing catheter-associated thrombosis, including the use of thrombolytic agents, are guided by limited published experience and extrapolation from practices used for lower-extremity DVT. Prospective, randomized, controlled trials are needed to identify the safest and most effective anticoagulant agents, treatment durations, and alternative venous access strategies for cancer patients who develop catheter-associated thrombosis.

### Antithrombotic therapy for venous thromboembolic disease: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^116ceJ2x]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about treatment for venous thromboembolic disease is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see "Grades of Recommendation" chapter). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: for patients with objectively confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend anticoagulant therapy with subcutaneous (SC) low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), monitored IV, or SC unfractionated heparin (UFH), unmonitored weight-based SC UFH, or SC fondaparinux (all Grade 1A). For patients with a high clinical suspicion of DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with anticoagulants while awaiting the outcome of diagnostic tests (Grade 1C). For patients with confirmed PE, we recommend early evaluation of the risks to benefits of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1C); for those with hemodynamic compromise, we recommend short-course thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B); and for those with nonmassive PE, we recommend against the use of thrombolytic therapy (Grade 1B). In acute DVT or PE, we recommend initial treatment with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux for at least 5 days rather than a shorter period (Grade 1C); and initiation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) together with LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux on the first treatment day, and discontinuation of these heparin preparations when the international normalized ratio (INR) is ≥ 2.0 for at least 24 h (Grade 1A). For patients with DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, we recommend treatment with a VKA for 3 months over treatment for shorter periods (Grade 1A). For patients with unprovoked DVT or PE, we recommend treatment with a VKA for at least 3 months (Grade 1A), and that all patients are then evaluated for the risks to benefits of indefinite therapy (Grade 1C). We recommend indefinite anticoagulant therapy for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE and a low risk of bleeding when this is consistent with the patient's preference (Grade 1A), and for most patients with a second unprovoked DVT (Grade 1A). We recommend that the dose of VKA be adjusted to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations (Grade 1A). We recommend at least 3 months of treatment with LMWH for patients with VTE and cancer (Grade 1A), followed by treatment with LMWH or VKA as long as the cancer is active (Grade 1C). For prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after proximal DVT, we recommend use of an elastic compression stocking (Grade 1A). For DVT of the upper extremity, we recommend similar treatment as for DVT of the leg (Grade 1C). Selected patients with lower-extremity (Grade 2B) and upper-extremity (Grade 2C). DVT may be considered for thrombus removal, generally using catheter-based thrombolytic techniques. For extensive superficial vein thrombosis, we recommend treatment with prophylactic or intermediate doses of LMWH or intermediate doses of UFH for 4 weeks (Grade 1B).

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111yR9zX]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

CHEST guideline — subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) with no proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — In patients with subsegmental PE (no involvement of more proximal pulmonary arteries) and no proximal DVT in the legs who have a low risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), we suggest clinical surveillance over anticoagulation (Grade 2C), and in those with high risk for recurrent VTE, we suggest anticoagulation over clinical surveillance (Grade 2C). Remarks specify that US imaging of the deep veins of both legs should be done to exclude proximal DVT, clinical surveillance can be supplemented by serial US imaging of the proximal deep veins of both legs to detect evolving DVT, and patients and physicians are more likely to opt for clinical surveillance over anticoagulation if there is good cardiopulmonary reserve or a high risk of bleeding. The document notes the evidence supporting these recommendations is low quality because of indirectness and limited ability to predict which patients will have VTE complications without anticoagulation.

### Lessons from French national guidelines on the treatment of venous thrombosis and central venous catheter thrombosis in cancer patients [^115zewRZ]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Increased prevalence of Venous thromboembolism (VTE), as defined by deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), central venous catheter (CVC) related thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (PE) in cancer patients has become a major therapeutic issue. Considering the epidemiology and each national recommendations on the treatment of VTE in cancer patients, we analysed guidelines implementation in clinical practice. Thrombosis is the second-leading cause of death in cancer patients and cancer is a major risk factor of VTE, due to activation of coagulation, use of long-term CVC, the thrombogenic effects of chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic drugs. Three pivotal trials (CANTHANOX, LITE and CLOT) and several meta-analysis led to recommend the long term (3 to 6 months) use of LMWH during for treating VTE in cancer patients with a high level of evidence. The Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the French "Institut National du Cancer" (INCa), the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCCP) have published specific guidelines for health care providers regarding the prevention and treatment of cancer-associated VTE. Critical appraisal of these guidelines, difficulties in implementation of prophylaxis regimen, tolerance and cost effectiveness of long term use of LMWH may account for large heterogenity in daily clinical practice. Homogenization of these guidelines in international consensus using an adapted independent methodological approach followed by educational and active implementation strategies at each national level would be very valuable to improve the care of VTE in cancer patients.

Evidence-Based Answer Best medical practices for the initial treatment of uncomplicated DVT include anticoagulation, compression stockings, and physical exercise. In the management of DVT, adding an antiplatelet agent to standard practices does not show clear benefits or cause significant adverse effects.
1. 2 Anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulants, warfarin, or heparin is part of the standard initial treatment for DVT. Secondary treatment options include thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, inferior vena cava filter, angioplasty, and stenting. Several studies have been done to assess whether adding antiplatelet agents to standard anticoagulation decreases the risk of recurrent VTE and mortality.

All studies used best medical practices or best medical practices plus placebo for comparison. Best medical practices were sometimes mentioned in the studies but were not comprehensively defined. Each comparison investigated the effects of antiplatelets on the recurrence of DVT, PE, mortality, and adverse effects. Four studies used various antiplatelet agents: dipyridamole; aspirin, 300 mg four times per day; sulfinpyrazone, 800 mg per day; and indobufen, 200 mg twice per day. The meta-analysis did not reveal a statistically significant benefit for the outcomes of mortality or progression to PE, and there was no increased risk of bleeding or other adverse effects in patients with chronic DVT who were receiving antiplatelet therapy. Use of antiplatelet therapy in addition to best practices decreased the risk of recurrent VTE compared with placebo.

However, when only PE was studied, antiplatelet agents did not achieve a difference between the groups. The 2021 CHEST guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians for the management of VTE recommend the use of direct oral anticoagulants as first-line treatment for acute DVT or PE. 3 For patients with VTE and otherwise stable cardiovascular disease, the CHEST guidelines suggest suspending aspirin therapy when initiating anticoagulation. The combination of anticoagulation plus aspirin does not seem to decrease mortality risk.

CHEST guideline on unprovoked DVT of the leg (isolated distal or proximal) or pulmonary embolism (PE) — we recommend treatment with anticoagulation for at least 3 months over treatment of a shorter duration (Grade 1B), and we recommend treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over treatment of a longer time-limited period (eg, 6, 12, or 24 months) (Grade 1B). After 3 months of treatment, patients with unprovoked DVT of the leg or PE should be evaluated for the risk-benefit ratio of extended therapy.

Selection of catheter insertion site — central venous access evidence and recommendations indicate that randomized controlled trials report the femoral site has a higher risk of thrombotic complications in adult patients, and one randomized trial concludes thrombosis risk is higher with internal jugular than subclavian catheters, while other comparisons show equivocal findings; consultants and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) members strongly agree with the recommendation to determine site selection based on clinical need and practitioner judgment, experience, and skill, and agree with the recommendations to select an upper body insertion site to minimize the risk of thrombotic complications relative to the femoral site.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to anticoagulation after IVC filter placement, ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider administering a conventional course of anticoagulant therapy in patients with acute proximal DVT of the leg and an IVC filter inserted as an alternative to anticoagulation, if the risk of bleeding resolves.

Acute pulmonary embolism with hypotension — In patients with acute PE associated with hypotension and who have (i) a high bleeding risk, (ii) failed systemic thrombolysis, or (iii) shock that is likely to cause death before systemic thrombolysis can take effect (eg, within hours), if appropriate expertise and resources are available, we suggest catheter-assisted thrombus removal over no such intervention (Grade 2C). Catheter-assisted thrombus removal refers to mechanical interventions, with or without catheter directed thrombolysis.

### Antithrombotic therapy in children: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^112KRfkb]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article about antithrombotic therapy in children is part of the 7th American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh the risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this article are the following. In neonates with venous thromboembolism (VTE), we suggest treatment with either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or radiographic monitoring and anticoagulation therapy if extension occurs (Grade 2C). We suggest that clinicians not use thrombolytic therapy for treating VTE in neonates, unless there is major vessel occlusion that is causing the critical compromise of organs or limbs (Grade 2C). For children (ie, > 2 months of age) with an initial VTE, we recommend treatment with i.v. heparin or LMWH (Grade 1C+). We suggest continuing anticoagulant therapy for idiopathic thromboembolic events (TEs) for at least 6 months using vitamin K antagonists (target international normalized ratio [INR], 2.5; INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) or alternatively LMWH (Grade 2C). We suggest that clinicians not use thrombolytic therapy routinely for VTE in children (Grade 2C). For neonates and children requiring cardiac catheterization (CC) via an artery, we recommend i.v. heparin prophylaxis (Grade 1A). We suggest the use of heparin doses of 100 to 150 U/kg as a bolus and that further doses may be required in prolonged procedures (both Grade 2 B). For prophylaxis for CC, we recommend against aspirin therapy (Grade 1B). For neonates and children with peripheral arterial catheters in situ, we recommend the administration of low-dose heparin through a catheter, preferably by continuous infusion to prolong the catheter patency (Grade 1A). For children with a peripheral arterial catheter-related TE, we suggest the immediate removal of the catheter (Grade 2C). For prevention of aortic thrombosis secondary to the use of umbilical artery catheters in neonates, we suggest low-dose heparin infusion (1 to 5 U/h) (Grade 2A). In children with Kawasaki disease, we recommend therapy with aspirin in high doses initially (80 to 100 mg/kg/d during the acute phase, for up to 14 days) and then in lower doses (3 to 5 mg/kg/d for ≥ 7 weeks) [Grade 1C+], as well as therapy with i.v. gammaglobulin within 10 days of the onset of symptoms (Grade 1A).

### The association between PICC use and venous thromboembolism in upper and lower extremities [^114vWidn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Peripherally inserted central catheters are associated with upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis. Whether they also are associated with lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is unknown. We examined the risk of venous thromboembolism in deep veins of the arm, leg, and chest after peripherally inserted central catheter placement.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 76,242 hospitalized medical patients from 48 Michigan hospitals. Peripherally inserted central catheter presence, comorbidities, venous thrombosis risk factors, and thrombotic events within 90 days from hospital admission were ascertained by phone and record review. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to examine the association between peripherally inserted central catheter placement and 90-day hazard of upper- and lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, adjusting for patient-level characteristics and natural clustering within hospitals.

Results

A total of 3790 patients received a peripherally inserted central catheter during hospitalization. From hospital admission to 90 days, 876 thromboembolic events (208 upper-extremity deep vein thromboses, 372 lower-extremity deep vein thromboses, and 296 pulmonary emboli) were identified. After risk adjustment, peripherally inserted central catheter use was independently associated with all-cause venous thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR], 3.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.59–3.85), upper-extremity deep vein thrombosis (HR, 10.49; 95% CI, 7.79–14.11), and lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.02–2.15). Peripherally inserted central catheter use was not associated with pulmonary embolism (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.86–2.06). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses incorporating receipt of pharmacologic prophylaxis during hospitalization.

Conclusions

Peripherally inserted central catheter use is associated with upper- and lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis. Weighing the thrombotic risks conferred by peripherally inserted central catheters against clinical benefits seems necessary.

### Guidelines for performing ultrasound-guided vascular cannulation: recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography [^114Mdjpo]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) cannulation — common complications are thrombosis, bleeding, tip malposition, arm discomfort, and line malfunction; there is a comparable incidence of central line and PICC line–associated bloodstream infections (5.2%) and a higher incidence of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis at the PICC insertion site (13.9%); these complications occur independently of whether insertion was ultrasound-guided, and careful consideration should be given to the number of lumens as this directly relates to complication occurrence.

Factors relating to the underlying pathology and patient history

Infection

Catheter infection is highly associated with intraluminal thrombosis and catheter-related venous thrombosis. An Australian study evaluated the rate of CVC-related complications showed that thrombosis occurred in 15.1% of all cases, exit-site infection in 1.9% and CVC-related bloodstream infection in 7.5 per 1000 CVC-days.

A case–control study reported an association between VTE and any recent infection in patients with cancer, with an OR of 1.7.

General guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections suggest the use of the subclavian vein, rather than a jugular or a femoral site, in adult patients to minimise infection risk for non-tunnelled CVC placement. No recommendation can be made for a preferred site of insertion to minimise infection risk for a tunnelled CVC. Also, the use of a CVC with the minimum number of ports or lumens is essential for the management of the patient.
