## Question

HIV anti viral causing osteoporosis and vitamin d deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about whether and how HIV antiretroviral therapy can cause osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency, and how these issues interrelate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching clinical problem and its epidemiology. Then, I should review the mechanistic pathways across phases of HIV disease and ART. Next, I will quantify the magnitude of bone loss and key risk factors. After that, I need to evaluate management strategies, including ART choices, vitamin D and calcium, and antiresorptives, and specify monitoring. Finally, I will reconcile guidance across major guidelines and highlight uncertainties and research gaps, mapping each point to the best available evidence to keep this rigorous.

> Let me first frame the clinical problem clearly: people living with HIV (PLWH) experience a "double-hit" to bone — HIV-related immune dysregulation plus ART initiation — leading to earlier and greater bone loss than the general population, with vitamin D deficiency as a prevalent and amplifying comorbidity. PLWH commonly lose 2–6% BMD in the first year after starting ART, and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency is reported in roughly 70–91% of cohorts, which is clinically meaningful for bone turnover and fracture risk trajectories [^1155vSZA] [^112rkvux] [^115BnnuP].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology before ART: HIV replication drives osteoclastogenesis via immune activation and cytokine signaling, including increased RANKL and reduced osteoprotegerin, with chronic inflammation further accelerating bone turnover and impairing formation, producing a pro-resorptive milieu that sets the stage for later demineralization and fracture susceptibility [^1131k2bo].

> Next, I should review the ART initiation window: immune reconstitution increases TNF-α and RANKL signaling from repopulating T cells and B cells, causing a transient but clinically important surge in resorption and net BMD loss of about 2–6% at hip and spine over 48 weeks. Wait, let me verify an earlier statement I often see that this loss is entirely regimen-independent; that overgeneralizes the immune component. Hold on, I should clarify: while immune reconstitution drives a regimen-agnostic resorptive spike, drug-specific effects superimpose nontrivially, magnifying losses with certain agents like TDF, so it is incorrect to say "regardless of regimen" without qualification [^116Pjey9] [^1155vSZA] [^1168eJfo] [^117BoDqu].

> I need to check drug-specific toxicities that prolong or deepen bone loss beyond the immune reconstitution phase: TDF increases bone turnover and can cause renal phosphate wasting with secondary hyperparathyroidism, efavirenz reduces 25-hydroxyvitamin D via enzyme induction and doubles the odds of severe deficiency in some cohorts, and protease inhibitors can impair vitamin D bioactivation via CYP450 interference. Let me reconsider whether ritonavir is protective; some cohorts suggest lower odds of deficiency with ritonavir exposure, but confounding is likely, so I should not ascribe causality without stronger data [^117BoDqu] [^115BnnuP] [^111UsM6D] [^112rkvux].

> I should confirm major risk factor patterns to contextualize individual risk: nonmodifiable contributors include older age and Black race, while modifiable risks include low BMI, lack of exercise, smoking and alcohol exposure, vitamin D deficiency, efavirenz exposure, TDF use, and seasonal low sunlight, with lower CD4 nadir and prior AIDS associating with lower BMD in some analyses. Hmm, wait a minute, the seasonality of 25(OH)D is substantial in PLWH and can confound cross-sectional comparisons, so I need to account for timing and latitude when interpreting vitamin D levels [^112rkvux] [^115BnnuP] [^116gyzVY].

> Let me quantify clinical impact where possible: cross-sectional cohorts report high osteopenia and osteoporosis prevalence among PLWH, with osteopenia in roughly half and osteoporosis particularly elevated in men in some cohorts, while fracture risk is modestly higher overall and further increased with HCV coinfection. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from the SMART fracture signal; serious fractures were uncommon and the hazard estimate had wide confidence intervals, so I should present it cautiously as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^111RnhxS] [^115ZmL75] [^114PFhLN].

> I should double-check the magnitude of drug-related and nutritional effects relevant for management: longer on-study TDF exposure tracks with incremental femoral and spine BMD losses per year, and vitamin D plus calcium at ART start meaningfully attenuates the first-year BMD decline while raising 25(OH)D concentrations substantially, supporting a strategy of early supplementation in at-risk patients [^111GVMye] [^1155vSZA].

> Now, for primary prevention in ART-naïve or those about to initiate ART, I need to ensure baseline risk assessment and early mitigation. A reasonable approach is to obtain baseline 25(OH)D and correct deficiency, assess calcium/phosphate and consider PTH if clinically indicated, and selectively obtain DXA in those with clinical risk factors, in line with endocrine guidance and the TDF label's caution for patients at risk of bone loss. Wait, I initially wrote "vitamin D3 50,000 IU weekly" as a universal prophylactic dose; let me verify the trial dosing and guideline stance. The provided randomized trial confirms attenuation of ART-related bone loss with vitamin D plus calcium but does not specify a blanket 50,000 IU weekly protocol here, and endocrine guidance emphasizes tailoring dose to deficiency severity, often 800–2000 IU daily for maintenance with higher amounts for repletion, especially in patients on medications for AIDS where 2–3× higher intake may be required, so I should correct that to "dose to achieve and maintain sufficiency" rather than a fixed weekly megadose for all [^111x2JTt] [^117BoDqu] [^1155vSZA] [^111TsKkR].

> Regarding ART selection, I need to ensure that patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis avoid TDF and consider switching from TDF to TAF when feasible, as recommended by IAS-USA, with supportive data that TAF-based regimens are associated with smaller BMD declines than TDF and that switching improves bone turnover markers and tends to improve BMD. But wait, I should acknowledge that even TAF regimens can show small early BMD decreases, and the long-term clinical significance remains uncertain, so counseling should be balanced [^11454N3G] [^113UQySq] [^1128SYKX] [^117FHgGf].

> For secondary treatment in established osteoporosis, I will now examine antiresorptive efficacy in PLWH: zoledronate meaningfully increases LS and TH BMD and lowers resorption markers, with the largest effects seen when combined with calcium and vitamin D, while oral alendronate is effective and has pooled LS-BMD gains comparable to those in the general population. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude claims: network meta-analyses report LS-BMD gains around 0.082–0.0985 g/cm² with zoledronate and pooled LS increases for bisphosphonates approximating 0.227 g/cm², with favorable safety profiles in the included RCTs, supporting bisphosphonates as first-line pharmacotherapy in PLWH with osteoporosis [^115QPR9y] [^111sSmYs].

> I need to ensure appropriate monitoring: reassess BMD by DXA about 1–2 years after ART initiation or antiresorptive start, and then at intervals based on risk and response, and check 25(OH)D at least annually in at-risk patients with a goal of maintaining levels above 30 ng/mL per endocrine guidance, recognizing that PLWH on interacting medications may require higher maintenance dosing. Let me first confirm that HIV-specific skeletal management otherwise mirrors general-population guidance; current endocrine and metabolic literature support this aligned approach with attention to HIV-specific drug effects and nutrition [^111x2JTt] [^1168eJfo].

> Nonpharmacologic measures remain foundational, and I should emphasize them explicitly: weight-bearing and resistance exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol, nutrition with adequate calcium and protein, and optimization of BMI are reasonable and supported as part of comprehensive bone health management in PLWH, complementing ART optimization and pharmacotherapy when indicated [^1131k2bo].

> Next, I should review and reconcile guidelines. IAS-USA recommends avoiding TDF in osteopenia/osteoporosis and supports proactive switching to TAF in those at high risk for bone toxicity, while the Endocrine Society advises higher vitamin D intake for patients on medications for AIDS and related interacting drugs and the AACE/ACE guideline recommends obtaining serum 25(OH)D in patients at risk for insufficiency, particularly with osteoporosis. Meanwhile, the USPSTF finds insufficient evidence for routine vitamin D and calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in premenopausal adults, underscoring the need to individualize in PLWH based on risk and deficiency rather than universal supplementation for fracture prevention alone [^11454N3G] [^113UQySq] [^111TsKkR] [^111dG7rW] [^111x2JTt] [^114Q6qvz].

> But wait, what about switching data specifics and generalizability? Evidence suggests that switching from TDF to TAF improves bone turnover markers and is associated with BMD improvements, though not all studies are identical in design, and some manufacturer-labeled analyses still report small BMD decreases with TAF-containing regimens at 48 weeks, so I need to communicate that benefits are relative rather than absolute and that patient-level risk stratification still matters [^1128SYKX] [^117FHgGf].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties to avoid overstatement: FRAX is not fully validated in PLWH, many bisphosphonate trials are short with small samples, and meta-analytic certainty varies from very low to moderate for different outcomes, so shared decision-making and re-evaluation over time are essential. Hold on, I should verify that current reviews call for longer-duration trials and better-standardized bone turnover marker reporting, which they do, reinforcing the need for pragmatic monitoring and individualized care plans [^1128SYKX] [^113pLEMR] [^1134c9sX].

> In conclusion, HIV and ART create an early and multifactorial bone loss pattern driven by immune reconstitution and drug-specific toxicities such as with TDF, superimposed on high background rates of vitamin D deficiency; targeted prevention includes optimizing ART away from TDF in at-risk patients, correcting vitamin D deficiency and ensuring adequate calcium, employing bisphosphonates for established osteoporosis, and reinforcing lifestyle measures, with monitoring aligned to general osteoporosis care but calibrated for HIV-specific risks and medications [^1131k2bo] [^1168eJfo] [^1155vSZA].

- **Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)** is the HIV antiviral most strongly linked to osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency, via **renal phosphate wasting** and secondary hyperparathyroidism that increase bone turnover and reduce BMD [^1131k2bo] [^1128SYKX]. **Efavirenz** also contributes by inducing CYP enzymes that accelerate vitamin D catabolism, lowering 25(OH)D and increasing fracture risk. Management includes switching from TDF to TAF, vitamin D/calcium supplementation, and bisphosphonates for high-risk patients [^1155vSZA] [^1128SYKX] [^111sSmYs].

---

## Antiretroviral drugs associated with osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)

- **Bone mineral density loss**: TDF is consistently associated with significant BMD reductions in adults and children, with increased bone turnover and secondary hyperparathyroidism [^117BoDqu].

- **Vitamin D deficiency**: TDF-related renal phosphate wasting and secondary hyperparathyroidism contribute to vitamin D deficiency and impaired bone mineralization.

- **Clinical evidence**: Switching from TDF to TAF improves BMD and reduces bone turnover markers, supporting TDF's role in bone loss [^1128SYKX].

---

### Efavirenz

Efavirenz affects **vitamin D metabolism** by inducing CYP enzymes that increase vitamin D catabolism, lowering 25(OH)D levels. Its **bone health impact** includes severe vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increased bone turnover, which together raise osteoporosis risk.

---

### Protease inhibitors (PIs)

Protease inhibitors (PIs; e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir) cause **vitamin D bioactivation impairment** by inhibiting CYP enzymes involved in vitamin D activation, reducing 1,25(OH)₂D synthesis [^111UsM6D]. The resulting reduction in active vitamin D impairs calcium absorption and bone mineralization, increasing osteoporosis risk.

---

## Mechanisms underlying antiretroviral-induced bone loss and vitamin D deficiency

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Renal phosphate wasting | TDF causes renal phosphate loss, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased bone resorption |
| Vitamin D metabolism alteration | Efavirenz and PIs induce CYP enzymes, increasing vitamin D catabolism and reducing active vitamin D levels |
| Immune reconstitution | ART initiation triggers immune reconstitution, increasing bone resorption via RANKL/OPG pathway [^116Pjey9] |
| Direct drug toxicity | Certain antiretrovirals directly affect osteoblast and osteoclast function, increasing bone turnover |

---

## Clinical implications

HIV-positive individuals on ART have **higher fracture risk**, particularly with TDF and efavirenz. Osteoporosis often **develops earlier** than in HIV-negative individuals. **Vitamin D deficiency is common** in HIV-positive patients and further worsens bone health [^112rkvux].

---

## Management strategies

- **Antiretroviral regimen modification**: Switch from TDF to TAF to improve BMD and reduce bone turnover [^1128SYKX].

- **Vitamin D and calcium supplementation**: Supplementation attenuates ART-associated bone loss and corrects deficiency [^1155vSZA].

- **Bisphosphonate therapy**: Bisphosphonates (e.g. zoledronate) effectively increase BMD and reduce bone turnover in HIV-positive patients [^111sSmYs].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation support bone health.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Bone mineral density monitoring**: Regular DXA scans for HIV-positive patients on ART, especially with TDF or efavirenz.

- **Vitamin D level assessment**: Routine 25(OH)D testing and supplementation to maintain sufficiency.

- **Antiretroviral regimen selection**: Avoid TDF in patients with osteoporosis or high fracture risk; consider TAF or alternative regimens.

---

## Conclusion

TDF and efavirenz are the primary antiretrovirals linked to **osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency** in HIV-positive patients, through renal phosphate wasting, altered vitamin D metabolism, and immune reconstitution. Management includes **regimen modification**, **supplementation**, **bisphosphonates**, and **lifestyle changes** to reduce fracture risk and improve bone health.

### Vitamin D and calcium attenuate bone loss with antiretroviral therapy initiation: A randomized trial [^1155vSZA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy initiation for HIV-1 infection is associated with a 2% to 6% loss of bone mineral density (BMD). To evaluate the effect of vitamin D3 plus calcium supplementation on bone loss associated with antiretroviral therapy initiation, a 48-week prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01403051).

The study setting included 39 AIDS Clinical Trials Group units. The participants were adults with antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV. Key measurements included BMD by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, and other laboratory assessments.

A total of 165 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D3 plus calcium (79 patients) or a placebo (86 patients). The study groups were well-balanced at baseline: 90% were men, 33% were non-Hispanic black, and the median CD4 count was 0.341 × 10⁹ cells/L. At 48 weeks, the decline in total hip BMD was smaller in the vitamin D3 plus calcium group compared to the placebo group. The medians were -1.36% (IQR, -3.43% to 0.50%) for the supplementation group and -3.22% (IQR, -5.56% to -0.88%) for the placebo group (P = 0.004). Similar results were observed at the lumbar spine.

At 48 weeks, 90% of the patients achieved HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 50 copies/mL. Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 increased significantly with vitamin D3 plus calcium supplement but not with the placebo. The median change was 61.2 nmol/L (IQR, 36.4 to 94.3) for the supplementation group versus 1.7 nmol/L (IQR, -13.2 to 10.7) in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Overall, 103 patients (62%) reported one or more adverse events, with a similar distribution between groups; no cases of hypercalcemia were reported, and there was one case of nephrolithiasis.

### Bone turnover change after randomized switch from tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir alafenamide fumarate in men with HIV [^1128SYKX]. AIDS (2024). Low credibility.

The widespread use of lifelong contemporary combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, many of which include the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), has transitioned HIV into a chronic disease with normal life expectancy. However, bone loss and its sequelae, such as fractures, are increasingly recognized as important comorbidities in the aging population of people with HIV (PWH). Moreover, it is likely that bone loss is underestimated in this population, as the tools for detection are insensitive, not widely available, or not utilized. Although the mechanism of bone loss is poorly understood, plasma bone turnover markers (BTMs) suggest uncoupling of bone resorption and formation via a treatment effect on bone cells.

Although there are likely several contributing factors, including age-associated factors, vitamin D deficiency, corticosteroid exposure, and HIV-associated perturbation of bone turnover, TDF-containing regimens have been associated with greater bone loss. Switching from a TDF-containing regimen to one containing tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), a phosphonoamidate prodrug of tenofovir, has been associated with bone mineral density (BMD) increases as measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which suggests a reversal of subclinical bone loss.

Methods to identify fracture risk and BMD loss in PWH are confined to the Frax score, which has not been specifically validated in PWH, and DXA, which only provides two-dimensional impressions of fracture risk at the hip and spine.

### Efavirenz is associated with severe vitamin D deficiency and increased alkaline phosphatase [^115BnnuP]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

To identify factors, including exposure to specific antiretroviral drugs associated with severe vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in HIV-infected individuals, and to explore the effects of severe VDD and antiretroviral drug exposure on serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as a surrogate marker of bone turnover, a cross-sectional survey of vitamin D status among HIV-infected patients was conducted at a large London HIV clinic.

Severe VDD was defined as 25(OH)D levels of less than 10 micrograms per liter (< 25 nmol/L). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify factors associated with severe VDD and upper quartile ALP levels.

Vitamin D levels were measured in 1077 patients and found to be suboptimal in 91%. One-third of patients had severe VDD. Factors such as black ethnicity, sampling in winter, nadir CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/microliter, and exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy were associated with severe VDD. In analyses restricted to patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, efavirenz use was significantly associated with severe VDD [adjusted odds ratio 2.0 (95% confidence interval 1.5–2.7)]. Tenofovir [adjusted odds ratio 3.5 (95% confidence interval 2.3–5.2)] and efavirenz use [adjusted odds ratio 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.02–2.4)], but not severe VDD [odds ratio 1.1 (0.8–1.5)], were associated with increased bone turnover (upper quartile ALP).

Efavirenz was associated with severe VDD, a condition tied to multiple adverse health outcomes, and both efavirenz and tenofovir were linked to increased bone turnover.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: Insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111sSmYs]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

For people living with HIV (PLWH) at risk of osteoporosis, the primary treatment strategy focuses on reducing the risk of fractures and improving bone density. This includes optimizing bone health through lifestyle interventions such as weight-bearing exercises, smoking cessation, and addressing nutritional deficiencies. The main therapeutic goal is to halt bone loss and enhance bone mineral density (BMD), particularly in individuals at high fracture risk due to HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Anti-osteoporosis medications, especially bisphosphonates, play a central role by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, thus stabilizing or improving BMD. Studies support the efficacy of both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as alendronate and zoledronate, in PLWH, demonstrating BMD increases comparable to those in the general population, with a prior meta-analysis pooling all bisphosphonates yielding an increase in lumbar spine BMD of 0.227 g/cm². Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is essential in conjunction with therapy to enhance the effects of treatment and prevent further bone demineralization. The recommended daily dose of vitamin D for PLWH with osteoporosis is typically 800–2000 IU, depending on individual needs, with higher doses considered in cases of deficiency.

Despite the benefits, there is no consensus on specific bisphosphonate protocols, although their use is increasingly favorable in this population.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: Insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1131k2bo]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

With the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) are experiencing longer survival rates and an aging population structure. However, both HIV infection itself and long-term exposure to ART are associated with accelerated bone loss, characterized primarily by increased bone resorption. The major bone loss occurs during two key phases: active virus replication and ART initiation. During viral replication, HIV proteins directly affect bone cells while HIV-infected lymphocytes create a pro-resorptive environment by secreting RANKL and reducing osteoprotegerin expression. Subsequently, ART initiation triggers further bone resorption through immune reconstitution mechanisms and upregulation of the RANKL/OPG pathway. Additionally, certain antiretroviral drugs like tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) can affect bone mineralization through renal phosphate wasting. This pattern of accelerated bone resorption, combined with reduced bone formation as shown in histomorphometric studies, contributes to premature bone aging in PLWH. Consequently, these patients typically develop osteoporosis approximately a decade earlier than HIV-negative individuals. If left untreated, osteoporosis in this population can lead to a higher incidence of fragility fractures, reduced quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality.

The management of osteoporosis in PLWH presents unique challenges, as standard assessment and treatment strategies may not be directly applicable. Currently, the optimal pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis in PLWH remains an area of ongoing research and debate.

### HIV-protease inhibitors impair vitamin D bioactivation to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [^111UsM6D]. AIDS (2003). Low credibility.

A high prevalence of bone demineralization occurs in people living with HIV/AIDS. The contribution of HIV itself and its treatment remains unclear. Protease inhibitors (PIs) are potent inhibitors of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system. Three cytochrome p450 mixed function oxygenases control serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) D), which is responsible for vitamin D actions in target tissues, including bone. The 25- and 1alpha-hydroxylases regulate 1,25(OH) D synthesis, and 24-hydroxylase regulates 1,25(OH) D catabolism.

- **Objective**: To assess whether HIV-protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir) impair the activity of the main enzymes involved in 1,25(OH) D homeostasis.

- **Design and methods**: Studies were conducted in the human hepatocyte (H3B) and monocyte (THP-1) cell lines, expressing 25-hydroxylase and 1alpha-hydroxylase, respectively. The 24-hydroxylase expression was induced in macrophages by exposure to 1,25(OH) D. Conversion rates of vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH) D or 24,25(OH) D, and 1,25(OH) D degradation were quantified in untreated and HIV-PI-treated cells after cartridge extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography purification of 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH) D, and 1,25(OH) D fractions.

- **Results**: The PIs impair hepatocyte 25(OH)D and macrophage 1,25(OH) D synthesis in a reversible, dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PIs inhibit 1,25(OH) D degradation in macrophages with lower potency than that elicited on 1alpha-hydroxylase. Thus, reduced macrophage 1,25(OH) D production is the net effect of PI.

### Low vitamin D among HIV-infected adults: Prevalence of and risk factors for low vitamin D levels in a cohort of HIV-infected adults and comparison to prevalence among adults in the US general population [^112rkvux]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

We explored serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and associated factors for insufficiency or deficiency in an adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cohort and compared 25(OH)D levels with those in the general US population.

- **Methods**: Using baseline data from the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV and AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN), a prospective, observational cohort study of HIV-infected adults enrolled at 7 HIV specialty clinics in 4 US cities from March 2004 to June 2006, we estimated the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency (defined as 25(OH)D levels < 30 ng/mL), standardized by age, race, and sex. Using multiple logistic regression, we examined risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.

- **Results**: Among 672 SUN participants with baseline serum 25(OH)D determinations who were not receiving vitamin D supplements, 70.3% (95% confidence interval, 68.1%-74.9%) were vitamin D insufficient or deficient, compared with 79.1% (95% CI, 76.7–81.3) of US adults. Factors associated with vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency included black race (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.51; 95% CI, 2.59–7.85), Hispanic ethnicity (aOR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.31–5.90), higher body mass index (aOR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00–1.09), hypertension (aOR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.10–3.22), lack of exercise (aOR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.80–5.47), exposure to efavirenz (aOR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.18–3.34), higher exposure to ultraviolet light (aOR, .78; 95% CI, .71-.86), renal insufficiency (aOR, .55; 95% CI, .36-.83), and exposure to ritonavir (aOR, .56; 95% CI, .35–0).

### Role of T-cell reconstitution in HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy-induced bone loss [^116Pjey9]. Nature Communications (2015). Low credibility.

HIV infection causes bone loss. We previously reported that immunosuppression-mediated B-cell production of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), coupled with a decline in osteoprotegerin, correlates with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in untreated HIV infection. Paradoxically, antiretroviral therapy (ART) worsens bone loss, although existing data suggest that such loss is largely independent of specific antiretroviral regimens. This led us to hypothesize that skeletal deterioration following HIV disease reversal with ART may be related to T-cell repopulation and/or immune reconstitution.

Here, we transplant T cells into immunocompromised mice to mimic ART-induced T-cell expansion. T-cell reconstitution elicits RANKL and TNFα production by B cells and/or T cells, accompanied by enhanced bone resorption and BMD loss. Reconstitution of TNFα- or RANKL-null T-cells and pharmacological TNFα antagonist all protect cortical, but not trabecular bone, revealing complex effects of T-cell reconstitution on bone turnover. These findings suggest T-cell repopulation and/or immune reconstitution as putative mechanisms for bone loss following ART initiation.

### Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [^117BoDqu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In clinical trials involving HIV-1 infected adults, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets were associated with slightly greater decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism, suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1,25 Vitamin D levels were also elevated in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Clinical trials evaluating tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets in pediatric and adolescent subjects were conducted. Under normal circumstances, BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients. In HIV-1 infected subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years, bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects, suggesting increased bone turnover. Total body BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-treated HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects compared to the control groups. Similar trends were observed in chronic hepatitis B infected adolescent subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years. In all pediatric trials, skeletal growth (height) appeared to be unaffected [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The effects of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for adults and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D on these parameters is not determined, monitoring and preventive measures may be prudent to mitigate potential risks.

### Bone turnover change after randomized switch from tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir alafenamide fumarate in men with HIV [^114rQZhn]. AIDS (2024). Low credibility.

University College London was the trial sponsor. Gilead Sciences funded the study as an Investigator Sponsored Research/Collaborative Study project (IN-UK-366–4216 27) and provided the study supply of TAF/FTC/RPV. The UK National Health System supplied the TDF/FTC RPV fixed-dose combination tablets. While Gilead Sciences reviewed the final manuscript prior to submission, they did not participate in the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the study data.

### Hepatitis C co-infection and severity of liver disease as risk factors for osteoporotic fractures among HIV-infected patients [^115ZmL75]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is increasingly reported in the aging HIV-positive population, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) may further increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, it remains unclear whether HCV-related increased fracture risk is a function of the severity of liver disease. We calculated the time-updated alanine aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score (an indirect marker of hepatic fibrosis) in all HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs' Clinical Case Registry between 1984 and 2009. The association between HCV co-infection and incident osteoporotic fracture (defined as closed wrist, vertebral, or hip fracture) was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox survival models, adjusting for traditional risk factors for osteoporosis and APRI score or the presence of cirrhosis.

A total of 772 osteoporotic fractures were identified among 56,660 HIV-infected patients (98.1% male; 31.3% HCV co-infected; median age 44.0 years) contributing 305,237 patient-years of follow-up. Fracture rates were significantly higher among HIV/HCV patients than HIV-only patients (2.57 versus 2.07/1000 patient-years, relative risk = 1.24, p < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariable model including age, race, smoking, drug use, body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy, HCV co-infection remained an independent predictor of osteoporotic fractures after controlling for the presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32; p < 0.001) or APRI score (HR = 1.30; p = 0.003). Among HIV/HCV co-infected patients, cirrhosis strongly predicted osteoporotic fractures (HR = 1.65; 95% confidence interval).

### Skeletal health in adults with HIV infection [^1168eJfo]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). High credibility.

Concern has been raised that HIV infection, its treatment, or both adversely affect skeletal health. Cross-sectional studies show that bone mineral density (BMD) is 3–5% lower in patients infected with HIV than in uninfected controls, but patients with HIV infection are, on average, 5 kg lighter than uninfected people. After this weight difference is accounted for, BMD differences are smaller and not clinically relevant. Longitudinal studies show short-term BMD loss of 2–4% over 1–2 years when antiretroviral therapy is started, followed by longer periods of BMD increase or stability. Losses are greatest with treatment regimens that contain tenofovir. Patients infected with HIV have slightly higher fracture rates than controls, but the increased risk of fracture is substantially attenuated by adjustment for traditional risk factors for fracture. These reassuring findings suggest that management of skeletal health in HIV should follow guidelines for the general population. In general, effective antiretroviral treatment and avoidance of undernutrition are the two most important factors for maintenance of skeletal health in patients infected with HIV.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: Insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115QPR9y]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous bisphosphonates are increasingly utilized in people living with HIV (PLWH) due to their prolonged inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Zoledronate is the most commonly used intravenous bisphosphonate in this population, typically administered annually for the treatment of osteoporosis. Our network meta-analysis (NMA) demonstrated that zoledronate significantly improves bone mineral density (BMD) compared to placebo. Specifically, zoledronate alone significantly increased lumbar spine (LS) BMD with a weighted mean difference (MD) of +0.0985 g/cm² (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0688–0.1287), while zoledronate combined with calcium and vitamin D produced the greatest improvement in total hip (TH) BMD, with a weighted MD of +0.0606 g/cm² (95% CI: 0.0133–0.1079).

These increases surpass the least significant change (LSC) thresholds for the general population, which are estimated at 0.034 g/cm² for the lumbar spine and 0.027 g/cm² for the total hip. Our component network meta-analysis (CNMA) further identified zoledronate as the most influential component, demonstrating significant incremental effects on both BMD and bone turnover markers (BTMs). These findings align with prior research showing that zoledronate effectively mitigates BMD loss in PLWH, including those treated with tenofovir.

Additionally, our NMA revealed that zoledronate significantly reduced C-terminal telopeptide (CTx) levels, with a weighted MD of −0.1748 ng/ml (95% CI: −0.2841 to −0.0654), surpassing the LSC for the bone turnover marker, which is set at 0.28 ng/ml. Importantly, zoledronate treatment did not result in a significant increase in major adverse events, reinforcing its favorable safety profile. However, the studies included in our analysis primarily focused on zoledronate, highlighting the need for further research.

### Antiretroviral therapy and the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis: A meta-analytic review [^116QWxse]. AIDS (2006). Low credibility.

The prevalence estimates of osteopenia and osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone mineral density (BMD), in HIV-infected patients and the role of antiretroviral therapy (ART) vary within the literature.

- **Methods**: We conducted a meta-analytical review of cross-sectional studies published in English to determine the pooled odds ratios (OR) of reduced BMD and osteoporosis in the following groups: HIV-positive versus HIV-negative; ART-treated versus ART-naive; and protease inhibitor (PI)-treated versus PI-untreated. We searched the MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE databases for eligible references from January 1966 to November 2005. Random effects models were used to generate pooled OR estimates and confidence intervals.

- **Results**: Of 37 articles identified, 20 met the inclusion criteria. Among the 884 HIV-infected patients, 67% had reduced BMD, with 15% having osteoporosis. This yielded a pooled OR of 6.4 and 3.7, respectively, when compared with HIV-uninfected controls (n = 654) using data from 11 studies. Compared with ART-naive patients (n = 202, 10 studies), ART-treated individuals (n = 824) had a 2.5-fold increased odds of prevalent reduced BMD. The risk of prevalent osteoporosis (seven studies) was similarly elevated in ART-treated individuals. Compared with non-PI-treated HIV patients (n = 410, 14 studies), PI-treated patients (n = 791) had increased odds of reduced BMD and osteoporosis (12 studies). Few studies adjusted for important covariates such as HIV disease severity or treatment duration.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of osteoporosis in HIV-infected individuals is more than the general population.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: Insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111iLvkx]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Changes in osteocalcin (OC) over one year

Three trials, involving 253 participants and evaluating three treatments (alendronate with calcium and standard vitamin D, calcium with standard vitamin D, and calcium with higher-dose vitamin D), were included in the analysis of OC changes over one year. Based on SUCRA rankings, oral alendronate combined with calcium and standard vitamin D showed a 67.1% probability of achieving the greatest OC changes. However, the data were compatible with similar effects between alendronate with calcium and standard vitamin D and calcium with standard or higher-dose vitamin D (wMD: +1.3313 ng/ml; 95% compatibility interval: −4.1455 to 6.8082; and wMD: +1.2213 ng/ml; 95% compatibility interval: −4.2828 to 6.7255, respectively; CoE: low for both), as indicated by compatibility intervals including zero.

- **AOMs-related major adverse event rate**: Seven trials, involving 398 participants and evaluating five treatments (intravenous zoledronate with calcium and standard vitamin D, intravenous zoledronate with calcium and higher-dose vitamin D, alendronate with calcium and standard vitamin D, calcium with standard vitamin D, and calcium with higher-dose vitamin D), were included in the analysis of AOM-related serious adverse events. SUCRA rankings indicated that calcium with higher-dose vitamin D had a 65.9% probability of having the lowest adverse event rate. However, the weighted mean difference data were compatible with similar adverse event rates among all treatments, as indicated by compatibility intervals including the null value.

### Odefsey [^117FHgGf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a pooled analysis of two 48-week trials involving antiretroviral treatment-naïve adult participants with HIV-1, bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline to Week 48 was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The mean BMD decreased from baseline to Week 48 by -1.30% with FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI at the lumbar spine and -0.66% at the total hip. Participants receiving FTC+TAF with EVG+COBI experienced BMD declines of 5% or greater at the lumbar spine in 10% of cases. Similarly, BMD declines of 7% or greater at the femoral neck were reported in 7% of these participants. The long-term clinical significance of these BMD changes is not known.

### Bone mass, fracture risk, and associated factors in postmenopausal women living with HIV [^114jSLM6]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

Participants were interviewed regarding sociodemographics, lifestyle, and chronic diseases. Body mass index (BMI) was assessed and stratified according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines:

- **Classification**: Underweight — BMI of less than 18 kg/m², normal weight — BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m², overweight — BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m², and obese — BMI of 30 kg/m² or more. Obesity is subclassified into:
	- **Class I**: BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m².
	- **Class II**: BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m².
	- **Class III**: BMI of 40 kg/m² or more.

For women living with HIV (WLH), if the last CD4+ lymphocyte count (in cells per cubic millimeter) and viral load (VL) (in copies per milliliter) from the electronic medical record were over a year old, new tests were conducted.

The bone mineral density (BMD) and T score of the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and femoral neck were measured using the same DXA device (Lunar Prodigy; GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) at the Beneficente Portuguesa Hospital. For each scan, BMD results (in grams per square centimeter) were recorded based on the World Health Organization criteria. These criteria established BMD thresholds according to the difference in standard deviation (SD) between a patient's BMD and that of a young adult reference population (T score):

- **Normal**: BMD T score of up to −1.0 SD.
- **Osteopenia**: BMD T score between −1.0 and −2.5.
- **Osteoporosis**: BMD T score of less than or equal to −2.5.

### Bone mineral density in Black South African women newly diagnosed with breast cancer living with and without HIV [^114Tk3i2]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Worsening bone mineral density (BMD) — and the corresponding increase in osteoporotic fractures — is an important and well-established source of morbidity and mortality in women receiving treatment for breast cancer, as well as those living with HIV. However, there are comparatively few reports on pretreatment bone health in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, especially in predominantly Black populations across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and among individuals living with HIV. Therefore, we sought to characterize bone health in a cohort of Black South African women with and without HIV before the initiation of systemic breast cancer therapy, in particular chemotherapy and/or aromatase inhibitors.

- **Methods**: Building on the South African Breast Cancer and HIV Outcomes study, we recruited consecutive women newly diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer who were to start systemic cancer therapy at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg, between June 2021 and August 2024. In addition to collecting extensive demographic and clinical information, we conducted dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans on each patient to measure BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip.

- **Results**: We enrolled a total of 378 women, 32.3% of whom (n = 122) were living with HIV. Among women aged 50 years and older (n = 156), 64.1% had osteopenia or osteoporosis; HIV infection and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency — but no breast cancer characteristics — were associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis. By contrast, 3.6% of women younger than 50 years…

### Lower peak bone mass and abnormal trabecular and cortical microarchitecture in young men infected with HIV early in life [^116hcKzm]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) early in life may interfere with the acquisition of peak bone mass, thereby increasing fracture risk in adulthood.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) in 30 HIV-infected African-American or Hispanic Tanner stage 5 men aged 20–25 on ART (15 perinatally infected and 15 infected during adolescence) and 15 HIV-uninfected controls.

- **Results**: HIV-infected men were similar in age and BMI, but were more likely to be African-American (P = 0.01) than uninfected men. DXA-derived areal bone mineral density (aBMD) Z-scores were 0.4–1.2 lower in HIV-infected men at the spine, hip, and radius (all P < 0.05). At the radius and tibia, total and trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD), and cortical and trabecular thickness were between 6 and 19% lower in HIV-infected than in uninfected men (P < 0.05). HIV-infected men had dramatic deficiencies in plate-related parameters by individual trabeculae segmentation (ITS) analyses and 14–17% lower bone stiffness by finite element analysis. Differences in most HR-pQCT parameters remained significant after adjustment for race/ethnicity. No DXA or HR-pQCT parameters differed between men infected perinatally or during adolescence.

- **Conclusion**: At an age by which young men have typically acquired peak bone mass, HIV-infected men on ART have lower BMD, markedly abnormal trabecular plate and cortical microarchitecture, and decreased whole bone stiffness, whether infected perinatally or during adolescence.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: Insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117Wk6f1]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

With life expectancy for people living with HIV (PLWH) approaching that of the general population, age-related conditions like osteoporosis are increasingly common. Both HIV infection and long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), are associated with early-onset osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are commonly used for treatment, but the optimal strategy for improving bone health in PLWH remains unclear.

- **Methods**: We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) with component analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified from Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL EBSCO databases, from inception to December 1, 2024. The study included RCTs comparing zoledronate, alendronate, calcium and vitamin D, and their combinations in PLWH with osteoporosis. The primary outcomes were changes in lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density (LS-BMD and TH-BMD). Secondary outcomes included changes in bone turnover markers (BTMs) — C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx) and osteocalcin (OC) — as well as major adverse events associated with anti-osteoporosis medication (AOMs). Data were analyzed using a component NMA approach to compare treatment strategies. The study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO: CRD42023475160.

- **Findings**: A total of 11 RCTs involving 816 participants were included. In mixed PLWH populations, zoledronate-based regimens significantly improved LS-BMD [weighted mean difference (wMD): 0.0821–0.0985 g/cm²; certainty of evidence (CoE): very low to low] and TH-BMD.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: Insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115CxQL9]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Inconsistency - No global inconsistencies (design-by-treatment interaction model) or local inconsistencies (loop approach) were found for LS-BMD, TH-BMD, OC changes, or AOM-related major adverse events, except for CTx changes (Appendix 9).

Transitivity assessment - The assessment of transitivity showed consistent distribution in male percentage (79.5–91.5%) and body mass index (22.5–24.9 kg/m²), while significant differences were observed in age (30.4–49.5 years), time since diagnosis (3.0–12.4 years), baseline BMD (lumbar spine: 0.89–1.29 g/cm²; total hip: 0.80–1.09 g/cm²), CD4 counts (128–568 cells/mm³), and ART-experience status (Appendix 5). These differences were considered in assessing evidence certainty and exploring effect modifiers through the following meta-regression and subgroup analyses.

Certainty of evidence - The summary profile, including GRADE ratings, is available in Appendix 10. Most comparisons showed very low to low certainty of evidence regarding LS-BMD improvement, TH-BMD improvement, CTx changes, OC changes, and AOM-related adverse events. Some comparisons had moderate to high CoE in cases of low heterogeneity or low risk of bias (Fig. 2 K–O; Appendix 10).

Meta-regression - Meta-regression analyses evaluated potential effect modifiers including patient age (≤ 50 vs > 50 years), duration since diagnosis (≤ 5 vs > 5 years), baseline lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD ≤ 1.01 vs > 1.01 g/cm²), baseline total hip bone mineral density (TH-BMD ≤ 0.94 vs > 0.94 g/cm²), baseline CD4 count (≤ 350 vs > 350 cells/mm³), and ART experience status.

### Association of a polygenic risk score with osteoporosis in people living with HIV: The Swiss HIV Cohort Study [^1164syfW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Bone health is a major long-term concern in people living with HIV (PLWH). Low-trauma fractures and low bone mineral density (BMD; i.e. osteopenia and osteoporosis) are recorded more frequently in PLWH than in the general population. Increased osteoporosis susceptibility in PLWH has been attributed to a higher prevalence of traditional osteoporosis risk factors: low body weight, vitamin D deficiency, hepatitis C coinfection, smoking and other substance use, chronic inflammation, and toxicity from antiretroviral therapy (ART) agents such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and boosted protease inhibitors (bPIs).

BMD has a strong genetic component, with heritability in the range of 50% to 90%. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have now identified over 500 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are reliably associated with BMD in the general population. Furthermore, by combining the effect of the SNPs in these GWASs, it is possible to obtain a single measurement of the genetic risk conferred for the predicted outcome in the form of a polygenic risk score (PRS) (reviewed by Torkamani et al).

We previously reported on participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) regarding associations of GWAS-derived SNPs with dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and low-trauma fractures, and we associated individual PRSs with chronic kidney disease, rapid progression of renal dysfunction, coronary artery disease events, and subclinical atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether an individual BMD-associated PRS is independently associated with osteoporosis.

### Emerging bone problems in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus [^114UV2J2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Recently, a high incidence of osteopenia and osteoporosis has been observed in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This problem appears to be more frequent in patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. Other bone-related complications in HIV-infected individuals, including avascular necrosis of the hip and compression fracture of the lumbar spine, have also been reported. People living with HIV have significant alterations in bone metabolism, regardless of whether they are receiving potent antiretroviral therapy. The underlying mechanisms to account for these observations remain unknown, although studies are underway to examine the relationship between the bone abnormalities and other complications associated with HIV and antiretroviral therapy. HIV-infected patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis should be treated similarly to HIV-seronegative patients with appropriate use of nutritional supplements (calcium and vitamin D) and exercise. Hormone replacement and antiresorptive therapies might also be indicated.

### Bone mineral density in HIV participants randomized to raltegravir and lopinavir/ritonavir compared with standard second line therapy [^113m3N2A]. AIDS (2013). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that the prevalence of osteoporosis in HIV-infected individuals may be more than three times greater compared with HIV-uninfected controls. The prevalence of osteoporosis in HIV has been reported to be between 3 and 21%. Osteopenia is more common, affecting about 30–50% of HIV-positive individuals. Our data support these previous estimates of bone disease in HIV populations, with 20–31% experiencing osteopenia and 2–5% experiencing osteoporosis at baseline. This demonstrates that in middle-income countries, where treatment options are limited, similar rates of bone disease are found compared with HIV populations from developed countries.

The reason for such a high prevalence of bone disease in HIV is of concern and is most probably multifactorial. The influence of HIV disease, social factors, and cART all contribute. Studies have confirmed that bone mineral density (BMD) is significantly lower in HIV-positive patients over a 1-year period compared with HIV-negative patients, independent of cART. However, in our multivariate analysis, neither HIV duration nor HIV disease category were significant predictors of low BMD.

In addition, smoking and alcohol intake are known lifestyle factors more common in the HIV-infected population and have previously been documented as associated with reduced BMD. However, in the Second Line study cohort, neither smoking nor alcohol was a significant predictor of low BMD in the multivariate regression analysis. Another lifestyle factor known to affect BMD is a low BMI. In this analysis, a low BMI at baseline was associated with a low BMD over 48 weeks, which has been demonstrated previously.

### Continuous antiretroviral therapy decreases bone mineral density [^114PFhLN]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

To assess the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on bone mineral density (BMD), a randomized comparison of continuous ART (viral suppression group; VS) with intermittent ART (drug conservation group; DC) was conducted. This study was set in outpatient clinics in the United States, Australia, and Spain.

Participants in the Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) Body Composition substudy were involved.

Main outcomes were measured by annual hip and spine BMD using dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry (DXA) and spine BMD using quantitative computed tomography (qCT).

Comparisons were made by intention-to-treat analysis, using longitudinal models for change in BMD. Risk factors for BMD loss were evaluated.

Results showed that the 214 participants (median age 44 years, 19% female, 73% on ART; median T-scores: -0.5 total hip, -0.7 spine DXA, -0.9 spine qCT; 98 randomized to VS and 116 to DC) were followed for a mean of 2.4 years. With continuous ART, BMD declined per year by 0.8% (hip), 0.4% (spine DXA), and 2.4% (spine qCT). BMD declined significantly less with intermittent ART. Estimated DC minus VS group differences in mean BMD change through follow-up were 1.4% [hip; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6–2.3; P = 0.002], 1.3% (spine DXA; 95% CI 0.1–2.4, P = 0.03), and 3.0% (spine qCT; 95% CI 0.8–5.2, P = 0.007). No consistent drug-specific association with BMD decline was found. In the parent study, 10 of 2753 participants in the VS group and two of 2720 in the DC group reported serious fractures (hazard ratio 4.9; 95% CI 1.1–22.5; P = 0.04).

**Results**: A total of 11 trials, involving 816 adult people living with HIV (PLWH), were included in the analysis. Baseline characteristics for each trial are summarized in Table 1 and Appendix 4. The mean age of participants ranged from 22 to 49.5 years, with most being male (79.3–100%). Time since HIV diagnosis, reported in 6 trials, ranged from 2 to 13.9 years. Baseline lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) varied from 0.86 to 1.29 g/cm², while total hip BMD ranged from 0.71 to 1.09 g/cm². CD4 counts were reported in 11 trials, ranging from 102 to 663 cells/mm³. Eight trials enrolled antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced patients, while three included ART-naïve participants.

### Reduced bone mineral density in HIV-infected patients: prevalence and associated factors [^111RnhxS]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

There is a high prevalence of bone demineralization among HIV-infected patients, but the mechanisms of alteration of bone turnover are still unclear and are thought to be multifactorial.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional survey of 492 HIV-infected patients within the Aquitaine cohort estimated the prevalence of osteoporosis/osteopenia and investigated associated factors. Bone mineral density of total body, lumbar spine, and femoral neck was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Multivariable analyses of the association with HIV disease status, treatment, and anthropometric parameters were stratified according to gender.

- **Results**: Median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 38–50); 73% were male; 19.7% of patients had reached AIDS; 93.1% were treated with HAART; and 28.5% had lipodystrophy. Based on World Health Organization criteria, osteopenia was diagnosed in 54.6% of men [95% confidence interval (CI), 49.4–59.7] and 51.1% of women (95% CI, 42.6–59.6) and osteoporosis in 33.7% of men (95% CI, 28.8–38.6) and 8.3% of women (95% CI, 3.6–13.9). Using polytomous logistic regression, older age, homosexual transmission group, low body mass index, and low HIV plasma viral load were associated with the diagnosis of bone abnormalities in men. In contrast, older age and low CD4 lymphocyte count nadir were independently associated with osteoporosis/osteopenia in women. The use of HAART was not related to osteoporosis after adjustment (P = 0.58).

- **Conclusions**: This cohort-based survey showed a high prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis of multifactorial origin. Mechanisms and factors contributing to these conditions require further investigation to clarify the roles they play.

### Association of a polygenic risk score with osteoporosis in people living with HIV: The Swiss HIV Cohort Study [^115N7qx2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Here we analyzed a polygenic risk score (PRS) for osteoporosis in people living with HIV (PLWH), considering both traditional and HIV-related factors, including osteoporosis-associated antiretrovirals. Our genetic study has four main findings:

- **First finding**: When an individual PRS based on 9413 bone mineral density (BMD)-associated SNPs was applied, an unfavorable genetic background independently increased osteoporosis risk approximately fourfold.

- **Second finding**: This effect of an unfavorable genetic background appears clinically relevant because it was larger than the effect of well-established osteoporosis risk factors, such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) exposure for five years.

- **Third finding**: An unfavorable genetic background also increased the risk of the combined endpoint of osteoporosis or osteopenia. As expected, due to the less stringent separation of cases and controls, the genetic effect size was smaller and seen only in participants with the most unfavorable genetic background. Participants in the top PRS quintile had a 2.3-fold increase in osteopenia/osteoporosis risk.

- **Fourth finding**: The association of the genetic score of osteoporosis and osteoporosis (gSOS PRS) and osteoporosis was not affected by parental history of hip fracture, as we were unable to document any association of parental history with osteoporosis. Additionally, we found no evidence for any association of the longevity PRS with osteoporosis, in contrast to our recent study of coronary artery disease events in PLWH.

### HIV and bone mineral density [^116e86FQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

This review details the clinical aspects and pathogenesis of low bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV, discusses broad management issues, and outlines areas in which our understanding of this condition is incomplete.

- **Recent findings**: Low BMD is prevalent in HIV-infected patients, with traditional risk factors, HIV infection, and exposure to antiretroviral therapy all contributing. The role of specific antiretrovirals in the development of low BMD remains controversial, but most changes arise at either antiretroviral therapy initiation or switch.

- **Summary**: Further research is needed to clarify mechanisms underlying low BMD in HIV, whether low BMD will translate to increased fractures, and to determine the correct therapeutic approach to low BMD in HIV, particularly in younger HIV-infected patients.

### Prevalence of HIV-associated osteoporosis and fracture risk in midlife women: a cross-sectional study in Zimbabwe [^114t44L8]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy roll-out has dramatically reduced HIV-related mortality; more women are living to reach menopause. Menopausal estrogen loss causes bone loss, as does HIV and some of its treatments. However, data describing HIV's impact on osteoporosis prevalence and fracture risk are scarce in southern Africa. A cross-sectional study of women aged 40–60 years (49% women living with HIV [WLH]) was conducted in Harare, Zimbabwe.

Menopause, fracture, and HIV history were collected; anthropometry and bone mineral density (BMD) were measured by DXA; FRAX 10-year fracture probabilities were quantified. The FRAX probability of a major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) included HIV as a risk factor for secondary osteoporosis. Linear and Poisson regression determined the relationships between clinical risk factors and both femoral neck (FN) BMD and the 10-year FRAX probability of MOF, respectively.

The 393 participants had a mean (SD) age of 49.6 (5.8) years and a mean (SD) BMI of 29.1 (6.0) kg/m². Ninety-five percent of WLH were established on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with 85% on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and 81% had a viral load < 50 copies/mL. A BMD T-score ≤ -2.5 was more common in WLH than those without, at both FN and lumbar spine (LS) (FN, 22 [11.4%] vs. 5 [2.5%]; LS, 40 [20.8%] vs. 9 [4.5%], respectively). Prior fracture was more prevalent in WLH: any fracture type (27 [14%] vs. 14 [7%]); MOF (14 [7.3%] vs. 5 [2.5%]).

WLH had a higher 10-year MOF probability (median, 1.2%; IQR, 0.9–1.8) compared with those without HIV (1.0%; IQR, 0.9–1.5), (p < .001), although probabilities were low. Older age, low weight, and HIV infection were associated with s.

### High prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency in combined antiretroviral therapy-naive and successfully treated Swiss HIV patients [^116gyzVY]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate the prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] deficiency in HIV-positive patients, a population at risk for osteoporosis, a retrospective assessment of vitamin D levels was conducted by season and initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART).

25(OH)D was measured in 211 HIV-positive patients. Samples were taken before initiation of cART from February to April or from August to October as well as 12 (same season) and 18 months (alternate season) after starting cART. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D] was measured in a subset of 74 patients. Multivariable analyses included season, sex, age, ethnicity, BMI, intravenous drug use (IDU), renal function, time since HIV diagnosis, previous AIDS, CD4 cell count, and cART, in particular, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and tenofovir (TDF) use.

At baseline, median 25(OH)D levels were 37 nmol/l (interquartile range 20–49) in spring and 57 nmol/l (39–74) in fall. 25(OH)D deficiency less than 30 nmol/l was more prevalent in spring (42%) than in fall (14%) but remained unchanged regardless of cART exposure. In multivariable analysis, 25(OH)D levels were higher in white patients and those with a longer time since HIV diagnosis, and lower in springtime measurements and in those with active IDU and NNRTI use. 1-Hydroxylation rates were significantly higher in patients with low 25(OH)D. Hepatitis C seropositivity, previous AIDS, and higher CD4 cell counts correlated with lower 1,25(OH)2D levels, whereas BMI and TDF use were associated with higher levels.

### Long-term bone mineral density changes in antiretroviral-treated HIV-infected individuals [^1123M3ub]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

We compared adjusted bone mineral density (BMD) changes between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals during the first approximately 7.5 years after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and HIV-uninfected controls. HIV-infected individuals (n = 97) had significantly greater adjusted BMD decline than controls (n = 614) during the first 96 weeks of ART. Subsequently, the rate of BMD decline slowed in HIV-infected individuals but remained greater than the rate of decline in HIV-uninfected individuals at the lumbar spine, but not at the hip. In HIV-infected individuals after 96 weeks, no HIV- or treatment-related characteristic was associated with BMD loss; however, lower lean body mass was associated with greater BMD loss at both the lumbar spine and hip.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among perinatally HIV-infected Thai adolescents receiving antiretroviral therapy [^111oPpnU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

We assessed the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among 101 perinatally HIV-infected Thai adolescents receiving antiretroviral therapy. The median age was 14.3 years (interquartile range 13.0–15.7), and 90% had HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL. The median 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level was 24.8 ng/mL (interquartile range 6.9–46.9); 25 adolescents (24.7%) had vitamin D deficiency (25-OHD < 20 ng/mL) and 47 adolescents (46.5%) had insufficiency (25-OHD 20–30 ng/mL). Adolescents with vitamin D deficiency had significantly higher parathyroid hormone levels (54.9 pg/mL vs. 40.2 pg/mL, P < 0.007). No associations between vitamin D deficiency and body mass index, bone mineral density, efavirenz use, HIV RNA, CD4, or self-reported sunlight exposure were observed.

### Bone mass, fracture risk, and associated factors in postmenopausal women living with HIV [^1138YFkp]. Menopause (2024). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of low bone mass (osteopenia/osteoporosis), the factors associated with low bone mass, and the risk of fractures in Brazilian postmenopausal women living with HIV (WLH) in the Amazon region.

This is a cohort study with a cross-sectional assessment at baseline conducted between March 2021 and August 2022. The study involved 100 postmenopausal WLH undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) aged between 45 and 60 years, and 100 age-matched HIV-negative women. Data on bone mineral density in the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were collected using dual X-ray absorptiometry, and the 10-year risk of hip and major osteoporotic fractures was assessed using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX).

The age of menopause onset occurred earlier in WLH (P < 0.001). No differences in the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in LS and FN were observed, except for a lower T score in FN in WLH (P = 0.039). The FRAX scores for major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture were low in both groups, although the means of both FRAX scores were higher in WLH (P < 0.001).

Multivariate analysis showed that years since menopause onset, higher body mass index, and higher FRAX major osteoporotic fracture scores were associated with the WLH group, while a higher frequency of physical activity was noted in the HIV-negative group. Additionally, in WLH, a lower T score in FN was associated with years since menopause onset and body mass index, and the number of years since menopause onset was associated with a lower T score.

### Bone mineral density in HIV participants randomized to raltegravir and lopinavir/ritonavir compared with standard second line therapy [^111GVMye]. AIDS (2013). Low credibility.

The prevalence of osteopenia (−2.5 < T score < 1.0) at baseline in both treatment groups was 26% across the two anatomical regions, and the prevalence of osteoporosis (T score ≤ −2.5) was 3%. The incidence of low BMD (Z score < −2), osteopenia, and osteoporosis at week 48 was not different between the two treatment arms. Only two (1%) participants experienced a bone fracture: one in the N(t)RTI arm and one in the RAL arm.

The multivariate regression analysis results are summarized in the following points:

- **Predictors of change in BMD**: The covariates that predicted a change in BMD in both the lumbar spine and proximal femur were higher baseline BMI and longer duration of TDF on study. Having a higher baseline BMI predicted greater BMD at week 48; for every 1 kg/m² increase in BMI, the femur BMD increased by 0.5%, and spine BMD by 0.17% (P < 0.01). Participants prescribed TDF for longer throughout the 48 weeks of the study had reduced BMD at week 48; for every 1 year of TDF use on study, the femur BMD reduced by −1.58%, and spine BMD by −1.65% (P = 0.001).

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113XmKuX]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

In people living with HIV (PLWH), calcium and vitamin D supplementation is often recommended alongside bisphosphonates to mitigate bone loss. The mechanism involves vitamin D's role in increasing calcium absorption and reducing bone turnover, which is particularly relevant in HIV patients on ART regimens, such as TDF, known to exacerbate bone loss. Discussions focus on whether a standard dose of vitamin D or a higher dose should be used. Studies have shown that calcium and vitamin D supplementation can reduce bone loss in PLWH, particularly at the hip and lumbar spine, with vitamin D having potential immunomodulatory benefits as well.

However, some studies indicate limited effect in preventing significant bone density loss, especially in those with ongoing risk factors such as low body weight or smoking. Our network meta-analysis revealed that calcium and vitamin D supplementation alone did not significantly improve lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD) compared to placebo. At the total hip, we observed a small improvement (MD: 0.0399 g/cm², 95% CI: 0.0118, 0.0679), though this did not exceed the least significant change (LSC) of 0.027 g/cm². Interestingly, when combined with zoledronate, calcium and vitamin D supplementation further enhances total hip BMD compared to zoledronate alone, as demonstrated by the 95% compatibility intervals and ranking from the network meta-analysis (SUCRA = 63.6–87.4% vs. zoledronate alone at SUCRA = 54.0%). In contrast, multifaceted interventions combining calcium and higher-dose vitamin D did not achieve superior LS-BMD improvements compared to zoledronate alone, with the 95% compatibility intervals between these interventions crossing zero.

### Changes in bone mineral density, body composition, vitamin D status, and mineral metabolism in urban HIV-positive South African women over 12 months [^115V1zpj]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). High credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with bone loss and poor vitamin D status in white populations, though their relative roles are not known. No previous studies have examined longitudinal changes in areal bone mineral density (aBMD), measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), or in vitamin D status in HIV-positive African women. Of 247 premenopausal, urban, black African women from Soweto, South Africa, initially recruited, 187 underwent anthropometry, DXA scanning, and blood and urine collections at both baseline and 12 months. Of these, 67 were HIV-negative throughout (Nref), 60 were HIV-positive with preserved CD4 counts at baseline (Ppres), and 60 were HIV-positive with low CD4 counts at baseline, eligible for ART by South African standards of care at the time (Plow). No participant had been exposed to ART at baseline. By 12 months, 51 Plow women had initiated ART, with over 85% taking combined tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), lamivudine, and efavirenz. By 12 months, both Plow and Nref, but not Ppres, experienced increases in body weight and fat mass (group-by-timepoint p ≤ 0.001, p = 0.002, respectively). Plow had significant decreases in aBMD of 2% to 3%, before and after size adjustment, at the femoral neck (p ≤ 0.002) and lumbar spine (p ≤ 0.001), despite significant weight gain. These decreases were associated with increased bone turnover, but there were no significant differences or changes over time in vitamin D status, serum phosphate concentrations, or renal phosphate handling.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL. Individuals living at high latitudes (above 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.

### Interruption or deferral of antiretroviral therapy reduces markers of bone turnover compared with continuous therapy: The SMART body composition substudy [^111G6jDb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) declines significantly in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We compared the effects of intermittent versus continuous ART on markers of bone turnover in the body composition substudy of the Strategies for Management of AntiRetroviral Therapy (SMART) trial and determined whether early changes in markers predicted subsequent change in BMD.

For 202 participants (median age 44 years, 17% female, 74% on ART) randomized to continuous or intermittent ART, plasma markers of inflammation and bone turnover were evaluated at baseline and months 4 and 12; BMD at the spine (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] and computed tomography) and hip (DXA) was evaluated annually. Compared with the continuous ART group:

- **Markers of bone turnover**: Mean bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP), osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), N-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTX), and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (βCTX) decreased significantly in the intermittent ART group, whereas RANKL and the RANKL:osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio increased (all p ≤ 0.002 at month 4 and month 12).

- **Prediction of BMD changes**: Increases in bALP, osteocalcin, P1NP, NTX, and βCTX at month 4 predicted a decrease in hip BMD at month 12, whereas increases in RANKL and the RANKL:OPG ratio at month 4 predicted increases in hip and spine BMD at month 12.

This study has shown that compared with continuous ART, interruption of ART results in a reduction in markers of bone turnover and an increase in BMD at the hip and spine. Early changes in markers of bone turnover predict BMD.

### Vitamin D and the anti-viral state [^115KhByq]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D has long been recognized as essential to the skeletal system. Newer evidence suggests that it also plays a major role in regulating the immune system, perhaps including immune responses to viral infection. Interventional and observational epidemiological studies provide evidence that vitamin D deficiency may confer increased risk of influenza and respiratory tract infection. Vitamin D deficiency is also prevalent among patients with HIV infection. Cell culture experiments support the thesis that vitamin D has direct anti-viral effects, particularly against enveloped viruses. Though vitamin D's anti-viral mechanism has not been fully established, it may be linked to vitamin D's ability to up-regulate the anti-microbial peptides LL-37 and human beta defensin 2. Additional studies are necessary to fully elucidate the efficacy and mechanism of vitamin D as an anti-viral agent.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115Bf9Vi]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

- **Sensitivity and subgroup analyses**: Our sensitivity analysis excluded two trials with imputed BMD data, examining nine trials that reported percentage changes from baseline (Appendix 12). Zoledronate-based regimens demonstrated superior efficacy. For LS-BMD, zoledronate combined with calcium and higher-dose vitamin D showed the strongest results (SUCRA = 83.0; wMD = 5.72% vs. placebo, 95% compatibility interval [1.68, 9.81]), while for TH-BMD, zoledronate with calcium and standard-dose vitamin D ranked highest (SUCRA = 83.6%; wMD = 4.17% vs. placebo, 95% compatibility interval [0.61, 7.73]).

Subgroup analysis of the ART-experienced population (nine trials, Appendix 13.1.2) demonstrated findings consistent with the mixed population analysis. For LS-BMD, intravenous zoledronate with calcium and higher-dose vitamin D ranked highest (SUCRA = 94.4%; wMD = 0.06 g/cm² vs. calcium and standard-dose vitamin D, 95% compatibility interval [0.01, 0.12]). For TH-BMD, zoledronate with calcium and standard-dose vitamin D showed the best results (SUCRA = 87.2%; wMD = 0.03 g/cm² vs. calcium and standard-dose vitamin D, 95% compatibility interval [0.00, 0.06]).

The analysis of ART-naïve patients was more limited in scope, encompassing only three trials for LS-BMD and two trials for TH-BMD. These trials compared three interventions: intravenous zoledronate alone, calcium with higher-dose vitamin D, and placebo. Notably, despite zoledronate's known potency as a bisphosphonate, no intervention demonstrated clear superiority. The treatments showed remarkable consistency across trials.

### Antiretroviral therapy and periarticular osteonecrosis development in patients with HIV [^112gigCr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Low credibility.

With modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV has become a chronic condition. Previous studies have not definitively assessed the risk of periarticular osteonecrosis (ON) that ART poses to the HIV population.

- **Methods**: A retrospective case-control study using the PearlDiver database was conducted using International Classification of Diseases codes. Patients were selected from 2010 to 2019 with a diagnosis of periarticular ON and HIV, both taking ART (HIV+/ART+) and not taking ART (HIV+/ART-). The control group consisted of HIV-negative patients not on ART. Subcategorization was performed by the affected joint — hip, knee, or shoulder — excluding patients with ON of the jaw. Chi-squared univariate analysis was used to compare incidence rates and control for age, sex, Elixhauser comorbidities, and other known risk factors for developing ON in multivariable analysis.

- **Results**: In total, 219,853 patients had HIV between 2010 and 2019. Of those patients, 123,710 (56.27%) had a history of ART (HIV+/ART+), while 96,143 (43.74%) did not (HIV+/ART-). The difference in incidence rates for HIV+/ART+ was higher in any joint (+1.7%), as well as the hip (+1.31%), knee (+0.08%), and shoulder (+0.08%). All risk factors met inclusion criteria in the multivariate analysis except coagulopathy. Multivariate analysis found that patients in the HIV+/ART+ cohort had higher odds of developing periarticular ON when compared with the HIV+/ART- cohort in any joint (odds ratio = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.42), hip (OR: 1.41; 95% CI, 1.38–1.43), knee (OR: 2.56; 95% CI, 2.39 to…).

### Bone mass, fracture risk, and associated factors in postmenopausal women living with HIV [^1149TAW4]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: This cohort study with a cross-sectional assessment at baseline was conducted between March 2021 and August 2022 in Manaus, the capital of the Brazilian state of Amazonas. In 2021, this state reported an HIV infection rate 3.2 times higher than the national rate.

Two hundred women, between 45 and 60 years old, with self-reported menopause (defined as more than 1 year of amenorrhea) were invited to participate after clinical referral during their routine appointments. The 100 women living with HIV (WLH) had their HIV diagnosis confirmed according to the country-approved HIV testing algorithm and had been on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 1 year. These women attended routine HIV/AIDS visits at the outpatient services of the Tropical Medicine Foundation Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) and four local clinics. The 100 uninfected women were invited to participate during appointments at the ultrasound service of one clinic (Codajás Policlinic) and were enrolled after receiving an HIV-negative result from a rapid diagnostic test performed during their appointments.

Women in both groups were excluded if they had a history of hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or were unable to answer the questionnaire. All participants signed the informed consent form. This study was reviewed by the ethics review committee of the FMT-HVD, Manaus, Brazil, and was approved on October 19, 2020 (approval number: 4.346.088).

### Bone mineral density in Black South African women newly diagnosed with breast cancer living with and without HIV [^114qvPbR]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Worsening bone mineral density (BMD) and the corresponding increase in osteoporotic fractures is an important and well-established source of morbidity and mortality in women receiving treatment for breast cancer, as well as those living with HIV. However, there are comparatively few reports on pretreatment bone health in women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, especially in predominantly Black populations across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and among individuals living with HIV. Therefore, we sought to characterize bone health in a cohort of Black South African women with and without HIV before the initiation of systemic breast cancer therapy, in particular chemotherapy and/or aromatase inhibitors.

- **Methods**: Building on the South African Breast Cancer and HIV Outcomes study, we recruited consecutive women newly diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer who were to start systemic cancer therapy at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg, between June 2021 and August 2024. In addition to collecting extensive demographic and clinical information, we conducted dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans on each patient to measure BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip.

- **Results**: We enrolled a total of 378 women, 32.3% of whom (n = 122) were living with HIV. Among women aged 50 years and older (n = 156), 64.1% had osteopenia or osteoporosis; HIV infection and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency — but no breast cancer characteristics — were associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis. By contrast, 3.6% of women younger than 50 years old showed similar bone health issues.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: Insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114p7dNY]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

With life expectancy for people living with HIV (PLWH) approaching that of the general population, age-related conditions like osteoporosis are increasingly common. Both HIV infection and long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART), particularly tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), are associated with early-onset osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are commonly used for treatment, but the optimal strategy for improving bone health in PLWH remains unclear.

We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) with component analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified from Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL EBSCO databases, from inception to December 1, 2024. The study included RCTs comparing zoledronate, alendronate, calcium and vitamin D, and their combinations in PLWH with osteoporosis. The primary outcomes were changes in lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density (LS-BMD and TH-BMD). Secondary outcomes included changes in bone turnover markers (BTMs) — C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx) and osteocalcin (OC) — as well as major adverse events associated with anti-osteoporosis medication (AOMs). Data were analyzed using a component NMA approach to compare treatment strategies. The study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO: CRD42023475160.

A total of 11 RCTs involving 816 participants were included. In mixed PLWH populations, zoledronate-based regimens significantly improved LS-BMD [weighted mean difference (wMD): 0.0821–0.0985 g/cm²; certainty of evidence (CoE): very low to low] and TH-BMD.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: Insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1134c9sX]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Our research has several important limitations. First, most included trials had relatively short follow-up periods, typically within one year, with only three trials extending to two years. This limitation is particularly significant given clinical recommendations that suggest evaluating bisphosphonate effectiveness via DXA scanning after 2 years and reassessing treatment every 3–5 years. Longer-duration trials are needed to determine the persistence of therapeutic benefits beyond the first year.

Second, our network meta-analysis was restricted to adult populations, highlighting a critical gap in pediatric research.

Third, while most outcomes (LS-BMD, TH-BMD, and osteocalcin) supported the normality assumption with |mean/SD| ratios < 2, some CTx data showed potential skewness with ratios exceeding 2.

Fourth, the presence of trials with relatively small sample sizes may introduce small-sample bias. Although the use of mean differences for BMD outcomes helps mitigate this concern, results should be interpreted cautiously, particularly for secondary outcomes and comparisons with fewer participants.

Fifth, our analysis of osteocalcin changes was limited by insufficient trials, inconsistent interventions, and significant population heterogeneity, which compromised statistical power and reliability.

Sixth, following International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) recommendations for reference analytes (s-PINP for bone formation, serum CTX for resorption), PINP analysis was precluded by limited data, with only two trials measuring P1NP and only one providing one-year results.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1116ZxDa]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

The analysis evaluated seven interventions (Appendix 4.3.2): (1) intravenous zoledronate alone (2 trials; 70 patients; all ART-naïve); (2) intravenous zoledronate combined with calcium and standard-dose vitamin D (2 trials; 36 patients; all ART-experienced); (3) intravenous zoledronate combined with calcium and higher-dose vitamin D (1 trial; 21 patients; all ART-experienced); (4) alendronate with calcium and standard vitamin D (4 trials; 95 patients; all ART-experienced); (5) calcium with standard-dose vitamin D (7 trials; 232 patients; all ART-experienced); (6) calcium with higher-dose vitamin D (3 trials; 209 patients; ART-experienced 62%); and (7) placebo (3 trials; 153 patients; all ART-naïve).

Detailed trial results and information on transitivity are presented in Appendices 4 and 5, respectively. Network plots, SUCRA-based rankings, and forest plots for individual outcomes are shown in Fig. 2. Pairwise meta-analysis outcomes, along with heterogeneity results and NMA results with certainty ratings, are displayed in league tables (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6). The relative rankings of all outcomes are listed in Appendix 7. Baseline biochemical parameters varied across studies (detailed in Appendix 4.3.1).

Three studies excluded vitamin D-deficient participants at enrollment. Among the six trials reporting baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, values ranged from 14.5 to 43 ng/ml, with most participants being vitamin D sufficient (> 20 ng/ml).

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^1163Tpwm]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The national guidance on the management of vitamin D has, unsurprisingly, led to controversy and confusion in managing vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK. We therefore welcome, in this edition, an authoritative practical clinical guideline by the National Osteoporosis Society UK on the management of vitamin D deficiency. The guideline has been designed to assist clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dieticians, and other practicing clinicians.

- **Key recommendations include**:
	- The best way of estimating vitamin D status
	- Recommendations for vitamin D testing
	- Threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency
	- Treatment of choice for vitamin D deficiency
	- Guidance on rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency
	- Guidance on maintenance therapy
	- Guidance on monitoring blood tests

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem, with a plethora of conflicting guidance and inconsistent clinical management across the UK. We welcome this authoritative guidance, which will help towards better care and management of patients.

- **Key points**:
	- The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high worldwide, particularly in the elderly.
	- 25OHD is the best marker of vitamin D status and is defined as a 25OHD < 30 nmol/l.
	- The primary role of vitamin D is the maintenance of extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, but more recently it has been associated with many other conditions.
	- Vitamin D deficiency is associated with muscle weakness, predominantly of the proximal muscle groups, through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.

### Optimizing bone health in people living with HIV: Insights from a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113pLEMR]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

At the time of writing, only three meta-analyses have been performed to explore pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis in people living with HIV (PLWH), each with limited scope and focused on pairwise meta-analyses. One review examined the impact of vitamin D on bone health, another included three trials assessing the effect of oral bisphosphonates, and the third combined all bisphosphonates but evaluated only changes in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD). With the increasing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the introduction of intravenous bisphosphonates, the comparative efficacy and safety of different bisphosphonates in PLWH remain unclear. Additionally, the adequacy of standard doses of vitamin D for PLWH is still under question. Therefore, our research aims to conduct a comprehensive network meta-analysis and systematic review to compare the effects of various pharmacological treatments, with a particular focus on bisphosphonates and the adjunct use of calcium and vitamin D, on bone health in PLWH. Outcomes will include BMD, bone turnover markers, and anti-osteoporosis medications (AOMs) related to major adverse events.

Although osteopenia is common in HIV-infected patients, there is limited data on the evolution of bone mineral density in this population. We aimed to evaluate the course of osteopenia over a 2-year period in HIV-1-infected men and to identify risk factors for abnormal bone mineral density (BMD) decline.

- **Methods**: HIV-1-infected men on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) were screened in the ANRS 120 Fosivir trial. These individuals were diagnosed with low BMD (-2.5 ≤ T-score 1 SDD) associated with TDF exposure.

### Effects of vitamin D deficiency and combination antiretroviral therapy on bone in HIV-positive patients [^117Au6Tg]. AIDS (2012). Low credibility.

In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), vitamin D deficiency, low bone mineral density (BMD), and fractures have emerged as subjects of concern in HIV-positive patients. Testing for vitamin D deficiency has been widely adopted in clinical practice even though the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in this population remain uncertain. The objective of this review was to evaluate the evidence for such a strategy.

- **Design**: Systematic review of the literature on vitamin D deficiency in HIV infection, the effects of cART on vitamin D status, and the effects of vitamin D deficiency and cART on parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone turnover, BMD, and the incidence of fractures in HIV-positive patients.

- **Methods**: PubMed was used to identify relevant articles up to September 2011.

- **Results**: Vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and low BMD are common in HIV-positive patients. Efavirenz is associated with a reduction in 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, tenofovir with secondary hyperparathyroidism, and cART with increased bone turnover and low BMD. The clinical significance of low BMD, however, remains unclear, especially in younger patients. Although the incidence of fractures may be increased in HIV-positive patients, the contribution of low BMD and vitamin D deficiency to these fractures is uncertain. Limited data on vitamin D supplementation in HIV-positive patients have shown transient, beneficial effects on PTH, but no effects on BMD.

- **Conclusion**: The benefits of vitamin D supplementation in this population need to be demonstrated before widespread implementation.
