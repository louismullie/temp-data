## Question

How deep should you go while doing a shave biopsy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how deep a shave biopsy should go and how to tailor the depth for different clinical scenarios, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and special sites, while preserving diagnostic accuracy and avoiding transection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that governs shave depth. Then, I should verify how this principle translates into concrete depths for melanoma, BCC, and cSCC. Next, I will examine exceptions where a superficial shave is acceptable. After that, I need to check the consequences of going too shallow versus too deep. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, scenario-based recommendation and ensure it aligns with major guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core principle so I don't jump to conclusions: shave depth should be sufficient to capture the entire lesion down to and just below the anticipated plane of the lesion so that the specimen includes the base and avoids transection, which preserves accurate histopathologic diagnosis and staging, especially for melanoma where Breslow thickness drives management and prognosis [^114R5Xio] [^111Xa2fK] [^112ZPRAR].

> Now, for melanoma specifically, I need to ensure the depth recommendation is precise: preferred technique is a narrow-margin excisional/complete biopsy with 1–3 mm margins and sufficient depth to prevent transection at the base. This can be achieved by elliptical excision, punch excision around the lesion, or deep shave/saucerization to a depth below the anticipated plane of the lesion, which practically means extending into the deep reticular dermis or to the subcutaneous fat when needed to clear the base [^114R5Xio] [^111Xa2fK] [^112ZPRAR] [^1155GuEZ].

> Wait, let me verify the practical depth range for a "deep shave" or saucerization in melanoma: most descriptions situate the plane in the mid-to-deep reticular dermis, and when the lesion is expected to be thicker, extending to just above or into superficial subcutaneous tissue is reasonable to avoid transection. Importantly, superficial/tangential shaves are discouraged for clinically suspected invasive melanoma because they can underestimate Breslow thickness and compromise staging, with the notable exception of melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type, where a broad shave into the deep papillary or superficial reticular dermis can optimize sampling of focal invasion across a broad field [^113mNzz4] [^1175zCuA] [^113Pc9XA].

> For basal cell carcinoma, I should confirm that infiltrative or deeper components must be captured: guidelines emphasize that biopsy should include the deep reticular dermis because infiltrative histology may lie only at deeper advancing margins and superficial shaves will miss it. In practice, that means extending to at least the mid-to-deep reticular dermis, and for suspected deeper invasion, going to the subcutis is prudent to avoid underdiagnosis of aggressive subtypes [^116poSa1] [^113bBCeR].

> For cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, hold on, I should verify whether the same "deep enough" rule applies: yes, the biopsy size and depth should be adequate to provide the recommended clinical information and pathology elements to permit accurate diagnosis and guide therapy, including identifying an aggressive growth pattern if present. For large or high-risk tumors, a full-thickness incisional or punch biopsy incorporating peripheral and deep margins is preferred to ensure accurate grading and staging before definitive therapy [^111cpccD] [^111B6xur] [^112A8kQ5] [^117N5M2Y].

> But wait, what if the lesion is benign-appearing or the suspicion for invasion is low — can a superficial shave suffice? Let me reconsider: for clearly superficial lesions such as seborrheic keratosis, actinic keratosis, or warts, a superficial shave to the mid dermis is appropriate; similarly, in low-suspicion settings for melanoma, a superficial shave may be acceptable, though it risks incomplete sampling if invasion is present, so clinical judgment is key and any residual pigment or uncertainty warrants deeper sampling or excision [^111ipKLq] [^1175zCuA].

> I need to check the consequences of going too shallow: positive deep margins are common with superficial shaves, especially in melanoma, which can lead to understaging. Meta-analytic data show positive deep margins in about 42.9% of melanomas diagnosed by shave biopsy, and a separate series found positive deep margins in 22% of shave melanoma biopsies, with higher rates in lesions ≤ 1 mm, underscoring the risk of transection and incomplete assessment of Breslow thickness [^112rha6B] [^115z1Y1M].

> Hold on, I should verify whether going too deep causes problems: extending into subcutaneous fat is acceptable when the lesion is expected to reach that plane, and it does not inherently worsen cosmetic outcomes if the plane is controlled. However, unnecessarily deep shaves can create larger defects and scarring, so the depth should match the anticipated lesion depth rather than being uniformly deep in all cases [^114R5Xio] [^117FUzZW].

> Next, I should review special anatomic sites where depth must be individualized: on the face, ears, acral sites, or digits, where tissue is thin or cosmetically sensitive, a full-thickness incisional or punch biopsy of the thickest/atypical portion may be preferred to balance diagnostic yield with function and cosmesis. For nail matrix lesions, matrix shave techniques can be used to sample deeply while preserving architecture when appropriate [^112ZPRAR] [^111EBjyt].

> Let me synthesize a practical, scenario-based answer: for a suspected melanoma, aim for a deep shave/saucerization that extends to or just below the anticipated plane of invasion, typically into the deep reticular dermis and to superficial subcutis if the lesion is expected to be thicker, with 1–3 mm margins, to avoid transection. For BCC, extend to at least the deep reticular dermis to capture infiltrative components. For cSCC, ensure depth is adequate to assess invasion and grade, often full-thickness in higher-risk scenarios. For clearly superficial benign lesions, a mid-dermal shave is fine. If in doubt, err deeper to avoid a non-diagnostic transected base and plan definitive therapy accordingly [^114R5Xio] [^111Xa2fK] [^112ZPRAR] [^116poSa1] [^111cpccD].

> Finally, I should double-check that this approach aligns with outcomes data: although positive deep margins are not rare with shave biopsies, contemporary series suggest that when deep shaves are performed thoughtfully, changes in management due to upstaging are infrequent and survival is not adversely affected compared with other biopsy modalities, reinforcing that the key is adequate depth and complete sampling rather than the specific instrument used [^112rha6B] [^114mcsiy] [^116Xcx2r].

Shave biopsy depth should extend to the **mid-to-deep dermis** to ensure adequate tissue for diagnosis while minimizing scarring and recurrence [^113bBCeR]. For suspected melanoma, use a **deep shave or saucerization** to avoid transection and preserve Breslow depth accuracy [^114R5Xio] [^111Xa2fK]. For BCC or SCC, extend to the **deep reticular dermis** to capture infiltrative or invasive components [^116poSa1] [^117N5M2Y]. Avoid subcutaneous fat unless the lesion is suspected to extend that deep, and adjust depth to lesion morphology and location [^111B6xur].

---

## General principles of shave biopsy depth

- **Mid-to-deep dermis**: Standard depth is the mid-to-deep dermis, balancing diagnostic yield with cosmetic outcomes [^111ipKLq].
- **Avoid subcutaneous fat**: Unless the lesion is suspected to extend into fat, avoid subcutaneous tissue to minimize scarring and recurrence [^111ipKLq].
- **Adjust to morphology**: Depth should be tailored to lesion type, size, and location [^111B6xur].

---

## Specific recommendations by lesion type

| **Lesion type** | **Recommended depth** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Melanoma | Deep shave (saucerization) to below anticipated lesion plane | - Avoid transection <br/> - Preserve Breslow depth <br/> - Enable accurate staging [^114R5Xio] [^111Xa2fK] [^112ZPRAR] |
| Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) | Deep reticular dermis | Capture infiltrative components and avoid underestimation of depth [^116poSa1] [^113bBCeR] |
| Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) | Deep reticular dermis | Identify invasive components and guide definitive treatment [^111cpccD] [^111B6xur] |
| Benign lesions (e.g. seborrheic keratosis, warts) | Superficial dermis | Minimize scarring and recurrence [^111ipKLq] |

---

## Risks of inadequate depth

- **Positive margins**: Shallow biopsies risk positive deep margins, leading to recurrence or understaging [^115z1Y1M] [^112rha6B].
- **Misdiagnosis**: Inadequate depth can miss infiltrative or invasive components, causing misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment [^116poSa1].
- **Recurrence**: Insufficient depth increases recurrence risk, particularly in BCC and SCC [^117UgTUq].

---

## Risks of excessive depth

Excessive depth can cause **increased scarring**, particularly on the face or cosmetically sensitive areas [^111ipKLq]. It may also lead to **unnecessary morbidity**, including larger defects and the potential need for reconstruction [^116khUet].

---

## Clinical factors influencing depth selection

- **Lesion morphology**: Raised lesions may require deeper shaves than flat lesions [^114tgNys].
- **Anatomic location**: Face, ears, and hands require careful depth selection to balance diagnostic yield with cosmetic outcomes [^111B6xur].
- **Patient factors**: Bleeding diathesis, anticoagulation, and patient preference may influence depth selection [^117RwNxg].

---

## Post-biopsy considerations

Post-biopsy considerations include **hemostasis**, for which electrocautery or topical agents (e.g. aluminum chloride) are preferred to minimize tissue damage and scarring [^113mNzz4]. Wound care should include clear instructions to reduce infection and scarring risk [^notfound]. Patients should be monitored for recurrence or complications, especially if margins are positive or the lesion is high risk [^116khUet].

---

Shave biopsy depth should be tailored to lesion type and location, generally reaching the **mid-to-deep dermis** to balance diagnostic accuracy with cosmetic outcomes. Deep shaves or saucerization are preferred for melanoma, while BCC and SCC require sufficient depth to capture infiltrative components.

### Biopsy type does not affect the number of stages during mohs micrographic surgery: a retrospective study [^111k8E2f]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is the treatment of choice for high-risk basal cell carcinoma (BCC). However, there are no evidence-based recommendations regarding which biopsy type is more appropriate to obtain tumour samples prior to MMS. Shave or punch biopsies are performed depending on the clinical characteristics of the tumour, surgeon experience and local protocols. However, biopsy type might result in difficult histopathological interpretation and influence the practical implementation of MMS. We performed a retrospective study on 208 consecutive BCCs treated with MMS. Of the 208 BCC biopsies, 42 (20.2%) were obtained by the shave method and 166 (79.8%) via punch. Those obtained with the shave technique had a mean of 1.64 stages vs. 1.69 stages with the punch technique (P = 0.130). These findings suggest biopsy type does not affect Mohs surgery performance. The biopsy type of choice is the one deemed adequate for each specific case to obtain a diagnosis and tumour subtyping.

### Margin assessment for punch and shave biopsies of dysplastic nevi [^112aeeau]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Biopsies of atypical melanocytic nevi are among the most commonly performed procedures by dermatologists. Margin assessment is often used to guide re-excision, but can be a point of confusion as negative margins reported in the planes of sections examined do not always reflect complete removal of a lesion. This study investigates the rates of false negative margins after both punch and shave biopsies.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 50 consecutive punch and shave biopsy specimens (1) diagnosed as DN, and (2) reported as having clear margins in the planes of section examined. Identified specimen blocks were then sectioned through to examine true margin involvement.

Results

Of the 50 specimens identified, 20% (n = 10) were found to have positive margins upon additional sectioning. We found no difference between the groups with respect to biopsy technique, type of nevus, degree of atypia, or gender.

Conclusion

This study observed false negative peripheral margin status in a sizeable proportion of biopsy specimens, which did not vary significantly based on biopsy technique or pathologic characteristics. This finding reflects a limitation of standard tissue processing, in which a limited proportion of the true margin is evaluated, and may be of note to many dermatologists who base their decision to re-excise on the reporting of margin involvement.

### Microcystic adnexal carcinoma: a review of the literature [^116it58a]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is a rare, locally aggressive cutaneous neoplasm that commonly occurs on the face.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to comprehensively review the current literature on MAC pertaining to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, histology, immunohistochemistry, prognosis, follow-up, and treatment.

Materials and Methods

An extensive literature review was conducted using OVID MEDLINE and PubMed to identify articles relating to MAC.

Results

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma typically presents as a skin-colored nodule on the face. The pathogenesis is mostly related to pilar and eccrine differentiation. Histologically, MAC can mimic syringoma, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, and infiltrative basal cell carcinoma. Diagnosis is challenging because superficial shave biopsies may reveal only benign findings that do not warrant further management. A deep biopsy is mandatory for the correct diagnosis, and Mohs micrographic surgery provides the highest cure rate.

Conclusion

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a locally aggressive disease with histological margins that often far surpass what is clinically suspected. Mohs micrographic surgery is the standard of care for removal of these lesions. Patients with a history of MAC should be examined at least every 6 months for recurrence, metastasis, and development of additional skin cancers.

Regarding medical management for basal cell carcinoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of high-risk basal cell carcinoma (primary treatment), NCCN 2023 guidelines recommend to consider curettage and electrodessication or shave removal as an alternative primary treatment option for clinically diagnosed non-facial basal cell carcinomas < 6 mm in depth on the head, neck, hands, feet, pretibial, and anogenital area that are clinically confined to the dermis, if Mohs surgery, resection with post-definitive excision margin assessment, and standard excision are difficult to perform due to patient comorbidities (e.g., thrombocytopenia, immunosuppression, bleeding diathesis, multiple primary basal cell carcinomas).

### Cutaneous malignant melanoma: a primary care perspective [^113jRRfk]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Cutaneous malignant melanoma accounts for 3 to 5 percent of all skin cancers and is responsible for approximately 75 percent of all deaths from skin cancer. Persons with an increased number of moles, dysplastic (also called atypical) nevi, or a family history of the disease are at increased risk compared with the general population. An important tool to assist in the evaluation of potential melanomas for patients and health care professionals is the ABCDE mnemonic, which takes into account asymmetry, border irregularities, color variation, diameter, and evolution. Any suspicious pigmented lesion should be biopsied. Appropriate methods of biopsy can vary, and include deep shave, punch, and excisional biopsy. Regardless of the procedure selected, it is essential that the size of the specimen be adequate to determine the histologic depth of lesion penetration, which is known as the Breslow depth. The Breslow depth is the most important prognostic parameter in evaluating the primary tumor. Because early detection and treatment can lead to identification of thinner lesions, which may increase survival, it is critical that physicians be comfortable with evaluating suspicious pigmented lesions and providing treatment or referral as necessary.

### Self supervised artificial intelligence predicts poor outcome from primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma at diagnosis [^113UMsiC]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Other differences and potential confounding factors between the development and the test set are the type of biopsy and the source of the anatomic site. While the NYU cohort had nearly as many slides from excision as from shave biopsies, the CAUSA test cohort is exclusively composed of wide local excision, and the Mayo cohort, on the other hand, is mostly dominated by shave biopsy (Supplementary Table 1). We notice that most HPCs contain tiles from all types of preparations (Supplementary Figs. 3e, 4d). In some rare HPCs, the relative proportion of tiles between excision and biopsies varies more (Supplementary Figs. 3d, 4c): for example, HPCs 1 and 13, located at the top left of the PAGA graph and contain subcutaneous fat/tissues, are relatively more rare in shave biopsies than excisions, which is consistent considering that the depth of the shave samples is thinner than excisions which are often full-thickness. While the survival prediction pipeline seems to perform well on both the shave and excision biopsies specimens from the Mayo cohort (Supplementary Fig. 17 a–c), we cannot rule out that with larger training set, a biopsy-type specific Cox Regression approach would lead to even better performances, specially for wide local excisions specimens like those used in the CAUSA cohort. Finally, because the anatomic sites are so diverse compared to the number of patients available, conclusions regarding potential biases are more difficult to draw but we notice as well that most HPCs contain at least a few tiles from most sites (Supplementary Figs. 3f, g, 4e, f, 5 c, d). At this stage, we did not identify either impact from the tissue source on the survival prediction, though larger per source cohorts would be needed (Supplementary Fig. 17d, e).

### Clinical impact and accuracy of shave biopsy for initial diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma [^116Xcx2r]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Effective treatment of malignant melanomas is dependent upon accurate histopathological staging of preoperative biopsy specimens. While narrow excision is the gold standard for melanoma diagnosis, superficial shave biopsies have become the preferred method by dermatologists but may transect the lesion and result in inaccurate Breslow thickness assessment. This is a retrospective cohort study evaluating an initial method of biopsy for diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma and indication for reoperation based on inaccurate initial T-staging.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients referred to the Medical College of Wisconsin, a tertiary cancer center, with a diagnosis of primary cutaneous melanoma. Adult patients seen between 2015 and 2018 were included. Fisher's exact test was used to assess the association between method of initial biopsy and need for unplanned reoperation.

Results

Three hundred twenty three patients with cutaneous melanoma from the head and neck (H&N, n = 101, 31%), trunk (n = 90, 15%), upper extremity (n = 84, 26%), and lower extremity (n = 48, 28%) were analyzed. Median Breslow thickness was 0.54 mm (interquartile range = 0.65). Shave biopsy was the method of initial biopsy in 244 (76%), excision in 23 (7%), and punch biopsy in 56 (17%). Thirty nine (33%) shave biopsies had a positive deep margin, as did seven (23%) punch biopsies and 0 excisional biopsies. Residual melanoma at definitive excision was found in 131 (42.5%) of all surgical specimens: 95 (40.6%) shave biopsy patients, 32 (60.4%) punch biopsy patients, and four (19.0%) excision biopsy patients. Recommendations for excision margin or sentinel lymph node biopsy changed in 15 (6%) shave biopsy patients and five (9%) punch biopsy patients.

Conclusions

Shave biopsy is the most frequent method of diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma in the modern era. While shave and punch biopsies may underestimate true T-stage, there was no difference in need for reoperation due to T-upstaging based on initial biopsy type, supporting current diagnostic practices. Partial biopsies can thus be used to guide appropriate treatment and definitive wide local excision when adjusting for understaging.

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116poSa1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Clinical presentation and workup of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) — On clinical presentation of a lesion suspicious for skin cancer, workup for BCC begins with a history and physical examination, biopsy, and if applicable a shave removal. A skin biopsy is then performed on any suspicious lesion, and the biopsy should include deep reticular dermis because infiltrative histology may be present only at deeper, advancing margins and superficial biopsies will frequently miss this component. After BCC diagnosis, a full skin examination is recommended since individuals with skin cancer often have additional, concurrent precancers or cancers at other sun-exposed sites and are also at increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma.

### Outcomes of transected melanoma diagnosed by shave biopsy: a single-institution retrospective analysis [^1137eQYV]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the histologic analysis of melanoma, Breslow depth is a critical component of prognostication. Transecting the tumor through tangential biopsy technique potentially affects staging, treatment, and outcomes.

Objective

Compare outcomes of transected and nontransected melanomas biopsied by tangential biopsy technique.

Patients and Methods

This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. Patients were matched based on American Joint Commission on Cancer eighth edition Tumor (T) stage and tumor transection status.

Results

Patients with transected melanomas experienced significant increases in 5-year recurrence (p = .023), 5-year mortality (p = .004), metastasis (p = .035), and melanoma-related mortality (p = .002). However, after stratifying by T stage, there were no significant differences in recurrence, metastasis, or mortality between transected and nontransected tumors. Transected tumors < 1.0 mm had a higher rate of sentinel lymph node biopsies (SNLB) performed compared with the nontransected tumors < 1.0 mm. Limitations include population size, single-institution retrospective nature of the study, and homogenous population.

Conclusion

While there were no significant differences in patient outcomes by T stage when melanomas were transected by shave biopsy, shallow (< 1.0 mm) transected melanomas were more likely to receive sentinel lymph node biopsy compared with nontransected melanomas. Biopsy technique should aim to a depth that provides the full Breslow depth of melanoma tumors.

### Basal cell skin cancer, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111uhjnw]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Basal cell skin cancer — principles of excision reporting state that "The intent of excision is to clear the tumor and thus margin status needs to be reported". For saucerization specimens "intended for definitive surgical therapy should be labeled as such, as they can be histopathologically difficult to distinguish from shave biopsies but must be evaluated for margin status". Excision requisitions should include "patient age and gender, anatomic location, clinical diameter of lesion, and additional clinical information listed above under Principles of Biopsy Reporting". Minimal elements for surgical specimens include "histologic subtype of BCC, a invasion of tumor beyond deep reticular dermis, presence of perineural invasion (if involving nerve below dermis or if largest nerve involved is ≥ 0.1 mm in caliber) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and peripheral and deep margin status". For Mohs excisions, "reporting of these elements is also encouraged", and because "Since depth of invasion (in mm) may not be ascertained on tangentially cut Mohs specimens, anatomic level of invasion should be reported". Additionally, "Frozen or permanent section analysis of the clinical tumor specimen may be undertaken if needed for complete reporting of features associated with poor prognosis".

### NCCN guidelines® insights: squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^116khUet]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Low-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) — primary and additional treatment are as follows: Primary treatment includes C&E or shave removal; standard excision with 4- to 6-mm clinical margins and postoperative margin assessment, with tissue rearrangement (eg, flap reconstruction, extensive undermining) should not be undertaken until clear margins are identified; Mohs or other forms of peripheral and deep en face margin assessment (PDEMA); or consultation with radiation oncologist for nonsurgical candidates. If tumor appears to extend beyond the dermis, surgical excision should generally be performed rather than C&E or shave removal. When Mohs is being performed and the preoperative biopsy is considered insufficient for staging, submission of the central specimen for vertical paraffin-embedded permanent sections or documentation of staging parameters in Mohs report is recommended, and Mohs surgery should be performed by dermatologic surgeons who have specialized training and experience in this procedure. For additional treatment with positive margins, options include Mohs or other forms of PDEMA, re-excision if clinically feasible, or RT for nonsurgical candidates; with negative margins proceed to follow-up (SCC-11). Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Evaluating invasive cutaneous melanoma: is the initial biopsy representative of the final depth? [^114nUw2y]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

An accurate initial biopsy of the deepest portion of the melanoma is vital to the management of patients with melanomas.

Objective

Our goal was to evaluate the accuracy of preliminary biopsies performed by a group of predominantly experienced dermatologists (n = 46/72).

Methods

A total of 145 cases of cutaneous melanoma were examined retrospectively. We compared Breslow depth on preliminary biopsy with Breslow depth on subsequent excision. Was the initial diagnostic biopsy performed on the deepest part of the melanoma?

Results

Of nonexcisional initial shave and punch biopsies, 88% were accurate, with Breslow depth greater than or equal to subsequent excision Breslow depth. Both superficial and deep shave biopsies were more accurate than punch biopsy for melanomas less than 1 mm. Excisional biopsy was found to be the most accurate method of biopsy.

Conclusions

Deep shave biopsy is preferable to superficial shave or punch biopsy for thin and intermediate depth (< 2 mm) melanomas when an initial sample is taken for diagnosis instead of complete excision. We found that a group of predominantly experienced dermatologists accurately assessed the depth of invasive melanoma by use of a variety of initial biopsy types.

### Guidelines of care for the management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^111cpccD]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) biopsy — For suspected cSCC, the recommended biopsy techniques are punch biopsy, shave biopsy, and excisional biopsy, and the technique used will depend on the characteristics of the suspected malignancy and the judgment of the physician. The biopsy size and depth should be adequate to provide the recommended clinical information and pathology report elements to permit accurate diagnosis and guide therapy, and repeat biopsy may be considered if the initial biopsy specimen is inadequate for accurate diagnosis.

### Screening for skin cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112eEe3z]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Harms of screening and treatment — two small fair-quality nonrandomized studies evaluated harms; a fair-quality study (n = 45) in Germany assessed cosmetic acceptance after three shave excisions at 6 months and reported that patients judged 7% of shave sites as having poor cosmetic outcomes; a fair-quality US-based study (n = 187) assessed psychological harms and health-related quality of life at 5 and 8 months after screening with visual examination and subsequent diagnostic biopsy as indicated, and scores in both the screened and unscreened groups were within the normal range on all measures, indicating there were no significant psychological effects.

### Margin status in shave biopsies of nonmelanoma skin cancers: is It worth reporting? [^115CPkzE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

-The practice of reporting margin status in biopsies is relatively unique to biopsies of the skin and highly variable among pathologists.

Objective

-To address the accuracy of margin evaluation in shave biopsies of nonmelanoma skin cancers.

Design

-We collected shave biopsies of squamous and basal cell carcinomas that appeared to have uninvolved margins on routine sign out. We obtained deeper levels on corresponding tissue blocks until blocks were exhausted and examined them for tumor at biopsy margins.

Results

-Forty-seven consecutive cases were collected, including 20 squamous cell (43%) and 27 basal cell (57%) carcinomas. Eleven of 47 cases (23%) with negative margins at initial diagnosis demonstrated positive margins upon deeper-level examination. Margins of 8 of 27 basal cell carcinomas (30%) and 3 of 20 squamous cell carcinomas (15%) were erroneously classified as "negative" on routine examination.

Conclusions

-No guidelines exist regarding the reporting of margins in nonmelanoma skin cancer biopsies, and reporting practices vary extensively among pathologists. We found that nearly one-quarter of positive margins in shave biopsies for cutaneous carcinomas are missed on standard histologic examination. Moreover, reporting of a positive margin may also be misleading if the clinician has definitively treated the skin cancer at the time of biopsy. For these reasons, and as routine exhaustion of all tissue blocks is impractical, the decision to include or exclude a comment regarding the margin status should be given conscious consideration, accounting for the clinical intent of the biopsy and any known information regarding postbiopsy treatment.

### Management of cutaneous neurofibroma: current therapy and future directions [^112HaJZv]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

A recent study by Chamseddin et al developed a robust surgical technique for surgical removal of cNF that differs by targeting the distinct anatomy of cNF. The cNF first begins as a nascent tumor in the dermis that eventually grows to become visible on the patient's skin surface. A superficial shave or biopsy will miss a sizeable portion of the tumor in the dermis, which may lead to more significant scarring, regrowth, and will not relieve the pain or itch. The technique comprises a shave biopsy of the soft mass above the skin with a dermablade or razer then using forceps to grasp the dermal component of the tumor, extruding its contents for more visibility, and removing its entirety with the same blade. The end product will be an empty hole, the same size or smaller than the cNF base excised. It can be closed using sutures, surgical glue, or staples dependent on the location of the excision (Figure 1). This technique has excellent postoperative cosmetic results featuring minimal scar size that is less than one required for a complete elliptical excision. In 84 tumors excised, one (1.2%) lesion in an African American male developed hypertrophic scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in 12% of cases which improved significantly after 5-month follow-up. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) showed statistically significant increase in quality of life. The procedure also does not require antibiotics or sterile gloves due to the superficial nature of the procedure and low risk for infection. The technique relies on local anesthesia and has benefits of worldwide accessibility due to its low-risk setting and reduced costs. Implementation of suturing prevents the removal of hundreds or thousands of cNF in one sitting. Patients can be advised to return for multiple rounds for removal of tens of cNF until acceptable results are obtained.

### Tangential shave removal of basal cell carcinoma [^113qCakv]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the outcome of tangential shave removal (TS) of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on the trunk and extremities.

Design

Cohort study of patients with multiple truncal BCC treated using TS in an academic dermatologic surgery practice.

Setting

Academic institution referral practice.

Patients

Individuals with BCC referred to the dermatologic surgery unit for ongoing therapy of multiple lesions.

Interventions

TS of amenable superficial and nodular BCCs with twice-annual follow-up. Lesions were removed using a scalpel as a uniform-depth mid-to-upper dermal shave and sent for routine pathology. Basic wound care was applied.

Primary Outcome Measures

Apparent cure rate and outcome of scars.

Results

One hundred eighty-two BCCs were treated in 19 individuals. Patients were followed for an average of 5.2 years. One lesion recurred. Three specimens had positive margins requiring further surgery. Scarring was acceptable and similar to what is observed with curettage and electrocoagulation.

Conclusions

TS is a reasonable treatment for primary superficial and nodular BCC on the trunk and extremities.

### Shave biopsy without local anaesthetic to diagnose basal cell carcinoma and other skin tumours prior to definitive treatment: analysis of 109 lesions [^1162mg1c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic biopsy of basal cell carcinoma and other skin tumours may be necessary prior to definitive treatment.

Objectives

To assess whether shave biopsy sampling of tumours without local anaesthetic can provide adequate tissue to make an accurate histological diagnosis, and to determine whether any discomfort is associated with the technique.

Methods

One hundred and nine lesions from 99 patients were sampled by shave biopsy without local anaesthetic. Any discomfort associated with the procedure, and the adequacy of the histological specimen, were documented. The pathology diagnosis was also compared against the clinically suspected diagnosis.

Results

In 108 of the 109 lesions sampled, sufficient tissue was obtained to make an accurate histological diagnosis. In only six of the 109 procedures was any discomfort reported and in all cases this was rated as minor. A high correlation was found between histological diagnosis and initial clinical suspicion.

Conclusions

Shave biopsy without local anaesthetic is a simple, relatively pain-free method of obtaining tissue samples for histological diagnosis in appropriate tumours.

### Obtaining adequate surgical margins in breast-conserving therapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer: current modalities and future directions [^112n3vjw]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Standardized Cavity Shaving

To avoid the earlier-mentioned difficulties in intraoperative cytological or histological techniques, some authors have suggested that standardized surgical cavity shaving could achieve the intended reduction in positive-margin rates. Hereto, all cut edges are shaved systematically after excision of the primary tumor to remove any residual disease.

Huston et al. compared the number of systematically shaved cavity edges to the achieved definitive histopathological margin status and found an inverted correlation between the rate of positive margin status and the total volume of breast tissue removed. Similar results were found by Janes et al. Because cavity shaving requires additional tissue resection, cosmetic outcome, and thereby one of the primary objectives of BCT, is compromised as a consequence. Furthermore, standardized cavity shaving still does not provide certainty in achieving negative margins due to the lack of intraoperative assessment of margin status.

### Malignant phyllodes tumour of the breast with early recurrence in a young patient [^113na4qR]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Treatment

The patient initially underwent left breast lumpectomy with posterior dissection down to the level of the pectoralis major muscle with the goal of obtaining at least 1-cm margins. Nodal staging was not recommended. The patient underwent full-thickness margin re-excision lumpectomy due to margins of less than 1 cm on the superior aspect as well as close margins on the medial aspect of the initial lumpectomy specimen. Adjuvant radiation was not recommended, nor was adjuvant systemic therapy. Early recurrence at the previous biopsy tract was treated with lumpectomy, excision of overlying skin and biopsy tract, and shave margins in all directions. All treatment decisions were made in accordance with national guidelines and in discussion with a multidisciplinary tumour board consisting of experts in breast and sarcoma. However, it should be noted that this case represents a rare and early recurrence and may not be reflective of national guidelines.

### Sentinel lymph node biopsy and complete lymph node dissection for melanoma [^117UXE9v]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical Excision

The standard treatment of melanoma is wide and radical excision including deep tissue. If the resected margins are not clear from malignant melanoma at histological examination, any remaining melanoma cells in the surrounding tissue should be included in a re-excision. Surgical margins are based on the maximal melanoma Breslow thickness (measured in millimeters) of the melanoma. All pigmented lesions with a clinical suspicion of melanoma should be removed with at least 2-mm clinical clear margin, but not exceeding 5 mm to preserve the lymphatic drainage assessed by sentinel node biopsy (SNB) at a later stage. Excision of lesions located on the extremities should follow the length axis to facilitate primary closure and avoidance of skin grafts. For the removal of invasive (as defined by histology) melanoma, the excision should continue through the skin and subcutaneous tissue down to, but not including, the fascia/periosteum/perichondrium. For melanoma in situ, surgical excision should include the superficial subcutaneous tissue. Partial biopsies of suspected melanomas should be avoided due to the risk of under staging, but if necessary can be guided by dermatoscopy to identify the most malignant part of the melanoma suspected lesion. Importantly, the risk of sentinel lymph node metastasis or overall survival has not been associated with the choice of biopsy method (excisional versus incisional versus shave biopsy).

Timing

In a study from the National Cancer Database (N = 153.218), data suggested that surgery performed later than 90 days was associated with a higher mortality for melanoma of all stages. Furthermore, in a subgroup of patients with stage T1(less than 1-mm thick melanoma) disease, patients had higher mortality if surgery was delayed > 30 days.

### Skin cancers of the hand and upper extremity [^116bsdFL]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Skin cancers represent the most common primary malignancies of the hand. They typically present as painless lesions on areas of high sun exposure, such as the dorsum of the hand and upper extremity. The most common malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma, followed by basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. The key to successful treatment is early and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Unlike open biopsies, which are indicated for deep soft tissue and bone lesions, biopsies for skin cancer can be performed under local anesthesia in the office setting in the form of shave or punch biopsies. A number of nonsurgical treatment options are available for treatment. However, when surgical excision is indicated, appropriate margin resections are dictated by the grade and stage of the malignancy.

### Natural language processing to automate a web-based model of care and modernize skin cancer multidisciplinary team meetings [^116sKtXD]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

A multicentre (Morriston Hospital, Singleton Hospital and Neath Port Talbot Hospital, Wales, UK), pan-specialty, consecutive retrospective analysis of patients with a diagnosis of BCC over a 6-month period from 1 March 2021 to 20 September 2021 was undertaken. Lesions were examined by a consultant histopathologist using the bread loafing cross-section technique.

Patient identification, inclusion and exclusion criteria

Patients were retrospectively identified from InterSystems TrakCare Lab Laboratory Information Management System (InterSystems TrakCare Lab, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA), using SNOMED reference term (RT) codes for BCC. SNOMED is a logic-based healthcare terminology used in an EHR. It is a consistent vocabulary for recording patient clinical information. All those patients with a SNOMED RT code for BCC during the study period who were managed by surgery (either non-definitive diagnostic sampling biopsy (punch biopsy, incision biopsy, shave biopsy or curettage) or surgical excision using a predetermined margin) were included. Comma separated variable (CSV) text files were generated from the respective canonical subheadings of the histopathology report.

General framework

The virtual skin MDT (vSMDT) consists of two main parts:; the extraction of the right text from the pathology report using the NLP algorithm and then producing the right recommendation within a web application given the data-extracted histopathology report (Fig. 1).

### A large percentage of excision specimens show residual basal cell carcinoma: a retrospective chart review [^1146tA14]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is recommended. However, patients often note that the biopsy site appears resolved and inquire about the need for additional treatment.

Objective

This study aims to determine the rate of residual BCC on excision specimens after initial shave biopsy to aid in decision-making on the necessity of further treatment.

Methods and Materials

A retrospective chart review was conducted that reviewed excision specimen pathology reports of previously biopsy-proven basal cell carcinomas for the presence of residual tumor between 2012 and 2022 at a single institution.

Results

Two thousand one hundred seventeen cases met inclusion criteria. Overall, 39.4% of patients had residual BCC after an initial shave biopsy. Using an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval, a significant relationship was found between larger lesions, longer time between biopsy and excision, and lesions on high-risk body sites with increased odds of residual BCC. A significant relationship was found between negative or not specified margins on shave biopsy with decreased odds of residual BCC.

Conclusion

The results show that a large percentage of patients have residual BCC following initial biopsies. These results should be included in physician-patient discussions about treatment options for BCC.

### Margins: a status report from the annual meeting of the American Society of Breast Surgeons [^112i2unr]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Since the emergence of breast conserving surgery (BCS) as an alternative to mastectomy in the 1980's, there has been little consensus on what constitutes acceptable margins for cases of invasive breast cancer, how best to evaluate margins in the operating room, or an understanding of the challenging process of margin assessment by pathologists. The program committee for the 15th Annual Meeting of The American Society of Breast Surgeons organized a plenary session to discuss the latest thinking and guidelines for these important issues. The SSO/ASTRO Consensus Guideline on Margins for BCS was an important focus of discussion. The SSO/ASTRO consensus panelists concluded that "no ink on tumor" is an adequate surgical margin for BCS in patients with invasive breast cancers. Intraoperative strategies to decrease the incidence of positive margins include intraoperative localization techniques (wire-localization, ultrasound, radioactive seed) and intraoperative margin assessments with specimen radiography, imprint cytology, and frozen section. Studies also demonstrate the positive effect of shave margins with or without intraoperative margin assessment. The College of American Pathologists protocols for breast specimen margin evaluation consider multiple variables that can impact the proper assessment of margins. These variables include: tissue fixation time, specimen orientation, cold ischemia time, leaking ink, specimen pancaking and others that surgeons need to be aware of. Determining when "enough is enough" should not only be the application of guidelines and national standards, but also a multidisciplinary discussion between breast cancer specialists for what is right for the individual patient's unique circumstances.

### What is the best method for removing biopsy-proven atypical nevi? A comparison of margin clearance rates between reshave and full-thickness surgical excisions [^111pnwWZ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is a common practice to biopsy clinically atypical nevi, which may signify an individual's increased risk of developing melanoma. There is no consensus in the current literature, however, as to what the best method is to manage biopsy-proven atypical nevi.

Objective

The objective was to compare margin clearance rates between reshave excision and full-thickness surgical excision performed to manage biopsy-proven atypical nevi.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective observational study, histopathology specimens from 201 patients whose atypical nevi were surgically removed were analyzed.

Results

For the majority (76%-79%) of the atypical nevi studied, all atypical melanocytes were removed by the initial shave biopsy. Of those atypical nevi with positive margins, shave re-excision was shown to have a lower clearance rate (76.2%) when compared with surgical excision (87.5%).

Conclusion

This study shows that in most cases, no residual atypical melanocytes are left after the initial shave biopsy. However, of the lesions where margins are not clear, full-thickness surgical excision may have a higher rate of success at eventual clearance than reshave excision.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^1175zCuA]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Cutaneous melanoma — biopsy approach and initial diagnostic procedure: Patients with a suspicious pigmented lesion optimally should undergo an excisional biopsy (elliptical, punch or saucerization), preferably with 1- to 3-mm negative margins, and the orientation of the excisional biopsy should always be planned with definitive treatment in mind; with lymphatic mapping and sentinel node biopsy, biopsies should also be planned so as not to interfere, and wider margins for the initial diagnostic procedure should be avoided. Excisional biopsy may be inappropriate for certain sites or very large lesions; in these instances, a full-thickness incisional or punch biopsy of the clinically thickest portion of the lesion is an acceptable option that should provide accurate primary tumor microstaging without interfering with definitive local therapy, and if the initial biopsy is inadequate for diagnosis or microstaging for treatment planning, re-biopsy with narrow margin excision should be considered. Shave biopsy may compromise pathologic diagnosis and complete assessment of Breslow thickness; however, it is acceptable in a low suspicion setting, for example, a broad shave biopsy may help to optimize accurate diagnosis of lentigo maligna, and panelists recognized that melanomas are commonly diagnosed by shave biopsy during screening in a dermatologist office, and that any diagnosis is better than none even if microstaging may not be complete.

### My approach to atypical melanocytic lesions [^116kaV3N]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Histological assessment of melanocytic naevi constitutes a substantial proportion of a dermatopathologist's daily workload. Although they may be excised for cosmetic reasons, most lesions encountered are clinically atypical and are biopsied or excised to exclude melanoma. Although dysplastic naevi are most often encountered, cytological atypia may be a feature of several other melanocytic lesions, including genital type naevi, acral naevi, recurrent naevi, and neonatal or childhood naevi. With greater emphasis being given to cosmetic results, and because of an ever increasing workload, several "quicker and less traumatising" techniques have been introduced in the treatment and diagnosis of atypical naevi including punch, shave, and scoop shave biopsies. A major limitation to all of these alternatives is that often only part of the lesion is available for histological assessment and therefore all too frequently the pathologist's report includes a recommendation for complete excision so that the residual lesion can be studied. Complete or large excision of all clinically atypical naevi permits histological assessment of the entire lesion, and in most cases spares the patient the need for further surgical intervention.

7.4 Immunofluorescence mapping (level of evidence 2+, grade of recommendation C)

IFM, also called antigen mapping, on frozen sections is a rapid technique for EB subtype diagnosis that is also feasible in resource‐limited settings. 62 Variations of this technique include using different panels of antibodies or different IHC detection methods. 62, 63, 64, 65 IHC on frozen sections is possible, 62 but it requires nearly the same equipment as IFM, excluding the need for a fluorescence microscope. In formalin‐fixed, paraffin‐embedded samples antigen loss is a major problem for most molecules of interest for EB diagnosis, and it is therefore not recommended. Nevertheless, a high sensitivity and specificity can be reached at very low costs using two antibodies (antikeratin 14 and antitype IV collagen) on paraffin‐embedded sections. 65 Haematoxylin and eosin staining may be useful in resource‐limited situations. 66

7.4.1 Biopsy samples

✓ For the diagnosis of EB by IFM, a 4–6‐mm punch or shave cutaneous biopsy sample is necessary. In general, it is recommended to take the biopsy from an area of the body that is not exposed to the sun (i.e. the inner part of the upper arm), as skin exposed to the sun may create nonspecific background fluorescence, thus interfering with the interpretation. Application of a topical anaesthetic cream before taking the biopsy may induce artificial skin cleavage. 67, 68 The biopsy should include perilesional (clinically normal appearing) skin as well as a small part of a fresh blister (< 12 h) (Fig. S1 a; see Supporting Information). If no fresh blister is present, a new blister can be induced by rubbing the patient's skin adjacent to a lesional area until it becomes red or blistered. 69, 70, 71, 72 An alternative method to induce a new blister after taking the biopsy is by suctioning the epidermal side of the biopsy with a 20‐mL syringe until a macroscopic blister appears. 73 However, the quality and reliability of this technique have not been validated in additional publications. Usually the skin of patients with EB is extremely fragile and the trauma of the biopsy may by itself lead to dermoepidermal separation.

### Impact of shave biopsy on diagnosis and management of cutaneous melanoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rha6B]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Melanoma is the most lethal skin cancer. Excision biopsy is generally recommended for clinically suspicious pigmented lesions; however, a proportion of cutaneous melanomas are diagnosed by shave biopsy. A systematic review was undertaken to investigate the impact of shave biopsy on tumor staging, treatment recommendations, and prognosis.

Methodology

The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles. Data on deep margin status on shave biopsy, tumor upstaging, and additional treatments on wide local excision (WLE), disease recurrence, and survival effect were analyzed across studies.

Results

Fourteen articles from 2010 to 2020 were included. In total, 3713 patients had melanoma diagnosed on shave biopsy. Meta-analysis revealed a positive deep margin in 42.9% of shave biopsies. Following WLE, change in tumor stage was reported in 7.7% of patients. Additional treatment was recommended for 2.3% of patients in the form of either further WLE and/or sentinel lymph node biopsy. There was high heterogeneity across studies in all outcomes. Four studies reported survival, while no studies found any significant difference in disease-free or overall survival between shave biopsy and other biopsy modalities.

Conclusions

Just over 40% of melanomas diagnosed on shave biopsy report a positive deep margin; however, this translated into a change in tumor stage or treatment recommendations in relatively few patients (7.7% and 2.3%, respectively), with no impact on local recurrence or survival among the studies analyzed.

### Shave biopsy is a safe and accurate method for the initial evaluation of melanoma [^114mcsiy]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Shave biopsy of cutaneous lesions is simple, efficient, and commonly used clinically. However, this technique has been criticized for its potential to hamper accurate diagnosis and microstaging of melanoma, thereby complicating treatment decision-making.

Study Design

We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of patients referred to the University of Florida Shands Cancer Center or to the Moffitt Cancer Center for treatment of primary cutaneous melanoma, initially diagnosed on shave biopsy to have Breslow depth < 2 mm, to determine the accuracy of shave biopsy in T-staging and the potential impact on definitive surgical treatment and outcomes.

Results

Six hundred patients undergoing shave biopsy were diagnosed with melanoma from extremity (42%), trunk (37%), and head or neck (21%). Mean (± SEM) Breslow thickness was 0.73 ± 0.02 mm; 6.2% of lesions were ulcerated. At the time of wide excision, residual melanoma was found in 133 (22%), resulting in T-stage upstaging for 18 patients (3%). Recommendations for additional wide excision or sentinel lymph node biopsy changed in 12 of 600 (2%) and 8 of 600 patients (1.3%), respectively. Locoregional recurrence occurred in 10 (1.7%) patients and distant recurrence in 4 (0.7%) patients.

Conclusions

These data challenge the surgical dogma that full-thickness excisional biopsy of suspicious cutaneous lesions is the only method that can lead to accurate diagnosis. Data obtained on shave biopsy of melanoma are reliable and accurate in the overwhelming majority of cases (97%). The use of shave biopsy does not complicate or compromise management of the overwhelming majority of patients with malignant melanoma.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^115mBWHo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Osteomyelitis — diagnostic evaluation is typically based on clinical suspicion with confirmation by imaging and laboratory methods, and inflammatory markers are often elevated: the peripheral white blood cell count may be elevated; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated as well. Establishing an etiologic diagnosis nearly always requires obtaining bone for microbiologic evaluation unless blood cultures are positive in the context of convincing radiographic findings, which can be accomplished by imaging-guided or surgical sampling. As much specimen as possible should be submitted to the laboratory; specimens may include pieces of intact bone, shavings, scrapings, and/or excised or aspirated necrotic material. Swabs are not recommended and cultures of sinus tracts are generally not recommended, because recovered organisms, aside from Staphylococcus aureus, do not correlate well with those found in deep cultures. In adults, imaging-guided aspiration or open biopsy is typically necessary, and those with underlying diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency are at particular risk for osteomyelitis.

### Nonpersistence of basal cell carcinoma after diagnostic shave biopsy: reconstruction when specimen is negative during surgery [^116ZqPD6]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Initial tissue sampling for diagnosis of suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is typically performed using a shave biopsy technique or punch biopsy.

Methods

Our realization of no residual BCC findings after excision in some patients with biopsy-proven BCC diagnosed through a shave biopsy prompted us to conduct a retrospective study of all consecutive patients with 127 BCCs who were treated in our department between 2006 and 2012. All patients with incompletely excised BCCs after shave biopsy diagnosis were operated on by a single surgeon (R.G.), eliminating variables in preoperative evaluation and surgical technique including margin control and reconstructive approach. Patient demographics, initial BCC site, size, subtype, duration between shave biopsy and surgery, size of excision, findings of intraoperative frozen section analysis, type of closure technique, and final pathology reports were analyzed.

Results

There were 108 residual BCCs diagnosed after surgical excision. Most of the108 BCCs were nodular (52) or micronodular (21) subtype. Eighteen BCCs were treated with excision and primary closure. Flap procedure was performed in 64 BCCs after excision. Twenty-six defects after excision were reconstructed using skin grafts. There was no evidence of residual BCC in 15% of BCCs (19 patients) after surgical treatment. In other words, shave biopsy was found to be curative in 15% of BCCs. Seven patients in no residual BCC group received excision and primary closure. Eleven patients underwent flap reconstruction, whereas only 1 patient required skin grafting. Most of the patients in this group had nodular or micronodular type BCC (14/19).

Conclusions

We were not able to identify any clinically significant predictors of residual versus no residual BCC, at least within the context of the current study. Although most patients diagnosed with BCC had residual tumors for which they received surgical treatment, 15% of patients had to undergo primary closure, skin graft, or flap procedure for negative residual BCC. We would like to promote greater awareness on the subject among plastic surgeons treating BCCs. And, it is extremely important that the informed consent should include statements regarding possible reconstructive procedures even in the case of nonpersistent tumor from medicolegal standpoint.

### Unilateral nipple hyperkeratosis [^114cuZa5]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most accurate test for identifying a cutaneous malignancy of the breast?
A. Wedge biopsy
B. Potassium hydroxide scraping
C. Punch biopsy
D. Shave biopsy
E. Diascopy

Answers:
A. Wedge biopsy – Correct. Histologic evidence of Paget cells (malignant intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells) in single or small groups in the epidermis is required to establish a diagnosis of Paget disease. Wedge biopsy is the most sensitive method to establish a definitive diagnosis of Paget disease because the epidermis can be adequately sampled, and the biopsy is likely to include lactiferous ducts. Staging workup is the same for both women and men and classified based on the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Treatment options should be discussed between the patient, dermatologists, and oncologists, and can range from broad cytotoxic or targeted drug therapy, radiation, or surgery.
B. Potassium hydroxide scraping – Incorrect. A scraping is typically used to identify either fungal or scabies infections. For fungal infections, following a scraping, a drop of 10% to 20% potassium hydroxide would be added and examined for hyphae, budding yeast, or both under a microscope. For scabies, mineral oil would be added and examined for mites, feces, or eggs. It would not be beneficial in identifying a malignancy.
C. Punch biopsy – Incorrect. Although a punch biopsy will include underlying stroma and possible portions of lactiferous ducts, frequently, it will fail to sample enough epidermis to make a definitive diagnosis.
D. Shave biopsy – Incorrect. Because of potential ulcerations, shave biopsies may not contain enough Paget cells to establish a diagnosis.
E. Diascopy – Incorrect. Diascopy is used to test the vascularity of lesions. Typically, a clear material is pressed against a lesion to test its blanchability.

### Toolbox to reduce lumpectomy reoperations and improve cosmetic outcome in breast cancer patients: the American Society of Breast Surgeons consensus conference [^114sRaea]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Tool 7: Specimen Radiograph with Surgeon Intraoperative Review

The primary role of specimen imaging is to document removal of the targeted nonpalpable lesion before the patient leaves the operating room. Lower-level evidence supports specimen radiography as a method to assess distance of lesion to margin and therefore direct and potentially reduce reoperation. Specimens should not undergo compression during imaging, because it may cause specimen fracture that allows ink to enter the crevasse and a false-positive margin. Some participants supplement specimen radiography with US. Surgeons should review the specimen imaging before the operation has been completed, ideally with surgeon-radiology communication. Real-time review may avoid a complete "miss" of the lesion or direct the surgeon to perform an additional cavity shave for a "close" margin. Specimen imaging may not be universally available. If not, the conference strongly encourages systems to develop necessary resources for specimen imaging with immediate image review. Two views at orthogonal angles may identify close or positive margins not seen on a single view. Intraoperative imaging with other modalities to include tomograms, MRI, CT, and other imaging are being investigated.

Tool 8: Consider Cavity Shave Margins in Patients with T2 or Greater Tumor Size or TI with Extensive Intraductal Carcinoma (EIC)

There are moderate levels of evidence that cavity side wall excisions correlate with lower reoperation rate. Shave size should provide adequate sampling of the residual wall. "Tiny shaves" representing only a small portion of a "wall" were discouraged. If shaves are performed, the "final" edge should be marked; i.e. nonoriented shave with even a small amount of tumor on the surface would constitute a final ink positive margin status requiring reexcision. Some surgeons routinely perform shaves of all cavity side walls regardless of tumor type or size. Others perform selective shaves directed by palpation, imaging, or pathologic specimen examination. There has been one recently published, randomized, controlled trial of cavity shave versus no-shave margins, which demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the reoperation rate for patients undergoing breast conservation surgery.

Tool 9: Intraoperative Pathology Assessment of Lumpectomy Margins may Help Decrease Reexcision When Feasible

A systematic literature review demonstrates that intraoperative margin assessment with frozen histologic section or imprint cytology are associated with lower reoperation rates by allowing intraoperative reexcision of positive margins. There is lower-level evidence to support only gross specimen examination. Resources and expertise may limit the feasibility of routine intraoperative pathology assessment. Several institutions report low reoperation rates without intraoperative margin assessment.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^111Xa2fK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Biopsy for cutaneous melanoma (CM) — skin biopsy remains the first step to establish a definitive diagnosis of CM; dermoscopy can improve diagnostic accuracy and/or help direct tissue sampling, and prebiopsy photographs are an important aid that help to prevent wrong-site surgery and should include a regional photograph with anatomic landmarks. Skin biopsy may be performed as an incisional, partial, or incomplete diagnostic biopsy, or with the intent to remove the entire lesion (excisional/complete). Partial biopsy may inaccurately stage CM and could negatively affect treatment planning; for a lesion clinically suggestive of CM, an excisional/complete biopsy is ideally performed with clinically negative margins and sufficient depth to avoid transection, generally achieved with a narrow peripheral margin of 1 to 3 mm. Diagnostic excisional biopsy can be accomplished in 3 ways: (1) elliptical (fusiform) excision; (2) punch excision around the clinical lesion; or (3) deep shave/saucerization.

The practitioner's clinical diagnosis, intent (sample or completely remove), and removal technique (excision, punch, shave biopsy, or scoop-shave) were recorded. Pathology results including the status of the peripheral and deep margins were subsequently documented.

Results

Over an 8-month period, 333 procedures were performed. Of the 11 melanomas (6 in situ and 5 invasive) removed by the scoop-shave, none had positive deep margins and 6 (2 in situ and 4 invasive) were completely removed. One of the 50 dysplastic nevi removed by scoop-shave had a positive deep margin (moderately dysplastic). Forty-six dysplastic nevi were completely removed by the scoop-shave. When the practitioner's intent was "complete removal", the lesion was completely removed 73.1% of the time by scoop-shave, 91% by standard excision, 18.1% by shave biopsy, and 78.6% by punch excision (p < .0001).

Conclusion

The scoop-shave is a safe and effective technique for diagnosis and treatment of melanocytic lesions.

### Histologic processing and reporting of cutaneous pigmented lesions: recommendations based on a survey of 94 dermatopathologists [^111z82ae]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Standard operating procedures for laboratory processing and reporting of margins of cutaneous pigmented lesions do not exist. We conducted a survey of 94 dermatopathologists to evaluate these practices.

Objectives

We sought to: (1) identify dominant practices among dermatopathologists; (2) determine the impact of the procedure, intent to excise, and histologic diagnosis on the process of margin evaluation; and (3) propose guidelines based on these findings.

Methods

The survey consisted of 44 questions focused on the impact of procedure (punch, shave, or ellipse), intent (excision or biopsy), and histologic diagnosis (common nevus, congenital nevus, atypical nevus, melanoma) on processing and margin reporting.

Results

For ellipses, or specimens indicated as excisions, the majority practice (76%-98%) was to ink the specimens. Although more than 90% of observers report the margins on all melanomas and atypical nevi, fewer than 50% of respondents report margins on all nonatypical nevi.

Limitations

The study consists of a survey sample of dermatopathologists and does not represent the practices of those who did not respond to the survey.

Conclusions

Based on the results of this survey we have arrived at the following recommendations: (1) ink all specimens that are ellipses or designated as excisions; (2) tips should be evaluated separately if the specimen is an ellipse; (3) obtain levels in cases with tumor in the tip but not at ink if the specimen is an ellipse or excision and the diagnosis is atypical nevus or melanoma; and (4) report margins on all atypical nevi and melanomas.

### Malignant phyllodes tumour of the breast with early recurrence in a young patient [^1156GcC6]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

The patient was re-evaluated in clinic 1 month post operatively due to a 1.5-cm mass in the left breast lateral to the incision with violaceous discolouration of the overlying skin at the site of the previous core needle biopsy entry site (see figure 2). Of note, the previous biopsy entry site was approximately 3 cm medial to the palpable mass and was not included in initial lumpectomy or re-excision specimens. Punch biopsy showed atypical spindle cell proliferation in the deep portion of the biopsy, suspicious for recurrent malignant phyllodes tumour in the prior biopsy tract. This case was then rereviewed in our multidisciplinary tumour board. Staging with a non-contrast CT of the chest was obtained and did not reveal additional disease. National guidelines recommend staging with chest imaging (X-ray or CT) rather than positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Options of mastectomy versus re-excision were discussed extensively. There is a paucity of data on management of early recurrent malignant phyllodes; however, per NCCN guidelines, re-excision with 1-cm margins without axillary staging is recommended without mandating mastectomy. Consideration of adjuvant radiation is also recommended. The patient then underwent excision of the mass and overlying skin with excision of the biopsy tract and shave margins in all directions with the goal of achieving 1-cm margins. Pathological review indicated a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm consistent with a malignant phyllodes tumour. Margins were negative and greater than 1 cm in all directions (see figure 3). Radiation was not recommended in the adjuvant setting.

### In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy of shave biopsy wounds: feasibility of intraoperative mapping of cancer margins [^115QrKUA]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) images skin at cellular resolution and has shown utility for the diagnosis of nonmelanoma skin cancer in vivo. Topical application of aluminium chloride (AlCl(3)) enhances contrast in RCM images by brightening nuclei.

Objectives

To investigate feasibility of RCM imaging of shave biopsy wounds using AlCl(3) as a contrast agent.

Methods

AlCl(3) staining was optimized, in terms of concentration vs. immersion time, on excised tissue ex vivo. RCM imaging protocol was tested in patients undergoing shave biopsies. The RCM images were retrospectively analysed and compared with the corresponding histopathology.

Results

For 35% AlCl(3), routinely used for haemostasis in clinic, minimum immersion time was determined to be 1 min. We identified three consistent patterns of margins on RCM mosaic images by varying depth: epidermal margins, peripheral dermal margins, and deep dermal margins. Tumour islands of basal cell carcinoma were identified at peripheral or deep dermal margins, correlating on histopathology with aggregates of neoplastic basaloid cells. Atypical cobblestone or honeycomb patterns were identified at the epidermal margins in squamous cell carcinomas, correlating with a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes extending to biopsy margins.

Conclusions

RCM imaging of shave biopsy wounds is feasible and demonstrates the future possibility of intraoperative mapping in surgical wounds.

### Comparison of margin assessment by radial and shave sections in wide local excision specimens for invasive carcinoma of the breast [^114hXFBj]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Standard margin assessment of breast carcinoma surgical specimens uses radial sections perpendicular to the margin. Shave sections assess a larger surface area of margin than radial sections. The aim was to assess the value of additional shave sections of the margin.

Methods and Results

Both types of section were used to assess 471 wide local excision specimens for invasive carcinoma. One hundred and seventy-nine specimens had positive margins: only radial margins were involved (tumour within 5 mm of margin) in 76, only shave margins in 45, and both shave and radial margins in 58. Residual carcinoma was found in re-excision specimens (immediate or later) in 43% when the closest distance to the radial margin was 0–1 mm, 25% for 2–4 mm, 18% for 5–9 mm and 13% for > 9 mm. Residual carcinoma was found in 44% of specimens if any shave section was positive and in 9% if all shaves were negative. Residual carcinoma was found in 32% if either radial or shave sections were positive and in 4% if neither was positive.

Conclusions

The combination of radial and shave sections appears to be good at separating patients into two groups with high and low risk of residual carcinoma.

### Punch biopsies are not the way to diagnose melanoma… [^112KbT3J]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The pitfalls related to the interpretation of a punch biopsy, with the limited length of skin available to examine, have been previously discussed in American Family Physician. 2 Recent data show that, of the three basic techniques of suspected melanoma biopsy — excision, scoop shave, and punch — punch biopsy is the most likely to yield an uncertain result. 3 This applies to determining the depth of melanoma, on which prognosis and definitive therapy is based, and correctly diagnosing the lesion. The only exception is the punch biopsy of a lesion that fits entirely within the punch. "Doing the math" explains the difficulty. A suspicious lesion 1 cm in diameter has an area of 0. 79 cm.
2. A "representative" 4-mm punch will sample 0. 13 cm 2, which is only 16 percent of the surface of the lesion. Three 2-mm punches, sometimes advocated for large facial lesions, sample less than 0. 1 cm 2 combined.

Furthermore, the advice that one can sample the most suspicious part of the lesion is flawed because the most papular component of a melanoma may indeed represent the thickest part of the cancer or may, instead, be the benign melanocytic lesion out of which the melanoma arose. Prognosis and definitive therapy are determined by tumor depth and thickness, and the best way to get this information remains a conservative excision of the entirety of the suspicious lesion. If the lesion is in a cosmetically sensitive area or is too large to do this, the largest incisional biopsy possible should be performed. The risk of incomplete information still exists with this technique, but at least much more tissue is available to examine than is obtained with a standard punch. Punch biopsy technique using larger trephines can actually achieve complete excision of a lesion. National guidelines 3, 4 have recognized the use of punch technique in diagnosing melanoma.

Other specialties have also recognized punch biopsy as a method to diagnose cutaneous malignancy. 5 Many family physicians receive instruction from their community subspecialists not to touch melanocytic lesions; they are warned that biopsy within a lesion could cause spread of a melanoma. Dr. Meffert correctly notes that biopsy does not promote the spread of a lesion. We should not create additional barriers for family physicians that keep them from participating in this important public health problem.

### Dermal electrosurgical shave excision [^1118iN3V]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The dermal electrosurgical shave excision is a fast and inexpensive method of removing epidermal and dermal lesions. The procedure is ideally suited for pedunculated lesions raised above the level of the surrounding skin. It consists of repetitive, unidirectional, horizontal slicing of a cutaneous lesion with a no. 15 blade followed by electrosurgical feathering to smooth out the wound edges. A smoke evacuator is used during electrosurgery to prevent inhalation of heat-disseminated viral particles. The procedure is followed by histologic evaluation of the shaved specimen. Suspicious pigmented lesions should not be shaved because the long-term prognosis of a malignancy may depend on the thickness of the lesion on histologic analysis. Administration of adequate local anesthesia should make this a painless procedure. Basic general surgery skills are required, and formal training in electrosurgery is highly recommended.

### The ram relaxation technique: a painless biopsy method. A shave biopsy approach without injectable anesthesia or needles [^112Ckkve]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Shave skin biopsies are essential procedures wherein physicians diagnose dermatologic lesions. The protocol for skin biopsies entails a lidocaine/epinephrine injection. This study suggests an alternative, novel method of performing a shave biopsy that avoids pain, needles, and injectable anesthesia, termed the Ram Relaxation Technique (RRT).

Objective

To present a new technique that physicians may chose to form when faced with dermatological biopsies that are painless and needle free.

Patients and Methods

Randomly selected, patients were presented to the authors' offices with abnormal skin lesions that required a shave biopsy. The patients were offered the choice of having an anesthetic injection (1% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine) or the alternative method (RRT) before the biopsy. Twenty patients (n = 20, 10 men, 10 women) chose the alternative method (RRT) and were the focus of this study. These patients who chose RRT were asked to scale their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 = no pain, 1–3 = mild, 4–6 = moderate, and 7–10 = severe pain).

Results

Fourteen of the 20 patients stated that they experienced no pain (0), 5 experienced mild pain, and 1 patient experienced moderate pain.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates an alternative and nearly pain-free method for superficial shave biopsies of the skin for certain patients in the appropriate clinical setting with the appropriate, superficial papule lesions. Dermis lesions, melanocytic lesions, and macular lesions are not ideal candidates given the risk for misdiagnosis, and more pain, respectively.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^1149dGCm]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Squamous Cell Skin Cancer — Principles of pathology for biopsy and excision specimens emphasize that pathologic evaluation of skin biopsies is ideally performed by a dermatologist, pathologist, or dermatopathologist experienced in interpreting cutaneous neoplasms, and reporting of margins and the elements below is not required for biopsy specimens. Specimens from intended complete surgical removal (eg, shave excisions) should be labeled as such so that margin status is reported. Since depth of invasion (in mm) may not be ascertained on tangentially cut Mohs specimens, anatomic level of invasion should be reported. Frozen or permanent section analysis of the clinical tumor specimen may be undertaken if needed for complete reporting of the features below to enable AJCC tumor staging. Immunohistochemistry may be utilized as needed to help identify lymphovascular or nerve invasion, or to identify single tumor cells or small aggregates.

### Changing dermatopathology protocols for processing small skin biopsies: decreases in slide quantity does not affect patient care and allows for optimal efficiency [^111BXKZG]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2016). Low credibility.

In dermatopathology, no standard protocol exists for processing small biopsy specimens. In our original protocol, 2 routine initial slides per biopsy were prepared. For 1003 biopsies, we noted how often the second slide helped in diagnosis or eliminated the need for additional deeper sections. After obtaining these data, we switched to processing only 1 initial slide (new protocol) and again evaluated 1003 biopsies. During the original protocol, the second slide never helped to make a diagnosis that was not apparent on the first slide. When deeper sections were ordered (10.4% of cases), they helped in the diagnosis 34.6% of the time. In the new protocol, deeper sections were ordered in 15.9% of cases and helped in the diagnosis 32.7% of the time when ordered. Comparing rates of deeper sections ordered showed no significant difference for benign, inflammatory/reactive, and premalignant/malignant groups (P > 0.1). However, there was a significant increase in deeper sections ordered for melanocytic lesions from 16.9% to 32.3% (P < 0.05). Also, a significantly greater percentage of punch biopsies (31.5% and 42.0% in the respective protocols) required deeper sections than shave biopsies (7.4% and 12.6% in the respective protocols). Switching protocols, the estimated annual cost savings is $2890. The majority of cases at our institution are properly diagnosed using only 1 slide. From our study findings, we conclude that 1 slide preparation for small biopsies is the best practice for our institution and one that does not affect diagnostic accuracy, reduces costs, and helps in effective time management.

### Shave and punch biopsy for skin lesions [^114tgNys]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Shave and punch biopsies are essential procedures for physicians who manage skin conditions. These office-based procedures can diagnose questionable dermatologic lesions, including possible malignancies. Approaches include the superficial shave biopsy, saucerization excision, punch biopsy, and elliptical excision. A superficial shave biopsy can be used for raised lesions. A saucerization biopsy may be performed for flat or pigmented lesions. Punch biopsies yield full-thickness samples and can be used for lesions that require dermal or subcutaneous tissue for diagnosis. Indications for biopsy of suspected melanoma remain controversial. Sufficient tissue may be obtained with the quicker, less costly saucerization biopsy or the more time-consuming, invasive elliptical excisional biopsy.

### Nail matrix biopsy of longitudinal melanonychia: diagnostic algorithm including the matrix shave biopsy [^111EBjyt]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Longitudinal melanonychia (LM) may represent nail matrix melanocyte activation (defined as a normal number of melanocytes with increased production of melanin), benign hyperplasia, or melanoma, in addition to multiple nonmelanocyte pathologies, including hemorrhage and infection. This article details an algorithmic approach to LM, including a careful history and physical examination, dermoscopy, and ability to sample the matrix using 3 biopsy techniques, a 3-mm punch excision, a lateral longitudinal excision, and a matrix shave biopsy. Facility with all 3 techniques will allow the physician to procure appropriate nail matrix specimens for diagnosis.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for cutaneous melanoma, more specifically with respect to excisional biopsy, AAD 2019 guidelines recommend to perform narrow excisional/complete biopsy with 1–3 mm margins encompassing the entire breadth of lesion and of sufficient depth to prevent transection at the base as the preferred biopsy technique. Perform excisional biopsy by any of the following methods:

- fusiform/elliptical excision

- punch excision around the clinical lesion

- deep shave/saucerization removal to depth below the anticipated plane of the lesion.

### Combining amino acid PET and MRI imaging increases accuracy to define malignant areas in adult glioma [^112bVN9B]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

It was not always necessary to plan four trajectories to collect the material, since it was sometimes possible to collect different samples on one trajectory. For example, if on a given trajectory the area of isolated FET uptake was more superficial and the MRI contrast enhancement was deeper, material corresponding to two different targets could be taken from one trajectory but at different depths. An example of biopsy trajectories is presented in Fig. 1b.

Each target was defined as a 0 point measuring a few millimeters in area, i.e. the target ranged, for example, from −6 to 0, where material was taken every 1 mm from −6 depth to 0 along a planned trajectory. Every first sample was tested intraoperatively, and every second sample was taken for histopathological and molecular examination. Approximately six serial biopsies were taken in areas of contrast enhancement, increased FET uptake, and peripheral areas. Therefore, in total, about 18 samples were obtained from each patient, i.e. ~400 samples in total for the entire cohort. The highest-grade malignancy detected at each serial biopsy site is presented in the results.

After planning, the patient's head was attached to the operating table through the previously installed frame. To avoid brain shift during biopsy, the patient was positioned to achieve a burr hole location in the most supine point of the cranium. The x, y, and z coordinates of the entry point were calculated by the stereotaxis program, thus determining where the head should be shaved, the skin incision, and the site for the trepanation hole. After washing and preparation, the site was anesthetized with 1% lignocaine solution and a small skin incision was then made to expose the skull bones. With a manual trepan, and for tumors in the posterior cranial fossa, a small trepanation was made with a high-speed drill. Then, the visualized dura mater was coagulated, incised, and, in accordance with the calculated parameters, a cannulated biopsy needle was placed in the brain. Forceps were inserted through the cannula and several small samples taken for histopathological examination at 1 mm intervals. A neuropathologist was present in the operating room throughout the procedure, who initially assessed the material. The remaining tumor fragments were placed into sample tubes with formalin and then processed and assessed by a pathologist.

### Melanoma: diagnosis and treatment [^111rYjeb]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous malignant melanoma accounts for 5% of cancer diagnoses and is the fifth most common cancer diagnosed in the United States. Risk factors for cutaneous malignant melanoma include ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure, Fitzpatrick skin type I or II, a history of dysplastic nevi, indoor tanning, older age, and a personal or family history of melanoma. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends counseling with patient education on minimizing early ultraviolet radiation exposure, including the use of protective clothing and sunscreen, especially for patients 6 months to 24 years of age. Tools to aid in the diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma and the decision to biopsy include the ABCDE mnemonic, ugly duckling sign, and dermoscopy. Any suspicious pigmented lesion should be biopsied. Biopsy with a deep scoop shave, saucerization, punch biopsy, or full-thickness excision is preferred to ensure the entire lesion is removed to obtain an accurate measurement of Breslow depth. Breslow depth is important in staging, treatment consideration, and prognosis. Wide local excision by a dermatologist or surgeon with appropriate margins is the primary treatment of choice. Thin lesions with a Breslow depth of less than 0.8 mm usually do not need further treatment after wide local excision and have an excellent prognosis. Lesions with a Breslow depth greater than 0.8 mm may need further diagnostic tests or procedures, including sentinel lymph node biopsy, complete lymph node dissection, gene mutation analysis, and possible treatment with systemic immunotherapy. Use of systemic immunotherapies has improved the prognosis for advanced melanoma (stages III and IV), with 5-year survival rates of 74.8% and 35%, respectively, compared with 62.6% and 16% from 1975 to 2011 before immunotherapy was available.

### Clinical and histologic characteristics of clinically unsuspected melanomas [^112f46xc]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Thin melanomas are recognized and captured by clinicians at an alarming rate, whereas thick melanomas remain underrecognized. Improved recognition of thick melanomas will require further understanding of their clinical and histologic characteristics at various stages of development because emerging data suggest that the thin melanomas being captured today may not represent the forerunners of the thick melanomas. In this retrospective analysis, pathology requisition forms from melanomas diagnosed by histopathology were examined for submitted clinical diagnosis, patient characteristics, melanoma thickness, and biopsy method. Three hundred eighty-five melanomas were identified from 2003 to 2011. Most lesions (71.7%) were clinically suspected to be melanocytic. The mean depth in this group was 0.62mm. Of the unsuspected cases (28.3%), the most common submitted diagnoses were basal cell carcinomas and seborrheic keratoses, consistent with previous reports. The mean depth in the unsuspected group was 1.64mm, and more frequently extended to the deep margin (51.8% vs 25.4% of the time). Shave biopsy was the overwhelming preferred method of biopsy (79.5% overall). Compared with thin melanomas, thick melanomas are underrecognized by physicians due to their lack of characteristic morphologic features; consequently, they are more frequently associated with suboptimal biopsies.

Question 3: If treatment is sought, what is the best next step in management?
A. Cryoablation
B. Shave excision
C. Full-thickness excision
D. Electrodessication and curettage
E. Photodynamic therapy

Answer:
A. Cryoablation – Incorrect. Cryoablation is commonly used for the treatment of warts, actinic keratoses, seborrheic keratoses, and molluscum contagiosum. Due to the nodule size and depth, it is not the ideal choice for a cellular digital fibroma.
B. Shave excision – Incorrect. A shave excision has the advantage of not requiring sutures; however, it is typically limited for lesions that predominate in the upper layers of the skin, unlike a cellular digital fibroma.
C. Full-thickness excision – Correct. A full-thickness excision including the epidermis and dermis is the best choice for a cellular digital fibroma. This will ensure complete removal and minimize the chance for recurrence, although the risk of recurrence is extremely low.
D. Electrodessication and curettage – Incorrect. Electrodessication and curettage, similar to a shave excision, is limited for lesions that predominate in the upper layers of the skin, unlike a cellular digital fibroma. Additionally, broad superficial lesions in areas with thick underlying dermis, such as the trunk and extremities, are ideal candidates for electrodessication and curettage.
E. Photodynamic therapy – Incorrect. Photodynamic therapy involves targeted topical application of a photosensitizer combined with light energy and has no known role in the treatment of cellular digital fibroma. It is typically reserved for precancerous lesions and nonmelanoma skin cancer.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^1121RJTK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary cutaneous melanoma (CM) — clinical information provided to the pathologist — states that on the pathology requisition, it is essential that the clinician provide patient identification, age, sex, and the precise anatomic location of the biopsy site, including laterality; it is strongly recommended that the clinician include the clinical impression and differential diagnosis, size of the lesion, and intent of the biopsy with the type performed (elliptical/fusiform, deep shave/saucerization, broad shave, or punch). Macroscopic satellites around the clinical lesion should be noted because they upstage CM to stage III at the outset and can be associated with microscopic satellites in the primary tumor. It may be very useful for the pathologist to review clinical photographs, if possible, and optional but helpful items to be reported include the level of suspicion for CM, clinical description and history of the lesion beyond size (including whether there has been a change in the lesion or previous biopsy), and dermoscopic features (with or without an accompanying photograph), as these features may add specificity to the diagnosis of CM.

### Deep shave removal of suspected basal cell carcinoma: a prospective study [^117T7Ltw]. Dermatologic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosis and treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in the same visit by shave removal may decrease health care spending and promote patient satisfaction.

Objective

To prospectively evaluate deep shave removal of lesions clinically suspicious for low-risk BCC on the trunk or extremities in immunocompetent patients.

Materials and Methods

Deep shave removal with the intent to remove the entire tumor was performed from January 2015 to June 2016, and patients were followed prospectively for clinical evidence of tumor recurrence.

Results

Seventy-seven lesions were removed from 51 patients, including 29 (37%) superficial and nodular BCCs, 27 (35%) superficial BCCs, 16 (21%) nodular BCCs, and 5 (6%) non-BCCs. Fifteen BCCs (21%) had positive residual margins after deep shave removal, which was significantly more likely to occur in nodular compared with superficial BCCs (odds ratio = 7.8, 95% confidence interval = 1.4–43), and underwent re-excision. Fourteen specimens initially reported to have negative margins after deep shave underwent resectioning, which revealed positive margins in 4 specimens (28.6%). No BCCs have recurred clinically after an average follow-up of 50 months (SE 3.2).

Conclusion

Consider deep shave removal for low-risk BCCs on the trunk or extremities in immunocompetent patients hoping to avoid a second treatment visit.

### Incisional biopsy technique is associated with decreased overall survival for cutaneous melanoma [^112sRbR5]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies examining melanoma biopsy technique have not demonstrated an effect on overall survival.

Objective

To examine overall survival of patients with cutaneous melanoma diagnosed by shave, punch, incisional, or excisional techniques from the National Cancer Database (NCDB).

Materials and Methods

Melanoma data from the 2004 to 2016 NCDB data set were analyzed. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to assess the risk of 5-year all-cause mortality.

Results

In total, 42,272 cases of melanoma were reviewed, with 27,899 (66%) diagnosed by shave biopsy, 8,823 (20.9%) by punch biopsy, and 5,550 (13.1%) by incisional biopsy. Both the univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that tumors diagnosed by incisional biopsy had significantly (p = .001) lower overall 5-year survival compared with shave techniques (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.140, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.055 to 1.231). We found no difference (p = .109) between shave and punch biopsy techniques (HR 1.062, 95% CI 0.987–1.142) or between punch and incisional techniques (HR 1.074, 95% CI 0.979–1.177, p = .131).

Conclusion

Incisional biopsies were associated with decreased overall 5-year survival in the NCDB. No difference was observed between shave and punch biopsy techniques. These findings support current melanoma management guidelines.

### Dermal electrosurgical shave excision… [^111ipKLq]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Shave excision describes the technique of sharp removal of epidermal or dermal lesions by horizontal slicing. Skin lesions can be removed by electrosurgical technique, conventional scissors, or scalpel shaving methods. Shave excision usually extends to the level of the middle dermis, with the subcutaneous tissue left undisturbed. The shave biopsy is ideally suited for pedunculated lesions raised above the level of the surrounding skin. Skin lesions with a minimal dermal component, such as seborrheic keratoses or fibrous papules of the nose, are also excellent candidates for shave excision technique. Inexperienced physicians often find it easiest to control the depth of excision by using a no. 15 blade held horizontal to the skin surface, which is then brought across the base of the lesion with long, unidirectional strokes.

Electrosurgical feathering can then be performed to eliminate sharp wound edges and contour the wound to the surrounding skin. Feathering is generally performed only with an electrosurgical cutting current. Shave biopsy technique. The blade is held horizontal to the skin surface and brought below the lesion while the nondominant hand is used to stretch and stabilize the skin surrounding the lesion during the shave biopsy. Smooth, unidirectional cutting with the blade separates the lesion above from the deep dermis below. ILLUSTRATIONS BY CHRISTY KRAMES. Smoothing shave biopsy sites. Dermal electro-surgical shave excisions can result in circular, crater-like defects that produce a step-off creating shadowing and leaving a noticeable scar. Some surgeons advocate the smoothing of shave biopsy skin edges to blend the healing wound into the surrounding tissues.

Electrosurgical cutting using a low power setting can be effectively performed with a thin wire dermal loop. The technique of electrosurgical "feathering" involves rapid, short brush strokes to smooth the edges and create a more cosmetically acceptable result. Results from several studies have demonstrated that re-excision of basal cell carcinoma specimens with positive margins produces a high frequency of second specimens that have negative margins for malignancy. Basal cell carcinomas at low-risk sites, such as the cheek or neck, require close follow-up. If the histologic analysis of a shave excision specimen reveals squamous cell carcinoma, full thickness re-excision of the site is recommended to completely eradicate the potentially metastatic lesion.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^113mNzz4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary cutaneous melanoma diagnosis — biopsy technique guidance notes that "Superficial shave biopsies may underestimate Breslow thickness and clinical stage and are thus generally discouraged for CM diagnosis", with an exception for "a macular lesion suggestive of MIS, LM type", where "a broad shave biopsy (extending into the deep papillary or superficial reticular dermis) may provide more thorough histologic assessment of potential focal microinvasion than multiple incisional/partial punch biopsies within the lesion would". When a broad shave or saucerization biopsy is performed, "hemostasis with electrocauterization or electrofulguration (hyfrecation) of the base may eradicate underlying melanoma that would otherwise be present in the wide excision (WE) specimen for microstaging", and although spot electrocautery may be necessary, "the use of topical hemostatic agents such as aluminum chloride or ferric subsulfate solution is preferred".

### Guidelines of care for the management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [^111B6xur]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Biopsy for suspected cSCC — The available literature does not identify a single optimal biopsy technique, and recommended techniques include punch biopsy, shave (eg, by tangential technique) biopsy, and excisional biopsy. Excisional biopsy is distinguished from excision with margins in that the intent of the former is to determine and/or confirm diagnosis, whereas the intent of the latter is to remove the tumor. For all techniques, the biopsy specimen size and depth should be adequate to provide the recommended clinical information and pathology report elements to permit accurate diagnosis and guide therapy, including by identifying an aggressive growth pattern if present. Repeat biopsy may be considered if the initial biopsy specimen is inadequate for accurate diagnosis. Selection of the specific biopsy technique is contingent on the clinical characteristics of the suspected tumor, including morphology, expected histologic subtype and depth, natural history, and anatomic location; patient-specific factors, such as bleeding and wound healing diatheses; and patient preference and physician judgment.

### A retrospective comparison between preoperative and postoperative breslow depth in primary cutaneous melanoma: how preoperative shave biopsies affect surgical management [^1147BS89]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Accurate histopathologic staging of preoperative biopsy specimens is critical for determining optimal surgical management for patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) currently list narrow excisional biopsy (fusiform excision) as the preferred technique for biopsying lesions suspicious for melanoma. However, preoperative shave biopsies are routinely performed on lesions concerning for melanoma in many medical centers out of convenience.

Objective

The current retrospective chart review was performed to determine whether preoperative shave biopsies are acceptable for evaluating lesions suspicious for melanoma and whether shave biopsies lead to underestimation of Breslow depth great enough to require additional surgeries.

Methods

A consecutive sample of 242 primary cutaneous melanoma cases surgically excised between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010 in a private practice setting was analyzed for this study.

Results

Breslow depth underestimation occurred in 8 of 226 shave biopsy cases (3.5%). Differences in preoperative and postoperative Breslow depths in shave biopsy cases were not statistically significant (P = 0.48). Underestimation of Breslow depth, melanoma transection, positive deep biopsy margins, and tumor upstaging did not lead to statistically significant changes in surgical management.

Conclusions

Based on the results from the current study and available literature, the authors posit that preoperative deep excisional shave biopsies performed by dermatologists are accurate for determining Breslow depth and for planning surgical management of melanomas.

### Efficacy and tolerability of a novel biopsy device for removing benign epidermal skin lesions [^115u2816]. Dermatologic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The shave biopsy using a razor with an open blade is the current standard of care for sampling superficial skin lesions.

Objective

To enhance safety, the authors developed a novel biopsy device with a closed blade design for removing the epidermal layer of skin and evaluated against the open razor blade for tolerability, scarring, and accuracy in histological diagnosis.

Materials and Methods

Shave biopsies were performed using the novel device or razor blade on benign epidermal skin lesions in 10 patients on comparable body parts. Digital photography, colorimetry, scar scale evaluations, and questionnaires were used to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the devices.

Results

For all patients, accurate histological diagnoses were made regardless of device type. No statistically significant differences were detected between the novel device and razor blade in terms of scar scale assessments, colorimetry, and questionnaire responses. Both patients and the participating dermatologist reported satisfaction with the safety and performance of the novel device. No injuries to the provider occurred with either instrument.

Conclusion

The rotating sphere biopsy device is a potential alternative to the razor blade with comparable tolerability, scarring, and accuracy in histological diagnoses, offering improved safety for patients and health care providers.

NCCN Basal cell skin cancer — imaging modality preferences and biopsy option: Extensive disease includes deep involvement such as bone, named nerves, and deep soft tissue; If disease of named nerve(s) is suspected, MRI with and without contrast is preferred, and If bone disease is suspected, CT with contrast is preferred unless contraindicated. Imaging modality and targeted area should be at the discretion of the treating team based on the suspected extent of disease (ie, local, regional, metastatic), and Histologic confirmation is sufficient to diagnose local recurrence, but MRI with and without contrast can be considered to assess extent of local disease; For nodal or distant metastasis, histologic analysis and/or CT imaging can be used for confirmation and to gauge extent of disease. Shave removal can be considered for clinically low-risk BCC in low-risk site and in situations where additional treatment would pose morbidity/hardship.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^112ZPRAR]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Melanoma: Cutaneous — principles of biopsy of a suspicious pigmented lesion state that excisional/complete biopsy (saucerization/deep shave removal, punch [for small diameter lesions], or elliptical excision) with 1- to 3-mm margins is preferred. Avoid wider margins to permit accurate subsequent lymphatic mapping. The orientation of an elliptical/fusiform excisional biopsy should be planned with definitive wide local excision in mind (eg, longitudinally [axially] and parallel to the underlying lymphatics on the extremities). Full-thickness incisional or punch biopsy of clinically thickest or most atypical portion of lesion is acceptable and may be preferred in certain anatomic areas (eg, palm/sole, digit, face, ear) or for very large lesions, and multiple scouting biopsies may help guide management for very large lesions. Superficial/tangential shave biopsy may compromise pathologic diagnosis and complete assessment of Breslow thickness, but is acceptable when the index of suspicion is low, and a broad shave biopsy may be optimal for histologic assessment for melanoma in situ (MIS), lentigo maligna (LM) type (ie, melanoma on skin with high cumulative sun damage [CSD]). If shave removal or tangential shave biopsy shows residual tumor/pigment at the base, a deeper biopsy (punch or elliptical) should be performed immediately and submitted in a separate container to the pathologist, noting that the shave specimen was transected. Biopsy of the nail matrix should be performed for suspected subungual melanoma and requires expertise in biopsy of the nail apparatus. Repeat narrow-margin excisional biopsy is generally not indicated if the initial specimen meets criteria for SLNB, unless the initial biopsy is inadequate for diagnosis or microstaging. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Obtaining an adequate specimen for the diagnosis of pigmented lesions [^111sNLPf]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Melanoma is a common, potentially deadly disease but is curable if caught early. A specimen of a pigmented lesion must capture the entire width and depth of the lesion to evaluate the lesion's size, symmetry, and circumscription. Saucerization shaving, punching, and excision biopsy are 3 techniques that can be used to achieve a satisfactory specimen. Physicians should have a low threshold to biopsy a suspicious atypical pigmented lesion, but acceptable specimens are key in following through with an accurate diagnosis.

### Guidelines of care for the management of primary cutaneous melanoma [^116v4dyW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Diagnostic biopsy of suspected melanoma — preferred technique and margins emphasize that the preferred biopsy technique is a narrow excisional/complete biopsy with 1- to 3-mm margins that encompasses the entire breadth of lesion and is of sufficient depth to prevent transection at the base, and this may be accomplished by fusiform/elliptical or punch excision or deep shave/saucerization removal to depth below the anticipated plane of the lesion. Partial/incomplete sampling (incisional biopsy) is acceptable in select clinical circumstances such as facial or acral location, very large lesion, or low clinical suspicion or uncertainty of diagnosis, and narrow-margin excisional biopsy may be performed if an initial partial biopsy is inadequate for diagnosis or microstaging, but it should not generally be performed if the initial specimen meets the criteria for consideration of sentinel lymph node biopsy.

### Perpendicular inked versus tangential shaved margins in breast-conserving surgery: does the method matter? [^115CLM8q]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In breast-conserving surgery (BCS), the method of margin assessment and the definition of a negative margin vary widely. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of positive margins and rates of reexcision between two methods of margin assessment at a single institution.

Study Design

In July 2004, our protocol for margin evaluation changed from perpendicular inked margins (Group A, n = 263) to tangential shaved margins (Group B, n = 261). In Group A, margins were classified as positive, close, and negative. Margins designated as "close" were further defined as: ≤ 1 mm, ≤ 2 mm, and ≤ 3 mm. In Group B, shaved margins (by definition 2 to 3 mm) were reported as positive or negative.

Results

The rate of reported "positive" margins was significantly higher in Group B: 127 of 261 (49%) versus 42 of 263 (16%), p < 0.001. But when patients with "positive, close, or both" kinds of margins were combined in Group A, there was no significant difference between the two techniques. Although the shaved margin was 2- to 3-mm thick, the rate of reexcision in Group B was significantly higher when compared with that in patients with "positive, close, or both" ≤ 3 mm margins in Group A (75% versus 52%, p < 0.001). The likelihood of finding residual disease remained the same (27% versus 32%, p = NS).

Conclusions

The tangential shaved-margin technique results in a higher proportion of reported positive margins and limits the ability of the surgeon to discriminate among patients with close margins, resulting in a higher rate of reexcision. The fact that many, but not all, patients with positive or close margins in both groups underwent reexcision emphasizes the role of surgical judgment in this setting. Longer followup is required to determine equivalency in rates of local recurrence between these two methods of margin assessment.

### Melanoma arising from partially biopsied moderately dysplastic nevus [^113Ad9QW]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The management of moderately atypical DN with positive histologic margins without residual pigmentation remains a controversial area in dermatologic practice. Although Pigmented Lesion Subcommittee recommendations tentatively support observation in such cases, substantial variability exists in clinical practice.52% of pigmented lesion clinic directors recommend no additional procedure, while 48% recommend additional margins of between 1 and 4 mm after initial biopsy. This variability is further compounded by low intraobserver reproducibility, with histopathologic agreement at 41% for moderate DN and 47% for severe DN.

Only a few cases have reported transformation of nevi to melanoma (Table I).

Table I
Reported cases of melanoma arising from benign, mild, and moderately atypical nevi

A pregnant patient developed melanoma 16 months after a biopsy revealed a benign nevus with no residual lesion. Another case described recurrent moderate DN at the same site despite 3 complete re-excisions, which developed into malignant melanoma 5.75 years after the last re-excision. Although Kim et al (2018) found no malignant transformation among moderate DN in a large retrospective cohort study, the study size may be underpowered to detect rare events. An earlier retrospective cohort study with a larger sample size that included partial biopsies found 5 cases of melanoma arising from mild-to-moderate DN and 1 case arising from moderate DN among patients who were observed after initial biopsy. Five of the 6 melanoma cases arose from DN in which the initial biopsy was partial, leading the authors to recommend saucerization or deep shave biopsy to avoid missing melanoma. This present case is among the few reports of moderate DN with positive margins that showed no clinical repigmentation but later progressed to melanoma.

### Biopsy techniques. diagnosis of melanoma [^117FUzZW]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The biopsy of a suspicious pigmented lesion is critical to establishing a correct and complete diagnosis. It allows the dermatopathologist accurately to diagnose melanoma and to gauge maximum depth of invasion (and other histologic criterion). This, in turn, influences the extent of further necessary surgery or other adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, choosing the appropriate biopsy technique provides adequate cosmetic results, bearing in mind that the excisional technique is ideal because it removes the suspicious lesion en toto. Excisional biopsies should extend to the subcutaneous fat by means of a punch biopsy, a fusiform ellipse, or a saucerization. Incisional biopsies can be performed in certain circumstances, but should be done so with caution because sampling error may lead to missed diagnosis or inaccurate histologic criterion, such as depth.

### Method of biopsy and incidence of positive margins in primary melanoma [^115z1Y1M]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The staging of patients with primary melanoma is dependent on adequate sampling of the tumor thickness. Initial biopsies with a positive deep margin suggest inadequate sampling, potentially limiting accurate staging and affecting treatment decisions.

Methods

To determine the efficacy of shave biopsy to adequately sample the tumor, we retrospectively reviewed our pathology database for original pathology reports of primary melanomas accessioned between 01/01/04 and 6/30/05. The biopsies were evaluated by technique, the presence of tumor at the margins of the specimen, and specimen thickness.

Results

We identified 240 cases of primary melanoma; 223/240 were analyzable. The specimens were divided by biopsy technique (excisional, n = 51; punch, n = 44; and shave, n = 128). Shave and punch specimens had a significantly higher percentage of positive margins than excisional specimens (50, 68, and 16%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Shave specimens had a significantly higher percentage of positive deep margins than punch or excisional specimens (22, 7, and 2%, respectively; P = 0.0009). For melanomas ≤ 1 mm, shave specimens had a significantly higher percentage of positive deep margins than punch or excisional specimens (17, 0, and 0%, respectively; P = 0.0014). There was a significant difference in specimen thickness (P = 0.0005), with shave specimens being the thinnest.

Conclusions

The presence of tumor at the lateral margin of punch biopsies is an expected result, since this method is often used to diagnose lesions with a large diameter. The presence of positive deep margins in 22% of shave biopsy specimens compromises the ability of this technique to properly stage patients.

### A comparison of current practice patterns of US dermatologists versus published guidelines for the biopsy, initial management, and follow up of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma [^116qFH3y]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines exist for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma, but their adoption, prevalence, and impact have not yet been determined.

Objective

To determine current melanoma clinical management practices of US dermatologists and the variance from guidelines that might exist.

Methods

A cross-sectional e-mail survey study assessing preferred biopsy methods for lesions suspicious for melanoma, margins used for excision, and recommended follow-up intervals were sent to 6177 US dermatologists (540 responding). The representative nature of the responding subset was verified by comparing their demographics to that from the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) membership.

Results

Management varied from published guidelines. Shave biopsy (35%) was the most commonly used method followed by narrow excisional biopsy (31%), saucerization/scoop shave (12%), punch (11%), and wide excision (3%). Excisional margins narrower than recommended were noted and follow-up intervals varied. There were significant management differences noted for dermatologists by practice setting and by years in practice.

Limitations

The impact of patient history, lesion anatomic site, and size of lesion were not assessed. Recall and nonresponder sampling bias may exist.

Conclusion

Variations in dermatologists' approaches to melanoma management and variance from current guidelines suggest that a knowledge gap may exist representing an educational opportunity. However, emerging data may also justify deviations from existing guidelines, suggesting a reassessment of the guidelines may be indicated.

### Needle-guided shave excision with ultrasonographic assistance: a new technique [^113hCVCq]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

A lack of control in the deep margin of shave excision is a drawback of this technique.

Objective

To describe a more precise shaving technique by sonography with the use of a fine injector needle as a depth marker.

Methods

After having examined the invasion levels of 40 benign skin lesions, a fine injector needle was intentionally threaded into the dermis horizontally just beneath the required shaving plane. Correct placement of the needle was ensured by sonographic examination after possible reinsertion trials. Large lesions needed several needles to be inserted. The tissue above the needles was then shaved off, whereas the deep dermal layer was protected.

Results

Histologic examination revealed that 77% of superficial and intermediate-thickness lesions were removed totally without disturbing the derma-fat junction.

Conclusion

The needle-guided technique was found to be effective in the control of the deep margin of shave excision.

### Treatment of basal cell carcinoma with curettage alone [^117UgTUq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Although curettage and electrodesiccation (C&E) is widely used to treat basal cell carcinoma, whether electrodesiccation improves outcome is unknown.

Objective

We sought to compare cure rates of curettage alone with those of C&E.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective records review of patients treated with curettage alone at 5-year follow-up or longer that extracted data about tumor location, size, histologic subtype, biopsy specimen margin involvement, and recurrence, as well as data about the medical history of patients treated in a dermatology clinic in a tertiary-care academic medical institution.

Results

Biopsy-proven tumors (302) amenable to treatment with C&E and treated by a single investigator with curettage alone had a 5-year cure rate of 96.03%, with minimal complications (hypopigmentation, scarring). Tumors involving more than 50% of the deep edge of the shave biopsy specimen had an increased risk of recurrence.

Limitations

This is a retrospective study based on historic controls.

Conclusion

For nonaggressive basal cell carcinoma, curettage alone has a cure rate similar to the published rates for C&E.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) biopsy approach emphasizes that studies using subsequent definitive excision as the reference standard found initial punch or shave biopsies were able to detect the most aggressive histologic subtypes of BCC in the vast majority of cases, but when recurrent tumor, deep invasion, or other aggressive features are suspected, more extensive tissue resection or multiple scouting biopsies may in certain cases be needed if more superficial methods are insufficient; the need to obtain information through biopsy is counterbalanced by patient preference and physician judgment to minimize biopsy-associated discomfort, trauma, risk for wound infection or dehiscence, scar, and loss of function, particularly on the head, neck, and other vital, functional, sensory, or cosmetically sensitive sites.
