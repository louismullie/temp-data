## Question

Nitrates to improve idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "nitrates" can improve idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about terminology and whether "nitrates" means organic nitrates versus inhaled nitric oxide or downstream NO–cGMP modulators. Then, I should verify what major IPF and pulmonary hypertension guidelines actually recommend. Next, I will examine trial evidence for inhaled nitric oxide in fibrotic ILD with pulmonary hypertension and for PDE5 inhibitors in IPF. Finally, I will synthesize safety concerns such as V/Q mismatch and conclude with practical, guideline-concordant recommendations for IPF management and PH-ILD exceptions, if any.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate distinct therapies. In cardiovascular medicine, "nitrates" typically refers to organic nitrates like nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate/mononitrate, whereas in pulmonary studies "nitric oxide" often means inhaled NO and "NO–cGMP pathway" modulation includes phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil; these are mechanistically related but clinically distinct use-cases in lung disease, and I need to be precise here. Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall: I initially wondered if N-acetylcysteine (NAC) might be relevant as a "nitrate", but that's incorrect — NAC is an antioxidant/glutathione precursor and not a nitrate, and its mixed data do not inform nitrate efficacy in IPF, so I should not mix these concepts.

> Next, I should review whether organic nitrates have any evidence or endorsement in IPF. Hold on, I should verify guideline texts and trial landscapes: major ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT IPF guidelines from 2011, 2015, and the 2022 update do not list organic nitrates as a treatment option, and I cannot find randomized IPF trials of nitroglycerin or isosorbide for antifibrotic benefit or symptom-based outcomes, which strongly suggests no established role for "nitrates" in IPF management.

> I will now examine inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), since that is the closest pulmonary "nitric oxide–based" intervention. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with fibrotic ILD at risk of PH, pulsed iNO at 30 μg/kg/h improved moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and oxygen saturation over 8 weeks and was well tolerated, which signals physiologic and functional benefit in fILD-PH rather than in unselected IPF per se; a prior case report described outpatient iNO as a bridge to lung transplantation with improved oxygenation and exercise tolerance, but that is very low-level evidence and not practice changing by itself [^1145naMk] [^111EyQhA]. Wait, I should double-check guideline positions before over-extrapolating: contemporary IPF guidelines do not recommend routine iNO for IPF, so any use remains investigational or limited to specialized settings for PH-ILD, not standard IPF therapy [^112Ph5Qt] [^115Hs7yL].

> Next, I should review PDE5 inhibitors that act on the NO–cGMP pathway. In advanced IPF, the STEP-IPF trial did not meet its primary endpoint on 6-minute walk distance, although small improvements in dyspnea, gas exchange, and HRQL were observed, and post hoc signals suggested potential benefits in those with right heart dysfunction; INSTAGE explored nintedanib with or without sildenafil with nuanced subgroup findings, but again this does not establish sildenafil as IPF therapy broadly [^111mKuBB] [^116HvXUQ]. I need to ensure my recommendations align with guidance: the 2015 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT treatment guideline recommended against using PDE5 inhibitors for IPF itself, whereas the 2022 ESC/ERS PH guideline allows consideration of PDE5 inhibitors in severe PH associated with ILD on an individualized basis at PH centers; a 2022 network meta-analysis suggested sildenafil may reduce acute exacerbations and hospitalizations, but that does not overturn IPF guideline recommendations and should be interpreted in context of patient selection and endpoints [^1175YG5a] [^115Hs7yL] [^1175YG5a].

> But wait, what about potential harm from vasodilators in parenchymal lung disease — could organic nitrates worsen gas exchange by increasing perfusion to poorly ventilated units and thereby aggravate V/Q mismatch. The physiologic concern is real, and invasive hemodynamic/ MIGET data show certain vasodilators like prostacyclin can worsen shunt and oxygenation in lung fibrosis, while inhaled NO and sildenafil showed more favorable pulmonary selectivity acutely; still, without trials in IPF for organic nitrates, the risk–benefit calculus remains unfavorable for empiric nitrate use [^114nYYxp].

> I should now anchor on the standard of care for IPF, so we don't drift into off-label, non-evidence-based approaches. The established disease-modifying therapies are nintedanib and pirfenidone, which consistently slow FVC decline and are guideline-recommended, forming the backbone of IPF pharmacotherapy alongside nonpharmacologic care such as oxygen for resting hypoxemia and pulmonary rehabilitation where appropriate; emerging strategies emphasize add-on or combination regimens, but these build on antifibrotic foundations rather than substituting "nitrates" or iNO for IPF treatment [^113pXshL] [^112Ph5Qt] [^113HsuUY] [^116XwUyX].

> Hold on, I should verify the related PH-ILD context, because that's the niche where NO-pathway agents might apply. For confirmed PH associated with ILD, current PH guidelines recommend optimizing ILD care and hypoxemia management and consider inhaled treprostinil broadly, with individualized consideration of PDE5 inhibitors in severe PH-ILD at expert PH centers; none of this, however, supports routine "nitrate" use for IPF, and iNO remains investigational or a bridge strategy rather than a standard outpatient therapy in IPF [^115rLgmb] [^114x4F5s] [^115Hs7yL].

> Putting it all together, I should be explicit and clinically actionable. Organic nitrates have no evidence base and no guideline support in IPF, and given the physiologic risk of worsening V/Q mismatch, they should not be used to treat IPF. Inhaled nitric oxide has shown activity improvements in fILD with PH but is not a standard IPF therapy and should be limited to trials or specialized contexts. PDE5 inhibitors are not recommended for IPF itself but may be considered in severe PH associated with ILD at PH centers. The evidence therefore does not support using "nitrates" to improve IPF, and best practice remains antifibrotic therapy, optimization of supportive care, and referral to expert centers for PH-ILD evaluation when indicated [^1175YG5a] [^111xtvrW] [^1145naMk] [^115Hs7yL] [^113pXshL] [^111KDKff].

---

Nitrates are not recommended for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) because there is no evidence of benefit on lung function, symptoms, or survival [^notfound], and they may worsen gas exchange by increasing ventilation–perfusion mismatch [^114nYYxp]. Current guidelines do not support nitrate use in IPF [^111KDKff], and management should focus on antifibrotic therapy [^113pXshL], oxygen [^113HsuUY], and supportive care [^113PoyTn].

---

## Pathophysiological rationale for nitrate use in IPF

Nitrates release nitric oxide (NO), causing vasodilation and reducing pulmonary vascular resistance [^114nYYxp]. In IPF, pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common and contributes to dyspnea and exercise limitation, suggesting a theoretical role for nitrates in improving hemodynamics and symptoms [^113pgHsL]. However, IPF lungs exhibit heterogeneous ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) matching, and non-selective vasodilation can increase perfusion to poorly ventilated areas, **worsening hypoxemia** [^114nYYxp].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding nitrate use in IPF

Robust clinical evidence supporting nitrate use in IPF is lacking [^111hHVDs]. No **randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** have specifically evaluated nitrates in IPF [^117Nv1VM]. Limited data on other vasodilators, such as sildenafil (a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor) [^114yPw3R], show minimal or no benefit in IPF without significant pulmonary hypertension [^111mKuBB]. Sildenafil did not significantly improve exercise capacity or lung function in IPF [^116HvXUQ], although small improvements in oxygenation and quality of life were observed in specific subgroups [^111mKuBB].

---

## Potential benefits and risks of nitrate therapy in IPF

### Potential benefits

Potential benefits include **pulmonary vasodilation**, which may theoretically reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve hemodynamics, and **symptom relief**, with potential improvements in dyspnea and exercise tolerance due to reduced pulmonary hypertension [^115rLgmb].

---

### Potential risks

- **Worsening hypoxemia**: Non-selective vasodilation may increase perfusion to poorly ventilated areas, exacerbating hypoxemia [^114nYYxp].
- **Ventilation–perfusion mismatch**: Increased V/Q mismatch may worsen gas exchange and respiratory symptoms [^112Ph5Qt].
- **Hypotension**: Systemic vasodilation may cause hypotension, dizziness, and syncope, particularly in elderly patients.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from major respiratory societies **do not recommend nitrates** for IPF management [^111KDKff]. The American Thoracic Society (ATS), European Respiratory Society (ERS), Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), and Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) emphasize antifibrotic therapies (pirfenidone and nintedanib) as the primary pharmacological treatments for IPF [^113pXshL] [^1175YG5a]. They do not list nitrates as a recommended or investigational therapy [^111xtvrW].

---

## Comparison with other vasodilators

Other vasodilators, such as sildenafil and endothelin receptor antagonists, have been studied in IPF with limited success. Sildenafil showed minimal benefit in patients without significant pulmonary hypertension [^111mKuBB], and endothelin receptor antagonists (e.g. ambrisentan) have been associated with **increased mortality and adverse outcomes** [^11289koK] [^112LEsyb]. These findings suggest that vasodilator therapy, including nitrates, may not be beneficial and could be harmful in IPF [^1149Ffkz].

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and research

There are currently **no significant ongoing clinical trials** specifically investigating nitrates in IPF [^117Nv1VM]. Research efforts are focused on antifibrotic therapies, novel molecular targets, and supportive care strategies [^1116HAey]. This lack of nitrate research further indicates limited interest and promise in this therapeutic approach.

---

## Patient selection criteria and biomarkers

Given the lack of supporting evidence, there are **no established patient selection criteria** or biomarkers to identify patients who may benefit from nitrate therapy in IPF [^111KDKff]. Clinical decisions should be guided by established therapies and individualized patient assessment.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Nitrates are **not recommended** for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) due to a lack of evidence for efficacy and potential risks, including worsening hypoxemia and ventilation–perfusion mismatch [^114nYYxp]. Current clinical guidelines do not endorse nitrate use in IPF; management should focus on antifibrotic therapies, oxygen supplementation, and supportive care [^111KDKff].

The art of clinical decision making

As indicated by Rochwerg et al, evidence-based guidelines provide a comprehensive summary of the available evidence and a transparent process leading to recommendations that are not biased by personal experiences or opinions of individual experts. The strength of the GRADE methodology used in this process lies in the systematic and pragmatic literature search, which leads to an unbiased overview of the available evidence on a given topic. Its shortcoming is the exclusion of clinical experience and common sense not supported by formal evidence from well-designed clinical trials, as succinctly discussed by Wells. This approach eventually leads to recommendations that lack practicability, as exemplified in the diagnostic algorithm of the IPF guideline. It foresees a surgical lung biopsy for patients with a non-informational HRCT, yet this cannot be performed in a large portion of these patients due to disease severity, comorbidities, or cost. Consequently, according to this guideline, a significant number of patients are left without a diagnosis or treatment.

This differentiation has gained significance since the recent approval of nintedanib and pirfenidone, and the issue of whether these drugs should also be used in probable and possible IPF remains unresolved. While possible IPF patients were included in the INPULSIS trials with nintedanib, only definite IPF patients were allowed in the ASCEND trial with pirfenidone. However, neither of these studies has led to a definite solution.

### Efficacy of N-acetylcysteine plus pirfenidone in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114jx5kk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is commonly associated with fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and presents a poor prognosis. Among adults over 65 years of age, it was reported by Schafer SC et al. that there are 494 cases per 100,000 people, which is double the rate observed a decade ago. Patients diagnosed with IPF typically experience a median survival time of 2–5 years, and quite a few are not in the early stage when they see a doctor, resulting in a marked deterioration in their quality of life. However, drug treatment for IPF is not effective enough, highlighting a pressing need for additional treatment modalities.

Pirfenidone has been shown to regulate transforming growth factors and fibroblasts, producing antioxidant and antifibrotic effects, as well as regulating reactive oxygen species metabolism. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided evidence that pirfenidone can effectively decelerate the progression of lung function and extend progression-free survival. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant and scavenger of oxygen free radicals, serves as a precursor of glutathione and collaborates with catalase to decompose hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. The addition of NAC to azathioprine and prednisone has been demonstrated to postpone the decline of lung function in the IFIGENIA study.

Several case-control and cohort studies conducted in Japan, Germany, and China have demonstrated the efficacy of NAC plus pirfenidone for the treatment of IPF. However, a number of high-quality RCTs, such as those conducted by Sakamoto S et al. and the PANORAMA research, have revealed that the combination therapy does not offer superior efficacy.

Regarding the medical management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, specifically with respect to N-acetylcysteine, the BTS/ITS/TSANZ 2008 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of prednisolone (tapering from 0.5 mg/day to 10–20 mg/day) with azathioprine (2 mg/kg, maximum 150 mg/day) and N-acetylcysteine (600 mg TID) over prednisolone and azathioprine alone in patients with IPF.

### Sildenafil for treatment of lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension: A randomised controlled trial [^114nYYxp]. Lancet (2002). High credibility.

Lung fibrosis can be complicated by pulmonary hypertension, which limits both exercise tolerance and life expectancy. Moreover, vasodilators might cause a deterioration in gas exchange. Our aim was to compare the acute effects of sildenafil, nitric oxide, and epoprostenol in individuals with pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung fibrosis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomised controlled, open-label trial involving 16 individuals admitted to our hospital with pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung fibrosis. After inhalation of nitric oxide (10–20 ppm), patients were assigned to either a maximum tolerated dose of intravenous epoprostenol (mean 8.0 ng/kg per min, n = 8) or oral sildenafil (50 mg, n = 8). The primary objective was to assess the pulmonary vasodilative potency of sildenafil by comparing it with inhaled nitric oxide and infused epoprostenol. Analyses were conducted by intention to treat.

- **Findings**: The pulmonary vascular resistance index was reduced by nitric oxide (-21.9%, 95% CI -14.1 to -36.2), epoprostenol (-36.9%, 95% CI -24.4 to -59.6), and sildenafil (-32.5%, 95% CI -10.2 to -54.1). However, the ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance decreased only in individuals who received nitric oxide and sildenafil. Baseline measurement of multiple-inert-gas elimination showed right-to-left shunt flow (4.8%, 0.0–28.2) and little perfusion of low ventilation (V)/perfusion (Q) areas (0.1%, 0.0–13.0). Prostacyclin was found to increase V/Q mismatch (shunt 16.8%, 95% CI 10.8–35.9; low V/Q 3.8%, 95% CI 0.0–13.0) and decrease arterial oxygenation. By contrast, nitric oxide showed improved outcomes (4.5%, 0.0–18.0; 0.0%.

### A comprehensive comparison of the safety and efficacy of drugs in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a network meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials [^112LEsyb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Procoagulases may directly stimulate fibrosis through cell surface receptor-mediated responses. A previous unblinded study reported a 1-year survival benefit with anticoagulation (Heparin + Warfarin) in patients with IPF. However, in a later RCT, warfarin was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (14 warfarin versus 3 placebo deaths; P = 0.005), and the study had to be terminated early due to excessive mortality. Data from preclinical models suggested that the expression of endothelin receptors in IPF lung tissue increased while antagonizing endothelin receptors may reduce the severity of pulmonary fibrosis.

Ambrisentan is a selective ETA receptor antagonist that had been approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). One RCT reported that Ambrisentan treatment for IPF increased mortality (Ambrisentan: 7.9% vs. Placebo: 3.7%) and an increase in the proportion of patients with IPF with decreased lung function (Ambrisentan: 16.7% vs. Placebo: 11.7%). As a result, the study was terminated early. Our findings also confirmed that the safety and efficacy of Warfarin and Ambrisentan were very poor compared to other drugs and placebo, combining with previous findings that Warfarin and Ambrisentan should not be used clinically for IPF. In addition, several other drugs (Bosentan, Macitentan, and Simtuzumab) are less outstanding than placebo in terms of safety and efficacy, and further clinical studies are needed to confirm their efficacy.

### Outcomes for hospitalized patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated with antifibrotic medications [^113dAbVc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease for which there is no cure. However, lung function decline, hospitalizations, and mortality may be reduced with the use of the antifibrotic medications, nintedanib and pirfenidone. The historical outcomes for hospitalized patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are grim, but there is a paucity of data since the approval of nintedanib and pirfenidone for treatment. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of nintedanib and pirfenidone on mortality following respiratory-related hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation.

- **Methods**: Using a large U.S. insurance database, we created a one-to-one propensity score-matched cohort of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated and untreated with an antifibrotic who underwent respiratory-related hospitalization between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018. Mortality was evaluated at 30 days and end of follow-up (up to 2 years). Subgroup analyses were performed for all patients receiving treatment in an ICU and those receiving invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation during the index hospitalization.

- **Results**: Antifibrotics were not observed to affect the utilization of mechanical ventilation or ICU treatment during the index admission or affect mortality at 30 days. If patients survived hospitalization, mortality was reduced in the treated cohort compared to the untreated cohort when followed up to two years (20.1% vs. 47.8%).

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with antifibrotic medications appears to have a long-term benefit on mortality for patients who survive initial hospitalization.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - clinical management guided by the evidence-based GRADE approach: what arguments can be made against transparency in guideline development [^116cmc3S]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines have undergone intense evolution over the last 15 years. The main driver behind this transformation has been the shift from what used to be called expert- or consensus-based recommendations to evidence-driven recommendations. This distinction represents a typical misunderstanding because, even in the era of evidence-based guidelines, recommendations are developed by clinical experts in the field and require consensus of panel members on the best possible treatment options. The transparent link between the evidence and the recommendations, along with the requirement of making structured expert judgments, represents a shift in the guideline development paradigm. This holds true even for evidence-based guidelines that focus on complex and rare diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

In 2000, a selected panel of international experts in the field of interstitial lung diseases provided a guideline for the diagnosis and management of IPF. Due to the paucity of evidence available and the relatively immature field of guideline methodology, this document was developed using the conventional consensus approach based on the opinions of a few expert panel members, without a systematic review of the literature or formal quality of evidence evaluation. Regardless, this document, then considered state-of-the-art for the disease, provided useful direction to clinicians in diagnosing and managing patients with IPF. Over the next decade, an increasing number of studies in the field of IPF were published based on this guidance document.

### Models of disease behavior in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^116EQxHN]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a diffuse parenchymal lung disease of unknown cause. The natural history of the disease can vary considerably, making it difficult to predict the clinical trajectory for an individual patient. Accurate prognostication is desirable for clinical management as well as for cohort enrichment in clinical trials of therapeutics. Clinical and biomarker models of disease behavior have been developed to improve prognostication in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with moderate predictive capabilities. Integrated prediction models that combine both clinical and biomarker variables will enhance prognostication for patients and improve cohort enrichment strategies for clinical trials. This goal may be best achieved through collaborative patient registries with prospectively collected biological samples, allowing for characterization of disease behavior in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - clinical management guided by the evidence-based GRADE approach: What arguments can be made against transparency in guideline development [^112hVRjR]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Input from clinical experts in the field is integral, and guideline panelists must interpret the evidence summary, the certainty in estimate effects, and consider the factors listed above to arrive at a direction and strength of recommendation using the EtD. Although some judgments will require an element of subjectivity, GRADE ensures explicit recording of rationale to improve transparency and reproducibility. Discussion of the evidence summaries and other EtD criteria for the 2015 IPF guidelines included all panel members; however, to help ensure impartiality, only non-conflicted members of the panel were permitted to formulate the recommendations themselves.

The final result, using the GRADE process, is a comprehensive, systematic, and explicit evidence-based guideline. Recommendations for the 2015 IPF update were formulated using the common terminology of "we suggest" for conditional (also known as weak) recommendations and "we recommend" for strong recommendations. Strong recommendations are those that apply to the vast majority of patients, understanding a small minority will choose the opposite course of action. These recommendations are sometimes used to drive policy decisions. Conditional recommendations should apply to the majority of patients, but there will be a large minority who will choose the opposite. For conditional recommendations, especially those based on low or very low certainty of evidence, a model of shared decision-making between clinicians and patients is imperative, considering all the factors above in addition to individual circumstances.

### Development of novel agents for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Progress in target selection and clinical trial design [^1116HAey]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal disease. Until recently, the standard therapy for this disease has been essentially supportive, with the exception of a minority of patients who were eligible for lung transplantation. The development pathway for novel medications for IPF has been complicated. There have been several challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis, unpredictable clinical course, lack of validated biomarkers, the low clinical predictive value of animal models of lung injury, and the need to commit to large clinical trials of long duration to obtain initial evidence of clinical efficacy.

Despite these challenges, the combination of recent advances in translational medicine and the unprecedented increase in clinical data accumulated from recent large clinical trials has stimulated an increase in the number of clinical development programs for IPF. Clinical programs are increasingly characterized by rational target selection, preclinical optimization of therapeutic molecules, and an emphasis on efficient clinical trial design. A lower rate of functional decline in patients treated with pirfenidone and nintedanib was demonstrated in large clinical trials. In October 2014, these two drugs became the first agents to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of IPF. (Pirfenidone had already been approved in several countries outside the United States.) In November 2014, the European Medicines Agency approved the use of nintedanib for IPF.

The landscape for management of IPF has markedly changed.

### Nintedanib and sildenafil in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and right heart dysfunction. A prespecified subgroup analysis of a double-blind randomized clinical trial (INSTAGE) [^116HvXUQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by lung function decline, dyspnea, and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL). IPF is hypothesized to result from epithelial injury and abnormal repair processes, leading to excess accumulation of extracellular matrix produced by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Additionally, destruction of the vasculature and aberrant vascular remodeling result in pulmonary vascular abnormalities, particularly in patients with more advanced disease.

Nintedanib, an intracellular inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, is an approved treatment for IPF. In patients with IPF and mild or moderate impairment in lung function, nintedanib slows disease progression by reducing the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) by about 50% compared with placebo. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor and selective pulmonary vasodilator, is an approved treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the STEP-IPF (Sildenafil Trial of Exercise Performance in IPF) trial, in patients with IPF and a diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (D CO) < 35% predicted, there was no significant benefit on exercise capacity with sildenafil versus placebo over 12 weeks. However, differences in D CO, dyspnea, and HRQL favored sildenafil. In a post hoc analysis, sildenafil was associated with benefits on exercise capacity and HRQL in patients with right ventricular systolic dysfunction (RVSD) or right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) on echocardiogram. In the INSTAGE trial, patients with IPF and D CO of 35% predicted or lower were randomized to receive nintedanib.

### A comprehensive comparison of the safety and efficacy of drugs in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a network meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials [^114yPw3R]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The results showed no difference in lung function improvement with placebo for Imatinib (FVC (L) absolute change from baseline) and Sildenafil (FVC (% predicted) absolute change from baseline), and the SUCRA values were also roughly equal to placebo. It was also found that Imatinib and Sildenafil had lower all-cause mortality than Warfarin, and the SUCRA values for the safety of Imatinib and Sildenafil were also lower than those of placebo and some other drugs.

Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPAH). It stabilizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate, the second messenger of nitric oxide, which leads to pulmonary vasodilation in patients with IPF and thereby improves gas exchange. In addition, Sildenafil also reduced the production of superoxide in the mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis. A previous study reported that Sildenafil (20–50 mg orally 3 times daily for 3 months) resulted in an improvement in 6-MWT distances of patients with IPF. However, in one RCT, there was no difference in FVC (% predicted) changes in 89 patients with advanced IPF in the Sildenafil group compared with 91 patients in the placebo group (mean change = 0.32, 95% CI [−1.12 to 1.76], P = 0.66), and there was also no significant difference in SAEs and all-cause mortality. In another RCT, there was no significant difference in FVC (% predicted) in IPF patients (P = 0.79) between Sildenafil and placebo, and there were few SAEs.

Imatinib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

### Safety and tolerability of acetylcysteine and pirfenidone combination therapy in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^113qo2wB]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Oral acetylcysteine (also known as N-acetylcysteine) is used with pirfenidone to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in Europe. However, no randomised studies have investigated the safety and tolerability of this combination. The PANORAMA study assessed the safety and tolerability of acetylcysteine combined with pirfenidone in patients with IPF, and exploratory efficacy endpoints were also assessed.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind randomised trial at 48 sites in eight countries. Patients with IPF, aged 40–80 years and established on pirfenidone (at least 1602 mg/day for 8 weeks or longer), were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio via an interactive voice response system to receive concomitant oral acetylcysteine (600 mg, three times daily) or placebo for 24 weeks. A stratified blocked randomisation scheme was used with a block size of 4. Randomisation was stratified by dose of pirfenidone (2403 mg/day [the maximum dose] or < 2403 mg/day). Patients, physicians, study staff, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. The primary endpoint was the assessment of adverse events, which were collected at each visit and for 28 days after the last dose of the study drug. Exploratory efficacy measurements included forced vital capacity (FVC), carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and 6-minute walk distance. Analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of the study medication.

### Models of disease behavior in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^114Gh4DM]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a diffuse parenchymal lung disease of unknown cause. The natural history of the disease can vary considerably, making it difficult to predict the clinical trajectory for an individual patient. Accurate prognostication is desirable for clinical management and cohort enrichment in clinical trials of therapeutics. Clinical and biomarker models of disease behavior have been developed to improve prognostication in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with moderate predictive capabilities. Integrated prediction models that combine both clinical and biomarker variables will enhance prognostication for patients and improve cohort enrichment strategies for clinical trials. This goal may be best achieved through collaborative patient registries with prospectively collected biological samples that allow for characterization of disease behavior in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### Modern concepts on the role of inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis [^114bAymW]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a uniformly lethal disease with limited biomarkers and no proven therapeutic intervention short of lung transplantation. Pulmonary fibrosis was previously thought to result from inflammation in the lung. Although some forms of pulmonary fibrosis may result from inflammation, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is currently thought to result primarily from cell death and secondarily from inflammation.

- **Objective**: To determine the role of inflammation in pulmonary fibrosis in light of our laboratory's published and unpublished research and published literature.

- **Data sources**: Review based on our laboratory's published and unpublished experimental data with relevant background and clinical context provided.

- **Conclusions**: Although cell death is central to pulmonary fibrosis, the proper cytokine environment leading to macrophage polarization is also critical. Evaluation of this environment is promising both for the development of disease biomarkers and for targets for therapeutic intervention.

### A controlled trial of sildenafil in advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^111mKuBB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, may preferentially improve blood flow to well-ventilated regions of the lung in patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, potentially improving gas exchange. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with sildenafil would improve walk distance, dyspnea, and quality of life in patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, defined as a carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of less than 35% of the predicted value.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of sildenafil in two periods. The first period consisted of 12 weeks of a double-blind comparison between sildenafil and a placebo control. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an increase in the 6-minute walk distance of 20% or more. Key secondary outcomes included changes in oxygenation, degree of dyspnea, and quality of life. The second period was a 12-week open-label evaluation involving all patients receiving sildenafil.

- **Results**: A total of 180 patients were enrolled in the study. The difference in the primary outcome was not significant, with 9 of 89 patients (10%) in the sildenafil group and 6 of 91 (7%) in the placebo group having an improvement of 20% or more in the 6-minute walk distance (P = 0.39). There were small but significant differences in arterial oxygenation, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, degree of dyspnea, and quality of life favoring the sildenafil group. Serious adverse events were similar in the two study groups.

- **Conclusions**: This study did not show a benefit.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Lung function is a clinically meaningful endpoint for phase III trials [^114WqxYJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012).

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis causes progressive morbidity and has a worldwide incidence that is increasing. There are a number of promising therapies, one of which has been approved in Europe, parts of Asia, and India, and others that are at various stages of development. Despite this, there continues to be debate about the most appropriate clinical endpoint that should be used in future randomized controlled clinical trials of novel therapies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

In a recent Pulmonary Perspective in this journal, the case for the use of a variety of clinical endpoints was analyzed, and the article concluded that FVC, the endpoint most commonly used recently and in ongoing studies, was not an appropriate option. In this Pulmonary Perspective, we present a counterpoint in which we explore the basis on which this conclusion is drawn and present data that strongly and logically support the use of FVC as a valid and robust measure that fulfills the criteria for an ideal clinical endpoint and that is meaningful to patient and clinician alike.

### The future of the development of medicines in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^117WM8du]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The development of treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has often been disappointing. Building on authorized treatments that can benchmark the validity of treatment effect measures, the time has come to standardize endpoints and achieve consensus on their use for different clinical questions and specific IPF phenotypes. In order to facilitate the development of new medicines for IPF, it is crucial that the knowledge of the disease and lessons learned from past trials are carried forward to create international trial networks with patient involvement, including biobanks and clinical data collection through a multinational registry.

Interaction with regulators may be useful to align the initiatives of academia and pharmaceutical companies with the bodies ultimately responsible for licensing new products. Interaction can occur through the use of qualification programs for biomarkers and endpoints, and participation in innovative regulatory pathways and initiatives. Finally, the experience of IPF should be used to benefit even rarer interstitial lung diseases for which no treatment is available, including pediatric interstitial lung diseases. This commentary provides a perspective on the hurdles slowing the development and regulatory approval of medicines for IPF and encourages close cooperation between investigators and drug regulators.

### Association of angiotensin modulators with the course of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112ioxbh]. Chest (2019). Low credibility.

Angiotensin peptides have been implicated in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) pathogenesis. Angiotensin modulators are used to treat arterial hypertension, a frequent comorbidity of IPF. This post hoc analysis evaluated associations of antihypertensive treatments with disease-related outcomes in IPF.

- **Methods**: All patients randomized to placebo (n = 624) in the CAPACITY and ASCEND studies were categorized by antihypertensive treatment at baseline. Outcomes of disease progression (first occurrence of ≥ 10% absolute decline in % predicted FVC, ≥ 50-m decline in 6-min walk distance, or death) and all-cause mortality were assessed over 52 weeks.

- **Results**: At baseline, 111 and 121 patients were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), respectively; 392 were receiving neither. In multivariable analyses adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics compared with the non-ACEi/ARB group, ACEi treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.6 [95% CI, 0.4–0.9]; p = 0.026), but not ARB (HR, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.6–1.2]; p = 0.413), was associated with slower disease progression. Furthermore, the increase in all-cause mortality associated with cardiovascular disease was not observed in the ACEi group (HR, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.5–2.9]; p = 0.782), which presented a similar percentage of IPF-related mortality as the non-ACEi/ARB group (3.6% vs 3.6%). In contrast, patients in the ARB group had greater risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.2–5.2]).

These observations were validated in a pooled analysis that included patients from previous studies.

### Combination therapy: The future of management for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^116XwUyX]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Findings from recently published placebo-controlled trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have established that pirfenidone and nintedanib prevent about 50% of the decline in forced vital capacity typically seen in this disease; future trials are therefore unlikely to use placebo as a control group for ethical reasons. Future clinical assessment will probably include add-on trials in which a new drug is combined with an intervention with established efficacy; this development is in turn likely to herald the use of combination regimens in clinical practice. Personalised medicine, the selection of monotherapies on the basis of individualised biomarker signals, is an intrinsically attractive alternative approach. However, it is unlikely to be useful in routine management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the medium-term future because of the complex nature of the disease's pathogenesis.

- **Pleiotropic nature**: In this Personal View, we review the pleiotropic nature of disease pathogenesis in idiopathic pulmonary disease, the use of combination regimens in other selected chronic lung diseases, and the conceptual basis for combination therapies in interstitial lung disorders other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Based on these considerations and the emergence of data from add-on trials, we believe that the future of management for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lies in the development of combination regimens.

### Advances in the management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and progressive pulmonary fibrosis [^117Nv1VM]. BMJ (2022). High credibility.

Similarly to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), other interstitial lung diseases can develop progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF), characterized by declining lung function, a poor response to immunomodulatory therapies, and early mortality. The pathophysiology of disordered lung repair involves common downstream pathways that lead to pulmonary fibrosis in both IPF and PPF. Antifibrotic drugs, such as nintedanib, are indicated for the treatment of IPF and PPF, and new therapies are being evaluated in clinical trials. Clinical, radiographic, and molecular biomarkers are needed to identify patients with PPF and subgroups of patients likely to respond to specific therapies.

This article reviews the evidence supporting the use of specific therapies in patients with IPF and PPF, discusses agents being considered in clinical trials, and considers potential biomarkers based on disease pathogenesis that might be used to provide a personalized approach to care.

### Sildenafil added to pirfenidone in patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and risk of pulmonary hypertension: A Phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study - rationale and study design [^112WXXW5]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is commonly observed in patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Despite the availability of therapies for both IPF and PH, none are approved for PH treatment in the context of significant pulmonary disease. This study will investigate the use of sildenafil added to pirfenidone in patients with advanced IPF and risk of PH, who represent a group with a high unmet medical need.

- **Methods**: This Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is actively enrolling patients. It will study the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sildenafil or placebo in patients with advanced IPF and intermediate or high probability of Group 3 PH who are receiving a stable dose of pirfenidone. Patients with advanced IPF (diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide ≤ 40% predicted) and risk of Group 3 PH (defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥ 20 mm Hg with pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤ 15 mm Hg on a previous right-heart catheterisation [RHC], or intermediate/high probability of Group 3 PH as defined by the 2015 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines) are eligible. In the absence of a previous RHC, patients with an echocardiogram showing a peak tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity ≥ 2.9 m/s can enrol if all other criteria are met. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with disease progression over a 52-week treatment period. Safety will be evaluated descriptively.

- **Discussion**: Combination treatment with sildenafil and pirfenidone may warrant further investigation in this context.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^113CBNRs]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a rapidly progressive illness of unknown cause, characterized by sequential acute lung injury, subsequent scarring, and end-stage lung disease. Treatment at present remains largely supportive. There is evidence that patients' satisfaction and survival may be improved by referral to centers specializing in the evaluation of interstitial lung diseases. Although no drug therapy has clearly been demonstrated to benefit patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, several novel investigational agents hold promise for future study. Given the poor prognosis associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, patients should be referred to regional centers of expertise for enrollment in therapeutic clinical trials or for lung transplantation.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - clinical management guided by the evidence-based GRADE approach: What arguments can be made against transparency in guideline development [^11499ph9]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Some believe that the opinion of experts in the field is driven by their understanding of the clinical problem and their accurate interpretation of the underlying literature; therefore, such recommendations may be considered, in effect, evidence-based. However, this approach has gone wrong on many occasions. Using a transparent and structured process in guideline development not only mandates a linkage of evidence to recommendation development but also ensures that this linkage is explicit and systematically demonstrated. In effect, this helps to limit the potential for bias. Guideline panel members may have strong opinions or academic bias surrounding a specific area in which they have clinical expertise, or they may have other biases related to interactions with academic colleagues or industry partners.

In an attempt to address this, the GRADE approach requires systematic or pragmatic searches of the literature and the production of evidence summaries, such as evidence profiles, ideally based on pooled treatment effects and produced by panel members without conflict of interest or independent methodologists. The latter helps ensure a fair and reproducible assessment of the literature addressing a specific clinical question.

### Guidelines or guidance for better idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis management [^117TqT1i]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare fibrotic interstitial lung disease known for its relentlessly progressive course and fatal outcome. Guidelines summarizing the evidence and providing evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of rare diseases such as IPF are crucial, as individual physicians often have limited experience. However, the available evidence is often scarce and, therefore, evidence-based recommendations can be vague or have low confidence, creating uncertainty instead of guidance. Moreover, the effect of guidelines themselves on clinical practice has not been sufficiently evaluated.

On the other hand, expert opinion may be biased and lead to the misinterpretation of evidence, resulting in misleading recommendations and potential harm to patients. This editorial focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of evidence-based guidelines and professional experience in the context of a rare disease such as IPF and tries to assess the optimum combination of both approaches.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of pulsed, inhaled nitric oxide in subjects at risk of pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary fibrosis [^1145naMk]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

The interstitial lung diseases include a variety of disorders, many of which are characterized by fibrotic changes (fILD). Of the fILDs, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) frequently complicates fILD and is associated with impaired functional capability, lower physical activity, and significantly reduced life expectancy. There is no proven treatment for patients with fILD-PH. We report results from the first cohort of a phase 2b/3 trial with pulsed inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in patients with fILD-PH.

- **Methods**: Subjects in cohort 1 were randomized to iNO 30 μg/kg ideal body weight/h (iNO30) or placebo for 8 weeks of blinded treatment; subjects then transitioned to open-label extension (OLE) on iNO30 followed by dose escalation to iNO45 then iNO75. Activity monitoring was used to assess changes in daily activity. Safety and efficacy were evaluated.

- **Results**: Twenty-three patients were randomized to iNO30 and 18 to placebo. During blinded treatment, iNO30 subjects showed an average improvement in moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and remained stable in overall activity. Placebo subjects showed an average drop of 26% in MVPA and a 12% drop in overall activity. The iNO group had an improvement in oxygen saturation. During OLE, subjects maintained their activity levels including placebo subjects who transitioned from a decline to a maintenance in all activity parameters. Inhaled nitric oxide at all doses (30, 45, and 75) was safe and well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with iNO30 demonstrated clinically and statistically significant improvements in patients with fILD-PH.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis in adults: An official ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline [^113vKRwd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

It is plausible that antifibrotic agents that slow disease progression in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) may also slow progression in progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF). One such antifibrotic agent, pirfenidone, is an oral agent with anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antiproliferative effects that was recommended for the treatment of IPF in prior guidelines.

The committee asked, "Should patients with PPF be treated with pirfenidone?" Given that many different types of interstitial lung disease (ILD) can manifest PPF, this overarching question was also asked for eight specific types of ILD that can manifest PPF:

- **Radiological patterns**:
	- Should patients with PPF and radiological usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern be treated with pirfenidone?
	- Should patients with PPF and radiological non-UIP pattern be treated with pirfenidone?

- **Specific ILD cases**:
	- Should patients with progressive fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) be treated with pirfenidone?
	- Should patients with progressive fibrotic connective tissue disease (CTD)-related ILD be treated with pirfenidone?
	- Should patients with progressive fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) be treated with pirfenidone?
	- Should patients with progressive fibrotic sarcoidosis be treated with pirfenidone?
	- Should patients with progressive fibrotic occupational ILD be treated with pirfenidone?
	- Should patients with progressive fibrotic unclassifiable ILDs (uILDs) be treated with pirfenidone?

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Critical outcomes**: Mortality and disease progression, determined by change in forced vital capacity (FVC).
	- **Important outcomes**: Lung function, determined by changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), total lung capacity (TLC), diffusion capacity (D CO), and six-minute walk distance (6MWD).
	- **Respiratory symptoms**: Changes in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ), or visual analog scale for cough scores.
	- **Adverse events (AEs)**: Consideration of the occurrence of any adverse events.

### Guidelines or guidance for better idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis management [^114AtRGF]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines summarize the available evidence using a comprehensive literature research approach and provide unbiased recommendations reflecting this evidence. However, this emphasis on methodology eventually results in a lack of practicability and guidance in areas with a dearth of evidence. The empirical approach, based on expert advice, can provide guidance, especially in areas with little or no formal evidence, but is vulnerable to biased recommendations. Thus, both approaches may adversely affect patients. A synthesis of these potentially complementary approaches seems appropriate to provide optimal guidance in the treatment of all patients.

### Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: A position paper from a Nordic expert group [^112DGjjd]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal, progressive lung disease occurring in adults. In the last decade, the results of a number of clinical trials, based on the updated disease classification, have been published. The registration of pirfenidone and nintedanib, the first two pharmacological treatment options approved for IPF, marks a new chapter in the management of patients with this disease.

Other nonpharmacological treatments, such as lung transplantation, rehabilitation, and palliation, have also been shown to be beneficial for these patients. In this review, past and present management is discussed based on a comprehensive literature search. A treatment algorithm is presented based on available evidence and our overall clinical experience. In addition, unmet needs with regard to treatment are highlighted and discussed.

We describe the development of various treatment options for IPF from the first consensus to recent guidelines based on evidence from large-scale, multinational, randomized clinical trials, which have led to the registration of the first drugs for IPF.

### Therapeutic intervention: assessing the role of the international consensus guidelines [^113fhaZh]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal lung disorder of unknown etiology. The consensus statement released by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society has provided guidelines for the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with IPF. These guidelines suggest the use of conventional treatment options, including therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents. The guidelines acknowledged that there is little good-quality evidence to support the safety and efficacy of such therapies in patients with IPF. The statement was published in 2000 and was based on an extensive review of the literature up to and including December 1998. The goal of this review is to reexamine the treatment recommendations of the guidelines in the context of data that has since become available.

### Unmet needs in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-insights from patient chart review in five European countries [^113RPLQ9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Of the 1838 patients, 55 patients in Italy and the UK were co-managed with a prescribing center and were therefore excluded from further analysis to avoid double-counting. Of the remaining 1783 patients analyzed, 955 (53.6%) did not receive treatment with either approved antifibrotic drug (see Fig. 1). The proportions of patients starting a new medication, switching to a different medication, or discontinuing a medication at their last consultation were 18.5%, 6.8%, and 1.2%, respectively.

Excluding patients who received palliative care only, or palliative care only with oxygen therapy (N = 46), 828 patients (47.7%) received antifibrotic treatment, and 909 patients (52.3%) did not receive antifibrotic treatment. More patients in the treated population had a confirmed diagnosis of IPF versus patients in the untreated population (see Fig. 2a). Of 1158 patients with a confirmed IPF diagnosis, 462 (39.9%) did not receive treatment with an approved antifibrotic drug. More patients at expert centers had a confirmed diagnosis of IPF than at non-expert centers (70.1% vs. 62.4%, respectively) (see Fig. 2b); of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of IPF, antifibrotic treatment was received by 67.9% (461/679) of those at expert centers compared with 49.1% (235/479) of those at non-expert centers.

### Targeting genes for treatment in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Challenges and opportunities, promises and pitfalls [^111f74NW]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

The currently accepted approach to the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is based on the assumption that it is a chronic inflammatory disease. Most available anti-inflammatory drugs target numerous biological processes involving multiple genes but are not often beneficial.

More novel therapeutic strategies take recent findings about the underlying molecular mechanisms of fibrogenesis into account. Ongoing and as yet unpublished clinical trials in IPF aim to block single gene targets believed to play major roles in disease progression.

Characterization of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IPF has largely come from the use of animal disease models in rodents. Most data suggest, from among the different factors, a prominent role for the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and platelet-derived growth factor pathways. Inflammation is a critical element of the initiation of fibrosis, and data indicate that the Smad pathway is a necessary link to fibrosis through TGF-beta and Smad3 signaling, which introduces matrix regulation as a new target for therapeutic intervention.

Regardless, gene-targeted therapy has numerous pitfalls that must be addressed before we see a real therapeutic advance.

### Current and future therapeutic approaches in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^1145NA9k]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal form of idiopathic diffuse lung disorders for which no treatment is effective. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the status and novel therapies of IPF, with emphasis on controlled trials. The studies selected included randomized controlled trials using drugs alone and/or in combination for the treatment of adults with IPF and meta-analyses, published in English. Abstracts of identified articles were retrieved and articles possibly fulfilling inclusion criteria were retrieved in full. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality if there were any included studies. Data quality was based on place of publication and relevance to clinical care.

There is a lack of good-quality studies regarding the effectiveness of the most used drugs, including corticosteroids and non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive agents. Oral corticosteroids are the usual treatment. Other therapies either alone or in combination with corticosteroids are widely used, including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and colchicine. Interestingly, clinical trials with novel drugs, mainly antifibrotic, anticytokine, and immunoregulatory, are currently being investigated in various trial phases. In conclusion, at present, there are no evidence-based therapies for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further controlled studies are warranted to improve the evidence base for clinical practice.

### Nintedanib: A novel therapeutic approach for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115vLpJs]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, fibrotic lung disease with no clear etiology and few therapeutic options. Growth factors that act as mediators in the development of this disease are important therapeutic targets. Nintedanib is a triple-tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a potent antagonist of growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor. It is currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a potential IPF therapy. Treatment with nintedanib may slow the decline in lung function, decrease the frequency of exacerbations, and improve the quality of life in subjects with IPF. This observation, together with extensive safety and pharmacokinetic data from studies of nintedanib in malignancy, has paved the way for the clinical development of this drug in IPF. Observations from clinical trials, coupled with preclinical data, suggest that nintedanib may become an important therapeutic option for individuals with IPF. High-dose nintedanib improved the quality of life, slowed the progression of lung fibrosis and the decline of lung function, and reduced the rate of exacerbations in individuals with mild and moderate IPF. This is a short review based on the available data (September 2013) on nintedanib.

### Guidelines or guidance for better idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis management [^116BrgRm]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare fibrotic interstitial lung disease characterized by a persistently progressive course and fatal outcome. Guidelines summarizing the evidence and providing evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of rare diseases, such as IPF, are crucial since individual physicians often have limited experience.

However, the available evidence is often scarce, rendering evidence-based recommendations prone to vagueness or low confidence, which can create uncertainty instead of guidance. Furthermore, the impact of the guidelines themselves on clinical practice has not been sufficiently evaluated. On the other hand, expert opinion may introduce bias and lead to the misinterpretation of evidence, possibly resulting in misleading recommendations and potential harm to patients.

This editorial focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of evidence-based guidelines and professional experience in the context of a rare disease such as IPF, aiming to assess the optimal combination of both approaches.

### Management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the elderly patient: Addressing key questions [^111pQDss]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is strongly associated with advanced age. Making an accurate diagnosis of IPF is critical, as it remains only one of many potential diagnoses for an elderly patient with newly recognized interstitial lung disease. Optimal management of IPF, especially in older-aged patients, hinges on factors such as balancing the application of standard-of-care measures with the patient's overall health status (robustness vs. frailty) and considering the patient's wishes, desires, and expectations.

IPF is associated with certain comorbidities that tend to be more prevalent in the elderly population. Until recently, options for the pharmacologic management of IPF were limited and included therapies such as immunosuppressive agents, which may pose substantial risk to the elderly patient. However, the antifibrotic agents pirfenidone and nintedanib have now become commercially available in the United States for the treatment of IPF.

The monitoring and treatment of patients with IPF, especially elderly patients with comorbid medical conditions, require consideration of adverse side effects, the avoidance of potential drug-drug interactions, treatment of comorbidities, and the timely implementation of supportive and palliative measures. Individualized counseling to guide decision-making and enhance quality of life is also integral to optimal management of the elderly patient with IPF.

### Advancing drug development in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Tomorrow is now [^114YCxhZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Phase III RCTs in IPF often take over two years to recruit their study populations because of the low prevalence of IPF and strict eligibility criteria with high screening failure rates. This has detrimental effects for all stakeholders. However, several strategies could support more efficient enrollment of study participants in future clinical trials.

The most important strategy is designing trials with broad eligibility criteria to maximize the potential study population and minimize the burden of trial procedures. For example, embedding clinical trial procedures within routine patient care can make them less daunting for patients and clinical trial staff members. Additional strategies that may appeal to patients include multifactorial designs that increase the likelihood of a patient receiving an active intervention. Furthermore, response-adaptive randomization takes interim results into account to prioritize the allocation of patients to study arms that appear to have greater benefit.

Although these strategies have advantages, they also bring challenges that require careful planning before study initiation.

### Medical treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111hHVDs]. Thorax (2022). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a respiratory disorder with a poor prognosis. Our objective is to assess the comparative effectiveness of 22 approved or studied IPF drug treatments.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 2 April 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for adult patients with IPF receiving one or more of 22 drug treatments. Pairs of reviewers independently identified randomized trials that compared one or more of the target medical treatments in patients with IPF. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for network meta-analysis. We calculated pooled relative risk (RR) ratios and presented direct or network estimates with 95% credibility intervals (95% CI) within the GRADE framework.

- **Results**: We identified 48 (10,326 patients) eligible studies for analysis. Nintedanib [RR 0.69 (0.44 to 1.1)], pirfenidone [RR 0.63 (0.37 to 1.09); direct estimate], and sildenafil [RR 0.44 (0.16 to 1.09)] probably reduce mortality (all moderate certainty). Nintedanib (2.92% [1.51 to 4.14]), nintedanib+sildenafil (157 mL [-88.35 to 411.12]), pirfenidone (2.47% [-0.1 to 5]), pamrevlumab (4.3% [0.5 to 8.1]) and pentraxin (2.74% [1 to 4.83]) probably reduce the decline of overall forced vital capacity (all moderate certainty). Only sildenafil probably reduces acute exacerbation and hospitalizations (moderate certainty).

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^112YuoQi]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating, age-related lung disease of unknown cause that has few treatment options. This disease was once thought to be a chronic inflammatory process, but evidence indicates that the fibrotic response is driven by abnormally activated alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). These cells produce mediators that induce the formation of fibroblast and myofibroblast foci through the proliferation of resident mesenchymal cells, attraction of circulating fibrocytes, and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. The fibroblast and myofibroblast foci secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix, mainly collagens, resulting in scarring and destruction of the lung architecture.

The mechanisms that link idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with aging and aberrant epithelial activation are unknown; however, evidence suggests that the abnormal recapitulation of developmental pathways and epigenetic changes have a role. In this seminar, we review recent data on the clinical course, therapeutic options, and underlying mechanisms thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

### The future of clinical trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^11657wHD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Several promising drugs are currently in development in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), mirroring the urgent need for better treatments for patients living with this terrible disease. A number of innovative approaches have the potential to increase the likelihood of success of late-phase clinical trials in IPF, including novel trial designs, alternative primary outcomes, and more efficient enrollment of study participants. However, a better understanding of the mechanisms driving lung fibrosis and an accelerated process of drug development remain instrumental to the identification of truly efficacious therapies for people living with IPF.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - clinical management guided by the evidence-based GRADE approach: what arguments can be made against transparency in guideline development [^115wYATX]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Certainties in evidence assessments were performed by the MacGRADE team and were then reviewed by the entire panel to ensure accuracy and agreement. In each case where the certainty in effect estimates was downgraded, an explicit rationale was provided in the evidence profile and the guideline manuscript. Including the certainty as part of the final recommendation, as we have done for the 2015 IPF evidence-based guideline, helps stakeholders interpret the recommendations made by the panel. Recommendations based on higher quality of evidence allow clinicians and patients to be more reassured that this intervention is beneficial, while recommendations based on lower quality of evidence provide caution to stakeholders and recognize the uncertainty regarding the benefits of this intervention.

Although the estimate of treatment effect and certainty in evidence are important, guideline panelists should also consider other factors when deciding on the strength of recommendations. Elements such as the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, the resources required, the impact on health equality, the acceptability, and the feasibility of treatment must also be considered. Unlike consensus documents that use an ad hoc approach, GRADE mandates an explicit assessment of these criteria using the Evidence-to-Decision framework (EtD), with documentation of panel judgments and rationale.

### Current approaches to the management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^114uTyjQ]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal lung disease associated with dyspnea, cough, and impaired quality of life. Currently, the aims of patient care are to improve outcomes by slowing disease progression, extending life, and enhancing quality of life. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial, enabling patients to receive treatment early in the disease course and to be considered for lung transplantation. Two anti-fibrotic drugs, nintedanib and pirfenidone, have been shown to reduce the decline in lung function in patients with IPF.

In addition to pharmacological therapy, optimal management of IPF includes treatment of comorbidities, symptom relief, pulmonary rehabilitation, and palliative care. Patient education is important to enable patients to make informed decisions about their care and to manage the disease and side-effects of anti-fibrotic drugs effectively. Research continues into new treatments and combinations of treatments that may improve outcomes for patients with this devastating disease.

### Outpatient inhaled nitric oxide in a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: A bridge to lung transplantation [^111EyQhA]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Inhaled nitric oxide (INO) has been shown to improve oxygenation and decrease intrapulmonary shunt and pulmonary hypertension in various lung diseases. In this study, we report a patient with end-stage idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension who received INO after coronary artery bypass surgery, with significant improvement in arterial oxygenation and pulmonary arterial pressure. Using a pulsing delivery system, the patient continued to receive outpatient INO for 30 months while waiting for lung transplantation. An exercise study and two-dimensional echocardiogram, after 3 months of inhaled NO, demonstrated continued benefits of INO for the improvement of arterial oxygenation, pulmonary arterial pressure, and exercise tolerance.

### Efficacy and safety of admilparant, an LPA antagonist, in pulmonary fibrosis: A Phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^1173a8iN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) have high morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the need for novel treatments. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of admilparant (BMS-986278), an oral lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 antagonist, in patients with IPF and PPF. This phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included parallel cohorts of patients with IPF (n = 278 randomized, n = 276 treated) or PPF (n = 125 randomized, n = 123 treated) who received 30 mg of admilparant, 60 mg of admilparant, or placebo (1:1:1) twice daily for 26 weeks. Background antifibrotics (both cohorts) and immunosuppressants (PPF only) were permitted.

- **Measurements and main results**: Rates of change in percentage of predicted FVC over 26 weeks for IPF were -2.7% (placebo), -2.8% (30 mg), and -1.2% (60 mg), and for PPF were -4.3% (placebo), -2.9% (30 mg), and -1.1% (60 mg). Treatment differences between 60-mg admilparant and placebo were 1.4% (95% confidence interval, -0.1 to 3.0) for IPF and 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 5.7) for PPF. Treatment effect was observed with or without background antifibrotics in both cohorts. Diarrhea occurred at similar frequencies in admilparant arms versus placebo. Transient Day 1 post-dose blood pressure reductions were observed in all arms in both cohorts but were greater with admilparant. Treatment discontinuations because of adverse events were similar across IPF arms and lower with admilparant (2.5% [30 mg]; 0% [60 mg]) versus placebo (17.1%) for PPF.
