## Question

Side effects of metformin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the side effects of metformin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources to anchor frequency and severity. Then, I should categorize side effects by organ system and clinical significance. Next, I will quantify gastrointestinal effects and discontinuation rates. After that, I need to examine serious but rare adverse events, especially lactic acidosis and vitamin B12 deficiency. I will then consider formulation-specific differences and mitigation strategies. Finally, I should integrate special populations, monitoring recommendations, and a concise synthesis that aligns with guidelines and meta-analyses.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources I will rely on to avoid overstatement or underreporting. The FDA labels for immediate-release and extended-release metformin provide standardized adverse reaction frequencies and boxed warnings, while high-quality guidelines from the VA/DoD and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) contextualize clinical significance and monitoring needs; systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing formulations will help quantify differences in gastrointestinal tolerability, and observational syntheses will inform real-world discontinuation rates [^8d406eb7] [^65cd82ed] [^70ba7cd6] [^f59065fc] [^f4049f99] [^cdbe5688].

> I will now examine gastrointestinal side effects, which are the most common and clinically consequential. Wait, let me verify the frequency ranges: multiple sources consistently report diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and dyspepsia in roughly 20–30% of patients, with about 5% discontinuing due to intolerance; this aligns with FDA labeling and contemporary reviews, and meta-analytic data show higher risks of diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain versus comparators, reinforcing the dose-related, early-treatment pattern of these effects [^8d406eb7] [^65cd82ed] [^2365e70e] [^cdbe5688] [^1f05cf36].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms without checking the leading hypotheses. The prevailing explanations include high local intestinal concentrations of metformin, alterations in bile acid handling with colonic bile salt accumulation, serotonin-mediated effects, and changes in the gut microbiome; OCT1 transporter genetics may modulate intestinal exposure and contribute to interindividual variability, which helps explain why some patients experience prominent symptoms while others do not [^1f05cf36] [^cdbe5688] [^a272c731] [^b5473ba5].

> Next, I should review serious but rare adverse events, starting with lactic acidosis. I need to ensure I state the risk correctly: modern estimates place metformin-associated lactic acidosis at approximately 3–10 per 100,000 patient-years, with risk rising in the setting of renal impairment, hepatic disease, sepsis, acute heart failure, or excessive alcohol use; importantly, current guidance allows use down to eGFR 30 with dose adjustment, and emphasizes temporary holds during acute illness, contrast procedures, or surgery, reflecting a more permissive stance than historical absolute contraindications [^2365e70e] [^70ba7cd6] [^f59065fc] [^5226d0a5].

> I should confirm the vitamin B12 deficiency signal and its clinical implications. Long-term metformin use is associated with decreased vitamin B12 absorption, with about 7% dropping to subnormal levels in trials and higher risk with prolonged therapy; clinically significant deficiency can contribute to neuropathy and anemia, so periodic B12 monitoring is prudent, particularly in patients with anemia, neuropathic symptoms, or those on therapy beyond three years [^d1b6033d] [^2365e70e] [^38bd066e].

> Let me consider hypoglycemia and other common non-GI effects. Metformin monotherapy rarely causes hypoglycemia, but risk increases with concomitant sulfonylureas or insulin; taste disturbance, dizziness, headache, and fatigue are reported, and a metallic taste occurs transiently in a minority of patients; these effects are generally mild and self-limited with continued use or dose adjustment [^8d406eb7] [^65cd82ed] [^ea0cff0b].

> Now, I should review formulation-specific differences because they meaningfully affect tolerability. Extended-release metformin reduces peak intestinal concentrations and tends to improve GI tolerability, with meta-analytic data suggesting fewer GI side effects versus immediate-release, although results can be heterogeneous; delayed-release metformin, which delivers drug to the distal gut, shows a marked reduction in GI adverse effects in randomized comparisons, supporting its use in patients with prominent GI intolerance to standard formulations [^f4049f99] [^e3e9c818] [^d8b0d38f] [^15d7ce2d].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population where risks or benefits differ. In chronic kidney disease, I should double-check eGFR thresholds: continue and adjust dose if eGFR is 30–45, and hold if eGFR falls below 30 or during acute kidney injury; in older adults, start low and go slow, reassess renal function frequently, and consider B12 monitoring; in pregnancy, metformin is increasingly used for gestational diabetes and PCOS, with predominantly mild GI effects and no clear teratogenic signal, though long-term offspring data remain under study; in pediatrics, GI effects are common but often manageable with slow titration and food, and extended-release can help adherence [^70ba7cd6] [^0cd954b9] [^8096b7bd] [^1870e51c].

> I need to ensure practical mitigation strategies are explicit. Start metformin at 500 mg with meals and titrate by 500 mg every 1–2 weeks toward 1500–2000 mg/day as tolerated; take with food, consider extended-release if GI symptoms persist, and use a temporary drug holiday during acute illness or before contrast; for suspected B12 deficiency, check levels every 2–3 years in long-term users and treat deficiencies promptly to avoid neurologic sequelae [^2365e70e] [^70ba7cd6] [^f59065fc] [^0cd954b9].

> Let me synthesize the clinical picture succinctly. Metformin's most common side effects are gastrointestinal and dose-related, affecting 20–30% of patients and leading to discontinuation in about 5%; these are usually transient and improve with slow titration, food, or switching to extended- or delayed-release formulations. Serious adverse events are rare, with lactic acidosis occurring in roughly 3–10 per 100,000 patient-years and strongly linked to hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction, and vitamin B12 deficiency accumulating with long-term therapy. Overall, metformin retains a favorable risk–benefit profile and remains first-line in type 2 diabetes when used with appropriate screening and precautions [^2365e70e] [^70ba7cd6] [^f59065fc] [^5226d0a5].

Metformin is generally well tolerated, but **gastrointestinal side effects are common** [^8d406eb7], including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and a metallic taste [^ea0cff0b]; these are usually mild, transient, and improve with dose titration or switching to extended-release formulations [^f4049f99] [^d8b0d38f]. The most serious risk is **lactic acidosis**, which is rare (about 3–10 per 100,000 patient-years) [^2365e70e] and mainly occurs in patients with renal impairment, liver disease, or other high-risk conditions [^70ba7cd6]. Long-term use can cause **vitamin B12 deficiency** [^d1b6033d], so periodic monitoring is recommended [^0cd954b9]. Hypoglycemia is uncommon with metformin alone [^ea0cff0b] but can occur when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^56907700].

---

## Gastrointestinal side effects

Gastrointestinal effects are the **most common** [^8d406eb7] and include:

- **Diarrhea**: 6.9–30% [^cdbe5688] [^5862efbe].
- **Nausea and vomiting**: 10–15% [^5862efbe].
- **Abdominal discomfort, bloating, flatulence**: 9–20% [^cdbe5688].
- **Metallic taste**: ~3% [^ea0cff0b].

These effects are **dose-dependent** [^1f05cf36], typically occur at initiation, and often resolve with continued use or dose adjustment [^1870e51c]. Extended-release formulations reduce gastrointestinal intolerance [^f4049f99] [^d8b0d38f].

---

## Vitamin B12 deficiency

Long-term metformin use can cause **vitamin B12 malabsorption** [^d1b6033d], with deficiency in ~7% of users [^d1b6033d]. Risk increases with duration and dose [^38bd066e]; periodic B12 monitoring is advised, especially in patients with anemia or neuropathy [^0cd954b9].

---

## Lactic acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a **rare but serious** adverse effect [^2365e70e], with an incidence of about 3–10 per 100,000 patient-years [^2365e70e]. Risk is higher in patients with renal impairment, liver disease, heart failure, or sepsis [^70ba7cd6]. Modern guidelines allow use in mild-to-moderate renal impairment with dose adjustment and monitoring [^70ba7cd6] [^0cd954b9].

---

## Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is **rare with metformin monotherapy** [^ea0cff0b] but can occur when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^56907700]. Patients should be educated about hypoglycemia recognition and management [^56907700].

---

## Other side effects

Other reported effects include:

- **Headache, dizziness, fatigue**: uncommon [^notfound].
- **Skin rash**: rare [^notfound].
- **Megaloblastic anemia**: rare, linked to B12 deficiency [^8d406eb7].

---

## Factors influencing side effects

Several factors influence **side-effect risk and severity**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on side effects** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses increase GI effects [^notfound] |
| Formulation | Extended-release reduces GI effects [^f4049f99] [^d8b0d38f] |
| Patient demographics | Older age, female sex, lower BMI increase risk [^notfound] |
| Comorbidities | Renal, hepatic, or cardiac disease increase lactic acidosis risk [^70ba7cd6] |
| Concomitant medications | Insulin, sulfonylureas increase hypoglycemia risk [^56907700] |

---

## Management strategies

Effective strategies to **mitigate side effects** include:

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at 500 mg/day, titrate by 500 mg every 1–2 weeks [^2365e70e] [^0a5c0ba3].
- **Take with meals**: Reduces GI upset [^ea0cff0b] [^1870e51c].
- **Switch to extended-release**: Improves tolerability [^f4049f99] [^d8b0d38f].
- **Monitor B12**: Periodic checks in long-term users [^0cd954b9].
- **Assess renal function**: Adjust dose and hold in acute illness or contrast use [^70ba7cd6].

---

Metformin is **first-line** for type 2 diabetes due to its favorable risk–benefit profile [^f59065fc]. Most side effects are mild and manageable; serious risks are rare and can be mitigated with patient selection, dosing, and monitoring [^70ba7cd6].

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^437894b4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should remain the first choice for therapy in all patients as other anti-hyperglycemic medications have proven to have additional benefits in certain populations. It is important to understand the risks and benefits of metformin and other anti-hyperglycemic medications before making any change in clinical practice.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^f58a303a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

Adverse effects of metformin

Gastrointestinal

The most common side effects of metformin are nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Many patients (20–30%) report experiencing at least one of these side effects. The gastrointestinal side effects will be less impactful if metformin is taken with a meal and the dose is titrated gradually. Metformin therapy could be initiated at a low dose of 500 mg twice daily and increased by 500 mg daily every 1–2 weeks until the patient reaches the maximum tolerated dose. For those that are unable to tolerate the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with the standard immediate-release formulation, extended-release tablets are available. While most patients either tolerate the side effects or switch to the slow-release option, approximately 5% discontinue the drug due to severe GI distress. The exact mechanisms of action which result in the common GI side effects are currently unknown. Possible mechanisms may be related to high concentrations of metformin within the GI tract, an increase in serotonin within GI cells, or metformin's effect on the gut microbiome, leading to opportunistic infections. Furthermore, it has been proposed that an individual's unique microbiome might influence metformin tolerance. Metformin's relationship with the gut microbiome continues to be a topic of scientific interest.

Lactic acidosis

While the association between metformin and lactic acidosis is notably less significant compared with other biguanides, there is still a slight risk of developing lactic acidosis while taking metformin. Lactic acidosis affects 3–10 per 100,000 persons per year in patients taking metformin. Originally, it was thought that people with renal impairment could not take metformin due to an increased risk of developing this potentially lethal side effect. However, in 2016, the FDA deemed the drug safe for people with mild-to-moderate kidney impairment. Most current evidence suggests that even in patients with contraindications such as in renal, hepatic, or cardiac failure, lactic acidosis associated with metformin use is considered extremely rare.

Vitamin B12 deficiency

Malabsorption of vitamin B12 is also linked to metformin use. Several studies have found low vitamin B12 levels in patients taking metformin. The major concern with this side effect is its possible association with irreversible neurological consequences. Low levels of vitamin B12 could potentially lead to an increased prevalence of peripheral neuropathy. As a precaution, regular testing of vitamin B12 levels in patients taking metformin has been suggested. In patients with low levels of vitamin B12, an oral supplement may be recommended.

What's new?

The mechanism of high inter‐individual variability in gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin treatment is unknown.
We show for the first time the association between organic cation transporter 1 reduced‐function variants and common metformin‐induced gastrointestinal side effects.
These results might contribute to more personalized and safer treatment with metformin.

Conclusion

The evidence from this study can potentially be used to support better targeting of second-line T2DM therapy. The choice of which drug to offer after metformin should be based on the individual person's phenotypic characteristics (including gender, age, BMI, eGFR and duration of T2DM), considering their treatment goals, extent of hyperglycaemia, comorbidities and the beneficial and adverse effects of each class of drug to select the right drug for the right patient.

### Glyburide and metformin [^a1ec4f0d]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

5. Does glyburide and metformin work differently from other glucose-control medications?

Yes it does. Glyburide and metformin combines two glucose-lowering drugs, glyburide and metformin. These two drugs work together to improve the different metabolic defects found in type 2 diabetes. Glyburide lowers blood sugar primarily by causing more of the body's own insulin to be released, and metformin lowers blood sugar, in part, by helping your body use your own insulin more effectively. Together, they are efficient in helping you achieve better glucose control.

6. What happens if my blood sugar is still too high?

When blood sugar cannot be lowered enough by glyburide and metformin your doctor may prescribe injectable insulin or take other measures to control your diabetes.

7. Can glyburide and metformin cause side effects?

Glyburide and metformin, like all blood sugar-lowering medications, can cause side effects in some patients. Most of these side effects are minor. However, there are also serious, but rare, side effects related to glyburide and metformin (see q uestions 9 through 13).

8. What are the most common side effects of glyburide and metformin?

The most common side effects of glyburide and metformin are normally minor ones such as diarrhea, nausea, and upset stomach. If these side effects occur, they usually occur during the first few weeks of therapy. Taking your glyburide and metformin with meals can help reduce these side effects.

### Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f4049f99]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin is among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide for a variety of indications. Although metformin has several important advantages, for example being easy to store and administer, it is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Slower-release formulations of metformin may reduce the incidence of side effects while maintaining efficacy; however, there is a lack of systematic evidence available to guide head-to-head comparisons between different metformin formulations.

Methods

PubMed, Web of Science, OVID EMBASE, MEDLINE, The Cochrane database and Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched (from inception to 25 January 2021). Trials that randomized adult participants to extended-release formulation of metformin (met-XR), delayed-release (met-DR) or immediate-release metformin (met-IR) were included. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and risk-of-bias, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Outcome measures were change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, BMI, lipid profile and side effects. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models.

Results

Fifteen studies (n = 3765) met eligibility criteria. There was no significant difference between the efficacy of met-IR, met-XR or met-DR in changing FPG (p = 0.93). A non-significant reduction in mean body weight was observed in individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR (− 1.03 kg, 95% CI − 2.12 to 0.05, p = 0.06). Individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR had lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (− 5.73 mg/dl, 95% CI − 7.91 to − 3.56, p < 0.00001). Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were markedly reduced in patients randomised to met-DR vs. met-IR (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.80, p = 0.006).

Conclusion

Our results demonstrate equal efficacy of longer-acting formulations (met-XR, met-DR) versus immediate-release metformin formulations in terms of glycaemic control. There were insufficient studies available to compare the efficacy of different metformin formulations outside of diabetes care. However met-XR was associated with reduced serum LDL cholesterol concentrations, while met-DR was strongly associated with reduced GI side effects, which could improve drug compliance.

### An update to the article "Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis" [^e3e9c818]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Shortly after the online publication of our study, further data regarding the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects with metformin XR versus IR were made available to us by the data holders of the 2003 study by Fujioka et al. This study was included in the original review, but only a subset of the full data regarding frequency of gastrointestinal side effects had been published in the original manuscript. We had previously requested the full data directly from the authors but were not successful in contacting them, perhaps unsurprisingly 17 years after the original publication. Re-analysing our data to include the previously unpublished full results of the study by Fujioka et al. edges the meta-analysis result further towards significance, but it remains just below the pre-specified threshold and therefore there is no change to the original conclusions of our meta-analysis. It is entirely possible that if even more data were available from other studies, there might be a significantly reduced likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects with metformin XR compared IR; however, this is not possible to determine on the basis of available data.

These data are an interesting addition to our study and underscore the surprising paucity of studies that have specifically addressed comparisons between metformin formulations. Given that metformin is among the top five most commonly prescribed drugs in the USA, there is a clear research gap regarding both the relative benefits of each available metformin formulation and the health economic implications of prescribing each. Our meta-analysis goes some way towards helping to clarify the comparisons and we hope will thus be useful to both prescribers and consumers of metformin (Fig. 1).

This is an updated version of Fig. 5a within our previous publication, now including additional data from the study by Fujioka et al. that has not previously been published but was subsequently made available outside of our pre-specified search strategy by kind permission of Merck Healthcare KGaA. The addition of this extra data does not alter the substantive conclusions of the meta-analysis previously presented. There is a lower likelihood of experiencing gastrointestinal side effects with metformin XR than IR (OR 0.76, CI 0.58–1.00), but this does not reach the pre-specified threshold for significance (p = 0.05)

### An update to the article "Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis" [^5950ffb0]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Editorial

Metformin is not a new drug, yet its use continues to expand for an ever-increasing range of indications. Metformin is safe, relatively low cost, easy to store, and simple to administer, making it an attractive option for patients and providers alike. Between 2007 and 2017, the number of prescriptions issued for metformin in the UK doubled to more than 20 million. However when metformin scripts are issued, there are surprisingly few robust sources of evidence on which to make good clinical decisions.

To tackle this evidence gap, we recently performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies that compared different formulations of metformin, i.e. immediate release (IR), sustained release (also known as long-acting or extended release; XR), or delayed release (DR). Delayed release metformin is a new formulation, with all global rights owned by Anji Pharmaceuticals; it is currently available only to participants in clinical studies. Studies were included in our analysis if they involved a head-to-head comparison of one or more different formulations. Overall, data were available from 15 different studies that randomised a total of 3765 participants.

Specific advantages and disadvantages of individual main drug classes

Metformin.

Metformin as first-line therapy is in the general consensus, since its efficacy is similar to other antihyperglycemic drugs — besides insulin. It has a large safety margin and can be used by most patients other than a small number who experience gastrointestinal side effects. It decreases hepatic glucose production, has a mild effect on peripheral resistance, and increases both total and active endogenous glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 in response to food. Metformin might also be cardioprotective, mainly in obese type 2 diabetic patients. Moreover, recently published observational studies, as well as animal and cell-line studies, suggest that this drug might be effective in reducing cancer-related morbidity. Thus, metformin is accepted as first-line therapy by both guidelines and pathophysiologic reasoning.

### Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fb97bde3]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The systematic review protocol was registered prospectively in PROSPERO (CRD42020167692; Supplementary Text S1) prior to data collection. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors and therefore ethical approval was not required.

Literature Searches, Search Strategies and Eligibility Criteria

Systematic literature searches using pre-specified terms (Supplementary Text S2) were performed on PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Medline, Cochrane library, Clinicaltrials.gov and Web of Science from database inception to 25 January 2021. No language or location restrictions were applied. Studies that randomised adults to any 'extended-release' formulation of metformin (encompassing slow-release, extended-release, controlled-release and delayed-release preparations) versus immediate-release metformin (met-IR) were included (Supplementary Table S1). Studies were included if they randomised patients for any indication. All treatment indications were screened for and diagnosed according to local criteria in each study, and we did not apply exclusions with respect to this. No restrictions were applied with respect to the length of follow-up period. Efficacy outcomes were change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG; mg/dl and mmol/l), change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; %), body mass index (BMI; kg/m²), mean body weight (kg), lipid profiles (including total, HDL, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides; mg/dl). Any side effects, including GI effects, reported by individual studies were recorded. Data reported only in meeting abstracts was included if the abstract contained sufficient information for assessment. One meeting abstract contained sufficient information and therefore was included in the meta-analysis. Where insufficient information for complete assessment was available, authors were contacted for further information. A total of seven authors were contacted; however none responded.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^26ca3f02]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin in the 21st century

By the end of the 20th century, metformin's ability to safely lower glucose levels in patients with diabetes had been well-documented on a global scale. In 2002, metformin became the most commonly prescribed oral anti-hyperglycemic medication. In 2005, the International Diabetes Foundation published guidelines recommending metformin as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes. Nearly 50 years after the rediscovery of metformin, the World Health Organization added metformin to its list of essential medications in 2011. Numerous clinical trials in the last decade have thoroughly assessed concerns regarding the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis in patients with comorbidities such as renal and hepatic dysfunction or congestive heart failure. Results from such trials continue to support metformin as a safe and effective medication for the vast majority of patients. In fact, the restriction for using metformin in patients with impaired kidney function has recently been relaxed.

### Organic cation transporter 1 variants and gastrointestinal side effects of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^a272c731]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metformin is the first‐line drug for treatment of Type 2 diabetes 1, and the most widely used oral anti‐diabetes agent. It has considerable advantages over other Type 2 diabetes therapies, including low risk of hypoglycaemia, weight neutrality, low cost and possible cardiovascular benefits 1. However, 20–30% of people treated with metformin develop gastrointestinal side effects, and 5% are unable to tolerate metformin due to the severity of these side effects 2. The mechanism behind gastrointestinal side effects and their considerable inter‐individual variability is not known. We recently reported the first study of the genetic and phenotypic determinants of severe intolerance to metformin in a large cohort of people with Type 2 diabetes 3. Reduced‐function alleles of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), and the concomitant use of medications known to inhibit OCT1 activity, were identified as risk factors for metformin intolerance 3. However, in the reported research, a proxy phenotype for metformin gastrointestinal intolerance was established based upon prescribing patterns, namely the discontinuation of metformin and switching to another oral hypoglycaemic agent in the first months of metformin treatment. In this study, we aimed to explore the association between OCT1 reduced‐function variants and common metformin gastrointestinal side effects in a prospectively recruited cohort of patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes, incident users of metformin.

### Adverse effects of the common treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5bf38b38]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is common among women of childbearing age and the available pharmacological therapies have different side-effect profiles.

Objective

We summarized the evidence about the side effects of oral contraceptive pills, metformin, and anti-androgens in women with PCOS.

Data Source

Sources included Ovid Medline, OVID EMBASE, OVID Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and CINAHL from inception through April 2011.

Study Selection

We included comparative observational studies enrolling women with PCOS who received the agents of choice for at least 6 months and reported adverse effects.

Data Extraction

Using a standardized, piloted, and Web-based data extraction form and working in duplicate, we abstracted data from each study and performed meta-analysis when possible.

Data Synthesis

We found 22 eligible studies of which 20 were randomized. No study reported severe side effects (eg, lactic acidosis, thromboembolic episodes, liver toxicity, cancer incidence, or pregnancy loss). Meta-analysis demonstrated no significant change in weight in oral contraceptive pills or flutamide users. Indirect evidence from populations without PCOS demonstrated no increased risk of lactic acidosis with metformin, only case reports of liver toxicity with flutamide (no comparative evidence), and increased relative risk difference of venous thromboembolism with oral contraceptive pills but very low absolute risk. Evidence on mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer was inconclusive.

Conclusions

Drugs commonly used to treat PCOS appear to be associated with very low risk of severe adverse effects although data are extrapolated from other populations.

Metformin Efficacy

Metformin is the first‐line drug treatment for type 2 diabetes. It is derived from the French lilac and has been in clinical use for over 60 years. Yet its mechanism of action remains much debated — for an overview of its action see ref. 17. 17 Metformin is a highly effective treatment that is associated with weight loss and probable cardioprotection, and it is being investigated for its potentially beneficial effects on cancer risk and outcomes 18 and aging. 19 It should be noted, however, that metformin also causes quite considerable gastrointestinal (GI) side effects in ~ 10% of individuals who are prescribed the drug, leading to cessation in ~ 5%. The mechanisms for GI intolerance are also poorly understood. The considerable benefits with confusion about mechanism of action and side effects makes this an intriguing drug worth studying!

### Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8e059e0f]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

A significant barrier to the use of metformin is the high incidence of side effects, particularly gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Of all patients who take metformin, 20–30% report GI side effects; and approximately 5% of all patients discontinue treatment because of severe GI symptoms. The concentration of metformin measured in the small intestine peaks at 30–300 times greater than plasma concentrations; thus it has been suggested that intestinal accumulation of metformin may be a key driver of the reported GI side effects. It is therefore plausible that different formulations of metformin, absorbed systemically at different rates and locations in the GI tract, may have significantly different GI side effect profiles. Metformin hydrochloride (metformin immediate release, met-IR), is poorly absorbed in the stomach, so the majority of the drug is absorbed in the upper part of the small intestine. Metformin extended release (met-XR) is a formulation of metformin hydrochloride suspended within a polymer matrix that dissolves over hours as the tablet passes through the GI tract. Peak metformin concentrations in the small intestine are thus reduced with met-XR compared to met-IR. The newest formulation of metformin is metformin delayed release (met-DR). Met-DR is distinct from met-XR in that it comprises a core of metformin hydrochloride with a pH-dependent enteric coating, which dissolves at pH ≥ 6.5. Hence drug delivery is targeted to the ileum, maximising the gut-based mechanisms of action of metformin while reducing bioavailability. Longer-acting formulations thus reduce systemic absorption of metformin. It is possible that lower doses of met-XR or met-DR could be used to achieve similar efficacy to met-IR while simultaneously reducing prevalence of side effects.

We systematically compared the efficacy and side effect profiles of met-IR, met-XR and met-DR. Despite the increased costs of longer-acting preparations of metformin, if there are significant gains in tolerability then increased use of these formulations may ultimately improve concordance, increase achievement of treatment goals and thus ultimately reduce spending within healthcare services.

### Effects of metformin in obesity treatment in different populations: a meta-analysis [^9c6d4fbb]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Many studies support that metformin can promote weight loss in overweight or obesity patients. – A systematic review that included 946 10–16-year-old obese adolescents demonstrated a significant reduction in BMI [−1.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), −1.93 to −0.82] after metformin treatment. Broad evidence based on clinical trials supports the efficacy and safety profiles of metformin in diabetes and weight gain prevention. In addition, the side effects of metformin are relatively mild. The most common side effect of metformin is gastrointestinal reaction, which decreases with increasing medication period and careful dose escalation. Furthermore, metformin has many advantages, such as improvement of insulin resistance (IR) in people with obesity and alleviation of hyperandrogenism in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Therefore, as a possible weight loss-promoting drug, conducting an in-depth study on the potential weight loss benefits of metformin is reasonable.

However, metformin has not been officially approved as a weight-reduction medicine. Different reports indicate inconsistencies in the weight loss effects of metformin. Moreover, no systematic review has been conducted regarding the weight reduction effect of metformin in different populations. The present meta-analysis aimed to further investigate the effectiveness of metformin on weight loss, explore the feasibility and effectiveness of metformin as a potential weight loss medicine, and possibly provide a basis for the establishment of clinical obesity management and obesity management guidelines.

### An update to the article "Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis" [^d8b0d38f]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results showed that in terms of glycaemic control, there were no significant differences between the different formulations. This alone is valuable evidence for the clinician who seeks to optimise the management of diabetes. However, metformin's use now extends beyond diabetes care, making evaluation of differences in other parameters increasingly important. For example metformin XR was significantly more effective than IR in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which may be an important benefit in patients with significant obesity or other metabolic disease.

A key influence on real-world efficacy of any drug is tolerability. A drug with few unpleasant side effects is much more likely to produce good results outside of the highly regulated world of clinical trials, because patients are more likely to actually take it. An important element of our study was therefore to assess whether there are significant differences between metformin formulations in terms of tolerability, in particular the likelihood of experiencing gastrointestinal side effects. Gastrointestinal effects are a major barrier to tolerating metformin therapy, affecting 20–30% of patients taking metformin. Around 1 in 20 patients will experience effects bothersome enough for them to stop taking metformin altogether. Longer-acting formulations are often recommended to patients who experience gastrointestinal side effects with immediate release metformin, based on the idea that there may be fewer unwanted effects with these preparations. Our data support the idea that metformin DR is associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects than metformin IR (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30–0.66, p < 0.0001). When metformin XR is compared to metformin IR, there is also a reduction in the likelihood of adverse gastrointestinal side effects, although this does not reach our pre-specified threshold for statistical significance.

### Organic cation transporter 1 variants and gastrointestinal side effects of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^b5473ba5]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Metformin is the most widely used oral anti-diabetes agent and has considerable benefits over other therapies, yet 20–30% of people develop gastrointestinal side effects, and 5% are unable to tolerate metformin due to the severity of these side effects. The mechanism for gastrointestinal side effects and their considerable inter-individual variability is unclear. We have recently shown the association between organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) variants and severe intolerance to metformin in people with Type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to explore the association of OCT1 reduced-function polymorphisms with common metformin-induced gastrointestinal side effects in Type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This prospective observational cohort study included 92 patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes, incident users of metformin. Patients were genotyped for two common loss-of-function variants in the OCT1 gene (SLC22A1): R61C (rs12208357) and M420del (rs72552763). The association of OCT1 reduced-function alleles with gastrointestinal side effects was analysed using logistic regression.

Results

Forty-three patients (47%) experienced gastrointestinal adverse effects in the first 6 months of metformin treatment. Interestingly, the number of OCT1 reduced-function alleles was significantly associated with over two-fold higher odds of the common metformin-induced gastrointestinal side effects (odds ratio = 2.31, 95% confidence interval 1.07–5.01, P = 0.034).

Conclusions

In conclusion, we showed for the first time the association between OCT1 variants and common metformin-induced gastrointestinal side effects. These results confirm recent findings related to the role of OCT1 in severe metformin intolerance, and suggest that high inter-individual variability in mild/moderate and severe gastrointestinal intolerance share a common underlying mechanism. These data could contribute to more personalized and safer metformin treatment.

Abstract

Aims

Metformin is the most widely used oral anti‐diabetes agent and has considerable benefits over other therapies, yet 20–30% of people develop gastrointestinal side effects, and 5% are unable to tolerate metformin due to the severity of these side effects. The mechanism for gastrointestinal side effects and their considerable inter‐individual variability is unclear. We have recently shown the association between organic cation transporter 1 (1) variants and severe intolerance to metformin in people with Type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to explore the association of1 reduced‐function polymorphisms with common metformin‐induced gastrointestinal side effects in Type 2 diabetes.

Methods

This prospective observational cohort study included 92 patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes, incident users of metformin. Patients were genotyped for two common loss‐of‐function variants in the1 gene (22A1): R61C (rs12208357) and M420del (rs72552763). The association of1 reduced‐function alleles with gastrointestinal side effects was analysed using logistic regression.

Results

Forty‐three patients (47%) experienced gastrointestinal adverse effects in the first 6 months of metformin treatment. Interestingly, the number of1 reduced‐function alleles was significantly associated with over two‐fold higher odds of the common metformin‐induced gastrointestinal side effects (odds ratio = 2.31, 95% confidence interval 1.07–5.01, P = 0.034).

Conclusions

In conclusion, we showed for the first time the association between1 variants and common metformin‐induced gastrointestinal side effects. These results confirm recent findings related to the role of1 in severe metformin intolerance, and suggest that high inter‐individual variability in mild/moderate and severe gastrointestinal intolerance share a common underlying mechanism. These data could contribute to more personalized and safer metformin treatment.

### Organic cation transporter 1 variants and gastrointestinal side effects of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^c03ddab9]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Metformin is used by over 120 million people worldwide, and considering the high prevalence of metformin‐induced gastrointestinal distress, millions of people are suffering from these adverse effects during metformin treatment. These symptoms negatively affect their quality of life and may result in suboptimal drug dosage and non‐adherence 6. Although different hypotheses have been suggested, the pathophysiology of metformin‐induced gastrointestinal side effects is not clear, and data are lacking to explain the high inter‐individual variability 7. In this prospective study, we found for a first time a significant association between the number of OCT1 reduced‐function alleles and common gastrointestinal adverse effects to metformin. These results are in accordance with earlier findings obtained in the large GoDARTS cohort in which severe gastrointestinal intolerance to metformin was investigated 3. However, in the GoDARTS study, only individuals carrying two deficient OCT1 alleles (recessive model) had higher odds of severe intolerance leading to discontinuation of therapy compared with individuals with one or no deficient alleles. Interestingly, in the current study, the number of deficient alleles (additive model) was associated with common metformin gastrointestinal side effects. Thus, our results suggest that the high inter‐individual variability seen in mild/moderate, as well as severe gastrointestinal intolerance shares a common underlying mechanism despite the considerably different intensity and duration of gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5902c3af]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

Despite the frequent and widespread prescription of metformin worldwide, there is a relative lack of head-to-head comparison data regarding optimal formulations. This information is important to help guide decision-making about the cost–benefit ratio of prescribing long-acting metformin preparations; in some circumstances the relatively high upfront cost of these preparations may make their use prohibitive, despite potential clinical advantages. The equal efficacies of the different metformin formulations in lowering glucose, despite significant differences in drug plasma concentrations, may be explained at least in part by the importance of the gut-based mechanisms of action of metformin, for example stimulating glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)/peptide YY secretion, alterations of bile acid metabolism and potentially changes to the gut microbiome.

In our analysis, mean body weight was reduced following treatment with metformin, regardless of formulation. The underlying mechanism of metformin-associated weight loss remains poorly understood and is likely multifactorial, with several possible contributing mechanisms. Metformin-associated weight loss may be centrally mediated via suppression of orexigenic hypothalamic neurons potentially via GDF-15, by decreased expression of neuropeptide Y, or by preventing ghrelin-mediated appetite stimulation. There is likely also to be an important contribution from gut-based mechanisms, including increased secretion of GLP-1. It has also been suggested that GI side effects may contribute to metformin-associated weight loss via malabsorption of bile salts, microbiome alteration or and gut serotonin secretion. Although we found that long-acting preparations of metformin were associated with reduced GI side effects compared to immediate-release metformin, there was no significant difference in the magnitude of weight loss associated with long-acting preparations, suggesting that GI side effects were not the main mediators of weight loss.

Metformin improves lipid profiles by decreasing the activity and expression of several products involved in lipid synthesis, including acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR). We found that people randomised to met-XR versus met-IR had reduced LDL cholesterol levels, suggesting that long-acting metformin may show some benefit over the immediate-release formulation in improving long-term cardio-metabolic risk profiles.

### Current type 2 diabetes guidelines: individualized treatment and how to make the most of metformin [^a5caae74]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines provide the premise for the delivery of quality care to preserve health and prevent disabilities and premature death. The systematic gathering of observational, mechanistic and experimental data contributes to the hierarchy of evidence used to guide clinical practice. In the field of diabetes, metformin was discovered more than 100years ago, and with 60years of clinical use, it has stood the test of time regarding its value in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Although some guidelines have challenged the role of metformin as the first-line glucose-lowering drug, it is important to point out that the cardiovascular-renal protective effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists were gathered from patients with type 2 diabetes, the majority of whom were treated with metformin. Most national, regional and international guidelines recommend metformin as a foundation therapy with emphasis on avoidance of therapeutic inertia and early attainment of multiple treatment goals. Moreover, real-world evidence has confirmed the glucose-lowering and cardiovascular-renal benefits of metformin accompanied by an extremely low risk of lactic acidosis. In patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15-30mL/min/1.73 m²), metformin discontinuation was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular-renal events compared with metformin persistence. Meanwhile, it is understood that microbiota, nutrients and metformin can interact through the gut-brain-kidney axis to modulate homeostasis of bioactive molecules, systemic inflammation and energy metabolism. While these biological changes contribute to the multisystem effects of metformin, they may also explain the gastrointestinal side effects and vitamin B12 deficiency associated with metformin intolerance. By understanding the interactions between metformin, foods and microbiota, healthcare professionals are in a better position to optimize the use of metformin and mitigate potential side effects. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study and the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Program commenced 40years ago provided the first evidence that type 2 diabetes is preventable and treatable. To drive real-world impact from this evidence, payors, practitioners and planners need to co-design and implement an integrated, data-driven, metformin-based programme to detect people with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes (intermediate hyperglycaemia), notably impaired glucose tolerance, for early intervention. The systematic data collection will create real-world evidence to bring out the best of metformin and make healthcare sustainable, affordable and accessible.

### Metformin; a review of its history and future: from lilac to longevity [^22704072]. Pediatric Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Metformin is a widely prescribed medication that has been used to treat children with type 2 diabetes in the United States for the past 15 years. Metformin now has a variety of clinical applications in pediatrics, and its potential clinical uses continue to expand. In addition to reviewing the current understanding of its mechanisms of action including the newly discovered effects on the gastrointestinal tract, we will also discuss current clinical uses in pediatrics, including in type 1 diabetes. Finally, we examine the existing state of monitoring for metformin efficacy and side effects and discuss prospective future clinical uses.

Discussion

Main Findings

Our findings suggest that in people with T2DM and/or PCOS there were no significant differences in efficacy of glycaemic control between all included metformin formulations (IR, XR and DR), based on change in FPG and in HbA1c after treatment. In addition, our analyses showed very similar reductions in FPG with randomisation to met-XR versus met-DR across a range of clinically relevant doses. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of weight loss experienced by patients randomised to different metformin formulations or in the change in their BMI during treatment. However, patients randomised to met-XR had significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels compared to those randomised to met-IR. GI side effects were markedly reduced in patients randomised to longer-acting metformin preparations compared to met-IR, particularly with met-DR.

Strengths

Our analyses provides the first systematic comparison of the three formulations of metformin that have currently been trialled in head-to-head trials. Meta-regression and extensive sensitivity analyses have been performed to optimise comparisons between available studies and to leverage all existing data, despite methodological differences between the original studies, for example in dosing and study length. There are few previous syntheses of data directly comparing preparations of metformin. A previous comprehensive review concluded that side effects were reduced with met-XR compared to IR, but predated the availability of the new met-DR formulation.

Limitations

The drawing of definitive conclusions from our meta-analysis was limited by both the quantity and quality of the studies available. In particular, there was a lack of studies involving comparisons of individuals randomised to met-DR vs. met-IR (one study; n = 571) or met-DR vs. met-XR (two studies; n = 260). We thus suggest a cautious view regarding the interpretation of these comparisons. Our results highlight the need for more high-quality studies investigating optimal use of various metformin formulations, particularly in patient populations other than type 2 diabetes. Moreover, if more and higher quality data were available then non-significant effects, for example reduction in total cholesterol levels with met-XR v. met-IR, might reach significance, as would be expected from the observed reduction in LDL cholesterol. While metformin is prescribed for a range of clinical indications, the studies available for inclusion in our meta-analysis were limited mainly to populations with T2DM. We were thus only able to compare the efficacy of different metformin formulations for outcomes related to T2DM: glycaemic control, body weight and lipid profiles.

Risk of Bias and Sensitivity Analyses

The risk of bias was moderate-to-low in the majority of included studies; however two studies were open-label. Removal of these two studies did not substantively alter any outcomes, therefore all were included. We assessed the likelihood of single studies significantly influencing the overall results using LOO analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2) for met-IR v. met-XR comparisons. Two outcome measures investigated failed LOO analysis: change in body weight and likelihood of vomiting. This decreases our confidence of the robustness of these findings. Funnel plots for all outcomes were assessed visually (Supplementary Fig. S3); there were no obvious asymmetries in the plots for any study outcomes. All outcomes with more than five studies were subject to Egger's test, and all passed.

GRADE Analysis (Certainty of Evidence)

The majority of outcomes were classified as having a moderate certainty of evidence (Supplementary Fig. S4), with one outcome having a high certainty of evidence (LDL cholesterol). The moderate certainty of evidence was due to from five outcomes having high heterogeneity between studies and four outcomes having high degrees of imprecision in the derived estimates. No publication bias (as ascertained by the Egger's testing and funnel plot analyses) was detected. All studies reported direct evidence (Supplementary Fig. S4).

The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Side effects

Side effects are relatively common but usually not severe. These are more likely to occur within the first weeks of initiation of therapy and with dose escalation. Side effects tend to decrease in frequency and severity with continuation of a stable dose. GI side effects are most frequent and include nausea (25%–44%), diarrhea (19%–30%), vomiting (8%–24%), constipation (17%–24%), and abdominal pain (9%–20%). Although certain side effects have been reported more commonly with semaglutide than with tirzepatide, trial data suggest that such differences may be a reflection of variation in background (i.e. placebo group) rates in the enrolled trial populations, with the proportional increase in many side effects when compared to placebo being similar for the 2 agents (Table 2). Emerging therapies, such as dual and triple receptor agonists targeting GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon pathways, aim to improve efficacy while reducing GI side effects. Real-world experience has largely mirrored these trial data, with GI issues (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation) being the most frequently reported side effects.

TABLE 2
Common side effects reported in semaglutide and tirzepatide trials for obesity 1.

In the trials, GI symptoms rarely led to discontinuation, with < 10% of participants stopping therapy due to GI issues. Fewer data are available on the impact of GI side effects on adherence in clinical practice. Combining GLP-1s with metformin does not appear to worsen GI side effects, despite metformin's association with similar symptoms.

Underlying causes of these GI symptoms appear varied. GLP-1s delay gastric emptying, leading to bloating, fullness, and nausea. GLP-1s activate several brain regions responsible for weight regulation, appetite, and nausea. Occasionally, GLP-1s affect intestinal motility or secretions, contributing to diarrhea. Higher doses are more likely to provoke these adverse symptoms, indicating a dose-dependent relationship.

### Interaction between drugs and the gut microbiome [^21c644b7]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Metformin

Metformin is an oral blood glucose-lowering compound used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). While its exact working mechanism is complex, and not fully understood, metformin does inhibit liver gluconeogenesis, and studies increasingly suggest that some of its beneficial effects are mediated by the gut microbiota. Compared with PPIs, which are used for a wide number of indications or symptoms, metformin is (almost) exclusively used in the setting of diabetes, making it harder to disentangle the effect of the drug on the microbiome from changes in the gut microbiome that are related to the underlying disease. However, this has been done by a landmark study, which showed that previously observed changes in the gut microbiome thought to be driven by the underlying T2D were actually caused by the use of metformin.

In an additional intervention study in healthy volunteers, use of metformin resulted in a change in > 80 species compared with a control group receiving placebo. Notably, metformin treatment significantly increase Escherichia coli and lowers Intestinibacter abundance, which is in line with findings from cross-sectional cohorts that compared untreated patients to metformin-treated patients with T2D. Subsequently, the authors transplanted faecal samples from metformin-treated or placebo-treated donors into germ-free mice and observed lower blood glucose levels in the mice that received faecal samples from metformin-treated volunteers, implying a direct effect of the gut microbiome on blood glucose levels. This effect is thought to be mediated by metformin's effect on short-chain fatty acid (butyrate)-producing bacteria and the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, as well as through common biological pathways and genes encoded in different metformin-affected bacteria, for example, metalloproteins or metal transporters. Moreover, it is clinically well known that up to one-third of patients taking metformin report gastrointestinal side effects like diarrhoea, bloating and nausea, and the identified metformin-induced changes, including the increase of virulence factors and gas metabolism genes (mainly derived from an increase of E. coli species), can contribute to these side effects.

The intertwined relationship between metformin and the gut microbiome shows how a commonly used drug can change the gut microbiome and explain part of the drug's therapeutic function, as well as some of its side effects. It also emphasises the need to rigorously control for confounders like drug use (including of metformin, antibiotics, PPIs and other drugs) when performing microbiome studies looking at specific diseases or conditions.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — metformin could be used alone in women with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates, with counselling that there are more effective ovulation agents; women should be counselled on potential mild gastrointestinal side-effects, healthcare and resource burden are lower with metformin, and consideration of age and screening for other fertility factors needs discussion before prescribing metformin.

### Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3de454da]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate equal efficacy of longer-acting (XR, DR) versus IR metformin formulations in terms of glycaemic control, but significant additional advantages with the longer-acting formulations. Metformin XR was associated with reduced serum LDL cholesterol concentrations, while metformin DR was strongly associated with reduced GI side effects, which could improve drug compliance. Further research is required to refine the optimal cost–benefit ratio of the different available preparations of metformin in various clinical circumstances.

### Metformin for the prevention of antipsychotic-induced weight gain: guideline development and consensus validation [^4b6337d6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent in people with severe mental illness (SMI). Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is one of the most commonly reported and distressing side effects of treatment and people living with SMI place a high value on the avoidance of this side effect. Metformin is the most effective pharmacological intervention studied for the prevention of AIWG yet clear guidelines are lacking and evidence has not translated into practice. The aim of this research was to develop a guideline for the use of metformin for the prevention of AIWG.

Study Design

The appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation II instrument (AGREE II) was followed for guideline development. Literature was reviewed to address key health questions. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE methodology and an evidence-to-decision framework informed the strength of the recommendations. A consensus meeting was held where the algorithm and strength of recommendations were agreed. An independent external review was conducted involving experts in the field, including patient and public partners.

Study Results

Metformin is the only pharmacological agent that has demonstrated efficacy for preventing AIWG. Co-commencement with antipsychotic medicines can reduce the extent of weight gain by 4.03 kg (95% CI -5.78 kg to -2.28 kg) compared to controls. A guideline for the use of metformin for the prevention of AIWG was developed with specific recommendations for co-commencement of metformin at initiation with an antipsychotic or commencement if certain criteria are present. Core recommendations were graded as strong by consensus agreement.

Conclusions

This is the first published evidence-based guideline using the AGREE II framework and GRADE methods for the use of metformin to prevent AIWG incorporating recommendations for co-commencement. Implementation and evaluation of the guideline will be supported by a shared decision-making package and assessment of barriers and facilitators to implementation.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 194 summary: polycystic ovary syndrome [^19f98743]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome — insulin-sensitizing agents (metformin) have prevention and treatment roles but with limits: the Diabetes Prevention Program "demonstrated that metformin can delay the development of diabetes in high-risk populations", and "among women with PCOS who use metformin, glucose tolerance improves or stays steady over time". Metformin "is often used in conjunction with lifestyle therapy to treat PCOS", yet "recent studies suggest that there is little benefit to the addition of metformin above lifestyle therapy alone". Safety and dosing include that metformin "carries a small risk of lactic acidosis… most commonly among women with poorly controlled diabetes and impaired renal function", gastrointestinal symptoms "are the most common adverse reactions" and "may be ameliorated by starting at a small dose and gradually increasing the dose or by using the sustained-release version", and "The dose most commonly used to treat women with PCOS is 1,500–2,000 mg per day given in divided doses". For primary prevention, "data are insufficient to recommend insulin-sensitizing agents prophylactically", although trials "may favor more aggressive management when impaired glucose tolerance or metabolic syndrome is present".

Q5. In patients with T2DM who are intolerant of and/or fail to achieve HbA1c goals on high‐dose metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day), should treatment be switched to a combination regimen with low‐ or moderate‐dose metformin (≤ 1000 mg/day)?

Recommendation 5: In patients with T2DM who are intolerant of and/or fail to achieve HbA1c goals on high‐dose metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day), a triple combination of low‐ or intermediate‐dose metformin (≤ 1000 mg/day), DPP‐4i, and SGLT2i is recommended to improve glycaemic control and/or tolerability (Grade A; strong recommendation [agreement rate: 94%]).

Explanation 5: When used for treating T2DM, metformin is generally started at a low dose (500 mg/day) and titrated gradually to a maximum of 2550 mg/day. Its glucose‐lowering effects are dose‐dependent within the range of 500–2000 mg/day. However, many patients are unable to tolerate high‐dose metformin due to significant gastrointestinal side effects. Evidence from several randomized controlled trials showed that, in patients with T2DM who were intolerant of or had poor glycaemic control (HbA1c 8.0%–11.0%) on high‐dose metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day), a triple‐combination FDC containing low‐ or intermediate‐dose metformin (≤ 1000 mg/day), DPP‐4i, and SGLT2i reduced HbA1c levels by 1.45%–1.73% and increased glycaemic goal achievement rates to 27.5%–54% with good safety and tolerability.

Real-world experience has largely mirrored trial data, with GI issues (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation) as the most frequently reported side effects. Combining GLP-1s with metformin does not appear to worsen GI side effects, and higher doses are more likely to provoke these adverse symptoms, indicating a dose-dependent relationship.

### Use of metformin in the setting of mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency [^9d517385]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

A common clinical conundrum faces all U.S. practitioners treating patients with type 2 diabetes. Today's U.S. Food and Drug Administration prescribing guidelines for metformin contraindicate its use in men and women with serum creatinine concentrations ≥ 1.5 and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL (≥ 132 and ≥ 123 µmol/L), respectively. In a patient tolerating and controlled with this medication, should it automatically be discontinued as the creatinine rises beyond these cut points over time? Stopping metformin often results in poorly controlled glycemia and/or the need for other agents with their own adverse-effect profiles. Moreover, is the now widespread use of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in lieu of serum creatinine levels creating even more confusion, especially in those with abnormalities in one but not the other indirect measure of renal function? Indeed, more than a decade and a half after metformin became available in the U.S. debate continues over the best approach in these settings. How many patients are unable to receive this medication on the basis of guidelines which, although well intentioned, are somewhat arbitrary and outdated based on modern assessments of renal status?

4.2 Potential risks of metformin

Gastrointestinal side effects, such as metallic taste, abdominal discomfort, nausea and diarrhoea, are the most common. In clinical trials (including those in T2D), approximately 5%–8% of study participants discontinue metformin because of gastrointestinal side effects. In a recent meta‐analysis of 404 T1D patients on metformin, there were 156 instances of gastrointestinal side effects (41%) with only 57 events of 400 individuals in the placebo group (14%) with an relative risk (RR) of 2.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.06 to 3.45). There is also the potential risk of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment, but this remains very rare indeed. While theoretically the gastrointestinal side effects of metformin can be ameliorated by using a long‐acting preparation, strong evidence for a favourable side effect profile is lacking, although compliance certainly improves with the long‐acting preparation.

Taken together, it appears that in the short term, metformin reduces insulin requirements, improves cardiometabolic markers without a clear effect on HbA1c. However, the limited data suggest that the beneficial effects of metformin are not sustained long term. While there is an increase in gastrointestinal side effects, there are no real safety concerns with this agent, and given the potential benefits, at least in the short term, metformin may be considered for the management of individuals with T1D who display features of IR.

Key studies on metformin use in T1D are summarised in Table 1.

### Organic cation transporter 1 variants and gastrointestinal side effects of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes [^94b44419]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Furthermore, female sex and lower body weight showed a trend of association with side effects, in accordance with the GoDARTS findings 3. However, contrary to our earlier study 3, age and the concomitant use of OCT1‐inhibiting drugs had no significant effect on the incidence of side effects. A reason for this discrepancy might be difference in the studied phenotypes between the two studies (common vs. severe intolerance), or perhaps the small sample size in the current study.

Our results are in contrast with a previous study 8 demonstrating significant associations of the OCT1 variants M408V and the 8‐bp insertion rs36056065 with the presence of common metformin gastrointestinal adverse effects, whereas R61C and M420del or OCT1 haplotypes had no effect. However, M408V does not alter the uptake of metformin in vitro 9, and the function of rs36056065 is unknown. Also, contrary to our results, the prevalence of side effects was correlated positively with age 8, in line with the GoDARTS results 3. However, both previous studies also included patients with a longer duration of Type 2 diabetes treated with other anti‐diabetes drugs in addition to metformin, whereas in the current study, only patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes and metformin prescribed as their initial Type 2 diabetes therapy were included. This might explain the similar age between patients with and without gastrointestinal adverse effects.

The mechanism behind the association of OCT1 reduced transport with increased metformin side effects is not clear. It has been suggested that gastrointestinal symptoms are due to high local concentrations of metformin in the intestine 10. Because OCT1 is expressed in the membranes of enterocytes 11, 12, a change in its activity might affect local metformin concentrations in the gut, possibly leading to changes in incretins, ghrelin, bile acids or serotonin balance 7.

The main limitation of our study is its limited power. This might be the reason for not detecting the effect of OCT1‐inhibiting drugs on common metformin side effects. Future studies in larger cohorts are needed to explore these possible interactions and to confirm our findings.

In conclusion, we showed for the first time the association between OCT1 reduced‐function alleles and the incidence of common metformin‐induced gastrointestinal side effects in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Importantly, this study confirms recent findings related to the role of OCT1 in severe metformin intolerance, further supporting the role of OCT1 variants in gastrointestinal side effects following metformin treatment.

### Metformin for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in persons at increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^e9f9a404]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether metformin can prevent or delay T2DM and its complications in people with increased risk of developing T2DM is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of metformin for the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in persons at increased risk for the T2DM.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was March 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of one year or more comparing metformin with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or standard care in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or combinations of these.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted outcome data independently. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs randomising 6774 participants. One trial contributed 48% of all participants. The duration of intervention in the trials varied from one to five years. We judged none of the trials to be at low risk of bias in all 'Risk of bias' domains. Our main outcome measures were all-cause mortality, incidence of T2DM, serious adverse events (SAEs), cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, health-related quality of life and socioeconomic effects. The following comparisons mostly reported only a fraction of our main outcome set. Fifteen RCTs compared metformin with diet and exercise with or without placebo: all-cause mortality was 7/1353 versus 7/1480 (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.01; P = 0.83; 2833 participants, 5 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 324/1751 versus 529/1881 participants (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.65; P < 0.001; 3632 participants, 12 trials; moderate-quality evidence); the reporting of SAEs was insufficient and diverse and meta-analysis could not be performed (reported numbers were 4/118 versus 2/191; 309 participants; 4 trials; very low-quality evidence); cardiovascular mortality was 1/1073 versus 4/1082 (2416 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). One trial reported no clear difference in health-related quality of life after 3.2 years of follow-up (very low-quality evidence). Two trials estimated the direct medical costs (DMC) per participant for metformin varying from $220 to $1177 versus $61 to $184 in the comparator group (2416 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence). Eight RCTs compared metformin with intensive diet and exercise: all-cause mortality was 7/1278 versus 4/1272 (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.23; P = 0.43; 2550 participants, 4 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 304/1455 versus 251/1505 (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.37; P = 0.42; 2960 participants, 7 trials; moderate-quality evidence); the reporting of SAEs was sparse and meta-analysis could not be performed (one trial reported 1/44 in the metformin group versus 0/36 in the intensive exercise and diet group with SAEs). One trial reported that 1/1073 participants in the metformin group compared with 2/1079 participants in the comparator group died from cardiovascular causes. One trial reported that no participant died due to cardiovascular causes (very low-quality evidence). Two trials estimated the DMC per participant for metformin varying from $220 to $1177 versus $225 to $3628 in the comparator group (2400 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin with acarbose: all-cause mortality was 1/44 versus 0/45 (89 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 12/147 versus 7/148 (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.14; P = 0.22; 295 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence); SAEs were 1/51 versus 2/50 (101 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin with thiazolidinediones: incidence of T2DM was 9/161 versus 9/159 (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.40; P = 0.98; 320 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). SAEs were 3/45 versus 0/41 (86 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin plus intensive diet and exercise with identical intensive diet and exercise: all-cause mortality was 1/121 versus 1/120 participants (450 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 48/166 versus 53/166 (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.92; P = 0.49; 332 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). One trial estimated the DMC of metformin plus intensive diet and exercise to be $270 per participant compared with $225 in the comparator group (94 participants; 1 trial; very-low quality evidence). One trial in 45 participants compared metformin with a sulphonylurea. The trial reported no patient-important outcomes. For all comparisons there were no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or microvascular complications. We identified 11 ongoing trials which potentially could provide data of interest for this review. These trials will add a total of 17,853 participants in future updates of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

Metformin compared with placebo or diet and exercise reduced or delayed the risk of T2DM in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM (moderate-quality evidence). However, metformin compared to intensive diet and exercise did not reduce or delay the risk of T2DM (moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, the combination of metformin and intensive diet and exercise compared to intensive diet and exercise only neither showed an advantage or disadvantage regarding the development of T2DM (very low-quality evidence). Data on patient-important outcomes such as mortality, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications and health-related quality of life were sparse or missing.

### Optimizing metformin therapy in practice: tailoring therapy in specific patient groups to improve tolerability, efficacy and outcomes [^0cd954b9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Metformin is the first-line medication for type 2 diabetes. It is effective and safe, provided some caution is taken in specific populations. In patients with chronic kidney disease, metformin may provide long-term benefits, and it is a first-line therapy for diabetes, but the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) must be assessed regularly, to minimize the risk for metformin accumulation. When eGFR is 30-60mL/min/1.73 m², the dose should be reconsidered, and sick-days education provided. Metformin should be discontinued when eGFR falls below 30mL/min/1.73 m². Metformin accumulation may increase the risk for lactic acidosis if concomitant risk factors for hyperlactataemia (liver or respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, acute heart failure) are present; in these conditions, metformin is contraindicated, even although the available evidence is reassuring. Patients on metformin often complain of gastrointestinal side effects (mainly diarrhoea and nausea) during therapy initiation, but they may sometimes occur after years of stable therapy. These usually resolve if the dose is carefully titrated, or by switching to the extended-release formulation. Patients with obesity may benefit from the significant, although modest, metformin-associated weight loss and appetite reduction. During pregnancy, metformin is associated with a reduction of pregnancy complications, especially in obese women, but some concern remains, because metformin crosses the placenta, and it is associated with a significantly lower mean birth weight than insulin. In the elderly, gastrointestinal tolerability and renal function must be reassessed more often. Vitamin B-12 should be screened regularly in long-time metformin users because metformin may induce clinical vitamin B-12 deficiency.

Noninsulin diabetes medications — class-specific adverse effects and incidence are reported as follows: Metformin commonly causes diarrhea (10–30%) and nausea (10–15%), with a rare risk of lactic acidosis (2–5/100,000).

### Glipizide and metformin hydrochloride [^f270066e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Q5. Does Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets work differently from other glucose-control medications?

Yes, they do. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets combines 2 glucose-lowering drugs, glipizide and metformin. These 2 drugs work together to improve the different metabolic defects found in type 2 diabetes. Glipizide lowers blood sugar primarily by causing more of the body's own insulin to be released, and metformin lowers blood sugar, in part, by helping your body use your own insulin more effectively. Together, they are efficient in helping you to achieve better glucose control.

Q6. What happens if my blood sugar is still too high?

When blood sugar cannot be lowered enough by Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, your doctor may prescribe injectable insulin or take other measures to control your diabetes.

Q7. Can Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets cause side effects?

Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, like all blood sugar-lowering medications, can cause side effects in some patients. Most of these side effects are minor. However, there are also serious, but rare, side effects related to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets (see Question Nos. 9 to 13).

### Understanding and overcoming metformin gastrointestinal intolerance [^5887aa46]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Metformin is the most widely prescribed drug for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the first-line pharmacological option as supported by multiple international guidelines, yet a rather large proportion of patients cannot tolerate metformin in adequate amounts because of its associated gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs). GI AEs typically encountered with metformin therapy include diarrhoea, nausea, flatulence, indigestion, vomiting and abdominal discomfort, with diarrhoea and nausea being the most common. Although starting at a low dose and titrating slowly may help prevent some GI AEs associated with metformin, some patients are unable to tolerate metformin at all and it may also be difficult to convince patients to start metformin again after a bout of GI AEs. Despite this clinical importance, the underlying mechanisms of the GI intolerance associated with metformin are poorly known. In the present review, we discuss: the epidemiology of metformin-associated GI intolerance and its underlying mechanisms; genotype variability and associated factors affecting metformin GI intolerance, such as comorbidities, co-medications and bariatric surgery; clinical consequences and therapeutic strategies to overcome metformin GI intolerance. These strategies include appropriate titration of immediate-release metformin, use of extended-release metformin, the promise of delayed-release metformin and gut microbiome modulators, as well as alternative pharmacological therapies when metformin cannot be tolerated at all. Given the available data, all efforts should be made to maintain metformin before considering a shift to another drug therapy.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^13da0198]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Metformin — adults and adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Metformin alone should be considered in adults with PCOS and a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles; metformin alone could be considered in adolescents at risk of or with PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence; and metformin alone may be considered in adults with PCOS and BMI < 25 kg/m², acknowledging limited evidence. Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention and women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy; mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting; starting at a low dose, with 500mg increments 1–2 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence; suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5 g in adults and 2g in adolescents; use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered; and use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, where monitoring should be considered.

Results

Study Selection and Study Characteristics

The PRISMA flow chart (Supplementary Fig. S1) demonstrates the screening procedure involved to include 15 eligible studies (n = 3765 participants). The majority of these studies (12 studies, involving 2934 participants) compared met-XR v. met-IR. One study (n = 571) compared met-DR v. met-IR. The remaining two studies (n = 260) compared met-DR, met-XR and met-IR.

The majority of studies enrolled people with type 2 diabetes (13 studies; n = 3119). One study (n = 571) enrolled people with T2D and chronic kidney disease (CKD I/II) and one study enrolled people with PCOS (n = 75).

For all indications and comparisons, the studies varied with respect to quality and design (Supplementary Table S3). The included studies demonstrated heterogeneity with respect to the dosage of metformin (600–2500 mg) and the study duration (Supplementary Table S3). The included studies came from a variety of geographical locations: Europe (Belgium, Italy), Africa/Middle East (Pakistan, South Africa), Asia (China and Taiwan) and North America /Latin America (USA and Brazil).

### Trial of restarting and tolerating metformin (treatMet) [^4cee8cee]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, n-of-1 crossover study assessed whether metformin's side effects are reproducible in patients with a history of metformin intolerance. Participants completed up to four cycles of 2weeks of metformin exposure and 2weeks of placebo exposure. Participants completed surveys based on the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication. The primary hypotheses were that treatment satisfaction would be equal for placebo and metformin and that more than 30% of the study enrollees would be able to adhere to a higher dose of metformin 6 months after participation. Thirteen patients (all women, mean age 52.4years) enrolled, three of whom were lost to follow-up or were non-adherent to study protocol. Metformin was associated with significantly lower global treatment satisfaction scores compared with placebo (39.58 vs. 53.75, P < .05) but participants could not distinguish metformin from placebo and did not report higher rates of gastrointestinal side effects on metformin. Two out of 10 participants adhered to a higher dose of metformin after trial completion. Metformin appears to have barriers to use beyond its classic gastrointestinal side effects.

### Metformin pharmacogenomics: current status and future directions [^3282b071]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its costs to the health care system continue to rise. Despite the availability of at least 10 drug classes for the treatment of T2D, metformin remains the most widely used first-line pharmacotherapy for its treatment; however, marked interindividual variability in response and few clinical or biomarker predictors of response reduce its optimal use. As clinical care moves toward precision medicine, a variety of broad discovery-based "omics" approaches will be required. Technical innovation, decreasing sequencing cost, and routine sample storage and processing has made pharmacogenomics the most widely applied discovery-based approach to date. This opens up the opportunity to understand the genetics underlying the interindividual variation in metformin responses in order for clinicians to prescribe specific treatments to given individuals for better efficacy and safety: metformin for those predicted to respond and alternative therapies for those predicted to be nonresponders or who are at increased risk for adverse side effects. Furthermore, understanding of the genetic determinants of metformin response may lead to the identification of novel targets and development of more effective agents for diabetes treatment. The goals of this workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases were to review the state of research on metformin pharmacogenomics, discuss the scientific and clinical hurdles to furthering our knowledge of the variability in patient responses to metformin, and consider how to effectively use this increased understanding to improve patient outcomes.

Mean Change in HbA1c

Nine studies (n = 2037) reported HbA1c change or start and finish HbA1c concentrations over 29 separate groups (8 met-IR, 14 met-XR, 7 met-DR). When summary measures were calculated using comparable dosages (1000–1500 mg), there was no significant difference between the efficacy of met-IR, met-XR or met-DR in reducing HbA1c (p = 0.25; met-IR, − 0.66 [− 1.04, − 0.27], p < 0.001; met-XR, − 0.70 [− 0.81, − 0.58], p < 0.0001; met-DR, − 0.50 [− 0.70, − 0.29], p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3).

### Advances in metformin-delivery systems for diabetes and obesity management [^9974e9e9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Metformin is a medication that is commonly prescribed to manage type 2 diabetes. It has been used for more than 60years and is highly effective in lowering blood glucose levels. Recent studies indicate that metformin may have additional medical benefits beyond treating diabetes, revealing its potential therapeutic uses. Oral medication is commonly used to administer metformin because of its convenience and cost-effectiveness. However, there are challenges in optimizing its effectiveness. Gastrointestinal side effects and limitations in bioavailability have led to the underutilization of metformin. Innovative drug-delivery systems such as fast-dissolving tablets, micro/nanoparticle formulations, hydrogel and microneedles have been explored to optimize metformin therapy. These strategies enhance metformin dosage, targeting, bioavailability and stability, and provide personalized treatment options for improved glucose homeostasis, antiobesity and metabolic health benefits. Developing new delivery systems for metformin shows potential for improving therapeutic outcomes, broadening its applications beyond diabetes management and addressing unmet medical needs in various clinical settings. However, it is important to improve drug-delivery systems, addressing issues such as complexity, cost, biocompatibility, stability during storage and transportation, loading capacity, required technologies and biomaterials, targeting precision and regulatory approval. Addressing these limitations is crucial for effective, safe and accessible drug delivery in clinical practice. In this review, recent advances in the development and application of metformin-delivery systems for diabetes and obesity are discussed.

Synthesis of Results

Efficacy Outcomes

Mean Change in FPG

Ten studies (n = 2855) reported either change in FPG or start-and-finish FPG concentrations over 33 separate groups. Of these, two groups were intermediate measurements of the same participants, so 31 groups (n = 2499) were included in meta-analysis (9 met-IR, 15 met-XR, 7 met-DR). When summary measures were calculated using comparable dosages (1000–1500 mg), there was no significant difference between the efficacy of met-IR, met-XR or met-DR in changing FPG (p = 0.928, Fig. 1); met-IR, − 22.90 ± 21.70 mg/dl (1.30 ± 1.20 mmol/l): met-XR, − 21.90 ± 9.90 mg/dl (1.2 ± 0.6 mmol/l); met-DR, − 20.00 ± 5.60 mg/dl (1.10 ± 0.30 mmol/l).

Fig. 1
Effect of metformin formulations (met-XR, met-IR and met-DR) upon mean fasting plasma glucose concentrations (mg/dl) measured at the start and at the end of the study. Metformin doses range between 600 mg per day to 2000 mg. Summary measures expressed as doses between 1000 and 1500 mg per day. Mean difference and 95% confidence intervals

All 33 groups were included in meta-regression (10 met-IR, 16 met-XR, 7 met-DR, n = 2855). Met-IR was only reported at two doses, so meta-regression could not reasonably be performed. There was significant dose-dependency of change in FPG for both met-DR and met-XR. For every 1000 mg dose, FPG decreased by 0.90 ± 0.40 mmol/l (15.60 ± 7.70 mg/dl; p < 0.05) with met-XR and 1.00 ± 0.40 mmol/l (18.1 ± 6.4 mg/dl; p < 0.01) with met-XR (Fig. 2).

### Alternative treatments for type 2 diabetes and associated metabolic diseases: medical therapy or endoscopic duodenal mucosal remodelling? [^fa61ce31]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Current treatment for T2D: glucose-lowering medications

Treatment to achieve euglycaemia is important to prevent hyperglycaemia-related complications such as macrovascular and microvascular diseases in patients with T2D. Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the most important reflection of long-term glucose control and levels are closely monitored to measure the effect of glucose-lowering therapy and to adjust the medication regimen if necessary. Target HbA1c levels are ≤ 53 mmol/L (7%), or even ≤ 48 mmol/L (6.5%), depending on the applicable guidelines. Several lifestyle interventions, including reduction of carbohydrate intake and increase of physical exercise, are initially advised. This is however effective only in a subset of patients and has limited long-term results. Table 1 provides a summary of glucose-lowering therapies.

Table 1
Overview of the most frequently prescribed glucose-lowering medications to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus

Metformin (dimethylbiguanide) is generally considered the first-line drug once lifestyle intervention is insufficient to achieve treatment goals. The first scientific reports on metformin date from 1922, and in Europe it has been registered and used since 1957. Its use as the first-line agent for T2D only became widespread in the late 1990s following its approval by the Food and Drug Administration in 1994 and the emergence of evidence from the landmark UK Prospective Diabetes Study of diabetes control which showed overall better outcomes and the possibility of lower cardiovascular mortality in a subset of patients who received the drug as initial pharmacotherapy. Metformin reduces glucose absorption in the gut, reduces hepatic glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity. Starting metformin treatment leads on average to an HbA1c reduction of approximately 11 mmol/mol (1%). Common side effects of metformin are diarrhoea and nausea. Caution is advised with impaired renal function, since metformin has been associated with lactic acidosis, particularly in case of renal failure. Nowadays, metformin has become the most prescribed glucose-lowering therapy worldwide as it has a favourable long-term safety profile and is inexpensive. However, for the majority of patients with T2D (about 60%), metformin monotherapy is not sufficient to achieve euglycaemia.

### Gastrointestinal adverse events of metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression of observational studies [^cdbe5688]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on RCTs, the different GI-related AE may occur in patients with T2DM treated with metformin which limits its use. In our recent systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of RCT, we found that metformin use was associated with a higher risk of abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea compared to other glucose-lowering drugs or placebo. In the current study, we did not evaluate the side effects of metformin in comparison to other glucose-lowering drugs. Instead, we report the event rate of AE from real world observational data.

Diarrhea emerged as the most frequently observed AE, affecting 6.9% of the population treated with metformin. This observation aligns with the results of our prior meta-analysis of RCT. Further, in both meta-analyses the frequency of other GI AE followed a consistent descending order: bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. This pattern suggests a robust trend in the manifestation of these GI AE in patients treated with metformin. There are multiple potential systemic effects of metformin that contribute to this side effect. By its structural relation to selective agonists of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, induces 5-HT3 receptor independent release of 5-HT from human duodenal mucosa, what may cause GI symptoms, including diarrhea. Additionally, metformin treatment leads to disturbances in the entero-hepatic circulation of bile salts and outcome osmotic diarrhea, through reducing ileal bile salt reabsorption and leading to elevated colonic bile salt concentrations. Moreover, microbiome alterations caused by metformin can be responsible for its different side-effects. Increased osmotic burden in the colon is a possible explanation for watery stool formation in patients on metformin particularly at the treatment beginning.

### The metformin in tuberous sclerosis (MiTS) study: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^928c3b84]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There is emerging evidence from animal work that metformin may have an anti-epileptic and anti-epileptogenic effect. Metformin may have an anti-epileptic effect via a number of different pathways: inhibition of MTOR, activation of AMPK and prevention of oxidative damage induced by seizure activity. Metformin has been shown to suppress seizures in some rodent models and Bruegeman et al. have recently demonstrated that metformin significantly suppressed seizure behaviour in a zebrafish PTZ-induced seizure model. Metformin has not previously been studied in any clinical trial for human seizures or epilepsy. Consequently, the reduction of seizure activity seen in patients treated with metformin in this study is interesting. However, our study data is undermined by the failure to obtain seizure data in eight patients and we did not control for alterations in other anti-epileptic drugs. Nevertheless, the findings are sufficiently intriguing to justify further study of the possible anti-epileptic effects of metformin in tuberous sclerosis complex in an adequately powered clinical trial.

Everolimus and rapamycin are two mTOR inhibitors that have been shown to be effective at both reducing hamartoma size and improving refractory epilepsy in TSC. However, these agents have significant side-effects. The most common side-effects of these agents are mouth ulceration and stomatitis but there is a risk of immunosuppression and severe infection. Two deaths in the recently reported EXIST-3 study were attributed to treatment. Metformin inhibits mTOR via a different mechanism than everolimus and rapamycin and it has a significantly more benign side-effect profile. At the dose used in this study, it does not appear to be as potent an mTOR inhibitor as rapamycin or everolimus and does not have such a dramatic effect on the hamartomas associated with TSC. However, given its better side-effect profile it may prove to be a more attractive option for TSC patients who may benefit from long-term mTOR inhibition to prevent the development of symptomatic SEGAs and to improve their long-term epilepsy control. It is also possible that it could be given in conjunction with other mTOR inhibitors possibly having a synergistic effect and possibly allowing use of lower doses of more toxic mTOR inhibitors and thus reducing the incidence of severe side-effects. These questions need to be explored in future research.

### AGA clinical practice update on chemoprevention for colorectal neoplasia: expert review [^7b9f975d]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Metformin — chemoprevention for colorectal neoplasia, primarily in patients with type 2 diabetes, is supported by observational and limited trial data: In individuals with CRC and type 2 diabetes, a meta-analysis of 17 observational studies (n = 269,417) found improved cancer-specific survival (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59–0.94) and overall survival (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.61–0.77), though observational studies are susceptible to confounding. For CRC incidence, a meta-analysis of 14 observational studies (n = 459,607) found a 27% reduction with metformin use (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62–0.86), whereas a diabetes trial comparing metformin with rosiglitazone and glyburide found no difference in CRC incidence. For adenoma, a meta-analysis of 5 observational studies (n = 19,730) showed 20% reduced risk (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71–0.90), and a 2016 Japanese randomized trial in nondiabetic patients with prior adenoma or polyp assigned to 250 mg metformin vs placebo found a 40% reduction in adenoma recurrence after 1 year (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39–0.92); there was insufficient evidence for sessile serrated lesion (SSL) incidence. Metformin is generally well-tolerated with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting as common side effects; in the Japanese trial, 11% experienced a mild adverse event with no serious events. Best Practice Advice 4 and 5 state that, based on observational studies, a small adenoma trial, and a favorable safety profile, metformin may be considered as a chemopreventive agent for individuals with type 2 diabetes and a history of colorectal adenoma.

### Pharmacokinetics of metformin in patients with gastrointestinal intolerance [^a1ab12e9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite affecting up to 20% of those treated, metformin intolerance is poorly understood. 1 Intolerance to metformin is usually characterized by gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of nausea, abdominal pain, bloating or diarrhoea. Gradual uptitration of dose after introduction of metformin or slow release preparations can, in some cases, attenuate symptoms of intolerance; however, in 5% of individuals exposed to metformin, the severity of the GI side effect leads to discontinuation of treatment. 1 For others, metformin intolerance may result in sub‐optimal dosing or poor adherence. These factors delay optimal glycaemic control in the individual, result in the addition of, or switch to, alternative oral anti‐hyperglycaemic agents, and, as a result, potentially contribute to increased risk of microvascular complications of diabetes. Metformin is the first‐line pharmaceutical treatment for type 2 diabetes recommended by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines. 2 These, and other guidelines, 3 recommend metformin based on prospective 4, 5, 6, 7 and retrospective 8 studies that demonstrate an improved glycaemic profile with metformin treatment, reduction in cardiovascular mortality, 4, 6, 7, 8 no associated hypoglycaemia, 5 and weight neutrality or weight loss. 5 These desirable characteristics, along with their low cost, explain metformin's status as the most extensively prescribed anti‐hyperglycaemic agent worldwide. These same characteristics drive the need for ongoing research into the mechanisms underlying intolerance to metformin, aiming to prevent, modulate or treat intolerance. This would not only benefit the individual but could have significant implications for health economy.

Metformin has a complex relationship with the gastrointestinal tract. 9 It is predominantly absorbed from the small intestine, with a bioavailability of ~60% 10; however, it also exerts many effects on the intestine, as previously described. 9 Multiple hypotheses for the mechanism of GI intolerance to metformin have been proposed, including abnormal uptake, increased lactate production, and accumulation of serotonin, histamine or bile acids.

Metformin uptake from the gut lumen is transporter‐dependent. 10, 11 Genetic variation 12, 13, 14, 15 in or inhibition 12, 14 of transporters, such as organic cation transporter (OCT)1, could alter metformin uptake from the intestinal lumen to enterocytes, and subsequently affect efflux of metformin across the basolateral membrane to the systemic circulation. This would lead to changes in metformin concentration within the GI tract, enterocytes or systemic circulation.

Side Effects of Metformin Formulations

There was a non-statistically significant reduction in the likelihood of experiencing GI side effects between individuals randomised to met-XR versus met-IR (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.45–1.07, I² = 71%, p = 0.10), based on nine studies including 2164 participants (Fig. 5 a). Individuals randomised to met-DR versus met-IR were less than half as likely to experience any GI side effects (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.80, I² = N/A, p = 0.006), based on one study including 472 participants (Fig. 5 b). There was no significant difference in the likelihood of developing any GI side effects between individuals randomised to met-DR versus met-XR (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.32–2.19, I² = N/A, p = 0.72), in one study including 159 participants (Fig. 5 c). When each reported side effect was considered separately, randomisation to met-XR versus met-IR was associated with reduced likelihood of heartburn/dyspepsia and increased tolerability overall (Table 2). Randomisation to met-DR v met-IR was associated with reduced likelihood of nausea (Table 2). No studies comparing met-DR versus met-XR reported the likelihood of experiencing each side effect separately.

6.1	Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In placebo-controlled trials, 781 patients were administered metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of the patients treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and that were more common than in placebo-treated patients are listed in Table 1.

Diarrhea led to the discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in 0.6% of patients. Additionally, the following adverse reactions were reported in 1.0% to 5.0% of patients treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and were more commonly reported than in placebo-treated patients: abdominal pain, constipation, abdomen distention, dyspepsia/heartburn, flatulence, dizziness, headache, upper respiratory infection, taste disturbance.

Laboratory Tests

Vitamin B12Concentrations

In clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin hydrochloride tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients.

6.2	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin.

Adverse effects

Gastrointestinal intolerance occurs quite frequently in the form of abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea. Most of these effects are transient and subside once the dose is reduced or when administered with meals. However, as much as 5% of patients do not tolerate even the lowest dose.

About 10–30% of patients who are prescribed metformin have evidence of reduced vitamin B12 absorption due to calcium-dependent ileal membrane antagonism, an effect that can be reversed with supplemental calcium. This vitamin B12 deficiency is rarely associated with megaloblastic anemia.

A multicentric study reported a mean decrease of 19% and 5% in vitamin B12 and folate concentration, respectively. Vitamin B12 deficiency has been related with dose and duration of metformin use and occurs more frequently among patients that use it for more than 3 years and in higher doses.

Other adverse reactions are sporadic, such as leucocytoclastic vasculitis, allergic pneumonitis, cholestatic jaundice, and hemolytic anaemia.

Hypoglycemia is very uncommon with metformin monotherapy but has been reported in combination regimens, likely due to metformin potentiating other therapeutic agents.

Drug interactions

Clinically significant drug interactions involving metformin are rare. Some cationic agents such as amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, and vancomycin that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion may compete with metformin for elimination. Concomitant administration of cimetidine, furosemide, or nifedipine may also increase the concentration of metformin. Patients receiving metformin in association with these agents should be monitored for potential toxicity. Metformin should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to the administration of iodinated contrast media which can produce acute renal failure and should only be restarted if renal function is normal.

Tolerability

Gastrointestinal side-effects are common with the use of metformin of standard release and are usually associated with rapid titration and high-dose initiation of metformin.

These effects are generally transient, arise early in the course of treatment, and tend to subside over time. The gastrointestinal side-effects can be addressed by taking the agent with meals, reducing the rate of dose escalation, or transferring to a prolonged-release formulation.

Some studies point to a dose-related relationship of the incidence of side-effects whereas other evidence gives no support for a dose-related effect of metformin on the gastrointestinal system.

### Mechanisms of action of metformin with special reference to cardiovascular protection [^d6b29567]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The choice of treatments for type 2 diabetes is wider than ever before, and several drugs have now been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and/or the risk of premature mortality in this population. Nevertheless, at the time of writing, influential diabetes management guidelines continue to identify metformin as initial antidiabetic pharmacotherapy of choice (in the absence of contraindications) more than 60 years after its first therapeutic administration to a person with diabetes. 1 It is important to place our knowledge of the actions of metformin within the current context of increased emphasis on the need to protect the cardiovascular system in type 2 diabetes. In this review, we provide a concise snapshot of current knowledge concerning the effects of metformin on glycaemia and clinical cardiovascular outcomes, together with a review of the diverse range of proposed mechanisms of action that underlie such effects.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^7c65fd27]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Preexisting diabetes in pregnancy — metformin added to insulin: In randomized controlled trials, total insulin dose requirements were decreased in the metformin plus insulin group compared with insulin alone in the MiTY trial (1.1 ± 1.0 vs 1.5 ± 1.1 units/kg; P < .0001) but were similar in the MOMPOD trial (0.9 ± 0.61 vs 1.1 ± 0.31 units/kg). The resources required to add metformin to insulin are low and most clinicians are comfortable prescribing metformin, but based on the available data the GDP judged cost savings from metformin plus insulin vs insulin alone to be low. Acceptability considerations noted that the addition of metformin to insulin is likely to be acceptable to most if the patient does not have gastrointestinal adverse effects and given the potential for less gestational weight gain (GWG), yet women tend to be more reluctant to use medicines during pregnancy and the most common fear was the "risk of harm to the unborn child".

### Metformin: from research to clinical practice [^4122d360]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin is the recommended first-line oral glucose-lowering drug initiated to control hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It acts in the liver, small intestines, and skeletal muscles with its major effect on decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis. It is safe, inexpensive, and weight neutral and can be associated with weight loss. It can reduce microvascular complication risk and its use is associated with a lower cardiovascular mortality compared with sulfonylurea therapy. It is also used to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, in treating gestational diabetes, and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

### Metformin: an old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^332efdc3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The management of T2DM requires aggressive treatment to achieve glycemic and cardiovascular risk factor goals. In this setting, metformin, an old and widely accepted first line agent, stands out not only for its antihyperglycemic properties but also for its effects beyond glycemic control such as improvements in endothelial dysfunction, hemostasis and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and fat redistribution. These properties may have contributed to the decrease of adverse cardiovascular outcomes otherwise not attributable to metformin's mere antihyperglycemic effects. Several other classes of oral antidiabetic agents have been recently launched, introducing the need to evaluate the role of metformin as initial therapy and in combination with these newer drugs. There is increasing evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies supporting its anti-proliferative role in cancer and possibly a neuroprotective effect. Metformin's negligible risk of hypoglycemia in monotherapy and few drug interactions of clinical relevance give this drug a high safety profile. The tolerability of metformin may be improved by using an appropiate dose titration, starting with low doses, so that side-effects can be minimized or by switching to an extended release form. We reviewed the role of metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and describe the additional benefits beyond its glycemic effect. We also discuss its potential role for a variety of insulin resistant and pre-diabetic states, obesity, metabolic abnormalities associated with HIV disease, gestational diabetes, cancer, and neuroprotection.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA): moving towards a new paradigm [^9dc00c81]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Although metformin has been used for over 60years, the balance between the drug's beneficial and adverse effects is still subject to debate. Following an analysis of how cases of so-called "metformin-associated lactic acidosis" (MALA) are reported in the literature, the present article reviews the pitfalls to be avoided when assessing the purported association between metformin and lactic acidosis. By starting from pathophysiological considerations, we propose a new paradigm for lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Metformin therapy does not necessarily induce metformin accumulation, just as metformin accumulation does not necessarily induce hyperlactatemia, and hyperlactatemia does not necessarily induce lactic acidosis. In contrast to the conventional view, MALA probably accounts for a smaller proportion of cases than either metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis or metformin-induced lactic acidosis. Lastly, this review highlights the need for substantial improvements in the reporting of cases of lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Accordingly, we propose a check-list as a guide to clinical practice.

Metformin in T2DM — effect sizes, role, and cautions: In a UKPDS substudy, "metformin, compared with conventional therapy (i.e., lifestyle modifications alone), resulted in a 32% reduction in microvascular and macrovascular diabetes-related outcomes, a 39% reduction in MI, and a 36% reduction in all-cause mortality rate". A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis "supported the use of metformin as first-line therapy for T2DM" due to benefits in HbA1c, weight, and ASCVD outcomes; however, "a separate systematic review found no evidence of reduced CVD events or CVD deaths with metformin". Safety notes include that "Metformin carries a small risk of lactic acidosis and must be used with caution in patients with CKD", and for initial management "clinicians can consider a trial of lifestyle therapies for 3 to 6 months before reconsideration of metformin" in younger or mildly elevated HbA1c cases.

Metformin-containing medicines are available by prescription only and are used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin helps control blood sugar in a number of ways. These include helping the body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally, decreasing the amount of sugar the liver makes, and decreasing the amount of sugar the intestines absorb from food. Metformin-containing medicines are available as single-ingredient products and also in combination with other drugs used to treat diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Metformin to prevent anthracycline Cardiotoxicity? that would Be sweet! [^a81eb400]. JACC: CardioOncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the groups were balanced in measured risk factors at baseline, it is possible that metformin may have been avoided in people with a history of contraindication in the past that was not captured in the baseline demographics or those perceived by clinicians to be at higher risk for a future contraindication. The most common reason for avoidance of metformin is renal failure, but baseline creatinine levels were similar in the 2 groups in the matched sample (0.86 mg/d, standardized difference = 0.08) as were age and sex, making it unlikely that the renal function was systematically different at baseline. It is possible that those patients unexposed to metformin may have had resolved acute kidney injury in the past leading to its avoidance. The study excluded patients with a known prior history of HF, but it is possible that metformin may have been avoided in patients with an unrecognized history of HF or cardiac dysfunction (eg, if treated with recovery outside the institution). More broadly, metformin intolerance (most commonly caused by gastrointestinal symptoms) may be a marker of patients who are more likely to be frail and therefore at higher risk of HF and death than patients who were not on metformin therapy. The healthy user effectwherein healthier people are more likely to start medications than those with comorbidities is well-documented in several other settings. If such systematic differences existed within this group, they may explain the lower risk of HF and death associated with metformin.

Nonetheless, the results of the study are intriguing, suggesting a large benefit (HR: 0.35–0.44) for metformin in reducing the incidence of HF in patients with DM treated with anthracyclines. These findings will need to be confirmed with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) before these data can be incorporated clinically. Recently, Serageldin et alreported an RCT of 70 women without DM who were treated for breast cancer in the adjuvant setting with 240 mg/m² of doxorubicin and who were randomized to metformin (1,700 mg/d) or control. The baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was similar in both groups, whereas the left ventricular ejection fraction at treatment end was minimally numerically higher in the metformin arm, although statistically significant (65.9% vs 62.2%; P = 0.0007).

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^a2f0c359]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity — metformin use and effectiveness: Metformin dosing is described as immediate- or extended-release with a recommended starting dose of 500 mg, once or twice daily, with gradual increases up to a maximum total daily dose of 2500 mg; adverse effects are dose-dependent (bloating, nausea, flatulence, diarrhea) and lactic acidosis is a serious but very rare pediatric complication. Metformin has not been approved as a weight-loss drug, and in adults with obesity showed modest (< 5%, or 1 BMI unit) weight reduction when used as an adjunct to lifestyle with effectiveness inconsistent across populations; pediatric effectiveness is similarly conflicting. In a randomized study of 39 teens 13 to 18 years of age in a lifestyle program, metformin hydrochloride XR 2000 mg or placebo once daily for 48 weeks led to approximately 1 kg/m² BMI reduction among adolescents taking metformin compared with a slight BMI increase in the lifestyle-only group. Another randomized study of 100 children 6 to 12 years of age with severe obesity (mean BMI 34.6 kg/m²) showed approximately 1 kg/m² BMI reduction at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily for 6 months, with gastrointestinal symptoms limiting the tolerated maximum dose in nearly 20% and no additional BMI reduction beyond 6 months. Across 16 metformin studies meeting inclusion, about two-thirds showed modest BMI reduction and one-third showed no benefit; given the modest and inconsistent effectiveness, metformin may be considered as an adjunct to intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment and when other indications for metformin are present.

### Metformin revisited: re-evaluation of its properties and role in the pharmacopoeia of modern antidiabetic agents [^9ebfffb8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The usefulness of metformin as an oral antidiabetic agent is widely accepted. However, several other classes of oral antidiabetic agents have been recently introduced, raising the need to evaluate the role of metformin as initial therapy and in combination with these newer drugs for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).

Methods

Synthesis of information was preceded by a comprehensive review of the English language literature using Medline. We also reviewed bibliographies of relevant articles. The studies most pertinent to the mechanism of action, efficacy, toxicity and administration of metformin were selected for citation in this review.

Results

Metformin acts by increasing tissue sensitivity to insulin, principally in the liver. Beneficial properties of metformin include weight reduction, favourable effects on the lipid profile and the fibrinolytic pathway, and improvement of ovarian function in some insulin-resistant women. It does not cause hyperinsulinaemia or hypoglycaemia. Metformin is effective as monotherapy and, in combination with both insulin secretagogues and thiazolidinediones (TZDs), may obviate the need for insulin treatment. Several fixed-dose combination pills containing metformin and other agents are available. A protocol for the initiation of therapy with contemporary oral agents for type 2 DM is presented, with emphasis on the continuing central role of metformin.

Conclusions

Metformin remains a safe and effective agent for the therapy of patients with type 2 DM. It is useful as monotherapy or in combination regimens with the newer insulin secretagogues, TZDs or insulin. It is still in most circumstances the agent of choice for initial therapy of the typical obese patient with type 2 DM and mild to moderate hyperglycaemia.

Gastrointestinal Reactions

The incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain) in the initial therapy trial are summarized in Table 7. Across all glyburide and metformin trials, GI symptoms were the most common adverse events with glyburide and metformin and were more frequent at higher dose levels. In controlled trials, < 2% of patients discontinued glyburide and metformin therapy due to GI adverse events.

In postmarketing reports cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis may occur rarely which may progress to liver failure; glyburide and metformin should be discontinued if this occurs.

### Metformin: from mechanisms of action to therapies [^9f26f3e2]. Cell Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Metformin is currently the first-line drug treatment for type 2 diabetes. Besides its glucose-lowering effect, there is interest in actions of the drug of potential relevance to cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of action remain elusive. Convincing data place energy metabolism at the center of metformin's mechanism of action in diabetes and may also be of importance in cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Metformin-induced activation of the energy-sensor AMPK is well documented, but may not account for all actions of the drug. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the different AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms underlying metformin action.

Intestinal effects

Metformin has an oral availability of about 60% and is shown to accumulate in the small intestine, as well as the liver and kidney, due to the expression of the OCT1, OCT3, and PMAT transporters in these tissues. Thus, several studies have described an intestinal mechanism for metformin's glucose-lowering effects and the gastrointestinal side effects that are observed in some patients. Importantly, observational studies have reported intestinal side effects in as low as 16% and as high as 62% of patients, leading to metformin intolerance in ~5% of patients

In recent years, the clinical benefits of metformin have been linked to alterations in gut microbiome composition, intestinal glucose uptake, and hormone (eg, growth differentiation factor 15 [GDF15], glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1]) secretion. Several groups have reported significant metformin-induced shifts in microbiome composition in T2D patients treated with metformin compared with placebo; however, it is unclear whether these changes to the gut microbiota are responsible for the glucose-lowering effects of metformin or secondary in nature. In support of a causal role for metformin-induced changes being responsible for metformin's glucose-lowering effects, germ-free mice were given a fecal transplant from patients before or after metformin treatment, which improved glucose tolerance in mice receiving the post-metformin fecal transplant. However, these studies need to be replicated in humans to establish the clinical relevance of this mechanism.
