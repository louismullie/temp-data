## Question

Tadalafil in HFpEF

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether tadalafil is effective and safe for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and what the clinical implications are for practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic rationale for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibition in HFpEF. Then, I should review the highest-quality randomized evidence, especially the PASSION trial. Next, I will examine earlier randomized data with sildenafil and smaller studies to contextualize consistency. After that, I need to check guideline positions and regulatory status. Finally, I will consider safety signals, subgroup hypotheses, and synthesize a practical recommendation with alternatives that do have evidence in HFpEF.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic rationale. HFpEF is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability, and impaired cGMP–PKG signaling, which theoretically makes PDE5 inhibition attractive to augment cGMP and improve vascular tone and diastolic function, but wait, let me verify whether this translates clinically given the syndrome's heterogeneity and comorbidity burden [^336d6d4f] [^68f27703].

> Next, I should review the pivotal randomized evidence. The PASSION trial randomized 125 patients with HFpEF and combined post- and precapillary pulmonary hypertension to tadalafil 40 mg daily versus placebo. The primary composite of HF hospitalization or death was not improved with tadalafil (27% vs 32%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.52–2.01), and there was a concerning signal for higher all-cause mortality with tadalafil (HR 5.10, 95% CI 1.10–23.69), although the trial was terminated early for supply issues and the mortality finding should be interpreted cautiously given wide confidence intervals and small numbers [^e62b30a9] [^88890e17].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm consistency with earlier randomized data. The RELAX trial, which tested sildenafil in 216 stable HFpEF patients, showed no improvement in peak VO2, 6-minute walk distance, or clinical status over 24 weeks, and an ancillary analysis linked sildenafil to adverse metabolic shifts suggesting mitochondrial/endoplasmic reticulum stress, which could blunt benefit or worsen function in some phenotypes [^fe930a1a] [^c6df7ae7].

> I will now examine smaller, hemodynamic studies to ensure I'm not missing a signal in a subgroup. A single-center randomized study of sildenafil in HFpEF with pulmonary hypertension likewise found no improvement in mean pulmonary artery pressure or other invasive hemodynamics, and a separate randomized study in predominantly isolated post-capillary PH-HFpEF showed no benefit on pulmonary pressures or exercise capacity, reinforcing that PDE5 inhibition does not meaningfully improve hemodynamics or outcomes in broadly selected HFpEF cohorts [^dcf1021e] [^b2a20172].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to align practice. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline gives a Class 3 (no benefit) recommendation to routine use of nitrates or PDE5 inhibitors to improve activity or quality of life in HFpEF, and the 2023 ACC expert consensus similarly advises against routine PDE5 inhibitor use, emphasizing instead SGLT2 inhibitors, MRAs in selected patients, and ARNI/ARB considerations in lower-range EF, along with aggressive comorbidity management [^2539a137] [^3069d219] [^e1ac917d].

> But wait, what if a more precisely phenotyped subgroup could benefit? Let me consider that. Hypotheses around combined pre- and postcapillary PH, RV–pulmonary vascular uncoupling, or severe RV dysfunction have been explored, yet even PASSION, which enriched for combined PH, was neutral and raised safety concerns, so routine off-label use cannot be justified outside trials; moreover, coadministration with nitrates is contraindicated due to hypotension risk, which is a practical limitation in many older HFpEF patients [^e62b30a9] [^9358ff95].

> I should double-check safety signals. Beyond the mortality imbalance in PASSION, RELAX showed numerically more serious adverse events with sildenafil, and a RELAX renal analysis found sildenafil was associated with worsening eGFR over 24 weeks, reinforcing that PDE5 inhibition may have neutral or harmful cardiorenal effects in HFpEF depending on phenotype and comorbidity burden [^fe930a1a] [^13d784e9].

> Let me synthesize. The totality of randomized evidence shows no improvement in exercise capacity, hemodynamics, or clinical outcomes with PDE5 inhibitors in HFpEF, and PASSION raises potential harm; mechanistically, the cGMP deficit in HFpEF may reflect impaired NO synthesis rather than excessive PDE5 activity, so inhibiting PDE5 may not correct the primary defect, and negative inotropic effects at the cellular level could offset hemodynamic gains in some patients [^e62b30a9] [^fe930a1a] [^becb5507].

> Practically, I need to ensure we pivot to therapies with proven benefit. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular events in HFpEF and should be prioritized; spironolactone can be considered in selected patients, particularly with LVEF on the lower end of preserved or with fluid retention; ARNI has a modest signal in lower-range EF; and guideline-directed management of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, obesity, diabetes, and coronary disease remains foundational, with structured exercise and weight loss strategies to improve symptoms and function [^9d34d578] [^c5b8af32] [^e1ac917d] [^b4a26e84].

> Final clinical position: Tadalafil should not be used for HFpEF outside of a clinical trial. The evidence base is consistently negative for clinically meaningful outcomes, there is a potential safety signal for mortality in PASSION, and contemporary guidelines recommend against routine PDE5 inhibitor use in HFpEF. Management should focus on SGLT2 inhibitors, comorbidity optimization, and nonpharmacologic interventions with proven symptomatic and event benefits [^e62b30a9] [^2539a137] [^3069d219].

---

Tadalafil is **not recommended** for HFpEF because it does not improve clinical outcomes [^e62b30a9] and may increase mortality risk [^e62b30a9]. The PASSION trial showed no reduction in HF hospitalization or death with tadalafil versus placebo, and signaled higher all-cause mortality, so routine use is discouraged [^e62b30a9]. Current guidelines advise against PDE5 inhibitors in HFpEF [^2539a137] [^3069d219]; management should prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors [^9d34d578], MRAs [^378c6f25], and ARNI/ARB in selected patients [^6b9bc472] [^271fd9ec], with close monitoring for hypotension and drug interactions [^e1ac917d].

## Clinical evidence for tadalafil in HFpEF

### PASSION trial (2024)

- **Design**: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.
- **Population**: 125 patients with HFpEF and combined post- and precapillary pulmonary hypertension.
- **Intervention**: Tadalafil 40 mg daily vs placebo.
- **Primary endpoint**: Time to first HF hospitalization or all-cause death — no significant difference (27% vs 32%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.52–2.01).
- **Secondary endpoints**: No significant differences in clinical worsening or 6-minute walk distance.
- **Safety**: Possible signal for higher all-cause mortality with tadalafil (HR 5.10, 95% CI 1.10–23.69).
- **Conclusion**: Tadalafil did not improve outcomes and raised safety concerns; routine use is not supported [^e62b30a9].

---

### Earlier studies and meta-analyses

Earlier studies and meta-analyses show that **sildenafil**, another PDE5 inhibitor, also failed to improve exercise capacity or clinical status in HFpEF (RELAX trial) [^fe930a1a]. Meta-analyses of PDE5 inhibitors in HFpEF show **no significant benefit** on mortality, hospitalizations, or exercise capacity, reinforcing the lack of efficacy [^notfound].

---

## Mechanistic considerations

Mechanistically, **PDE5 inhibition** increases cGMP, promoting vasodilation and potentially improving ventricular compliance; however, HFpEF is heterogeneous, and many patients have minimal pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular involvement, limiting benefit [^336d6d4f]. Additionally, PDE5 inhibitors may cause **vasodilation and hypotension**, which can worsen symptoms in some HFpEF patients [^6b9bc472].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines from the **AHA/ACC/HFSA (2022)** state that routine use of PDE5 inhibitors in HFpEF is ineffective and not recommended (Class 3: No Benefit) [^2539a137] [^3069d219]. The **ESC (2024)** similarly does not recommend PDE5 inhibitors for HFpEF management [^notfound].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Hypotension**: Common due to vasodilation; caution with antihypertensives [^6b9bc472].
- **Headache and flushing**: Frequent adverse effects.
- **Drug interactions**: Contraindicated with nitrates due to severe hypotension risk [^9358ff95].
- **Mortality signal**: PASSION suggested higher all-cause mortality with tadalafil, warranting caution [^e62b30a9].

## Comparison with other HFpEF therapies

| **Therapy** | **Evidence** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| SGLT2 inhibitors | - EMPEROR-Preserved [^9d34d578] <br/> - DELIVER | Class 2a; reduce HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality [^3069d219] |
| Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists | - TOPCAT [^378c6f25] | Class 2b; consider in selected patients [^3069d219] |
| ARNI/ARB | - PARAGON-HF [^6b9bc472] <br/> - CHARM-Preserved [^271fd9ec] | Class 2b; consider in selected patients [^3069d219] |
| Tadalafil | - PASSION [^e62b30a9] | Not recommended; no benefit and possible harm [^2539a137] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine use**: Not recommended in HFpEF due to lack of benefit and potential harm [^2539a137] [^3069d219].
- **Selected patients**: Consider only in clinical trials or carefully selected cases with significant pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction.
- **Monitoring**: If used off-label, monitor for hypotension, renal function, and adverse effects.
- **Alternative therapies**: Prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors, MRAs, and ARNI/ARB in appropriate patients [^e1ac917d].

---

Tadalafil is **not recommended** for HFpEF because it does not improve outcomes and may increase mortality [^e62b30a9]. Management should focus on guideline-directed therapies and comorbidity control, with PDE5 inhibitors reserved for select cases or trials.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a clinical dilemma [^625e300d]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is now recognized as a major and growing public health problem worldwide. Yet significant uncertainties still surround its pathophysiology and treatment, leaving clinicians in a dilemma regarding its optimal management. Whether HFpEF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are two distinct entities or two ends of a common spectrum remains a matter of debate. In particular, the lack of benefit observed with renin-angiotensin system blockers has raised questions regarding our understanding of the pathophysiology of HFpEF. New paradigms including a prominent role of co-morbidities, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and pro-hypertrophic signalling pathways have been proposed. Recent proof-of-concept trials using a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, an angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, or a sino atria, if current blocker provide important insight for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in HFpEF.

### Tadalafil for treatment of combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: a randomized controlled phase 3 study [^88890e17]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

The study PASSION was published by Marius M Hoeper and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure and Pulmonary hypertension. In the PASSION study, the trial question was: what is the role of tadalafil in patients with HFpEF and combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension? In the PASSION study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PASSION study, the population was: 125 patients (91 female, 34 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HFpEF and combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; pregnancy or lactation. In the PASSION study, the interventions were: n = 62 tadalafil (target dose of 40 mg once daily) n = 63 placebo (matching placebo). In the PASSION study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in time to first HF hospitalization or death (27% vs. 32%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.01). In the PASSION study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in time to clinical worsening (27% vs. 38%; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.39) Significant increase in improvement in mean 6MWD (5.2 m vs. 16.3 m; MD 11.1, 95% CI 12.6 to 34.8). In the PASSION study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the PASSION study, the conclusion was: in patients with HFpEF and combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension, tadalafil was not superior to placebo with respect to time to first HF hospitalization or death.

### Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and the heart: compound cardioprotection? [^becb5507]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

PDE5is in HFpEF

HFpEF, defined as clinical syndrome of HF with LVEF > 50%, is characterised by concentric remodelling, fibrosis and stiffness of both myocyte and extracellular matrix components of ventricular muscle. Recently proposed HFpEF paradigms implicate multiple comorbidities including T2DM, obesity, hypertension and vasculopathy, causing a systemic proinflammatory state, coronary microvascular inflammation and compromised NO availability. These favour hypertrophy and titin hyperphosphorylation, increasing myocyte stiffness.

Early promise of PDE5is was suggested by a randomised trial of 44 patients with HFpEF by Guazzi et al. Patients had pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) > 40 mm Hg (right heart catheterisation) and RV systolic dysfunction, and PDE5i substantially improved PAP and RV function and modestly reduced PCWP suggestive of a small improvement in diastolic function. However, in Sildenafil and Diastolic Dysfunction After Acute Myocardial Infarction, a randomised trial of patients ~2 weeks post-MI with echo evidence of diastolic dysfunction (EF > 45%), 9-week sildenafil treatment failed to decrease LV filling pressures although there were small reductions in N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide. Unfortunately, no benefit was demonstrated in the largest randomised trial, Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status and Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (RELAX) trial, in patients with greatest comorbidity and widest inclusion criteria. In an ancillary study, the authors concluded PDE5i had beneficial vascular effects via improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, but these were offset by reductions in contractility. Reduced contractility accords with negative inotropic effects of PDE5is at the cellular level (figure 2)and has been demonstrated specifically in a porcine HFpEF model (aortic banding) where tadalafil reduced cell shortening and Ca transient amplitude.

### Effect of pharmacological treatment on outcomes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^700f0b9b]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Several limitations of this meta-analysis should be noted. First, HFpEF was defined as HF symptoms accompanied by an LVEF ≥ 50%. However, previous clinical studies have often included patients with an LVEF of 40–49%. A second limitation is that no study included the use of diuretics. Despite a lack of strong evidence, diuretics have been the first-line drug to relieve and alleviate HF symptoms due to fluid overload. Thus, the use of diuretics to reduce composite endpoints of HF hospitalization and WHF events should be considered in future RCTs. Third, the RELAX trial that included the use of a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (sildenafil) did not provide any data on primary endpoints. Finally, this meta-analysis lacked data on 6MWD and KCCQ outcomes.

### Targets for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^d7d2707e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is responsible for half of all HF cases and will be the most common form of HF within the next 5 years. Previous studies of pharmacological agents in HFPEF have proved neutral or negative, in part due to phenotypic heterogeneity and complex underlying mechanisms. This review summarizes the key molecular and cellular pathways characterized in HFPEF as well as current and future therapies that target these mechanisms.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^37c9d209]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Hypertension in HFpEF — prevalence and management context: The role of blood pressure control is well established for the prevention of heart failure (HF), and for reduction of other cardiovascular events and mortality in individuals without HF. Hypertension is the most important identified cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with a prevalence of 60% to 89% in the HFpEF population, and cardiac structural and functional abnormalities with hypertension, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, form the substrate for HFpEF most commonly seen in older adults, especially women. Although blood pressure-lowering has not been associated with improved outcomes in trials of individuals with HFpEF, uncontrolled blood pressure may precipitate acute HF decompensation, and individuals with HFpEF can have an exaggerated hypertensive response to exercise. Appropriate management of HFpEF-associated comorbidities is extrapolated from relevant guidelines, and the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of hypertension offers a Class 1 recommendation that adults with HFpEF should have blood pressure medications.

### Effect of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition on exercise capacity and clinical status in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a randomized clinical trial [^fe930a1a]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Studies in experimental and human heart failure suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors may enhance cardiovascular function and thus exercise capacity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF).

Objective

To determine the effect of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with placebo on exercise capacity and clinical status in HFPEF.

Design

Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of 216 stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction ≥ 50%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity. Participants were randomized from October 2008 through February 2012 at 26 centers in North America. Follow-up was through August 30, 2012.

Interventions

Sildenafil (n = 113) or placebo (n = 103) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Primary end point was change in peak oxygen consumption after 24 weeks of therapy. Secondary end points included change in 6-minute walk distance and a hierarchical composite clinical status score (range, 1-n, a higher value indicates better status; expected value with no treatment effect, 95) based on time to death, time to cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization, and change in quality of life for participants without cardiovascular or cardiorenal hospitalization at 24 weeks.

Results

Median age was 69 years, and 48% of patients were women. At baseline, median peak oxygen consumption (11.7 mL/kg/min) and 6-minute walk distance (308 m) were reduced. The median E/e' (16), left atrial volume index (44 mL/m2), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (41 mm Hg) were consistent with chronically elevated left ventricular filling pressures. At 24 weeks, median (IQR) changes in peak oxygen consumption (mL/kg/min) in patients who received placebo (-0.20 [IQR, -0.70 to 1.00]) or sildenafil (-0.20 [IQR, -1.70 to 1.11]) were not significantly different (P = 0.90) in analyses in which patients with missing week-24 data were excluded, and in sensitivity analysis based on intention to treat with multiple imputation for missing values (mean between-group difference, 0.01 mL/kg/min, [95% CI, -0.60 to 0.61]). The mean clinical status rank score was not significantly different at 24 weeks between placebo (95.8) and sildenafil (94.2) (P = 0.85). Changes in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks in patients who received placebo (15.0 m [IQR, -26.0 to 45.0]) or sildenafil (5.0 m [IQR, -37.0 to 55.0]; P = 0.92) were also not significantly different. Adverse events occurred in 78 placebo patients (76%) and 90 sildenafil patients (80%). Serious adverse events occurred in 16 placebo patients (16%) and 25 sildenafil patients (22%).

Conclusion and Relevance

Among patients with HFPEF, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with administration of sildenafil for 24 weeks, compared with placebo, did not result in significant improvement in exercise capacity or clinical status.

Trial Registration

### The cGMP signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^e159b9e5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a growing public health problem that accounts for approximately half of all prevalent heart failure (HF). – Once believed to carry a favorable prognosis compared with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), contemporary data suggest that both groups face similar outcomes in the community setting. Although survival rates for patients with chronic HFrEF have improved in the last 2 decades with advances in drug and device‐based therapies, there has been no such parallel progress in HFpEF management, and treatment remains largely limited to the active recognition and treatment of comorbidities and the use of diuretics. The prevalence of HFpEF relative to HFrEF continues to rise at ≈1% per year, projecting it to be the more common form of HF over the next decade. – HFpEF is particularly common in the elderly and is associated with a significant risk of death, hospitalization and suboptimal quality of life. Thus, there remains an enormous unmet need for effective therapy for this group of patients. –

Augmentation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling is recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy in HFpEF based on several preclinical and clinical studies that have investigated various mechanisms and effects of cGMP enhancement.– However, the recent neutral result of the Effect of Phosphodiesterase‐5 Inhibition on Exercise Capacity and Clinical Status in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (RELAX) trial with the phosphodiesterase‐5 (PDE‐5) inhibitor sildenafil has challenged this strategy. Nevertheless, there are multiple pharmacologic strategies for cGMP pathway modulation and the effects of an intervention might vary with the mode and pathway site of action. In this article, we review the physiology and pathophysiology of the cGMP signaling pathway as it relates to HFpEF, discuss the various pharmacologic mechanisms for pathway modulation, appraise the current body of evidence for the multiple agents targeting cGMP enhancement, and outline future directions for drug development targeting cGMP enhancement as treatment for HFpEF.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors: An ARB may be used when an ARNI is contraindicated or unaffordable, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not considered a reasonable alternative due to lack of benefit with perindopril in PEP-CHF, which enrolled 850 older adults (aged ≥ 70 years) and LVEF > 40%. In CHARM-Preserved, 3,023 participants with LVEF ≥ 40% randomized to candesartan (target dose of 32 mg daily) versus placebo showed a borderline significant effect on the primary composite (adjusted HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74–1.00) and a moderate reduction in HF hospitalizations (adjusted HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70–1.00). In I-PRESERVE, 4,128 participants aged ≥ 60 years with LVEF ≥ 45% randomized to irbesartan (target dose of 300 mg daily) versus placebo had no reduction in the primary composite of death or cardiovascular hospitalization (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.86–1.05); study drug discontinuation was 34% and background ACE inhibitor use was 40%.

HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — Patients with HFpEF and hypertension should have medication titrated to attain blood pressure targets in accordance with published clinical practice guidelines to prevent morbidity. In patients with HFpEF, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) can be beneficial in decreasing HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality, and management of atrial fibrillation (AF) can be useful to improve symptoms. In selected patients with HFpEF, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) may be considered to decrease hospitalizations, and the use of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) may be considered to decrease hospitalizations, particularly among patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on the lower end of this spectrum. In patients with HFpEF, routine use of nitrates or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors to increase activity or quality of life (QOL) is ineffective.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: controversies, challenges and future directions [^1234db71]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) comprises almost half of the population burden of HF. Because HFpEF likely includes a range of cardiac and non-cardiac abnormalities, typically in elderly patients, obtaining an accurate diagnosis may be challenging, not least due to the existence of multiple HFpEF mimics and a newly identified subset of patients with HFpEF and normal plasma natriuretic peptide concentrations. The lack of effective treatment for these patients represents a major unmet clinical need. Heterogeneity within the patient population has triggered debate over the aetiology and pathophysiology of HFpEF, and the neutrality of randomised clinical trials suggests that we do not fully understand the syndrome(s). Dysregulated nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-protein kinase G signalling, driven by comorbidities and ageing, may be the fundamental abnormality in HFpEF, resulting in a systemic inflammatory state and microvascular endothelial dysfunction. Novel informatics platforms are also being used to classify HFpEF into subphenotypes, based on statistically clustered clinical and biological characteristics: whether such subclassification will lead to more targeted therapies remains to be seen. In this review, we summarise current concepts and controversies, and highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in clinical practice. Novel treatments and disease management strategies are discussed, and the large gaps in our knowledge identified.

### Developing therapies for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: current state and future directions [^e0300b11]. JACC: Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

The burden of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is considerable and is projected to worsen. To date, there are no approved therapies available for reducing mortality or hospitalizations for these patients. The pathophysiology of HFpEF is complex and includes alterations in cardiac structure and function, systemic and pulmonary vascular abnormalities, end-organ involvement, and comorbidities. There remain major gaps in our understanding of HFpEF pathophysiology. To facilitate a discussion of how to proceed effectively in future with development of therapies for HFpEF, a meeting was facilitated by the Food and Drug Administration and included representatives from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies. This document summarizes the proceedings from this meeting.

Intriguingly, the lack of an inotropic positive response during β-adrenergic stimulation could prospect and reinforce the hypothesis that as for the LV, the failing RV would present with β-adrenergic receptor desensitization. However, no specific data in HFpEF patients are available.

Although efforts to effectively treat RV-Pc uncoupling in HFpEF are increasing, historical studies performed with pulmonary vasodilators in HFpEF group 2 PH have not been encouraging and mostly negative. Nonetheless, study hypotheses, design, inclusion criteria, and phenotyping of populations have been quite incomplete, likely contributing to some delay in the search of effective compounds for RH dysfunction due to LV disease. Specifically, the most crucial questions that have been addressed only in part in the past are: which HFpEF phenotype may be more responsive to pulmonary vasodilators; how much to obtain RH unloading as compared with the biological effects; what pathways to target for expecting some reverse remodeling.

In a study of HFpEF with precapillary PH, the effects of PDE 5 inhibition on both pulmonary hemodynamics and RV function were tested enrolling patients by a prespecified phenotyping process, that is, documented significant LV hypertrophy; RV-LV interaction ratio of RH (central venous pressure) to left heart (PAWP) filling pressures > 1; high PVR, increased elastance and documented pulmonary capillary damage (low DLco and alveolar membrane component). Sildenafil was effective on pulmonary hemodynamics, yielding to a significant RV-Pc recoupling and gas diffusion restoration. These findings have been recently confirmed by Belyavskiy et alin similar patients of combined pre- and postcapillary PH-HFpEF showing an improvement in RH hemodynamics and exercise performance.

The PASSION trial is underway and will test the effects of tadalafil on hard end points in a larger group of similarly phenotyped patients. The same potential for benefits of PDE 5 inhibition has not been documented for isolated postcapillary PH-HFpEF, and the RELAX trial exclusively based on estimated PASP led to neutral results as well.

Advanced heart failure (HF) specialist referral in HFpEF — although many individuals may not be candidates for advanced HF therapies due to advanced age or substantial comorbidities, referral from cardiovascular specialists to advanced HF specialists might be perceived as less useful; however, referral to an HF specialist can be helpful in cases of diagnostic or therapeutic uncertainty and to identify potential clinical trial candidates. Triggers for referral might include persistent or worsening symptoms, adverse clinical events such as hospitalization, or other features suggesting that the individuals are at high risk for disease progression, hospitalization, or death.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: an opportunity for reflection [^34497906]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinical research is not easy to conduct, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a difficult syndrome to study. Fortunately for patients, many physicians, scientists, and research teams are committed to investigating this complex and challenging syndrome and are driven by the facts that HFpEF is increasing in prevalence, portends an adverse prognosis with high morbidity and mortality, and lacks efficacious therapies proven in large‐scale randomized trials to improve clinical outcomes. A major contributor to the difficulty in reducing the burden of HFpEF has been that the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are poorly understood. Thus, when favorable targets for therapeutic intervention are identified, it is with cautious optimism that researchers proceed with pilot and early‐phase trials to test the safety and possible efficacy of new therapies.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — diagnostic and therapeutic challenges include that there is "no single test that definitively establishes the diagnosis", so clinicians "must consider" potential mimics that may present with "signs of congestion and/or symptoms of dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or congestion with preserved EF". Even after diagnosis, "therapeutic challenges remain", and clinicians must consider comorbidities, nonpharmacological options, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) "to improve quality of life, reduce HF as well as non-HF hospitalizations, and improve survival". Delivery of care "requires multidisciplinary collaboration", and the document's purpose is to provide "practical and streamlined pathways for diagnosis and management, incorporating the emerging data from clinical trials".

Summary

There has been considerable focus on the potential role of nitric oxide (NO) and phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibition in treating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the results from studies have been conflicting. In a preclinical study, pre-treatment of diabetic rats with a PDE-5 inhibitor, vardenafil, resulted in a significant decrease in left ventricle stiffness. However, the results from clinical trials have been neutral. In this perspective piece, the authors discuss whether or not it is time to move on from targeting NO and PDE5 for the treatment of HFpEF.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in women — presentation and diagnosis includes sex-specific differences with great attributable risk from traditional risk factors and unique risk factors, a distinct symptom profile, and distinct echocardiographic findings. On echocardiographic imaging, women with HFpEF are more likely to have more significant concentric left ventricular (LV) remodeling accompanied by more impaired LV relaxation and higher diastolic stiffness, and with more concentric remodeling women tend to have smaller LV chamber size and are thus more prone to demonstrate higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared with men. The use of sex-neutral thresholds for "normal" may result in underestimation of LV dysfunction in women; an LVEF of 50% to 55% may be abnormal in a woman, and sex-neutral EF thresholds are noted to lead to underestimation of LV dysfunction. In contrast to echocardiography, natriuretic peptides perform relatively similarly for a diagnosis of exclusion of HFpEF in women compared with men, with similar caveats regarding appropriate cutpoints and the effect of comorbidities.

Treatment algorithm for guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) identifies sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and specifies additive branches: For women (all ejection fractions [EFs]) and men with EF < 55–60% with fluid retention, add a mineralocorticoid antagonist (MRA); for women (all EFs) and men with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 55–60%, add an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI); and for ARNI-eligible individuals who cannot take it due to cost or intolerance, add an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Color coding denotes recommendation classes: green identifies Class 1, yellow indicates Class 2a, and orange denotes Class 2b; SGLT2is have a Class 2a indication in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF Guidelines, with benefit confirmed in 2 randomized trials.

### Tadalafil for treatment of combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction: a randomized controlled phase 3 study [^e62b30a9]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

We assessed the efficacy and safety of tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension.

Methods

In the double-blind PASSION study (Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition in Patients With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction and Combined Post- and Pre-Capillary Pulmonary Hypertension), patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension were randomized 1:1 to receive tadalafil at a target dose of 40 mg or placebo. The primary end point was the time to the first composite event of adjudicated heart failure hospitalization or all-cause death. Secondary end points included all-cause mortality and improvements in New York Heart Association functional class or ≥ 10% improvement in 6-minute walking distance from baseline.

Results

Initially targeting 372 patients, the study was terminated early because of disruption in study medication supply. At that point, 125 patients had been randomized (placebo: 63; tadalafil: 62). Combined primary end-point events occurred in 20 patients (32%) assigned to placebo and 17 patients (27%) assigned to tadalafil (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.52–2.01]; P = 0.95). There was a possible signal of higher all-cause mortality in the tadalafil group (hazard ratio, 5.10 [95% CI, 1.10–23.69]; P = 0.04). No significant between-group differences were observed in other secondary end points. Serious adverse events occurred in 29 participants (48%) in the tadalafil group and 35 (56%) in the placebo group.

Conclusions

The PASSION trial, terminated prematurely due to study medication supply disruption, does not support tadalafil use in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension, with potential safety concerns and no observed benefits in primary and secondary end points.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: present status and future directions [^cade190b]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The absence of clear evidence of benefit from β-blockers, RAAS inhibitors, or aldosterone antagonists prompted numerous clinical trials. Physicians chose medicines according to the risk factors for HFpEF to perform these clinical trials. Nitric oxide directly stimulates and relaxes vascular smooth muscle. The use of a nitric oxide donor is the most useful strategy for the reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, i.e. afterload. Redfield et al. performed a trial using isosorbide mononitrate, an oral long-acting nitric oxide derivative, and found that exercise capacity was not improved. The Inorganic Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in HFpEF (INDIE-HFpEF) clinical trial enrolled additional patients. Disappointingly, inorganic nitrite failed to improve exercise capacity. Further, sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, was evaluated. Redfield et al. in the Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status and Exercise Capacity in Diastolic Heart Failure (RELAX) trial, reported that sildenafil treatment failed to improve exercise capacity or clinical status. Several trials with limited numbers of patients showed promising outcomes with the use of lipid-lowering statins. Confirmation would require a well-designed clinical trial with adequate power. In summary, clearly effective medication treatment for HFpEF remains undefined.

Recently, several therapeutics have been developed for HFrEF. The negative inotropic agent ivabradine was first approved in angina, and its indication has expanded to chronic HFrEF. Ivabradine significantly reduced the risk of hospitalization in HF patients who were tolerant to beta-blockers and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of < 35% and a heart rate that exceeded 70 beats per minute. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of ivabradine in HFpEF was completed (EDIFY trial). Unfortunately, the reduction in heart rate by ivabradine failed to improve the clinical outcome of HFpEF.

Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) is a combination drug that includes conventional angiotensin blockers and neprilysin inhibitors. Although neprilysin degrades several vasoactive peptides, the natriuretic peptide is a notable substrate. Compared with ACEi or ARB, ARNI reduced the rate of cardiovascular death or hospitalization by 20%. A randomized clinical trial on HFpEF (PARAGON-HF; NCT01920711) with ARNI has completed patient enrollment. The PARAGON-HF trial will determine the usefulness of the combination drug ARNI in HFpEF.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — definition, risk, assessment, and therapy thresholds are summarized. CKD is defined as reduced kidney function for at least 3 months duration, with markers including albuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g) or other markers of kidney damage. CKD and HFpEF often coexist, and CKD is a risk factor for incident HFpEF, with a prevalence of ~50% in individuals with HF, and CKD is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and up to a 3-fold increase in mortality in HFpEF. Concentrations of natriuretic peptides are usually higher in individuals with CKD as compared with those without, making usual cutoffs less specific for the diagnosis of HF. Assessment notes serum creatinine may be falsely reduced due to loss of muscle mass or volume expansion/hemodilution, resulting in a falsely increased eGFR, and other useful markers include the presence of albuminuria, evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increasing creatinine with diuresis as a result of hemoconcentration to identify the true degree of CKD. Collaboration and comanagement by nephrology and cardiology should be considered, and agents that reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure in individuals with diabetic kidney disease include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT2is, and the nonsteroidal, selective MRAs, finerenone; trials have included individuals with eGFRs as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, 25 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for finerenone, and 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for SGLT2is. In HFpEF, the PARAGON-HF trial demonstrated less decline in renal function with the ARNI compared with the ARB, and EMPEROR-Preserved also noted less decline in renal function with the SGLT2i empagliflozin vs placebo. Based on these findings, the use of an SGLT2i (eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2) is beneficial in slowing the decline of kidney function in individuals with HFpEF and CKD above and beyond other therapies, and when using RAAS blockers and/or SGLT2is, monitoring kidney function and serum potassium is useful 1 to 2 weeks after initiation.

### Erectile dysfunction and heart failure: the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors [^bae5d39d]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

The above studies demonstrated the beneficial cardiopulmonary effects of sildenafil in patients with HF (Table 3). Whether these benefits persist for more than 1 year remains to be determined. In addition, there is a lack of data in the literature regarding the effect of vardenafil or tadalafil in HF patients. Future studies should include all three PDE-5 inhibitors as well as determine the effect of the PDE-5 inhibitors on major adverse cardiac events and mortality. This may be accomplished with a long-term survival study of patients with HF randomized to standard HF therapy and placebo versus standard HF therapy plus a PDE-5 inhibitor.

### Effect of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition on exercise capacity and clinical status in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a randomized clinical trial [^5c353e1e]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study RELAX was published by Redfield MM and colleagues in 2013 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the RELAX study, the trial question was: what is the effect of PDE5 inhibition on exercise capacity and clinical status in patients with HFpEF? In the RELAX study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the RELAX study, the population was: 216 patients (104 female, 112 male). The inclusion criteria were stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction ≥ 50%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity. The key exclusion criteria were pericardial disease, HCM, primary pulmonary arteriopathy, anemia, severe liver disease, severe renal dysfunction, or listed for cardiac transplantation. In the RELAX study, the interventions were: n = 113 sildenafil (administered PO at 20 mg, TID for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, TID for 12 weeks) n = 103 placebo (matching placebo for 24 weeks). In the RELAX study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median reduction in peak oxygen consumption at 24 weeks (0.2 vs. 0.2; MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.6 to 0.61). In the RELAX study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean clinical status rank score at 24 weeks (94.2 points vs. 95.8 points; MD 1.6, 95% CI -13.87 to 17.07) No significant difference in change in 6-minute walk distance (5 m vs. 15 m; MD 10, 95% CI -169.3 to 189.3). In the RELAX study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events (80% vs. 76%, p = 0.49) and serious adverse events (22% vs. 16%, p = 0.22). In the RELAX study, the conclusion was: in stable outpatients with HF, ejection fraction ≥ 50%, elevated N-terminal brain-type natriuretic peptide or elevated invasively measured filling pressures, and reduced exercise capacity, sildenafil was not superior to placebo with respect to median reduction in peak oxygen consumption at 24 weeks.

### Angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^6b9bc472]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study PARAGON-HF was published by Scott D Solomon and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the PARAGON-HF study, the trial question was: what is the role of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with HFpEF? In the PARAGON-HF study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PARAGON-HF study, the population was: 4796 patients (2479 female, 2317 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HF, ejection fraction ≥ 45%, elevated level of natriuretic peptides, and structural heart disease. The key exclusion criteria were prior measurement of LVEF < 40%; acute coronary syndrome, cardiac surgery, other major cardiovascular surgery within 3 months; acute decompensated HF requiring therapy. In the PARAGON-HF study, the interventions were: n = 2407 sacubitril/valsartan (target dose of 97 mg sacubitril with 103 mg valsartan BID) n = 2389 valsartan (target dose of 160 mg BID). In the PARAGON-HF study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in total hospitalizations for HF and death from cardiovascular causes (21.9% vs. 23.3%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.01). In the PARAGON-HF study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in improvement in NYHA class at 8 months (15% vs. 12.6%; OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.86) Significant decrease in death from renal failure, ESRD, or a ≥ 50% reduction in the eGFR (1.4% vs. 2.7%; HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.77) No significant difference in death from any cause (14.2% vs. 14.6%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.13). In the PARAGON-HF study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in liver-related adverse event. significant differences in hypotension with SBP < 100 mmHg (15.8% vs. 10.8%), angioedema (0.6% vs. 0.2%), hyperkalemia (16.3% vs. 19.6%). In the PARAGON-HF study, the conclusion was: in patients with HF, ejection fraction ≥ 45%, elevated level of natriuretic peptides, and structural heart disease, sacubitril/valsartan was not superior to valsartan with respect to total hospitalizations for HF and death from cardiovascular causes.

### The cGMP signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^ba5b9baa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

HFpEF is a major public health problem that lacks effective evidence‐based therapies. The cGMP pathway plays a central role in derangements integral to HFpEF pathophysiology. Improved characterization of cGMP signaling and its relation to cardiac function has revealed multiple options for targeted therapeutic intervention. To date, no large phase III HFpEF trial has definitively tested the effects of pharmacologically mediated increases in cGMP activity. Future prospective studies are needed to explore the effects of pharmacologically induced increases in cGMP cell signaling on HFpEF clinical outcomes.

### Exploring new endpoints for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^80b34e9a]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

The epidemiological, clinical, and societal implications of the heart failure (HF) epidemic cannot be overemphasized. Approximately half of all HF patients have HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HFpEF is largely a syndrome of the elderly, and with aging of the population, the proportion of patients with HFpEF is expected to grow. Currently, there is no drug known to improve mortality or hospitalization risk for these patients. Besides mortality and hospitalization, it is imperative to realize that patients with HFpEF have significant impairment in their functional capacity and their quality of life on a daily basis, underscoring the need for these parameters to ideally be incorporated within a regulatory pathway for drug approval. Although attempts should continue to explore therapies to reduce the risk of mortality or hospitalization for these patients, efforts should also be directed to improve other patient-centric concerns, such as functional capacity and quality of life. To initiate a dialogue about the compelling need for and the challenges in developing such alternative endpoints for patients with HFpEF, the US Food and Drug Administration on November 12, 2015, facilitated a meeting represented by clinicians, academia, industry, and regulatory agencies. This document summarizes the discussion from this meeting.

### Medical therapies for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^556e2006]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Current cardiovascular pharmacotherapy targets maladaptive overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which occurs throughout the continuum of cardiovascular disease spanning from hypertension to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Over the past 16 years, 4 prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials using candesartan, perindopril, irbesartan, and spironolactone in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) failed to demonstrate increased efficacy of RAAS blockade added to guideline-directed medical therapy. We reappraise these trials and their weaknesses, which precluded statistically significant findings. Recently, dual-acting RAAS blockade with sacubitril-valsartan relative to stand-alone valsartan failed to improve outcome in the PARAGON-HF trial (Efficacy and Safety of LCZ696 Compared with Valsartan, on Morbidity and Mortality in Heart Failure Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction). The majority of patients with HFpEF experience hypertension, frequently with subclinical left ventricular dysfunction, contributed to by comorbidities such as coronary disease, diabetes mellitus, overweight, and atrial fibrillation. Contrasting the findings in HFpEF, trials evaluating RAAS blockade on either side of HFpEF on the cardiovascular continuum in patients with high-risk hypertension and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, respectively, showed positive outcomes. We do not have a biologically plausible explanation for such divergent efficacy of RAAS blockade. Based on considerations of well-established clinical efficacy in hypertension and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and the shortcomings of aforementioned clinical trials in HFpEF, we argue that RAAS blockers including MRAs (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists; aldosterone antagonists) should be used in the treatment of patients with HFpEF.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^c5b8af32]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) — dapagliflozin and empagliflozin — in heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40% showed a significant decrease in hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in both trials, and a meta-analysis suggests reduction in cardiovascular death in HFmrEF/HFpEF (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.77–1.00). Improvements in health status with SGLT2is were observed in both trials, with the greatest benefit in those with baseline symptomatic impairment, and additional evidence for improvement in health status and quality of life in HFpEF was seen in PRESERVED-HF. A meta-analysis found a consistent reduction in the composite of hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death in HFmrEF and HFpEF (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73–0.87), with benefit additive to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs). Empagliflozin use was associated with reduced discontinuation of MRAs, possibly due to less risk for hyperkalemia, and no unexpected safety events were identified in either the EMPEROR-Preserved or DELIVER trials; the use of SGLT2is appears to be safe and effective when initiated in the context of hospitalization for acutely decompensated HF.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: new approaches to diagnosis and management [^eca647b6]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of older patients who develop heart failure (HF), particularly older women, have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients with HFpEF have severe symptoms of exercise intolerance, poor quality-of-life, frequent hospitalizations, and increased mortality. The prevalence of HFpEF is increasing and its prognosis is worsening. However, despite its importance, our understanding of the pathophysiology of HFpEF is incomplete, and drug development has proved immensely challenging. Currently, there are no universally accepted therapies that alter the clinical course of HFpEF. Originally viewed as a disorder due solely to abnormalities in left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, our understanding has evolved such that HFpEF is now understood as a systemic syndrome, involving multiple organ systems, likely triggered by inflammation and with an important contribution of aging, lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition, and multiple-comorbidities, features that are typical of a geriatric syndrome. HFpEF is usually progressive due to complex mechanisms of systemic and cardiac adaptation that vary over time, particularly with aging. In this review, we examine evolving data regarding HFpEF that may help explain past challenges and provide future directions to care patients with this highly prevalent, heterogeneous clinical syndrome.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^ff8cab66]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — scope and diagnostic definition are outlined, noting that heart failure (HF) carries a lifetime risk at age 40 of approximately 20%, and that HFpEF continues to rise and now accounts for more than 50% of HF cases with outcomes comparable to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), while often under-recognized with substantial resource utilization. Per the Universal Definition of HF, diagnosis requires symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by structural/functional cardiac abnormalities and at least 1 of the following: elevated natriuretic peptides or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion. HFpEF is defined as a clinical diagnosis of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, whereas EFs between 40% and 50% are noted as HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). The document also notes that HFpEF is not synonymous with diastolic dysfunction and lists pivotal issues to address in HFpEF care, including how to approach a person with shortness of breath, overcome diagnostic dilemmas and identify a need for further testing, rule out mimics to avoid missed diagnosis, manage comorbidities and care complexities, initiate and optimize GDMTs, determine when and why to refer to a cardiologist or HF specialist, improve access to care, and recognize sex-specific differences in diagnosis and care management.

### Isosorbide mononitrate in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^c9b3fee2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study NEAT-HFpEF was published by Redfield MM and colleagues in 2015 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the NEAT-HFpEF study, the trial question was: what is the role of isosorbide mononitrate in patients with HFpEF? In the NEAT-HFpEF study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the NEAT-HFpEF study, the population was: 110 patients (63 female, 47 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HFpEF. The key exclusion criteria were SBP < 110 mmHg or > 180 mmHg or a previous adverse reaction to or current use of long-term nitrate or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor therapy. In the NEAT-HFpEF study, the interventions were: n = 51 isosorbide mononitrate (6-week dose escalation from 30 mg to 60 mg to 120 mg once daily) n = 59 placebo (matching placebo once daily for 6 weeks). In the NEAT-HFpEF study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in daily activity level for 120-mg dose group (8922 vs. 9303;). In the NEAT-HFpEF study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hours of activity per day (9.01 vs. 9.31; difference -30, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.05) Significant decrease in activity during all dose regimens (9185 vs. 9623; difference -439, 95% CI -792 to -86). In the NEAT-HFpEF study, the conclusion was: in patients with HFpEF, isosorbide mononitrate was not superior to placebo with respect to daily activity level for 120-mg dose group.

### Phenotype-specific treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a multiorgan roadmap [^2316af02]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (EF; HFpEF) accounts for 50% of HF cases, and its prevalence relative to HF with reduced EF continues to rise. In contrast to HF with reduced EF, large trials testing neurohumoral inhibition in HFpEF failed to reach a positive outcome. This failure was recently attributed to distinct systemic and myocardial signaling in HFpEF and to diversity of HFpEF phenotypes. In this review, an HFpEF treatment strategy is proposed that addresses HFpEF-specific signaling and phenotypic diversity. In HFpEF, extracardiac comorbidities such as metabolic risk, arterial hypertension, and renal insufficiency drive left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction through systemic inflammation and coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction. The latter affects left ventricular diastolic dysfunction through macrophage infiltration, resulting in interstitial fibrosis, and through altered paracrine signaling to cardiomyocytes, which become hypertrophied and stiff because of low nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Systemic inflammation also affects other organs such as lungs, skeletal muscle, and kidneys, leading, respectively, to pulmonary hypertension, muscle weakness, and sodium retention. Individual steps of these signaling cascades can be targeted by specific interventions: metabolic risk by caloric restriction, systemic inflammation by statins, pulmonary hypertension by phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, muscle weakness by exercise training, sodium retention by diuretics and monitoring devices, myocardial nitric oxide bioavailability by inorganic nitrate-nitrite, myocardial cyclic guanosine monophosphate content by neprilysin or phosphodiesterase 9 inhibition, and myocardial fibrosis by spironolactone. Because of phenotypic diversity in HFpEF, personalized therapeutic strategies are proposed, which are configured in a matrix with HFpEF presentations in the abscissa and HFpEF predispositions in the ordinate.

Heart failure phenotypes and definitions — Heart failure (HF) is defined by symptoms and/or signs from structural/functional cardiac abnormalities with specific objective criteria, and ejection fraction (EF) phenotypes are categorized as follows: HF is defined as symptoms/signs of HF with structural/functional abnormalities and at least 1 of elevated natriuretic peptides or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion; heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) requires a clinical diagnosis of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%; heart failure with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF) requires clinical HF with LVEF 41% to 49%; HF with improved EF is previous LVEF ≤ 40% with a follow-up measurement > 40%; heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) is clinical HF with LVEF ≥ 50% not attributable to infiltrative cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, pericardial disease, or high-output HF; and HFpEF mimics are clinical HF with LVEF ≥ 50% with a primary noncardiac cause (kidney or liver disease) or an underlying cardiac cause including infiltrative or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular or pericardial disease, or high-output HF.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^336d6d4f]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for nearly half of all heart failure cases and has a prevalence that is expected to rise with the growing ageing population. HFpEF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Specific HFpEF risk factors include age, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and atrial fibrillation. Haemodynamic contributions to HFpEF include changes in left ventricular structure, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, left atrial myopathy, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, chronotropic incompetence, and vascular dysfunction. Inflammation, fibrosis, impaired nitric oxide signalling, sarcomere dysfunction, and mitochondrial and metabolic defects contribute to the cellular and molecular changes observed in HFpEF. HFpEF impacts multiple organ systems beyond the heart, including the skeletal muscle, peripheral vasculature, lungs, kidneys and brain. The diagnosis of HFpEF can be made in individuals with signs and symptoms of heart failure with abnormality in natriuretic peptide levels or evidence of cardiopulmonary congestion, facilitated by the use of HFpEF risk scores and additional imaging and testing with the exclusion of HFpEF mimics. Management includes initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy and management of comorbidities. Given the significant impact of HFpEF on quality of life, future research efforts should include a particular focus on how patients can live better with this disease.

### Nitric oxide signaling in heart failure with Preserved ejection fraction [^68f27703]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

The lack of therapeutic options in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is well documented. In part, because of the high incidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in HFpEF, there has been consistent interest in repurposing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-specific therapies for HFpEF with considerable focus on nitric oxide (NO) and phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibition. NO is recognized as a potent vasodilator, and its activity is mediated through stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which results in formation of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and increased activity of protein kinase G (PKG). cGMP is degraded by PDE-5. PDE-5 inhibitors (PDE-5i) have been successfully used in for the treatment of PAH due to their significant vasodilatory effects. More recently, different strategies to stimulate the NO pathway for pulmonary vasodilatory purposes have been successfully explored, resulting in the approval of the sGC stimulator riociguat for treatment of PAH as well as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. This class of drugs directly stimulates sGC independently of the presence of NO, thereby providing a second avenue through which to increase formation of cGMP and dilate the pulmonary vasculature.

The NO pathway has also been shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure, which has made PDE-5i an attractive therapeutic option for the treatment of HFpEF. There is evidence of decreased NO bioavailability in cardiomyocytes in HFpEF, which results in reduced PKG activity in these cells and contributes to the development of cardiac hypertrophy. A study published in 2011 from Guazzi et al.showed promise as sildenafil resulted in improved hemodynamics in 44 patients with PH secondary to HFpEF. However, in the RELAX (Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status and Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial, which involved 216 patients with HFpEF, there was no difference in clinical status and 6-min walking distance between patients treated with sildenafil and with placebo in the primary or secondary outcomes. Although the RELAX trial was negative, some enthusiasm remained for PDE-5i, because investigators continued to see whether there was a class of patients who might respond to these agents.

### Old drug, new trick? Oral milrinone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^f81d8af2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Such discussion of drug efficacy is unavoidable but should be tempered by the reminder that this study was quite small and primarily designed to look at safety. In this regard, it clearly succeeded. Evaluation of the effectiveness is most helpful in considering how future studies might be designed including continued evaluation of its safety profile. This work functions as a reminder that there may be old tools long since retired for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction that may hold mechanistic and even therapeutic relevance when applied to HFpEF, where help is so urgently needed. We could only be so luckily if "the old is new again".

Data synthesis and analysis

Quantitative data extracted from the papers for all treatment efficacy outcomes were baseline and after treatment/placebo means ± standard deviation (SD). When differences from baseline (means ± SD) were reported, these were also extracted. When summary statistics were not adequately or fully reported (for example, missing pre-post treatment mean difference ± SD on a specific outcome; standard error of an estimated effect and no corresponding SD), these were calculated whenever possible. When baseline levels, post-treatment and/or change from baseline data were missing or inconsistent, the authors of the original papers were contacted in order to obtain the necessary information [see Additional file 1: Statistical Analysis]. Several studies (16/24) reported data on mixed populations, male and female; however, only 1 of the 16 contacted authors provided raw data separately, thus it was not possible to stratify by gender.

In order to examine the efficacy of PDE5i in the different clinical settings, all retrieved studies were categorized a priori according to the following categories: 1) moderate-severe left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) versus non/mild-LVH (based on LVMi values above or below 131 g/m 2 and where not available, on NT-proBNP levels above or below 700 pg/mL); 2) left versus right heart disease; 3) cardiac disease versus non-cardiac disease; 4) HF with reduced EF versus HF with preserved EF; 5) age: younger versus older than 60 years of age; and 6) active compound: sildenafil versus tadalafil versus vardenafil. The same categories were also used for the subgroup analysis. A minimum of two studies were used for subgroup analyses; however, findings stemming from such analyses were interpreted with care. Where a specific subgroup involved a single study, as occurred for HF with preserved EF, the analysis was not performed.

### Pulmonary hypertension in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^c6016cf1]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), an entity that remains challenging and difficult to treat, the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH), via an increase in left atrial pressure, is the direct consequence of reduced relaxation and enhanced stiffness of the left ventricle and is now viewed as an important contributor to clinical worsening and increased mortality. PH becomes a relevant clinical phenotype in approximately 50% of patients with HFpEF and represents a true challenge in the clinical follow-up and management of these patients. Along with these epidemiologic insights, there has been increasing recognition of the pathophysiology of PH and its consequences on the right ventricle in patients with HFpEF. Novel and effective therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing and reversing PH are highly relevant in the attempt to modify the poor clinical trajectory and growing health care burden of HFpEF. Many theoretical rationales as well as progressively accumulating evidence support the usefulness of nitric oxide pathway-potentiating compounds in targeting the lung vasculature through phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors or guanylate cyclase stimulators to produce vasodilation and potentially a biologic effect. These pharmacologic strategies may be clinically effective options for the treatment of PH in patients with HFpEF; however, large controlled trials are necessary to address definitively the safety, tolerability, and potential impact on morbidity and mortality. This review details the pathophysiologic process, prevalence, and consequences of HFpEF-associated PH and discusses current and emerging treatment strategies to prevent or treat this deleterious sequela when present.

### The cGMP signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^6557b66c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Phosphodiesterase‐5 Inhibition

An alternative approach is to inhibit catabolism of cGMP through PDE‐5 inhibition. PDE‐5 inhibition blunts adrenergic stimulation, attenuates maladaptive myocardial remodeling, improves endothelial function, and enhances the renal response to natriuretic peptides. Commonly used for pulmonary arterial hypertension, several small studies have explored the use of sildenafil in HFrEF patients with favorable results.– In HFpEF, a single‐center study of 44 patients found significant improvements in central hemodynamics, left and right ventricular function, and lung function with PDE‐5 inhibition. However, in the multicenter RELAX trial, which included 216 stable ambulatory HFpEF patients, sildenafil failed to significantly improve peak exercise oxygen consumption, clinical status rank score, or 6‐minute walk distance at 24 weeks. In addition, there were no hemodynamic effects, including changes in systemic vascular resistance, consistent with a study of the drug in HFrEF and secondary pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, there were no significant differences in plasma cGMP levels between sildenafil and placebo groups. The investigators postulated that the lack of a positive trial result may be related to the relatively modest level of pulmonary hypertension and LV hypertrophy in the RELAX trial compared with the study by Guazzi and colleagues, in which right ventricular function was markedly impaired with baseline right atrial pressures of 23 mm Hg, mean baseline pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 50 mm Hg, and LV mass index > 160 g/m 2. An alternative explanation centers on the lack of significant increase in plasma cGMP with sildenafil, suggesting a failure to adequately test the cGMP enhancement hypothesis. Along these lines, upregulation of PDE‐5 has not been definitively shown to be the underlying mechanism of reduced cGMP signaling in HFpEF, and it may be less important to inhibit this enzyme if decreased cGMP production is instead the predominant problem.

Therapeutic Implications

Management of PH in HFpEF presently rests on control of fluid accumulation and enhancement of LV filling. 175 Placebo‐controlled, randomized trials of endothelin antagonism with ambrisentan and bosentan have been terminated early because of poor enrollment or led to neutral findings, respectively (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00840463, NCT00820352). The placebo‐controlled Phosphdiesterase‐5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status and Exercise Capacity in Diastolic Heart Failure (RELAX) trial randomized 216 patients with HFpEF and moderate PH to PDE5‐I with sildenafil. 27 Compared to placebo, sildenafil did not significantly improve functional capacity and clinical status. 27 Notwithstanding that PDE5‐I may have failed to improve LV function, the selection of patients with moderate PH may partly account for the neutral findings of the RELAX trial. 180 Direct measurement of PA pressure and TPG by right heart catheterization was not required in the RELAX trial. 181, 182 Recently, treatment with sildenafil failed to reduce PA pressure or hemodynamic parameters in a HFpEF cohort. 183 In contrast, a single‐center, placebo‐controlled, randomized trial reported significant improvements in PA pressure, RV function, and LV relaxation with sildenafil in patients with HFpEF and PH. 184 In the absence of evidence‐based data, PDE5‐I cannot be recommended for the treatment of PH in HFpEF. 185, 186, 187 Riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that sensitizes guanylate cyclase through nitric oxide–dependent and –independent pathways, has been evaluated for the treatment of PH in HFpEF. 188, 189 Riociguat increases stroke volume and cardiac output without changes in pulmonary vascular resistance and TPG. 188, 189 The lack of US Food and Drug Administration–approved therapy makes the management of HFpEF patients with PH and particularly out of proportion PH extremely challenging. In summary, a subset of HFpEF patients seeks medical attention for PH‐related symptoms. The prognosis of HFpEF patients with PH is poor because no specific therapy is presently available to alleviate the progression of PH.

### Heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction in women: new clues to causes and treatment [^01e7d7bc]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome with a high prevalence and high mortality. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) results from abnormal left ventricular diastolic function caused by multiple factors causing microvascular coronary dysfunction and subsequent development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis that is mostly due to arterial hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and aging. HFpEF is now the most common form of heart failure and a condition predominantly of post-menopausal women. It is largely absent in pre-menopausal women; however, its prevalence rises after menopause, which indicates a protective role of endogenous estrogen.

Drugs that stimulate cGMP production by directly activating sGC, as well as PDE5 inhibitors that interfere with the breakdown of cGMP, are being explored as new approaches for the treatment of HFpEF. Using an experimental model of heart failure, Sasaki et al. previously reported that surgical menopause in female mice abrogated the beneficial effects of endogenous estrogens on the efficacy of a PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil. The estrogen-dependent NO-cGMP−mediated effect that protected against left ventricular remodeling was dependent on Gq-coupled receptor activation and the presence of functional cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα (PKGIα). Whether this protective effect involved genomic or nongenomic effects and which estrogen receptor(s) were involved remains unknown.

### Nonpharmacological approaches to managing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^3e601ed6]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HFpEF. This illustration demonstrates the intricate and multifaceted nature of HFpEF, which contributes to the limited efficacy of drug therapy alone, despite numerous clinical trials. However, ongoing research exploring nonpharmacological treatment approaches and their mechanisms may potentially mark a turning point in HFpEF management. This review examines nonpharmacological interventions and their associated mechanisms for HFpEF reported in the past year. cGMP indicates cyclic guanosine monophosphate; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; and PKG, protein kinase G.

Extracardiac abnormalities such as vascular-related atherosclerosis and decreased vascular responsiveness to nitric oxide have also been shown to contribute to the pathophysiology of HFpEF. For example, aortic stiffness is now considered a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular diseaseand may play a role in HFpEF formation through its association with the progression of hypertension.

### Effects of candesartan in patients with chronic heart failure and preserved left-ventricular ejection fraction: the CHARM-preserved trial [^271fd9ec]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

The study CHARM-Preserved was published by Yusuf S and colleagues in 2003 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the CHARM-Preserved study, the trial question was: what is the role of candesartan in patients with HFpEF? In the CHARM-Preserved study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CHARM-Preserved study, the population was: 3023 patients (1212 female, 1811 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with chronic HFpEF. The key exclusion criteria were life-threatening adverse event; known bilateral renal artery stenosis; current symptomatic hypotension; persistent systolic or diastolic hypertension; stroke, acute myocardial infarction, or open heart surgery within the last 4 weeks; or previous heart transplant or heart transplant expected to be performed within the next 6 months. In the CHARM-Preserved study, the interventions were: n = 1514 candesartan (target dose 32 mg once daily) n = 1509 placebo (matching placebo daily). In the CHARM-Preserved study, the primary outcome was: borderline significant decrease in cardiovascular death or admission to hospital for CHF (22% vs. 24%; aHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1). In the CHARM-Preserved study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke (26% vs. 28%; aHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99) Significant decrease in hospital admission for chronic HF (15.9% vs. 18.3%; aHR 0.84, 95% CI 0.7 to 1) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (11.2% vs. 11.3%; aHR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18). In the CHARM-Preserved study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in drug discontinuation due to adverse event or laboratory abnormality (17.8% vs. 13.5%). In the CHARM-Preserved study, the conclusion was: in patients with chronic HFpEF, candesartan was superior to placebo with respect to cardiovascular death or admission to hospital for CHF.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: uncertainties and dilemmas [^41db3532]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Many uncertainties surround the syndrome of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which was the topic reviewed in an Expert Meeting at the University of Ferrara. This concluded that the absence of clear diagnostic clinical criteria was the major barrier to progress. There was general agreement that symptoms or signs of heart failure, normal LVEF despite an elevated plasma concentration of natriuretic peptides, and signs of abnormal LV relaxation, LV filling, LV hypertrophy, or left atrial enlargement, or diastolic dysfunction supported the diagnosis. However, HFpEF, like all heart failure syndromes, is heterogeneous in aetiology and pathophysiology, rather than being a single disease. HFpEF may account for about half of all patients with heart failure. The classical risk factors for developing HFpEF include age and co-morbidities, notably hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and the metabolic syndrome. When complicated by increasing congestion requiring hospital admission, the prognosis is poor; 30% or more of patients will die within 1 year (nearly two-thirds die from cardiovascular causes). Patients with chronic stable symptoms have a much better prognosis. Despite many clinical trials, there is no solid evidence that any treatment alters the natural history of HFpEF. Several treatments have shown promising early results and are now being tested in substantial randomized clinical trials. Further basic research is required to better characterize the disease and accelerate progress. Our review highlights the many difficulties encountered in performing randomized clinical trials in HFpEF, often due to difficulties in characterizing HFpEF itself.

Cardiac rehabilitation and structured exercise in HFpEF — benefits and access: Enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation programs or structured exercise therapy could improve the quality of life and functional capacity of individuals with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), especially those with prior hospitalization, but large-scale randomized data are needed to verify and extend the impact of improved exercise capacity on prognosis. Insurance coverage for cardiac rehabilitation or structured exercise therapy is not available for individuals with HFpEF in the United States, and lack of reimbursement for cardiac rehabilitation in those with HFpEF results in a significant gap in care for this vulnerable population.

### Cardiorenal effects of long-term phosphodiesterase V inhibition in pre-heart failure [^17b1b646]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This proof‐of‐concept, randomized, placebo‐controlled physiological study assessed the effects of long‐term PDEV inhibition with tadalafil in subjects with PHF. We found that 12 weeks of tadalafil did not improve renal function or increase sodium/cGMP excretion compared with placebo. Left atrial volume index, a surrogate for left ventricular filling pressure, was lower and cardiac index improved after volume expansion in those treated with tadalafil. Taken together, our findings suggest that long‐term PDEV inhibition with tadalafil does not affect cardiorenal function in subjects with PHF, although there may be an improvement in cardiac hemodynamics with long‐term tadalafil.

Patients with PHF are classified as having stage B heart failure and are at high risk for developing symptomatic heart failure. Current guidelines recommended the use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with stage B heart failure who have a low LVEF. This recommendation is based on the SOLVD (Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction) Prevention Trial, in which > 4000 patients with asymptomatic reduced LVEF were randomized to enalapril versus placebo. These investigators found a reduced incidence of symptomatic heart failure and heart failure hospitalizations in patients randomized to enalapril. Aside from angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, therapies aimed at preventing progression from asymptomatic heart failure to symptomatic heart failure are lacking.

### Device-based solutions to improve cardiac physiology and hemodynamics in heart Failure with preserved ejection Fraction [^23e6a085]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Advancements in Therapeutic Options for HFpEF

The aim of the current work was to provide a comprehensive review of the rationale and progress in device-based solutions that improve the physiology and hemodynamics of HFpEF by targeting one or more of the abnormal biomechanical pathways occurring in the disease or associated symptomatology. We briefly summarize here the insights from the trials of some of the most promising pharmacologic therapies and other interventions or approaches.

Given the success of neurohormonal blockers for the treatment of HFrEF, significant efforts were made toward the investigation of these agents in HFpEF. Neurohormonal blockers have revolutionized the care of patients with HFrEF for several decades, as they reverse cardiac remodeling, thus increasing function and remarkably improving QoL and survival, and decreasing hospitalization rates in this patient population. However, several trials of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in patients with HFpEF failed to conclusively show benefits of this approach, causing it to be largely abandoned. Another approach that has been widely investigated is that of increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-protein kinase G signaling due to its role in the attenuation of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. A multitude of trials have studied the effects of up-regulating cGMP synthesis through inorganic nitrates in HFpEF or of other agents such as soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators (eg, vericiguat, praliciguat). In addition, the effects of phosphodiesterase type 5 and 9 inhibition have also been investigated. To date, however, none of these pathways has shown clinical benefit in patients with HFpEF.

### Empagliflozin in heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction [^9d34d578]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study EMPEROR-Preserved was published by Stefan D Anker and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the trial question was: what is the role of empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF? In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the population was: 5988 patients (2676 female, 3312 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with NYHA class II-IV HF and an ejection fraction > 40%. The key exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction; major cardiovascular surgery, or stroke in past 90 days; heart transplant; acute decompensated HF; indication for liver disease; impaired renal function. In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the interventions were: n = 2997 empagliflozin (10 mg once daily plus usual therapy) n = 2991 placebo (matching placebo plus usual care). In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF (13.8% vs. 17.1%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.9). In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for HF (8.6% vs. 11.8%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.83) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (7.3% vs. 8.2%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.09) Significant increase in the incidence of improvement in GFR (-1.25 mL/min/1.73 m²/year vs. -2.62 mL/min/1.73 m²/year; HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.66). In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation of trial drug. In the EMPEROR-Preserved study, the conclusion was: in patients with NYHA class II-IV HF and an ejection fraction > 40%, empagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF.

### Effects of sildenafil on invasive haemodynamics and exercise capacity in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction and pulmonary hypertension: a randomized controlled trial [^dcf1021e]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with associated pulmonary hypertension is an increasingly large medical problem. Phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibition may be of value in this population, but data are scarce and inconclusive.

Methods and Results

In this single centre, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we included 52 patients with pulmonary hypertension [mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) > 25 mmHg; pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) > 15 mmHg] due to HFpEF [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45%]. Patients were randomized to the PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil, titrated to 60 mg three times a day, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in mean PAP after 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints were change in mean PAWP, cardiac output, and peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2). Mean age was 74 ± 10 years, 71% was female, LVEF was 58%, median NT-proBNP level was 1087 (535–1945) ng/L. After 12 weeks, change in mean PAP was -2.4 (95% CI -4.5 to -0.3) mmHg in patients who received sildenafil, vs. -4.7 (95% CI -7.1 to -2.3) mmHg in placebo patients (P = 0.14). Sildenafil did not have a favourable effect on PAWP, cardiac output, and peak VO2. Adverse events were overall comparable between groups.

Conclusion

Treatment with sildenafil did not reduce pulmonary artery pressures and did not improve other invasive haemodynamic or clinical parameters in our study population, characterized by HFpEF patients with predominantly isolated post-capillary pulmonary hypertension. (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01726049).

### The cGMP signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^dd9e6eb1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Unlike acute coronary syndrome, no short‐term intervention, with 1 possible exception, has been shown to offer long‐term benefit in HF. Similar to HFrEF, future trials in HFpEF should focus on long‐term outcomes and test therapies that are initiated during hospitalization and continued into the postdischarge period, when patients are at highest risk of poor outcomes. Likewise, future trials of cGMP augmentation should preferentially concentrate on development of oral therapies that can be used in both the hospital and outpatient settings. In this regard, focus on the upstream synthetic pathway for cGMP with use of sGC modulators and neprilysin inhibitors appears promising. Low‐dose oral formulations initiated in stable hospitalized patients and continued in the ambulatory setting may be ideal to minimize the risk of hypotension and to explore long‐term influences on mortality and HFpEF progression that may occur independent of any vasodilatory action. In addition, enrollment of hospitalized HF patients identifies a cohort of patients who have a more certain diagnosis and who are at high risk of subsequent events, thus improving power to detect a drug effect.

Clinical context and diagnostic workup for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) emphasizes that clinical context, including demographic and comorbid risk factors, is important in diagnosis, and that a history and physical examination with echocardiogram may suggest right ventricular HF, pulmonary hypertension, or valvular heart disease, or raise suspicion for myocardial or pericardial diseases requiring further workup. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may support the diagnosis of infiltrative or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or pericardial disease, and further workup with invasive hemodynamics and, in some cases, endomyocardial biopsy or other systemic workup may be needed in selected individuals. The text emphasizes the contribution of noncardiovascular entities and HFpEF mimics to congestion, reinforcing the importance of establishing the diagnosis to optimize disease-directed therapies, and notes that even after mimics are excluded, extending the HFpEF label to identify associated comorbidities emphasizes addressing them to improve symptoms and outcomes.

### Cardiomyocyte functional etiology in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is distinctive – A new preclinical model [^65b1506d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In summary, here we report the characterization of a new model of HFpEF and provide the first demonstration of cardiomyocyte cellular pathophysiology underlying this increasingly prevalent form of heart failure. Therapies that have been largely successful in treatment of HFrEF have been targeted at suppressing neurohumoral signaling axes involving the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system and β‐adrenoceptors. 3, 14 Recently, evaluation of phosphodiesterase‐5 inhibition also reported lack of clinical improvement in HFpEF. 30 While these therapies may reduce morbidity in some HFpEF cohorts, mortality reduction has not be achieved in trials to date. 31 Now this investigation provides important mechanistic insight into the contrasting cellular etiologies of HFpEF and HFrEF, and represents a conceptual advance to be exploited for targeted development of HFpEF‐specific therapeutic intervention. Based on this study's novel findings, further studies of the signaling pathways involved and the effects of systemic secondary insults in shaping HFpEF failure development may now be pursued. As a new preclinical platform, the HHR provides a model for building multisystem pathology states through additional interventions that capture the spectrum of HFpEF phenotypes and comorbidities observed clinically. With this new understanding of the cardiopathology mechanism, there is potential opportunity for preclinical innovation in responding to the HFpEF challenge.

Women with HFpEF — sex-specific considerations note that challenges are "even more pertinent in women". Compared with men, women have "higher EFs and more preserved left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain" and may be less likely to develop reduced EF. The projected burden is rising: "the incidence of HF in women will rise by more than 30% in the upcoming decades", and women have a lifetime HF risk of "approximately 20% by age 40 years, increasing to nearly 30% by age 55 years". Obstetric history is relevant: "A careful history of pregnancy is important because that may also be prognostic for HFpEF", and "A history of preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk for subsequent HFpEF hospitalization", a concern "particularly noteworthy among populations with inadequate access to quality healthcare".

### Extended-release oral milrinone for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^30a0b378]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in general, numerous epidemiologic studies indicate that the overall burden of heart failure (HF) has increased over the past decade. 1 In particular, increasing age and ongoing challenges in the management of comorbidities including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus have contributed to the increase in prevalence and to a change in the phenotypic profile of HF patients. Presently, approximately half of those living with HF are now recognized to have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and this is rapidly becoming one of the most challenging issues in contemporary cardiovascular medicine.

In contrast to the substantial progress made in relation to the demonstration of effective treatments for Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), little progress has been made for HFpEF. To some extent, the lack of success in previous trials can be attributed to the heterogeneous pathophysiology of HFpEF. The cardiovascular physiology of HFpEF is complex. While the central paradigm is that of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction leading to rapid exertion‐related rise in left atrial pressure, other elements such as subclinical systolic dysfunction, 2 left atrial dysfunction, 3 impaired right ventricular–pulmonary arterial coupling, 4 and reduced peripheral oxygen delivery have all been implicated as potential pathophysiologic determinants of exercise intolerance.

We recently provided the first evidence for positive hemodynamic effects of milrinone in patients with HFpEF following an acute intravenous dose in a placebo‐controlled trial. 5 Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase type III inhibitor, exhibits several pharmacologic actions that may be useful in HFpEF, including beneficial effects on left ventricular diastolic function, pulmonary vasodilation, and systemic vasodilation. In the present study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of chronic, orally administered milrinone in patients with HFpEF, using a novel extended‐release formulation of the drug.

### Old drug, new trick? Oral milrinone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^ee580d0d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

One may also question the reasoning behind the utilization of a known inotrope in HFpEF, where the above‐noted precedent would warn of more potential for harm than good. The work described here is, of course, not just a last‐ditch effort because of the HFpEF syndrome's growing burden on the healthcare system and status as one of cardiology's lasting enigmas. 5 In fact, there is reasonable rationale for use of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as milrinone for this phenotypically diverse syndrome. The search for common pathophysiologic underpinnings that could serve as therapeutic targets received a blueprint with the paradigm set forth by Paulus et al in 2013. In this model, the prominent form of HFpEF was attributed to vascular endothelial inflammation and dysfunction secondary to comorbidities, manifest in the multiorgan dysfunction seen in the HFpEF syndrome. 6 The proposed culprit in this model was a loss of the key effector molecule nitric oxide, where in the setting of widespread inflammation and reactive oxygen species, a reduction in nitric oxide bioavailability could lead to several detriments. Among these detriments is cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and deposition of interstitial collagen that resulted in diastolic dysfunction, as well as vascular dysfunction characterized by resting vasoconstriction and impaired sensitivity to nitric‐oxide‐mediated vasodilation. Amelioration of such a pathway provided hope for a potential silver bullet, or at least a first effective therapy.

As is well known, the series of trials targeting this pathway in HFpEF — in particular the phosphodiesterase‐5 inhibitor sildenafil and sodium nitrite in nebulized form — have yielded disappointing results despite promising preliminary studies offering proof of concept. 7, 8 While mechanistic explanations for the lack of benefit seen with phosphodiesterase‐5 inhibition in HFpEF have been presented previously, including the potential for upregulated phosphodiesterase‐5A (rendering the phosphodiesterase‐5 inhibitor sildenafil ineffective) and only mildly increased levels of cGMP (suggesting the study drug's inability to achieve its intended effect at studied doses), the larger lesson may be in matching the therapy of interest to its target physiologic derangement. Such matching requires careful consideration of a drug's mechanism of action as well as careful characterization of the tested cohort through laboratory, echocardiographic, and invasive hemodynamic testing. So, is the cohort of HFpEF subjects tested here the ideal phenotype to derive benefit from the actions of an extended‐release milrinone?

Conclusions

In a pilot study of patients with HFpEF, a short duration of treatment with extended‐release oral milrinone appeared to be safe and resulted in improved quality of life and functional capacity without an increase in adverse events. Further longer‐term studies are warranted to establish the potential role of this therapeutic approach in HFpEF.

Obesity and HFpEF — In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), increasing severity of obesity is associated with an increased risk for HF hospitalization, and there is a U-shaped relationship between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause mortality with the lowest event rate at a BMI of 32 to 34 kg/m2. Weight loss is beneficial in individuals with obesity. In the STEP-1 trial, semaglutide plus lifestyle resulted in a sustained weight loss of over 15 kg over a 68-week period, and in SURMOUNT-1 tirzepatide demonstrated up to 20% reduction in weight loss sustained over the 72-week trial, although semaglutide and tirzepatide have not yet been rigorously evaluated in individuals with HF and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists may result in loss of not only adipose weight but also lean muscle mass. To improve symptoms and alleviate shared obesity-associated comorbidities with HFpEF, those with BMIs ≥ 35 kg/m2 would benefit from referral to a multidisciplinary team of medical, surgical, and nutritional experts in obesity, when available.

HFpEF diagnostic scoring systems — To support diagnosis of suspected heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), both the H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF algorithms use a scoring system. H2FPEF was derived and validated using a gold-standard reference of invasive exercise hemodynamic measurements and is the more practical system for use by clinicians; its 6 components are Heavy (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m^2), Hypertension (on 2 or more antihypertensive medications), Atrial Fibrillation, Pulmonary hypertension (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 35 mm Hg on Doppler echocardiography), Elder (age > 60 years), and Filling pressures (E/e′ > 9 on Doppler echocardiography), and "A score of 6 or more is highly suggestive of HFpEF". HFA-PEFF was developed based on expert consensus, is more involved with potential hemodynamic assessment, and includes 4 steps: Step 1 Pretest assessment (clinical assessment and standard diagnostic tests, including natriuretic peptides, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms), Step 2 Echocardiographic and natriuretic peptide score, Step 3 Functional testing in cases of uncertainty (diastolic stress test with exercise stress echocardiography followed by invasive hemodynamic measurements, if needed), and Step 4 Final etiology (testing to exclude other cardiac causes of dyspnea and/or edema such as infiltrative/restrictive cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, or pericardial disease); the algorithm includes natriuretic peptides and notes that natriuretic peptide levels are generally lower in individuals with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF.

### The year in cardiology 2015: heart failure [^b2a20172]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

In 2013, the RELAX trial conducted in 216 elderly patients with HFpEF showed the absence of effect of the phosphodiesterase type 5 sildenafil on maximal exercise capacity, 6 min walking distance, clinical status, quality of life, left ventricular remodelling or diastolic function after 24 weeks of follow-up. These results were in contrast with a previous single centre study that showed benefit on invasively measured haemodynamics, echocardiographic variables, and quality of life in patients with pulmonary hypertension related to HFpEF.

Another just recently published single centre study by Hoendermis et al.published in the European Heart Journal, however, casts further doubt on the use of sildenafil in HFpEF patients with associated pulmonary hypertension. Fifty-two patients with HFpEF and predominantly isolated post-capillary pulmonary hypertension were randomized to sildenafil or placebo. After 24 weeks, sildenafil did not reduce pulmonary artery pressures and did not improve other invasive haemodynamic or clinical parameters, thus confirming the findings of the aforementioned RELAX study that HFpEF patients with associated pulmonary hypertension do not benefit from treatment with this drug.

The current paradigm of HFpEF is that an abnormal nitric oxide bioavailability results in decreased cyclic guanylate monophosphate (cGMP) in the myocytes. One potential explanation of the lack of benefit from sildenafil is therefore that the defect is more a decrease in the production of cGMP than a problem of increased degradation that is inhibited by PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil. It will therefore be interesting to see the results of studies using a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, such as riociguat, which is currently under evaluation. The results of the SOCRATES-REDUCED study, however, highlight the challenges in moving the concept of modulating sGC and thereby addressing the relative cGMP deficit forward. In SOCRATES-REDUCED, a phase 2 dose-finding study in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and worsening chronic HF, the oral sGC stimulator vericiguat did not meet its primary endpoint of reducing N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) at 12 weeks when all doses were combined, but was well tolerated. While subgroup analysis did suggest efficacy and safety in its 10 mg subgroup, further studies are needed to determine the potential role of this class of drugs for patients with worsening chronic HF.

### Biological phenotypes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^cb03cad0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, which result in the heterogeneous phenotypes that are evident clinically, and which have potentially confounded previous HFpEF trials. A greater understanding of the in vivo human processes involved, and in particular, which are the causes and which are the downstream effects, may allow the syndrome of HFpEF to be distilled into distinct diagnoses based on the underlying biology. From this, specific interventions can follow, targeting individuals identified on the basis of their biological phenotype. This review describes the biological phenotypes of HFpEF and therapeutic interventions aimed at targeting these phenotypes.

### Sildenafil treatment in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: targeted metabolomic profiling in the RELAX trial [^c6df7ae7]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition with sildenafil compared with a placebo had no effect on the exercise capacity or clinical status of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in the PhosphodiesteRasE-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status and Exercise Capacity in Diastolic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (RELAX) clinical trial. Metabolic impairments may explain the neutral results.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that profiling metabolites in the RELAX trial would clarify the mechanisms of sildenafil effects and identify metabolites associated with clinical outcomes in HFpEF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Paired baseline and 24-week plasma samples of 160 stable outpatient individuals with HFpEF enrolled in the RELAX clinical trial were analyzed using flow injection tandem mass spectrometry (60 metabolites) and conventional assays (5 metabolites).

Interventions

Sildenafil (n = 79) or a placebo (n = 81) administered orally at 20 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks, followed by 60 mg, 3 times daily for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary measure was metabolite level changes between baseline and 24 weeks stratified by treatments. Secondary measures included correlations between metabolite level changes and clinical biomarkers and associations between baseline metabolite levels and the composite clinical score.

Results

No metabolites changed between baseline and 24 weeks in the group treated with a placebo; however, 7 metabolites changed in the group treated with sildenafil, including decreased amino acids (alanine and proline; median change [25th-75th], -38.26 [-100.3 to 28.19] and -28.24 [-56.29 to 12.08], respectively; false discovery rate-adjusted P = 0.01 and .03, respectively), and increased short-chain dicarboxylacylcarnitines glutaryl carnitine, octenedioyl carnitine, and adipoyl carnitine (median change, 6.19 [-3.37 to 14.18], 2.72 [-3 to 12.57], and 10.72 [-11.23 to 29.57], respectively; false discovery rate-adjusted P = 0.01, .04, and .05, respectively), and 1 long-chain acylcarnitine metabolite (palmitoyl carnitine; median change, 7.83 [-5.64 to 26.99]; false discovery rate-adjusted P = 0.03). The increases in long-chain acylarnitine metabolites and short-chain dicarboxylacylcarnitines correlated with increases in endothelin-1 and creatinine/cystatin C, respectively. Higher baseline levels of short-chain dicarboxylacylcarnitine metabolite 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine/malonylcarnitine and asparagine/aspartic acid were associated with worse clinical rank scores in both treatment groups (β, -96.60, P = 0.001 and β, -0.02, P = 0.01; after renal adjustment, P = 0.09 and .02, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

Our study provides a potential mechanism for the effects of sildenafil that, through adverse effects on mitochondrial function and endoplasmic reticulum stress, could have contributed to the neutral trial results in RELAX. Short-chain dicarboxylacylcarnitine metabolites and asparagine/aspartic acid could serve as biomarkers associated with adverse clinical outcomes in HFpEF.

### Saxagliptin and tadalafil differentially alter cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling and left ventricular function in aortic-banded mini-swine [^dcfc5d2c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

A primary strength of our study is the use of in vivo methodology in a large animal model that more closely mimics the human condition, providing translational impact. Less is known about cardiac signal transduction in large mammals, despite the significant differences between large and small mammalian hearts including include life span, heart rate, Ca 2+ handling, tolerance for myocardial injury, and rate of progression of cardiac remodeling. 43 The differences in cardiac biology between small and large mammals are not purely academic. Originally, work from Takimoto et al 6 demonstrated the beneficial effects of PDE5 inhibition showing sildenafil attenuated hypertrophy, decreased fibrosis, and restored LV relaxation kinetics in aortic‐banded mice. Several preclinical and clinical studies followed investigating various methods of preserving cGMP levels, with beneficial results. 5, 9, 10, 15, 44, 45, 46 However, the sole multicenter study targeting this signaling in HFpEF, the RELAX trial (Effect of Phosphodiesterase‐5 Inhibition on Exercise Capacity and Clinical Status in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction), reported equivocal results after testing the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil. 47 The results from our study did not completely reproduce the findings of Takimoto et al. 6 Although direct comparisons of the studies above are tempting, more importantly these differences provide a reminder that the translation of previous work in rodents to larger mammals and/or humans is not inconsequential and should not be assumed.

Limitations

Although the amino acid sequence of the BNP N‐terminus in both humans and pigs is consistent with the substrate specificity of DPP‐4, circulating levels of BNP are considerably lower in pigs compared to humans 48 and this feature of our model should be considered in interpreting our results. Our results showed plasma BNP and ANP levels were unchanged across groups, implying the beneficial effect of saxagliptin on fluid accumulation in the lungs was not dependent on unbalanced natriuretic peptide levels. However, our interpretation of these data is limited by methodology, as the radioimmunoassay used in the current study detects both BNP 1–32 and BNP 3–32 (or total BNP) and does not allow determination of the ratio of intact to cleaved BNP products. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to demonstrate the beneficial effects of saxagliptin on a clinical characteristic of heart failure (lung congestion) in a large animal model of experimental HFpEF.

### Renal dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: insights from the RELAX trial [^13d784e9]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) represent a high-risk phenotype. The Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status and Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (RELAX) trial enrolled a high proportion of CKD participants, allowing investigation into differences in HFpEF by CKD status.

Methods and Results

Among 212 participants, we investigated the associations of CKD with biomarkers, cardiac structure, and exercise capacity, and identified predictors of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over trial follow-up. CKD participants (eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73m 2) were older, had more comorbidities, and had worse diastolic function. Lower eGFR was associated with higher levels of endothelin-1, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, uric acid, and biomarkers of fibrosis (P < .05 for all). Whereas lower eGFR was associated with worse peak oxygen consumption (VO 2) after adjustment for demographics, clinical comorbidities, exercise modality, ejection fraction, and chronotropic index (β coefficient per 1 SD decrease in eGFR: -0.61, 95% CI: -1.01, -0.22, P = 0.002), this association was attenuated after further adjustment for hemoglobin (β coefficient: -0.26, 95% CI: -0.68, 0.16, P = 0.22). Hemoglobin mediated 35% of the association between eGFR and peak VO 2. Sildenafil therapy was independently associated with worsening eGFR over the trial (β coefficient: -2.79, 95% CI: -5.34, -0.24, P = 0.03).

Conclusion

Renal dysfunction in HFpEF is characterized by echocardiographic and biomarker profiles indicative of more advanced disease, and reduced hemoglobin is a strong mediator of the association between renal dysfunction and low exercise capacity. Sildenafil therapy was associated with worsening of renal function in RELAX.

### Spironolactone for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^378c6f25]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The study TOPCAT was published by Pitt B and colleagues in 2014 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the TOPCAT study, the trial question was: what is the effect of spironolactone in patients with HFpEF? In the TOPCAT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TOPCAT study, the population was: 3445 patients (1775 female, 1670 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HFpEF. The key exclusion criteria were severe systemic illness with a life expectancy of < 3 years, severe renal dysfunction, and specific coexisting conditions, medications, or acute events. In the TOPCAT study, the interventions were: n = 1722 spironolactone (15–45 mg/day) n = 1723 placebo (matching placebo). In the TOPCAT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF (18.6% vs. 20.4%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04). In the TOPCAT study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalization for HF (12% vs. 14.2%; HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99) No significant difference in cardiovascular death (9.3% vs. 10.2%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12) No significant difference in aborted cardiac arrest (0.2% vs. 0.3%; HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.5). In the TOPCAT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, serum creatinine level ≥ 3.0 mmg/dL, or dialysis. significant difference in hyperkalemia (18.7% vs. 9.1%) and hypokalemia (16.2% vs. 22.9%). In the TOPCAT study, the conclusion was: in patients with HFpEF, spironolactone was not superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF.

### Efficacy and safety of diuretics in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a scoping review [^eac83388]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Diuretics reduce congestion in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, comparison of clinical effects across diuretic classes or combinations of diuretics in patients with HFpEF are not well described. Therefore, we sought to conduct a scoping review to map trial data of diuretic efficacy and safety in patients with HFpEF.

Review Methods and Results

We searched multiple bibliometric databases for published literature and ClinicalTrials.gov, and hand searched unpublished studies comparing different classes of diuretics to usual care or placebo in patients with HFpEF. We included randomised controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies. Two authors independently screened and extracted key data using a structured form. We identified 13 published studies on diuretics in HFpEF, with 1 evaluating thiazide use, 7 on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and 5 on sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). There remain 17 ongoing trials evaluating loop diuretics (n = 1), MRAs (n = 5), SGLT2i (n = 10) and a polydiuretic (n = 1), including 2 well-powered trials of SGLT2i that will be completed in 2021.

Conclusions

The limited number of published trials evaluating different classes of diuretics in patients with HFpEF have been generally small and short term. Ongoing and emerging trials of single or combination diuretics with greater power will be useful to better define their safety and efficacy. SCOPING REVIEW REGISTRATION: doi:10.18131/g3-dejv-tm77.

Results

Study Population

A total of 20 subjects were randomized in a 2:1 manner to receive tadalafil (n = 14) or placebo (n = 6). Baseline characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1 and were similar between groups. The median age in the tadalafil group was 71 years compared with 64 years in the placebo group, and the overall cohort was predominantly men (65%). The median LVEF in both groups was ≈37%. Baseline laboratory measures of kidney and humoral function were similar between groups. The median tadalafil dose achieved was 15 mg daily. The tadalafil dose achieved was as follows: 20 mg daily (n = 6), 15 mg daily (n = 2), 10 mg daily (n = 2), and 5 mg daily (n = 4).

Baseline Characteristics

Cardiorenal Response to Volume Expansion at Visit 1

Volume expansion with normal saline (0.9% at 0.25 mL/kg per minute for 1 hour) was performed at visit 1 before randomization to treatment groups. Similar to prior data, there was no significant increase in GFR, renal plasma flow, urine flow, urinary sodium or cGMP excretion, and plasma cGMP in subjects with PHF in response to volume expansion (Table S2). Similarly, there was no change in ejection fraction, cardiac index, ratio of the transmitral early diastolic peak velocity (E) to the early diastolic tissue Doppler velocity of the mitral annulus (e') (E/e'), and right ventricular systolic pressure with volume expansion. The lack of activation of plasma and renal cGMP in response to volume expansion suggests impaired baseline cGMP response in these subjects.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^b4a26e84]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — exercise and calorie restriction guidance and trial data indicate activity targets and physiologic benefit. Increased physical activity, preferably aerobic physical activity (eg, brisk walking) for ≥ 150 minutes/week (equal to ≥ 30 minutes/ day on most days of the week), is recommended for initial weight loss. In a randomized trial of 100 older individuals with obesity and HFpEF, peak oxygen consumption was increased by 1.2 mL/kg/min in individuals randomized to aerobic exercise 3 times per week and/or caloric restriction of 400 kilocalories daily, and adding resistance training to aerobic exercise and caloric restriction improved leg muscle strength.
