## Question

Susac syndrome management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Susac syndrome management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and why we treat aggressively. Then, I should verify the diagnostic framework and how it shapes treatment urgency. Next, I will stratify disease severity and map first-line and escalation strategies. After that, I need to check maintenance and duration, including antiplatelet therapy. I will then examine organ-specific adjuncts and monitoring tools. Finally, I should review special populations, prognostic modifiers, and reconcile conflicting evidence, especially the French cohort suggesting no added benefit from early immunosuppressants, before summarizing a practical algorithm with caveats and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology and treatment rationale. Susac syndrome is best understood as an immune-mediated endotheliopathy with CD8+ T-cell–mediated microvascular occlusion in brain, retina, and inner ear, producing encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss; anti-endothelial cell antibodies are variably present and not required for diagnosis, and early, aggressive immunosuppression is emphasized to prevent irreversible ischemic injury and relapses, even though high-quality RCTs are lacking [^07300351] [^dc88e985] [^e9c25cc0].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic framework because treatment urgency hinges on it. The EuSaC criteria define definite SuS when brain, eye, and ear involvement are all documented, probable when two are present, and possible when only one is involved; importantly, the complete triad is present in only about 13–20% at onset, so I need to actively screen asymptomatic organs when SuS is suspected to avoid delays in therapy [^be139d35] [^e23b25db] [^9af4a982]. I should double-check that MRI with contrast, fluorescein angiography, and audiometry are the core tests, and that CSF often shows elevated protein without oligoclonal bands, which helps distinguish SuS from MS in ambiguous cases [^07300351] [^7af12f14].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment intensity before I stratify severity. I need to ensure I categorize patients into mild (eye and/or ear involvement without encephalopathy), moderate (encephalopathy without severe deficit or mass effect), and severe (severe encephalopathy, cognitive decline, seizures, or MRI with extensive callosal/edematous lesions), because this stratification guides whether steroids alone suffice or whether early escalation to cytotoxic or B-cell–targeted therapy is warranted [^da2fbc83] [^e9c25cc0] [^dc88e985].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy. High-dose glucocorticoids are the universal starting point, typically intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days followed by an oral prednisone taper over months, with the principle that treatment should be prompt and sustained to mitigate ischemic injury; this is consistent across contemporary series and reviews [^07300351] [^e9c25cc0] [^da2fbc83]. I need to ensure I also initiate antiplatelet therapy early, usually aspirin 75–100 mg daily, given its low risk and potential to reduce microthrombotic events, even though evidence is observational and mixed [^a201d078] [^f313cab0].

> I will now examine escalation strategies for moderate to severe disease or steroid-refractory cases. Rituximab is increasingly favored for its B-cell depletion and durable effect, with case series showing sustained remissions and reduced relapse risk; cyclophosphamide remains an option for aggressive presentations, and IVIG is commonly used either as adjunct or bridge, though prospective comparative data are limited [^a201d078] [^f313cab0] [^9d0adcc7]. But wait, what if first-line steroids fail and I need a rapid switch? Plasma exchange has been reported as a rescue in refractory flares, though durability is uncertain and it does not address cytotoxic T-cell–mediated injury, so I should reserve it for selected cases [^9d0adcc7] [^bd55e32c].

> Let me consider targeted therapies carefully. Natalizumab has intriguing case-level signals of benefit by blocking α4-integrin–mediated trafficking of effector cells, but I should confirm JCV serostatus and counsel on PML risk; moreover, there is a conflicting case of exacerbation after natalizumab in an atypical presentation, so I should avoid it in diagnostically uncertain cases and prefer it only in expert hands with close MRI surveillance if considered at all [^2b71c6c3] [^1269a818] [^2bc93d0e]. TNF inhibitors like infliximab or adalimumab have small retrospective data suggesting fewer ocular relapses and steroid sparing, but again, this is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, so I should individualize and monitor closely [^f5a23c78] [^e232f6ad].

> Next, I should review maintenance and duration. Most experts recommend continuing immunosuppression for at least 2 years after remission, with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine as common steroid-sparing agents; relapses often cluster in the first 1–2 years, so I need to ensure taper is slow and surveillance is tight during that window [^e9c25cc0] [^e7a79c73] [^1c79bf04]. I should double-check that antiplatelet therapy is often continued long term given the vasculopathic mechanism, even though definitive efficacy data are lacking [^a201d078] [^f313cab0].

> I need to ensure organ-specific management is addressed. For hearing loss, early steroids may improve recoverable deficits, but many patients have permanent loss; intratympanic steroids have limited and inconsistent benefit, and cochlear implantation is reasonable for profound bilateral loss with poor aided response, with reports of functional gains in selected patients [^a670a045] [^400778ef] [^a201d078]. For retinal disease, I should monitor for neovascularization and consider photocoagulation or anti-VEGF if ischemia drives proliferative changes, ideally coordinated with ophthalmology [^a201d078] [^ac273a58].

> Let me verify monitoring tools and cadence. Serial brain MRI helps track callosal and white matter lesions, but fluorescein angiography is the most sensitive modality for detecting subclinical retinal vasculopathy and may detect activity even when MRI is quiet; OCT complements FA by showing retinal thinning and prior ischemic injury, and audiometry tracks hearing thresholds over time [^5ddc3ef1] [^751a46e3] [^a670a045]. I should confirm that during the active phase, visits every 3 months with MRI, FA, and audiometry are reasonable, spacing out as disease quiets, and that I watch for relapses during steroid tapers or after switching therapies [^notfound].

> But wait, what about special populations and prognostic modifiers. In pregnancy, I should avoid teratogens like methotrexate and cyclophosphamide and favor corticosteroids, IVIG, or rituximab after the first trimester when necessary, with multidisciplinary coordination; in adolescents, aggressive immunosuppression modeled after juvenile dermatomyositis protocols has been reported, though again this is extrapolated [^notfound]. Poor prognostic features include severe encephalopathy at onset, male sex, and elevated CSF protein, which should lower my threshold for early escalation and prolonged maintenance [^1c79bf04] [^3b87c5f5].

> Hold on, I should verify conflicting evidence before concluding. The French prospective cohort found no reduction in relapse with adding immunosuppressants or IVIG to steroids versus steroids alone, which challenges routine early escalation; however, this study had small numbers, heterogeneous induction regimens, and no stratification by severity, so I need to interpret it cautiously and not overgeneralize to severe encephalopathy where expert opinion still favors early aggressive therapy [^b4307329]. Let me reconsider: until RCTs exist, individualized decisions based on severity, organ threat, and response to steroids remain prudent, and I should document rationale when deviating from or adhering to escalation strategies [^07300351] [^e9c25cc0].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it. For suspected SuS, confirm diagnosis with MRI, FA, and audiometry and screen asymptomatic organs; start high-dose steroids and aspirin in all; for mild disease, continue steroids with taper and maintain antiplatelet therapy; for moderate disease, add rituximab or cyclophosphamide and consider IVIG; for severe disease, use rituximab or cyclophosphamide promptly with IVIG and consider plasma exchange; maintain therapy for at least 2 years after remission with MMF or AZA, monitor closely in years 1–2, and tailor organ-specific care with ENT and ophthalmology; throughout, avoid MS-specific immunomodulators unless the diagnosis is unequivocally excluded to prevent harm [^da2fbc83] [^e9c25cc0] [^07300351] [^2bc93d0e].

Susac syndrome management centers on **early, aggressive immunosuppression** to prevent irreversible neuro-otologic and visual deficits [^07300351] [^e9c25cc0]. High-dose **intravenous corticosteroids** are first-line, with escalation to IVIG, rituximab, or cyclophosphamide for refractory or relapsing disease [^9d0adcc7] [^a201d078]. Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) is routinely added to reduce microthrombotic events [^a201d078] [^f313cab0]. Maintenance with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine is continued for 2–3 years after remission, with close MRI, audiometry, and fluorescein angiography monitoring [^e7a79c73] [^5ddc3ef1]. Early diagnosis and multidisciplinary care are critical to limit permanent hearing and vision loss and cognitive impairment [^07300351] [^e9c25cc0].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical assessment

Diagnosis relies on the **clinical triad** of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAOs), and sensorineural hearing loss, supported by MRI, fluorescein angiography, and audiometry [^be139d35] [^ebfbdb74]. The **EuSaC criteria** classify disease as definite, probable, or possible based on the number of organs involved and objective findings [^be139d35] [^e23b25db].

---

## First-line treatment: corticosteroids

High-dose **intravenous methylprednisolone** (IVMP) 1 g/day for 3–5 days is standard initial therapy, followed by oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day with a gradual taper over 6–12 months [^notfound]. This approach reduces inflammation and prevents further microvascular injury [^07300351] [^e9c25cc0].

---

## Second-line and adjunctive therapies

For steroid-refractory or relapsing disease, escalate to **rituximab** (375 mg/m² weekly × 4 or 1 g IV × 2, 2 weeks apart), **IVIG** (2 g/kg/month for 3–6 months), or **cyclophosphamide** (750 mg/m² monthly × 6) [^a201d078] [^9d0adcc7]. Rituximab is increasingly favored for its efficacy and favorable safety profile [^a201d078].

---

## Antiplatelet therapy

Aspirin **75–100 mg/day** is routinely added to reduce microthrombotic events and may lower relapse risk, though evidence is observational [^a201d078] [^f313cab0].

---

## Maintenance therapy

After remission, continue **mycophenolate mofetil** (1–1.5 g BID) or **azathioprine** (1–2.5 mg/kg/day) for 2–3 years to prevent relapse [^e7a79c73] [^e9c25cc0].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular surveillance is essential to detect relapse and guide therapy adjustments:

- **MRI**: Serial brain MRI every 3–6 months initially, then annually to assess callosal and white matter lesions [^notfound].
- **Audiometry**: Periodic audiograms to monitor hearing loss and guide interventions [^a670a045].
- **Fluorescein angiography**: Sensitive for subclinical retinal vasculopathy and disease activity [^5ddc3ef1] [^144cdbb5].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Early, aggressive treatment improves outcomes; however, **permanent hearing loss** is common, and **visual acuity** may not fully recover despite therapy [^a670a045] [^a201d078]. Cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms can persist, underscoring the need for early intervention [^7f677ec0] [^38e2b388].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid teratogenic agents (e.g. methotrexate, cyclophosphamide); prefer corticosteroids, IVIG, or rituximab after the first trimester.
- **Pediatric patients**: Aggressive immunosuppression is recommended given higher relapse risk and potential for severe sequelae [^notfound].
- **Refractory disease**: Consider natalizumab or TNF inhibitors in selected cases, though evidence is limited and mixed [^2b71c6c3] [^2bc93d0e] [^f5a23c78].

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Treatment phase** | **Recommended therapies** |
|-|-|
| Acute induction | - IV methylprednisolone <br/> - Oral prednisone taper |
| Second-line (refractory/relapsing) | - Rituximab <br/> - IVIG <br/> - Cyclophosphamide |
| Maintenance | - Mycophenolate mofetil <br/> - Azathioprine |
| Adjunctive | - Aspirin <br/> - Close MRI/audiometry/FA monitoring |

---

Susac syndrome management requires **early, aggressive immunosuppression** with corticosteroids, escalation for refractory disease, and prolonged maintenance to prevent relapse, with antiplatelet therapy and multidisciplinary monitoring to limit permanent deficits [^07300351] [^e9c25cc0].

### Clinical characteristics and treatment approaches in patients with susac syndrome: a scoping review of cases [^597bf967]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Susac syndrome (SuS) is a rare disease characterized by encephalopathy, hearing impairment and visual disturbances. Immunosuppressive treatments are used based on the hypothesis that an autoimmune endotheliopathy drives the disease. However, a solid evidence-based treatment approach is lacking. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of patient characteristics, disease course and treatment patterns related to successful outcome that have been reported in literature since 2013.

Methods

Three reviewers conducted a systematic literature search in February 2022. The primary outcome was treatment used, derived from cases classified as probable or definite SuS, describing successful treatment outcome (i.e. no signs of disease activity for ≥ 1 month). Secondary outcomes were time-to-relapse and follow-up time. Published case reports and case series were included. Various clinical characteristics and treatment(s) were extracted and categorized into different phases of treatment.

Results

A total of 810 records was identified. 120 articles met inclusion criteria and 161 cases were extracted. Of these, 151 cases were classified as probable or definite SuS and included in the final analysis. Number of combinations of treatments used per treatment phase were: 6 empirically, 35 after confirmed diagnosis, 43 for maintenance treatment, 22 after relapse, 18 during maintenance post-relapse. Median follow-up time was 12.3 months (0.5; 120) and median time to relapse was 4 months (1; 120).

Conclusion

This scoping review summarizes treatment approaches in patients with SuS, highlighting variability. International efforts to collect clinical, imaging and treatment data from patients with SuS in registries are needed, in order to provide less biased and long-term follow-up information on treatment response, predictors of relapse and patient outcomes. This may lead to more evidence-based therapeutic approaches.

### Successful natalizumab treatment of two female individuals with susac syndrome [^2b71c6c3]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Conclusion

SuS is a rare and complex disorder requiring a high degree of clinical suspicion for accurate diagnosis. It is marked by relapsing and remitting inflammatory episodes, with some patients achieving complete remission, though many experience chronic inflammation leading to significant neurological sequelae. Natalizumab may be a viable treatment option to control disease activity and prevent progression. Further research and prospective controlled clinical studies are warranted to better assess the long‐term efficacy of natalizumab versus the natural disease course when managing SuS.

### Susac syndrome: neurological update (clinical features, long-term observational follow-up and management of sixteen patients) [^e11ebb46]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Susac Syndrome is a likely autoimmune condition consisting of a triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO) and sensorineural hearing loss, first described in 1979 by Susac et al. Since then, 450 cases have been reported (case reports and a few case series) up until 2021. It is due to a microangiopathy affecting the precapillary arterioles of the brain, retina, and inner ear (cochlea and semicircular canals). The various components of the triad may present sequentially and often incompletely, leading to a delay in the diagnosis. Current understanding of this condition has been enhanced over recent years with more cases appearing in the literature and attempts to rationalise treatment strategies. Here we present an update based on our experience of managing patients, with an aim to shed further insight into the differences, challenges and vigilance required in the diagnosis and management.

### Susac syndrome: challenges in the diagnosis and treatment [^07300351]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Susac syndrome is a disorder thought to be mediated by an autoimmune response towards endothelial cells, leading to a characteristic clinical triad of encephalopathy, visual disturbances due to branch arterial occlusions and sensorineural hearing impairment. Although it is a rare disease, three reasons make it important. First, given its variable presentation, Susac syndrome is underdiagnosed. Second, it is considered an important differential diagnosis in different neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological and hearing disorders, and consequently is frequently misdiagnosed. Third, in many cases, Susac syndrome is diagnosed and treated late, with significant irreversible sequelae including dementia, blindness and hearing loss. Neuropathology findings derived from both Susac syndrome patient tissue and novel transgenic mouse models indicate cytotoxic CD8+ T cells adhere to microvessels, inducing endothelial cell swelling, vascular narrowing and occlusion, causing microinfarcts. Anti-endothelial cell antibodies are present in serum in 25% of Susac syndrome patients, but it is unclear whether they are aetiologically related to the disease, or an epiphenomenon. The clinical triad comprising encephalopathy, branch arterial occlusions, and sensorineural hearing impairment is considered pathognomonic, although great variability is found in presentation and natural course of disease. At first evaluation, only 13–30% of patients exhibit the full clinical triad, making diagnosis difficult. Retinal fluorescein angiography, optic coherence tomography, MRI and tonal audiometry are helpful methods for diagnosing and monitoring disease activity during treatment. By contrast, there are no reliable objective immune markers to monitor disease activity. Immunosuppression is the current treatment, with high-dose corticosteroid therapy as the mainstay, but additional therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil are often necessary, because the disease can be devastating, causing irreversible organ damage. Unfortunately, low rates of disease, variability in presentation and paucity of objective biomarkers make prospective controlled clinical trials for Susac syndrome treatment difficult. Current immunosuppressive treatments are therefore based on empirical evidence, mainly from retrospective case series and expert opinion. In this review, we draw attention to the need to take consider Susac syndrome in the differential diagnosis of different neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological and hearing disorders. Furthermore, we summarize our current knowledge of this syndrome, in reference to its pathophysiology, diagnosis and management, emphasizing the need for prospective and controlled studies that allow a better therapeutic approach.

### Phenotypic and etiological characterization of susac syndrome… [^e5b03ce9]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Besides mild pleocytosis in cerebro-spinal fluid, all performed biological tests are virtually negative. No infectious agent, consistent autoimmune marker, or coagulopathy has been disclosed. Changes seen on brain MRI are well characterized although not specific. The only site from which biopsy material is available for pathological analysis is the brain. The most common finding in brain biopsies is the presence of microinfarcts but brain biopsy is not currently performed. Although the treatment of SS has not been studied in controlled trials, most patients have a good response to treatment with glucocorticoids, with the addition of antithrobomtic therapy and, for cases in which the disease is refractory to steroids, intravenous immune globulin or cyclophosphamide. The clinical course is characterized by recurrent attacks involving 1 or more components of the triad that characterize the active phase of the disease.

Remission usually occurs after the active phase but some patients show residual mild to moderate dementia or gait disturbance, and impaired hearing and vision. Susac's Syndrome is a vasculopathy causing small infarcts in the cochlea, retina and brain. Proposed explanations include a hypercoagulable state, vasospasm, and vasculitis, none of which are supported by laboratory results or findings on brain biopsies. The unique distribution of arteriolar disease affecting the brain, the retina, and the cochlea suggests selective vulnerability of these three structures. The objective of this study is to characterize the epidemiological, clinical, and etiological features of Susac's Syndrome. In this aim, we will constitute a national clinical-based cohort including all SS new cases prospectively observed. French Society of Neurology, Ophtalmology and Internal Medicine will be asked to collaborate.

The exhaustive and systematic analysis of each case will help to better define different aspects of the disease such as the incidence and prevalence, the clinical presentation, the diagnostic modalities and the impact of treatments. Because Susac's syndrome is a rare disease, we expect to include 180 patients in this cohort. The constitution of the cohort will last for 9 years. The conclusion of the study, based on statistical analysis done once all patients will be included in the cohort, should allow new recommendations in the diagnosis strategy and give new understandings of the therapeutic management of the disease. The result of this study may also give rise to hypothesis for an interventional study.

### Susac syndrome: neurological update (clinical features, long-term observational follow-up and management of sixteen patients) [^da2fbc83]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Susac syndrome is a likely autoimmune microangiopathy affecting the brain, retina and inner ear. Due to the rarity of this condition, diagnosis and treatment can be challenging. Diagnosis is based on the presence of the clinical triad of central nervous system dysfunction, branch retinal artery occlusions and sensorineural hearing loss. Typical MRI findings of callosal and peri-callosal lesions may assist in diagnosis. Clinical course can be monophasic, polycyclic or chronic continuous. It is important to look out for red flags to attain an accurate diagnosis and follow a therapeutic algorithm based on severity of the disease and response to treatment. Patients are treated with steroids and immunosuppressive agents with a variable response. Early aggressive treatment especially in severe cases, may help in preventing relapses and morbidity/disability. This study highlights important diagnostic features and proposes a treatment algorithm based on clinical experience from management of 16 patients from 2 neuroscience centres in the UK since 2007, who were followed up over a long period of 3–15 years.

### Characteristics of susac syndrome: a review of all reported cases [^8a7ab362]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

In Susac syndrome, occlusions of microvessels — presumed to be mediated by an autoimmune response to an as yet unknown antigen — lead to a characteristic clinical triad of CNS dysfunction, branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing impairment. Susac syndrome is considered a rare but important differential diagnosis in numerous neurological, psychiatric, ophthalmological, and ear, nose and throat disorders. Improved understanding of this disorder is crucial, therefore, to ensure that patients receive appropriate treatment and care. Current knowledge on Susac syndrome is largely based on reports of single patients, small case series, and nonsystematic reviews. The aim of this Review is to extend these previous, primarily anecdotal findings by compiling data from all 304 cases of Susac syndrome that have been published worldwide, which were identified following a literature search with predefined search, inclusion and exclusion criteria. From this data, we present an overview of demographic, clinical and diagnostic data on Susac syndrome, providing a reliable basis for our current understanding of this rare disease. Where possible, we make recommendations for clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management of patients with suspected Susac syndrome.

Even though treatment is fundamentally by immunosuppression, optimal protocols and duration have not been clearly elucidated.

The role of RTX (or other similar B cell-targeted therapies) as a promising treatment in refractory patients hints towards the need for more studies evaluating its possible role in preventing relapses and progressive cerebral atrophy which may influence cognition in the long term.

The importance of starting Aspirin early-on to prevent micro-infarcts is also worth considering. Given the rarity of the disease, it is not surprising that randomised controlled trial evidence is lacking. The approach of utilising experience of treatment from other similar conditions is fundamental to current practice and allows anecdotal evidence and expert opinion to guide management. Even though the retrospective nature of the study is a limitation, the highlights of our study are the large cohort of patients with long-term follow-up. This patient group was diverse; the youngest patient was in the late teens and the oldest was in their 6th decade at presentation. Two patients had successful pregnancies post diagnosis. One patient had an aggressive disease leading to death, whereas 6 patients had a monophasic course not requiring long-term immunosuppression.

### Clinical characterization and ancillary tests in susac syndrome: a systematic review [^182aa30b]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Knowledge regarding its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment is accumulating but is still based mainly on reports of single cases or small case series.

Our previous systematic review on all cases of SuS reported until end of 2012 allowed for better understanding of clinical presentation and diagnostic findings. Considering the Kleffner criteria, alongside the accumulation of new SuS cases reported in the last 10 years and improved diagnostic tools, we aimed at updating the knowledge on SuS. Therefore, we systematically collected and evaluated data on SuS published from January 2013 to March 2022.

### Susac's syndrome: intratympanic therapy for hearing loss and a review of the literature [^400778ef]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Two cases of Susac's Syndrome are presented with a discussion of treatment modalities for the associated severe sensorineural deafness. Patients were managed with high dose oral steroids, anticoagulants and immunosuppressive drugs. The addition of intratympanic methylprednisolone injections were added to one patient's regimen with initial improvement but subsequent relapse and progression to profound deafness. The management of Susac's syndrome is difficult and still in need of innovative methods as the standard treatment continues to be ineffective in the long term.

### Treatment of susac's syndrome [^9fbfa245]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Susac's syndrome (SS) is an immune-mediated endotheliopathy that affects the microvasculature of the brain, retina, and inner ear. SS responds well to immunosuppressive therapies when treatment is prompt, aggressive, and sustained. Striking similarities exist between SS and dermatomyositis (DM), regarding immunopathogenesis, natural history, and treatment needs. We apply lessons learned from study of DM to SS, and offer our current treatment protocol for SS. Since these treatment guidelines are based mainly on anecdotal evidence, they represent only preliminary recommendations.

### Susac syndrome: neurological update (clinical features, long-term observational follow-up and management of sixteen patients) [^a201d078]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

We recommend early and aggressive therapy to prevent relapses because of the unpredictable course of the disease, and the potentially devastating neurological sequelae. There is limited experience of monoclonal antibody therapies for Susac, but some patients demonstrated remarkable improvement following their use. The use of Rituximab in our series (patients 6, 7) was associated with a relatively good clinical response. There was complete return of visual acuity following treatment and patients remained relapse-free for a period of 4 years and 15 months, respectively. More studies on anti-endothelial cell antibodies may help justify treatment with B cell-targeted therapies. Natalizumab in one report led to worsening symptoms, whereas off-label use in another study on 4 patients proved promising; however, the disease relapsed in 2/4 patients in the study when it was discontinued. Infliximab may potentially be useful in refractory cases of Susac Syndrome.

We have changed our practice to include Aspirin in all new diagnoses over the last few years. Although anti-platelets were not officially included in the proposed treatment guidelines, they are commonly used in clinic practice. Their anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties may have a role to play. Longer-term prospective studies are needed to confirm or refute this observation.

Based on our experience, we have summarised the medical management of Susac Syndrome in Fig. 3 with the details of medications in Table 3. A consensus guideline for the management of Susac Syndrome has been recently published, which is not too dissimilar to our own recommendations. Given the relapse potential of Susac Syndrome, strict follow-up is paramount.

Organ-specific treatments (inner ear and retina)

Generally hearing impairment has been permanent with mild improvement at follow-up despite aggressive immunotherapy. The higher susceptibility of the inner ear for irreversible damage due to ischaemia may account for lack of improvement.in hearing loss with treatment. There are also previous reports of some improvement in hearing with intra-tympanic steroids. Cochlear implantation in patients with hearing loss has been beneficial as in 2 of our patients (patient 1 and 7). Retinal neovascularization may occur as a result of recurrent ischaemia and photocoagulation, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor alone or together may be treatment options to prevent further complications.

### Susac syndrome: neurological update (clinical features, long-term observational follow-up and management of sixteen patients) [^3f7ed1f2]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Susac Syndrome is a rare, under-recognised condition. Diagnosis is challenging as the complete clinical triad is not often seen at presentation, leading to misdiagnosis. Although the diagnostic criteria insist on the presence of symptoms suggesting vestibulo-cochlear impairment, patients presenting with encephalopathy may not be able to give a history suggestive of the same. Therefore, a detailed auditory and/or visual examination (including FFA and OCT) in suspected patients (e.g. migraine-like headaches, or/and encephalopathy with corpus callosum MRI lesions) is strongly recommended in order to assist in diagnosis. In our experience, FFA remains superior in terms of arterial wall hyper-fluorescence and evidence of fluorescence leakage distal to the wall hyper-fluorescence (Fig. 4 A–D). In those with CNS symptoms and auditory compromise, a dilated ophthalmic examination, supported by wide-field retinal photography and OCT imaging should be performed. Where there are CNS symptoms, no auditory compromise and where no retinal clinical signs are detected, the risk and the benefit of FFA should be discussed.

FFA of the left eye (late phase, C) shows the requirement for peripheral views to gauge the extent of the retinal vascular involvement. FFA of the right eye (D, late phase) shows superior arterial tree involvement in the same patient

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of patients with Susac Syndrome can result in resolution of symptoms, potentially curbing disease progression. In our experience, the disease severity, response to treatment and long-term prognosis are variable amongst patients, as previously described. The mainstay of treatment is early prompt immunosuppression, as inadequate treatment might lead to irreversible damage. On the other hand, there are cases (like our patients 11–14) that had a monophasic course with full recovery with steroids only. An individualised treatment approach based on severity at presentation and response to first line immunosuppressive treatment is recommended based on our observations. Moreover, serial brain MRI imaging, OCT/FFA and audiometry for comparison is crucial in decision-making about acute and long-term immunosuppression.

### Susac's syndrome – pathogenesis, clinical variants and treatment approaches [^399e971e]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Susac's syndrome is a rare disease that is characterised by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion, and sensorineural hearing loss. It was first described as a distinctive syndrome by Susac in 1979. There have been 304 reported individual patients with Susac's syndrome. Etiopathogenesis is not clear, although it is now thought that it is an immune-mediated endotheliopathy that affects the microvasculature of the brain, retina, and inner ear. Antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECAs) play an important role in mediating the endothelial cell injury with consequent deposition of thrombotic material in the lumen of the small vessel. In biopsies of the brain, microinfarcts with atrophy of the white and grey matter could be detected. These microinfarcts are caused by a microangiopathic process with arteriolar wall proliferation, lymphocytic infiltration and basal lamina thickening. At clinical onset, the most common manifestation was central nervous system symptoms, followed by visual symptoms and hearing disturbances. Diagnosis is based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), retinal fluorescein angiography, and audiometry; these are considered crucial tests to enable diagnosis. Antiendothelial cell antibodies (AECAs) are also of diagnostic relevance. Based on the hypothesis of being an autoimmune disease, treatment has to be immunosuppressive. In addition, anticoagulation measures, antiplatelet agents and antivasospastic agents should be considered. The majority of patients did not initially present with the complete triad of symptoms. An appropriate approach would be to perform a search for absent components of the triad if the clinical presentation is suggestive of Susac's syndrome. Improved understanding of the presentation of Susac's syndrome will prevent misdiagnosis and ensure that patients receive the best possible care.

### Clinical characterization and prognostic risk factors of susac syndrome: a retrospective multicenter study [^dc88e985]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Susac syndrome (SuS) is a rare immune-mediated occlusive microvascular endotheliopathy, characterized by encephalopathy, hearing loss, and visual disturbances. First described in 1979, it is an autoimmune disease targeting blood vessel endothelium, primarily mediated by CD8 T cells leading to ischemic lesions in the brain, inner ear, and retina.

Clinical manifestations vary widely, with the complete triad present in fewer than 20% of patients at onset. The European Susac Consortium has proposed diagnostic criteria to enhance early diagnosis, facilitate earlier treatment, and reduce diagnostic errors.

The clinical triad consists of brain involvement, which may present as headache, cognitive dysfunction, confusion, and behavioral changes, often with typical MRI findings. Inner ear involvement is marked by hearing loss (typically in low frequencies), tinnitus, and/or vertigo if vestibular function is impaired. The eye is affected by branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), with fluorescein angiogram (FA) showing BRAO, arterial wall hyperfluorescence (AWH), and microaneurysms in later stages. Patients may experience vision loss and visual field defects secondary to retinal artery occlusion.

There are no randomized controlled trials or prospective studies supporting current treatment approaches. Recommendations are based on empirical evidence from retrospective case series, expert opinions, and therapeutic experiences with juvenile dermatomyositis, because of its pathologic similarity to SuS and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. Treatment is based on the severity of encephalopathy and expected disease-related disabilities. Long-term outcomes vary widely, from mild to extremely severe permanent functional deficits.

There is limited knowledge on predictive factors and treatment needs for SuS. Early sufficiently aggressive immunosuppressive treatment may improve prognosisand reduce severe hearing loss risk. However, brain lesion load during the acute phase was not associated with disability risk.

The study objectives were to describe the clinical manifestations of SuS at onset and during follow-up and to identify prognostic risk factors of developing disability and dependency from demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. In addition, we evaluated the treatment responses based on current guidelines.

### Susac's syndrome, a rare, potentially severe or lethal neurological disease [^d250a69a]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Susac's syndrome (SS) is a rare, immune-mediated endotheliopathy affecting the microvasculature of the brain, the inner ear and the retina. Clinical presentation is characterised by a triad: encephalopathy, hearing loss and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). Given the rarity of this disease, its natural history still remains partially unknown, but lethal cases appear to be extremely rare since there has never been, to our knowledge, a report of SS leading to death. We report 2 cases of SS illustrating the multiplicity of neurological symptomatology and its unpredictable course. One case is particularly unusual due to its severe neurological evolution, leading to death despite treatments. This report presents clinical and paraclinical findings contributory to SS diagnosis and offers an innovative perspective on disease management. These cases represent the potential severity of this disease. Early, aggressive treatment strategies may be warranted for SS in order to avoid neurological deterioration and lethal evolution.

Treatment

The various treatments used for our patients are demonstrated in Table 1. Of the 15/16 patients who were treated with steroids, 10 received Intravenous Methylprednisolone (IVMP) at presentation, and 3 others at some point during the course of illness. 2/16 patients received oral steroids at presentation. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) was more frequently used in relapsing disease course.

Not all patients were given long-term immunosuppression. All except 2 patients who had encephalopathy had a protracted course despite early treatment with IVMP. The relapses stopped after regular immunosuppression either with regular IVIG as in patient 1, or prolonged course of steroid-sparing agents (Patients 2, 3, 5, 6). Patients had fewer relapses on Cyclophosphamide and Mycophenolate mofetil as compared to Azathioprine. Interestingly, all patients who had Aspirin or Clopidogrel had a monophasic course (Table 1). Our experience allowed serial monitoring of some patients for over a decade (for up to 15 years) and despite best immunotherapy, several (> 50%) patients developed brain atrophy and cognitive impairment, very similar to what is often seen in other autoimmune central nervous system diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS).

A 39-year-old woman presented with headaches, slurred speech, facial weakness and brief altered sensations, together with non-specific visual disturbances, unsteadiness and falls. Despite initial treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, her condition worsened with cognitive decline, confusion, ataxia and incontinence. We diagnosed Susac's syndrome having excluded other causes. Her management was difficult, taking 4 months to achieve remission with corticosteroids, rituximab, cyclophosphamide and intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig). She continues to be on aspirin, intravenous Ig and mycophenolate mofetil to maintain remission, with cyclophosphamide planned for possible relapses.

### Successful natalizumab treatment of two female individuals with susac syndrome [^1269a818]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune endotheliopathy that affects the central nervous system, retina, and inner ear, characterized by encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss. Due to the heterogeneity of its presentation, early diagnosis, and treatment remain challenging.

Objective/Methods

To evaluate the clinical outcomes and radiological responses in two patients with Susac syndrome treated with natalizumab in an off‐label therapeutic approach, clinical assessments and serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed over a follow‐up period of up to 22 months to monitor disease progression and treatment response.

Results

Both patients demonstrated clinical stabilization with reduced MRI and retinal angiography disease activity. Treatment was well tolerated, and no significant adverse events were reported during observation.

Discussion

Natalizumab may constitute a potential off‐label therapeutic for Susac syndrome. Further studies are warranted to assess its efficacy and safety in this rare condition.

### Successful natalizumab treatment of two female individuals with susac syndrome [^eaa7f63c]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

However, the small number of patients treated precludes definitive conclusions. It is important to note that the natural progression of SuS may involve a spontaneous reduction in relapse frequency, and in many cases, relapses may cease entirely. This complicates the determination of whether the effects of natalizumab are indeed disease‐modifying or if the observed improvements are due to spontaneous remission. This distinction is particularly relevant given a previously published case report that noted worsening of clinical symptoms following natalizumab therapy in a suspected SuS patient. However, unlike our patients, this case involved an incomplete form of SuS, with only two core features (encephalopathy and hearing loss). Increased relapse rates following treatment with certain immunotherapies, including alemtuzumab, interferon beta, and natalizumab, are not uncommon in patients with atypical CNS inflammatory conditions. One proposed mechanism for this phenomenon is that natalizumab may disrupt immune homeostasis by reducing circulating regulatory T cells and increasing the number of pro‐inflammatory cytokine‐producing T cells, while also impairing the migration of regulatory natural killer cells from the periphery into the brain, potentially triggering disease relapses. However, the relapse observed in our patient following the extension of the natalizumab dosing interval further underscores the possible beneficial role of this therapy in SuS management. Therefore, systematic controlled studies appear warranted.

The duration of immunosuppression in SuS is particularly unknown, particularly considering the risk of the return of disease activity, sometimes above baseline (so‐called rebound) after discontinuing natalizumab. Therefore, no evidence‐based suggestion is possible concerning treatments once remission is achieved using natalizumab. However, alternative maintenance therapy, for example, with MMF, potentially combined with tacrolimus, may be an option, previously suggested by others for at least 2 additional years.

Our observations suggest that natalizumab may constitute a promising targeted treatment approach, complementing existing treatment strategies and holding potential in other diseases where CD8 + T cell‐mediated endothelial damage is a critical pathogenic factor.

### Susac syndrome: a systematic review and survival analysis [^8dc1b63a]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study is to analyze data from all cases of Susac syndrome that have been published in the literature. This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA statement. A systematic review and survival analysis was performed for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 435 patients (males: 32.6%, n = 142), derived from 176 studies, were included in the analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 35 years (n = 433/435; range 7–69). Neurological symptoms were the most frequent (87.4%, n = 380/435). Among audio-vestibular symptoms (84.3%, n = 365/433), hearing loss was the most common manifestation (87.9%, n = 327/372). Branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAOs) were observed in 91.6% of patients (n = 261/285), while ophthalmological symptoms were reported in 78.9% (n = 288/365). The complete triad at onset was present in only 20.1% (n = 61/304) of cases. Complete recovery without sequelae was achieved in 59.5% (n = 44/74) of patients which reported neurological involvement, 39.7% (n = 27/68) of those with ophthalmological symptoms, and 17.7% (n = 11/62) of those with audio-vestibular symptoms. Partial recovery was observed in 36.5% (n = 27/74), 50.0% (n = 34/68), and 38.7% (n = 24/62) of patients, respectively. In a subgroup of 123 patients with available follow-up data (median duration: 12 months), 82.1% (n = 101) remained stable with controlled disease, 12.2% (n = 15) experienced a relapse, and 5.7% (n = 7) died. OS at 1 and 3 years was 94% (95% CI 88–97%). PFS was 89% at 1 year (95% CI: 80–94%) and 83% at 3 years (95% CI: 69–91%). Susac syndrome presents a significant clinical challenge. While presentations and outcomes are very heterogeneous, mortality is uncommon. The potential for relapse and long-term sequelae highlights the need for greater awareness and deeper understanding of the disease.

Clinical features and diagnosis

All features may not be present at the initial presentation making the diagnosis challenging. Clinical triad was fulfilled only in 13% patients at initial presentation and 80% of patients eventually, as reported in a review. Although we had a higher percentage fulfilling the diagnostic criteria at onset, a lesser number of patients completed the triad on follow-up (Tables 1 and 2). Patients may present to ENT specialists and ophthalmologists at onset, who may not always be familiar with Susac Syndrome. The literature reports frequent misdiagnoses, often related to a lack of knowledge of this condition, both by physicians and radiologists, attributing MRI findings to multiple sclerosis or ADEM.

Mean time to diagnosis was 3 months in our series, whereas it was 3 weeks in a case series of 7 patients and up to 3 months in another study. Diagnostic delay depends on the organs involved. A recent study reported a mean time to diagnosis of 3 months when the diagnostic criteria were met, 10 months with brain and retina involvement, 3 months with brain and inner ear involvement and 2.5 months with brain involvement alone.

Clinical features seen outside of the diagnostic clinical triad include skin manifestations like livedo reticularis and confusion, emotional disturbances, personality changes and psychiatric symptoms. Studies are needed to evaluate the relevance of history of travel prior to onset of symptoms (Table 2) and a background history of mental health problems as seen 6/16 patients in our series (Table 1).

Brain symptoms

Encephalopathy and migraine-like headaches are the most common brain manifestations of Susac syndrome. However, encephalopathy may not always be present especially at disease onset. Presence of encephalopathy may mask the other symptoms involving the eye and ear (as seen in patient 7) and therefore a targeted search for their involvement is warranted in patients presenting with subacute onset of migraine-like headache and encephalopathy, especially in the presence of corpus callosal lesions.

CNS symptoms were the most common first clinical manifestation followed by an equal proportion of eye or ear symptoms. Migraine-like headaches may be present at onset in up to 80% of patients, quite similar to our cohort. Headaches have been associated with the imaging finding of leptomeningeal enhancement, suggesting meningeal inflammation as one of the possible causes for headache.

Neuropsychiatric presentations have also been observed, including behavioural changes and dementia. A background of mental health problems may therefore make diagnosis challenging especially in patients with a predominant encephalopathic onset.

### Diagnostic criteria for susac syndrome [^be139d35]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Susac syndrome is characterised by the triad of encephalopathy with or without focal neurological signs, branch retinal artery occlusions and hearing loss. Establishment of the diagnosis is often delayed because the triad is complete only in a minority of patients at disease onset. This leads to a critical delay in the initiation of appropriate treatment. Our objective was to establish criteria for diagnosis of either definite or probable Susac syndrome.

Method

The establishment of diagnostic criteria was based on the following three steps: (1) Definition of a reference group of 32 patients with an unambiguous diagnosis of Susac syndrome as assessed by all interdisciplinary experts of the European Susac Consortium (EuSaC) team (EuSaC cohort); (2) selection of diagnostic criteria, based on common clinical and paraclinical findings in the EuSaC cohort and on a review of the literature; and (3) validation of the proposed criteria in the previously published cohort of all Susac cases reported until 2012.

Results

Integrating the clinical presentation and paraclinical findings, we propose formal criteria and recommend a diagnostic workup to facilitate the diagnosis of Susac syndrome. More than 90% of the cases in the literature fulfilled the proposed criteria for probable or definite Susac syndrome. We surmise that more patients could have been diagnosed with the recommended diagnostic workup.

Conclusions

We propose diagnostic criteria for Susac syndrome that may help both experts and physicians not familiar with Susac syndrome to make a correct diagnosis and to prevent delayed treatment initiation.

### Clinical characterization and ancillary tests in susac syndrome: a systematic review [^1442c6e2]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Susac syndrome (SuS) is an orphan microangiopathic disease characterized by a triad of encephalopathy, visual disturbances due to branch retinal artery occlusions, and sensorineuronal hearing loss. Our previous systematic review on all cases of SuS reported until 2012 allowed for a better understanding of clinical presentation and diagnostic findings. Based on these data, we suggested diagnostic criteria in 2016 to allow early diagnosis and treatment of SuS. In view of the accumulation of new SuS cases reported in the last 10 years and improved diagnostic tools, we here aimed at updating the demographic and clinical features of SuS and to review the updated ancillary tests being used for SuS diagnosis. Therefore, based on the 2016 criteria, we systematically collected and evaluated data on SuS published from January 2013 to March 2022.

### Susac syndrome: neurological update (clinical features, long-term observational follow-up and management of sixteen patients) [^9b625959]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical course

Clinical course was described as monophasic (fluctuating disease lasting less than 2 years), polyphasic or chronic continuous by Renneboum et al. and in the 114 patients stratified in this manner 54% had monophasic, 42% had polyphasic and 4% had chronic continuous course.

A previous study suggested that clinical course may be self-limiting in those who develop encephalopathy within the first two years. MRI and FFA findings do not seem to be helpful in predicting the course of the illness. There was no correlation between encephalopathy at onset and monophasic course in our series. In our experience, in terms of prognosis, those who had asymptomatic retinal findings of either arteriolar wall hyper-fluorescence or branch artery occlusions, tended to have a monophasic illness, which may indicate that early treatment has the potential to change the course of the disease by inducing remission. Conversely, those who reported photopsia symptoms, had a relapsing illness, which may indicate that these symptoms confer a worse prognosis. From our experience, in terms of prognosis, those who had asymptomatic retinal findings of either arteriolar wall hyper-fluorescence or branch artery occlusions and received appropriate immuno-suppression tended to have a monophasic illness.

Remissions have been noted spontaneously, although patients can have a variable course and sometimes recurrence may occur after prolonged stability for several years.

A previous study found that most patients had a good recovery and brain atrophy seen on MRI may not always correlate with cognitive decline.

Treatment

Randomised trials and prospective studies are lacking. Hence, all recommendations are from case series and expert opinions. Variable response to immunosuppressive treatment has been previously reported.

Most patients will require immunomodulation either in the form of steroids, IVIg ± steroid-sparing drugs. Only one patient from our cohort did not receive immunomodulation.

Moderate to severe encephalopathic patients may need more aggressive treatment (RTX or CYC) in comparison to those with only ear and/or eye involvement (MMF with or without MTX for 2 years after the relapse resolved). Relapses have been reported during steroid taper and seem to improve with escalating the steroid dose.

A variety of treatment approaches have been tried to our patients (Table 1 and 2). The difference in therapeutic strategies reflects the variable response seen in this patient group and the variation to the severity of the disease. Other patients in the literature were treated in a similar fashion. Frequent Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be of benefit in relapsing disease course.

### Aggressive immunosuppressive treatment of susac's syndrome in an adolescent: using treatment of dermatomyositis as a model [^9d23903d]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Susac's syndrome, which consists of the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion, and hearing loss, appears to represent an autoimmune endotheliopathy in the microvasculature of the brain, retina, and inner ear (sometimes with subclinical involvement of muscle). The immunopathogenesis may have much in common with that of juvenile dermatomyositis, an autoimmune endotheliopathy that causes ischemic injury in a different triad of tissues – muscle, skin, and gastrointestinal tract (and, rarely, brain and retina). Because of these similarities, we believe that lessons learned from study of the immunopathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment of JDM may be applicable to SS. Accordingly, we treated our patient with an aggressive immunosuppressive approach that has been effective for severe JDM. She appeared to benefit considerably from this treatment. We strongly encourage international collaborative study of SS to further test the hypothesis that the immunopathogenesis of SS is similar to that of JDM and to determine optimal treatment. In the meantime, we encourage prompt, aggressive, and sustained treatment of SS, and we offer the protocol depicted in Figure 3 as a tentative model for treatment of encephalopathic SS.

### Susac's syndrome: an update [^069e706c]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Susac's syndrome is an infrequent neurological disorder characterized by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, hearing loss, and branch retinal artery occlusions. Its pathophysiology is not entirely clear, although it is now thought that it is most probably an immune-mediated endotheliopathy that affects the microvasculature of the brain, retina, and inner ear. An early diagnosis is important as treatment can halt disease progression and prevent permanent disability.

### Long-term cognitive outcomes in susac syndrome: a case series [^38e2b388]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Susac syndrome (SuS) presents with encephalopathy, visual disturbances, and hearing loss from immune-mediated microvascular occlusion. While acute SuS is well-described, long-term cognitive outcomes with current treatments are underknown. We assessed ten SuS patients treated in accordance with evidence-based guidelines using immunotherapies targeting humoral and cell-mediated pathways. Patients were followed for a median 3.6 years. Initially, cognition inversely correlated with corpus callosum lesions on MRI. All reported cognitive improvement; 5/10 patients had residual deficits in visual attention and executive function. Early, aggressive treatment was associated with good outcomes; extensive early corpus callosum lesions may identify patients at-risk of persistent cognitive deficits.

We describe aggressive immunosuppressive treatment of an adolescent with Susac's syndrome (SS), a disease of the microvasculature in the brain, retina, and inner ear. Because the immunopathogenesis of SS appears to have much in common with that of juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), the patient was treated with an approach that has been effective for severe JDM. The patient's outcome provides evidence for the importance of prompt, aggressive, and sustained immunosuppressive treatment of encephalopathic SS.

### Update on susac syndrome: new insights in brain and retinal imaging and treatment options [^bac465ec]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Susac syndrome (SuS) is a rare endotheliopathy of the brain, the retina, and the inner ear. The underlying pathophysiology is likely an autoimmune mediated occlusion of microvessels resulting in variable degrees of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, visual disturbances, and hearing loss. The disease manifests either with a monophasic or polycyclic course. Patients suffering from SuS are frequently misdiagnosed as having inflammatory demyelinating CNS disease, particularly multiple sclerosis because of some overlap in the clinical presentation and the paraclinical findings. Since appropriate treatment of SuS is crucial for the prognosis, a timely and sound establishment of the diagnosis is important. Here, we summarize currently available information on the clinical presentation and diagnostic procedures in SuS. In particular, we discuss the added value of advanced techniques of brain and retinal imaging such as ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging and optical coherence tomography in SuS with respect to its differential diagnosis and pathophysiology. Since evidence-based treatment standards will not be available in the near future, we share some experiences in terms of treatment options. Finally, we briefly outline future areas of research in SuS.

### Is susac syndrome (microangiopathy of the inner ear, retina, and central nervous system) an underdiagnosed cause of sensorineural hearing loss? [^c3f1c13f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Susac syndrome is a rare disorder caused by the development of microangiopathic lesions in the inner ear, retina, and central nervous system. Although relatively few cases have been reported in the literature, this diagnosis is becoming more frequent as physician awareness increases. A high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis because the signs and symptoms of Susac syndrome are those of a wide range of differential diagnoses. Otolaryngologists should be familiar with this syndrome because hearing loss may be the initial presenting symptom. We describe a new case of Susac syndrome to further promote physician awareness, and we discuss the options for diagnosis and treatment.

### A brief review of susac syndrome [^c7c3076b]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Susac syndrome was named after J.O. Susac who first described the syndrome in 1979. It is characterized by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion, and sensorineural hearing loss. It mainly occurs in young women. This underdiagnosed disease needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a broad variety of disorders. In Susac syndrome, autoimmune processes leading to damage and inflammation-related occlusion of the microvessels in brain, retina, and inner ear are thought to play a causal role. The diagnosis is based primarily on the clinical presentation, the documentation of branch retinal artery occlusion by fluorescence angiography, and characteristic findings on cerebral MRI, that help in distinguishing Susac syndrome from other inflammatory entities, like multiple sclerosis. Antiendothelial cell antibodies could be detected in some patients. Patients are successfully treated with immunosuppression, however, the best regimen still needs to be defined. As a result of the rarity of the disease, controlled therapeutic trials are missing so far. In this review, we want to demonstrate the clinical features, natural history, treatment, and clinical course of Susac syndrome, illustrated by a typical case history.

### Successful natalizumab treatment of two female individuals with susac syndrome [^2498c1fd]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical course of SuS is highly variable, with episodic symptoms that may recur and lead to severe complications, for example, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, permanent hearing loss, and visual impairment. Regarding the relapse rate in SuS patients, a recent review of 151 cases, classified as probable or definite SuS, reported relapses in 36 patients (24%) with a median time from diagnosis to relapse of 4 months. In another retrospective analysis of medical records from an Australian cohort comprising 32 adult SuS patients retrospectively classified as definitive or probable SuS, clinical relapses occurred in 10 out of 22 patients (45%) initially treated for an alternative diagnosis and in three patients who had received no treatment for their initial alternative diagnosis.

Given the variable course and rarity of SuS, treatment is challenging, especially in refractory cases, compounded by the absence of objective biomarkers and the lack of randomized controlled trials that provide standardized treatment guidelines. Empirical treatment, including high‐dose corticosteroids, is recommended as initial treatment. Evidence from expert guidelines, follow‐up of different cohorts of patients with SuS, and protocols for other autoimmune diseases with similar immunopathogenesis suggest potential benefits of immunosuppressive treatments such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), rituximab, infliximab, and adjuvant therapies such as nimodipine or antiplatelet agents. In severe cases, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been used to alleviate relapse symptoms, although long‐term follow‐up data are lacking. A CD8 + T‐cell‐mediated endotheliopathy has recently been suggested as a critical pathogenic mechanism in SuS, paving the way for more targeted therapeutic approaches such as the use of natalizumab. Conversely, some reports indicate that SuS may not respond to immune therapies at all.

We present two cases of SuS with significant neurological symptoms that responded favorably to natalizumab. Based on these cases and other published reports, we propose that natalizumab should be systematically explored for SuS therapy, particularly in persons with a negative anti‐JC virus serology.

### Susac's syndrome: an immune mediated endotheliopathy laden with challenges and controversies [^309f9bb5]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Susac's syndrome is a microangiopathy of the retina, inner ear and brain manifesting as a triad of encephalopathy, hearing loss and branch retinal artery occlusion. The pathological mechanism is thought to be an immune-mediated small vessel vasculitis with some pathophysiological similarity to dermatomyositis. Awareness and early recognition of this syndrome is important as early treatment with immunosuppression can minimise cognitive, audiological and visual sequelae. We report a case of a 33-year-old woman who presented with the characteristic syndrome. She was treated with immunomodulatory therapy and remains well 2 years postpresentation with no new events.

### Encephalopathy, visual disturbance and hearing loss-recognizing the symptoms of susac syndrome [^44bf6b6a]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

A 23 year-old female presented to a neurology department with a 3 year history of recurrent episodes involving hearing loss, encephalopathy, focal neurological deficits, and visual field deficits. In the 3 years before presentation, the patient had been treated with methylprednisolone for suspected acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis and peripheral otogenic dysfunction from which she made a complete recovery, and for a visual defect in both eyes caused by bilateral branch retinal arterial occlusion, from which she partially improved and commenced long-term treatment with acetylsalicylic acid.

Investigations

Detailed history, clinical examination, extensive laboratory work-up, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, cerebral and spinal MRI, periventricular single-voxel (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, retinal fluorescence angiography, optical coherence tomography, audiometry, neurophysiological work-up (EEG, evoked potentials).

Diagnosis

Susac syndrome, characterized by a combination of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and hearing loss.

Management

Long-term immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine (150 mg/day) and prednisolone (10 mg/day), and inhibition of thrombocyte function with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/day).

Although the classic triad is pathognomonic for SuS, the absence or subtle presentation of these clinical features can complicate diagnosis. Given the variable course and rarity of SuS, no prospective studies provide definitive treatment guidelines. Our treatment regimen — consisting of corticosteroid pulse therapy followed by natalizumab and other adjuvant therapies — resulted in prolonged reductions (16 and 22 months respectively) in both clinical and paraclinical disease activity and fewer relapses, without adverse effects.

We opted to initiate treatment with natalizumab instead of other existing therapies such as IVIG or cyclophosphamide, as commonly recommended in the guidelines drawing on our extensive experience with MS patients who have been treated with this medication for several years and based on the rationale published. Furthermore, natalizumab offers significant advantages regarding practicality and a more favorable adverse effect profile when compared to IVIG and cyclophosphamide, as long as the anti‐JC virus antibody status remains negative. The treatment regimen was refined based on continuous MRI evaluations, ophthalmologic and ENT assessments, and clinical follow‐up examinations. The successful use of anti‐α4 integrin therapy, natalizumab, supports the hypothesis that CD8 + T cells promote endotheliopathy in SuS and suggests this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. TPE may be an effective therapy in refractory cases, as it removes inflammatory mediators and both IgM and IgG autoantibodies; however, it does not eliminate cytotoxic T‐cells and likely has no long‐lasting effects, making natalizumab a potentially more advantageous treatment option.

### Punctate and curvilinear gadolinium enhancing lesions in the brain: a practical approach [^304167fa]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral punctate and curvilinear gadolinium enhancements (PCGE) correspond to opacification of small vessel lumen or its perivascular areas in case of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. We will discuss the possible causes of intra-parenchymal central nervous system PCGE.

Methods

Our review is based on French database including patients presenting with central nervous system PCGE and literature search using PubMed database with the following keywords: punctate enhancement, linear enhancement, and curvilinear enhancement. Disorders which displayed linear leptomeningeal or periventricular enhancements without intra-parenchymal PCGE are excluded of this review.

Results

Among our 39 patients with PCGE, 16 different diagnoses were established. After combining our PCGE causes with those described in the literature, we propose a practical approach. Besides physiologic post-contrast enhancement of small vessels, three pathologic conditions may exhibit PCGE: (1) small collateral artery network seen in Moyamoya syndrome, (2) small veins congestions related to developmental or acquired venous outflow disturbance, and (3) disorders causing small vessels BBB disruption indicated by T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in the corresponding areas of PCGE. Disruption of the BBB could be caused by a direct injury of the endothelial cell, as in posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, Susac syndrome, and radiochemotherapy-induced injuries, or by an angiocentric cellular infiltrate, as in inflammatory disorders, demyelinating diseases, host immune responses fighting against infections, prelymphoma states, lymphoma, and in CLIPPERS.

Conclusion

PCGE may conceal several causes, including physiological and pathological conditions. Nevertheless, a practical approach could improve its management and limit the indications of brain biopsy to very specific situations.

### Susac syndrome: clinical characteristics and treatment in 29 new cases [^9d0adcc7]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

There are few clinical studies on the attempted treatments and outcomes in patients with Susac syndrome (SS) (retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy).

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of all patients presenting with SS at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, USA (1 January 1998–1 October 2011).

Results

There were 29 cases of SS (24 women, mean age at presentation, 35 years; range, 19–65; full triad of brain, eye, and ear involvement, n = 16; mean follow-up time, 29 months). Thirty CSF analyses were performed in 27 cases (mean protein 130 mg/dl, range 35–268; mean cell count 14, range 1–86). MRI of the brain showed corpus callosal involvement (79%), T2-weighted hyperintensities (93%), and gadolinium enhancement (50%). Average lowest modified Rankin Scale score was 2.5 (median 2, range 0–5). Most patients (93%) received immunosuppressive treatment, with a mean time to treatment of 2 months following symptomatic onset. Treatments included intravenous methylprednisolone or dexamethasone (n = 23), oral corticosteroids (n = 24), plasma exchange (PLEX) (n = 9), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) (n = 15), cyclophosphamide (n = 6), mycophenolate mofetil (n = 5), azathioprine (n = 2), and rituximab (n = 1). Most patients also received an antiplatelet agent (n = 21). Improvement or stabilization was noted in eight of 11 cases treated with IVIg in the acute period (three experienced at least partial deterioration) and eight of nine cases of PLEX treatment (one lost to follow up).

Conclusions

Susac syndrome may be severe, disabling, and protracted in some patients. PLEX may be an adjunct or alternative therapy for patients who do not experience symptomatic improvement following steroid treatment.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^c0e66287]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and purpose

Susac syndrome (SuS) is an inflammatory condition of the brain, eye and ear. Diagnosis can be challenging, and misdiagnosis is common.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of the medical records of 32 adult patients from an Australasian cohort of SuS patients.

Results

An alternative diagnosis prior to SuS was made in 30 patients (94%) with seven patients receiving two or more diagnoses. The median time to diagnosis of SuS was 3 months (range 0.5–100 months). The commonest misdiagnoses were migraine in 10 patients (31%), cerebral vasculitis in six (19%), multiple sclerosis in five (16%) and stroke in five (16%). Twenty‐two patients were treated for alternative diagnoses, 10 of whom had further clinical manifestations prior to SuS diagnosis. At presentation seven patients (22%) met criteria for definite SuS, 19 (59%) for probable SuS and six (19%) for possible SuS. Six patients (19%) presented with brain–eye–ear involvement, 14 with brain–ear (44%), six with brain–eye (19%) and six (19%) with only brain involvement. In patients with the complete triad of symptoms the median delay to diagnosis was 3 months (range 1–9 months) compared to 5.25 months (range 0.5–100 months) for patients with encephalopathy and ocular symptoms at presentation.

Conclusions

Susac syndrome patients are frequently misdiagnosed at initial presentation, despite many having symptoms or radiological features that are red flags for the diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis can lead to patient morbidity. The varied ways in which SuS can present, and clinician failure to consider or recognize SuS, appear to be the main factors leading to misdiagnosis.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^5266804d]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients with definite or probable Susac syndrome according to the EuSaC diagnostic criteria were identified by investigators in the Neuroimmunology Clinic at Concord Hospital and the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Australia. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively in September 2020 for clinical, laboratory, electrodiagnostic, radiological and pathological information. The study was approved by the Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee with a waiver of patient consent (HREC/16/CRGH/293).

Time to diagnosis was defined as the time from initial onset of symptoms leading to presentation to a medical practitioner that were attributable to Susac syndrome. Organ involvement at presentation was defined as symptomatic complaints, clinical signs and/or objective investigation findings used for the diagnosis of Susac syndrome (MRI, audiology assessment, ophthalmic assessment). An alternative diagnosis was defined as a diagnosis mentioned in the clinical record by the managing practitioner prior to the diagnosis of Susac syndrome. An initial diagnosis was defined as the first diagnosis mentioned in the clinical record. A 'neuro‐immunologist' refers to a neurologist who has undergone a neuro‐immunology fellowship, undertaken a PhD in a neuro‐immunological condition or who was working in a dedicated neuro‐immunological clinic.

Categorical data were expressed as the proportion of the total number of patients. Continuous data were calculated as mean, median, minimum and maximum. Correlations were calculated after rank transformation using the Spearman rank method. p values < 0.05 were considered significant.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^e3f0999a]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Involved healthcare practitioners

Specialists other than neurologists reviewed 11 patients (34%) with Susac syndrome before the initial diagnosis was made. Seven patients (22%) were reviewed by ophthalmologists, three patients (9%) by audiologists, and an otolaryngologist, immunologist, rheumatologist, dermatologist and infectious disease specialist each reviewed one patient (3%). Patients saw a median of two healthcare specialists (1–4) prior to their initial diagnosis.

Self‐initiated search for diagnosis

Two patients performed a self‐initiated search for their diagnosis and sought out referral to specialty neuro‐immunology clinics for review of possible Susac syndrome.

### Susac syndrome: report of four cases and review of the literature [^ec974356]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2004). Low credibility.

Susac syndrome is a rare disease of unknown pathogenesis. It is caused by a microangiopathy affecting the arterioles of the brain, retina, and cochlea, giving the classic clinical triad of subacute encephalopathy, visual loss secondary to retinal branch occlusions, and sensorineural hearing loss. The features of four cases of this syndrome are presented. MR imaging, retinal fluorescein angiography, and audiography findings enable diagnosis. Early therapy may reduce sequelae and improve recovery.

### Aggressive immunosuppressive treatment of susac's syndrome in an adolescent: using treatment of dermatomyositis as a model [^e7c601a1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The above case reports are reminiscent of what is known about the natural history of JDM and the spectrum of responsiveness of JDM to various immunosuppressive therapies. It is wise to recall that in the pre-steroid era, a third of JDM patients recovered fully without any treatment, a third experienced chronic disability, and a third died. It is also important to realize that the prompt, aggressive, and sustained immunosuppressive treatment that children with JDM now receive has resulted in a marked improvement in outcome. At the current time, there is still a spectrum regarding how much immunosuppressive medication JDM requires (and for how long). The same is probably true for SS. Clearly, careful collaborative study of as large a number of patients as possible will be necessary to determine optimal treatment of SS.

In the meantime, we encourage prompt, aggressive, and sustained immunosuppressive treatment of SS. We think such treatment may prevent or minimize the feared sequelae of dementia, vision loss, and hearing loss. We suspect that, historically, encephalopathic SS has often been treated too late, with too little, and/or for too short a time. Historically, this was the case with JDM, too. We strongly encourage international collaborative study of SS to further test the hypothesis that the immunopathogenesis of SS is similar to that of JDM, and to determine optimal treatment. Our goal should be excellent outcome, not just good outcome. Until more is known, we offer the protocol depicted in Figure 3 and detailed elsewhere as a tentative model for treatment of encephalopathic SS. Finally, since SS appears to be an immune-mediated disease with immunohistopathologic characteristics similar to those seen in JDM and requires long-term immunosuppressive therapy, we urge the international rheumatology community to become more aware of SS, to view it as an autoimmune disease, and to become more involved in its diagnosis, treatment, and study.

### Susac syndrome: a scoping review [^e9c25cc0]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Susac syndrome is a rare disease characterized by an inflammatory microangiopathy limited to the brain, eye, and ear vessels. It mainly affects young women. Although the pathophysiology is not fully elucidated, recent advances favour a primitive vasculitis affecting the cerebral, retinal and cochlear small vessels. Diagnosis relies on the recognition of the triad including: 1/subacute encephalopathy with unusual headache and pseudo-psychiatric features associated with multifocal ischemic white matter, grey matter nuclei and specifically corpus callosum lesions along with leptomeningeal enhancement on brain MRI, 2/ophthalmological involvement that may be pauci-symptomatic, with bilateral occlusions of the branches of the central artery of the retina at fundoscopy and arterial wall hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography, 3/cochleo-vestibular damage with neurosensorial hearing loss predominating on low frequencies. The full triad may not be present at diagnosis but should be sought repeatedly. Relapses are frequent during an active period lasting approximately 2 years. Eventually, the disease resolves but isolated retinal arterial wall hyperfluorescence without new occlusions may recur, which should not result in treatment intensification. First-line treatment mostly consists of high dose corticosteroids. In refractory patients or in case of relapse, immunomodulatory molecules such as intravenous immunoglobulins or immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide or rituximab should be started. Sequelae -mostly hearing loss and cognitive impairment- are usually mild but remain frequent in these young patients.

### Susac syndrome: neurological update (clinical features, long-term observational follow-up and management of sixteen patients) [^751a46e3]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Two of our patients had arteriolar wall hyper-fluorescence as the only finding which would be clinically undetectable without FFA. This arteriolar wall hyper-fluorescence can be seen at the site of infarction but also at the site of vessel wall damage where infarction has not yet occurred. Therefore, in those with encephalopathy and auditory findings suggestive of Susac Syndrome, without obvious retinal findings, FFA is essential to detect the early disease. This, however, might be difficult in an uncooperative encephalopathic patient.

FFA, like most other procedures is not without clinical risk. However, the benefit of FFA is the early detection of retinal changes which will aid accurate and early clinical management, preventing visual loss, long-term disability and possibly long-term relapse.

OCT in acute stages may cause thickening of the retinal nerve fibre layer reflecting oedema from BRAOs. This may later resolve leading to focal thinning of the retinal nerve fibre and abnormal foveal contour. The findings differ from MS where a more diffuse involvement is seen (affecting the temporal nerve fibre layer and with normal foveal contour).

Advanced ocular imaging modalities such as wide-field imaging, which as the name suggests, captures a wider retinal field, are useful for long-term retinal monitoring. FFA may need to be repeated if no retinal abnormalities are detected because of the temporal disparity of the clinical symptoms and signs seen with the Susac triad and also because BRAO may recur over the course of illness. OCT angiography for the screening of Susac Syndrome remains a research tool, due to the limited field of view.

Retinal micro-aneurysm is a new ocular finding in Susac syndrome which suggests ischaemic damage to the retina. Two of our patients had cotton wool spots on fundus examination, which may also suggest the same pathology.

### Clinical characterization and prognostic risk factors of susac syndrome: a retrospective multicenter study [^1c79bf04]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The typical hearing loss in SuS is usually described as being in the low-medium hearing frequencies. Indeed, we found that the low-frequency loss is the most common at the end of the follow-up (81.3% of the patients with hearing loss). However, hearing loss of the high frequencies was also common at onset (60.0%), and there were cases where the hearing loss at disease onset was only in the high-frequency range (20.0%). Furthermore, in 46.7% of the cases at disease onset, no low-frequency loss was observed. Therefore, we suggest that diagnosis of SuS should not be ruled out when the hearing loss is not in the low frequencies.

In summary, SuS is most active in the first 2 years. The current treatment guidelines did not completely prevent disease activity, especially during the first 1–2 years, thus raising an unmet therapeutic need. Severe initial cerebral manifestation was associated with significant risk of disability and dependence, as well as the risk of cerebral relapse within the first year of the disease. In addition, male sex and elevated CSF protein levels were associated with more severe disease outcomes, suggesting that these factors may warrant the initiation of more aggressive treatment at disease onset. While most patients do not experience meaningful disability, 25% of our cohort were left with some degree of disability and functional dependence. Return to work was notably affected, with only half of the patients resuming full employment, and a quarter were unable to return at all. This study summarizes findings regarding 20 patients; therefore, validation is recommended, as well as continued research in larger cohorts.

### A case of susac syndrome with cervical spinal cord involvement on MRI [^87b16d42]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a typical case presentation of Susac syndrome with a novel MRI finding of cervical spinal cord involvement. A 25-year-old, 14-week gestation white woman presented with two episodes of encephalopathy, responsive to steroids, with abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) concerning for Susac syndrome. Further studies confirmed the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and hearing loss pathognomonic for Susac syndrome. Cervical spine MRI demonstrated two focal areas of high-signal abnormality at C2 and C3. We provide a brief review of Susac syndrome, data regarding pregnancy in this rare syndrome, and discuss how this unique observation may assist in the medical management of such cases and contribute to the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^9af4a982]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations from this study to improve the diagnostic accuracy of Susac syndrome include (1) consideration of Susac syndrome in a patient presenting with a BEE symptom; (2) undertaking an MRI brain with contrast with new onset headaches accompanied by visual, auditory or cognitive disturbance; (3) improving recognition of the specific MRI findings suggestive of Susac syndrome including callosal 'snowball' lesions, callosal 'spoke' and callosal 'icicle' lesions on T2 FLAIR, central callosal holes on T1 sequences, multi‐territorial areas of restricted diffusion in active cases and leptomeningeal enhancement (when present); (4) if investigations reveal characteristic features of Susac syndrome in one BEE organ, then other BEE organs should be tested, even if the patient is asymptomatic; and (5) the consideration for prompt referral to a sub‐specialist neuro‐immunology clinic if there is diagnostic uncertainty.

In conclusion, most patients with Susac syndrome are not diagnosed correctly at their initial presentation, with the commonest misdiagnosis being migraine. Patients are more promptly diagnosed with Susac syndrome if they present with clinical involvement of all three BEE organs or see a neuro‐immunologist. The varied ways in which Susac syndrome can present, and clinician failure to consider or recognize key features of Susac syndrome, appear to be the main factors leading to misdiagnosis.

### Treatment of susac syndrome with gamma globulin and corticosteroids [^dc4ece9a]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Susac syndrome is a rare vasculopathy characterized by visual, hearing, and cognitive dysfunction. Optimal treatment is unknown, but many patients require chemotherapy to control disease activity. We describe two patients with Susac syndrome and their response to intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) and corticosteroids. Both patients improved following acute treatment with IVIg and intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP), and no further relapses were observed. One patient showed significant improvement in hearing and MRI lesions shortly following acute treatment. Treatment with IVIg and corticosteroids provides a therapeutic option that avoids the toxicities of chemotherapy and suggests the possible importance of pathologic antibodies in the pathogenesis of Susac syndrome.

Introduction

Susac syndrome (SuS), first described in 1979 by J. Susac, is a microangiopathic multiorgan disease characterized by encephalopathy, visual disturbances due to branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAOs), and sensorineuronal hearing loss (SNHL). The presence of serum antiendothelial antibodies in some but not all patients with SuS, and pathology findings, including mononuclear cells in perivascular spaces, basal membrane thickening, and perivascular inflammation and narrowing, suggest an autoimmune etiology. The disease affects mainly women in their 30s. Treatment is tailored according to CNS disease severity and should always include glucocorticosteroids, often in combination with other immunomodulation or immunosuppression, including IV immunoglobulins (IVIG), cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab. Relevant residua after treatment and disease recurrence are both well described.

Although rare, SuS is a disease entity which can be readily encountered and a great mimicker of other diseases. It may be incorrectly diagnosed as CNS infection, malignancy, and a variety of other autoimmune diseases, such as limbic encephalitis, vasculitis, multiple sclerosis (MS), Bechet disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improved outcome.

The diagnosis of SuS is in particular based on a constellation of clinical and laboratory findings. In 2016, we suggested diagnostic criteria, to allow a homogenous language among clinicians and to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. According to these criteria, patients are differentiated based on the diagnostic security into "definite SuS," "probable SuS," and patients in which the diagnosis of SuS is not the most probable. To be diagnosed with definite SuS, patients must meet all 3 of the following criteria: brain involvement such as new cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, new focal neurologic symptoms, or headache, in the presence of typical MRI findings; symptomatic or asymptomatic retinal involvement, including BRAO or arterial wall hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography; vestibulocochlear involvement, including tinnitus, hearing loss, or vertigo, accompanied by findings such as a pathologic audiogram and caloric testing. Probable SuS includes patients fulfilling only 2 criteria out of the 3. It is important to remember that SuS is a rare disease, and the clinical and MRI findings may mimic other more common diseases such as inflammatory demyelinating disease (MS), cerebrovascular disease, vasculitis, infections, and malignancy. These disorders must be ruled out before making the diagnosis of SuS, especially when the criteria are not fully met.

### Clinical characterization and ancillary tests in susac syndrome: a systematic review [^e4382e74]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results and Discussion

Article Selection

The search yielded in total 270 articles. Excluded were 61 review articles without new relevant data, 12 letters to editors, 17 articles with no access to full-length article, not written in English and impossibility to be translated, and 13 articles in which the final diagnosis was not SuS. Seventeen articles were excluded because of lack of information but were mentioned across the article. Finally, 150 articles were included (Figure 1). Extracted from these 150 articles, a total of 332 individual cases were included in the analyses. Among them, 169 cases were taken from case series, in which some of the data were presented only in averages. In 163 cases, specific features of each patient were described.

Demographic and Clinical Data

Table 1 summarizes demographic data of our current updated review in comparison with our previous review and a total of the combined cohorts. In the newer cohort, SuS incidence was still higher in female patients with a ratio of 1:1.8, but the female preponderance was lower compared with our previous and other publications. This discrepancy may point toward a raising prevalence and/or awareness in male patients. In total of the 2 cohorts, the male:female ratio of the 2 cohorts was 1:2.4.

Table 1
Demographic Data of Patients With Susac Syndrome

Similar to the previous cohort, the mean age at disease onset was 29.5 years. The mean length of follow-up was 36.2 months with a median of 12 months. Our data suggest predominance of White patients (57%); however, similar to the previous cohort, information on ethnicity was sparsely provided, and there may be misrepresentation of other ethnicities because of publication bias.

Rennebohm et al.suggest empirical stratification of Susac syndrome into 3 major clinical courses, namely monocyclic, polycyclic, and chronic continuous. In our current review, these courses were hardly reported. It could be due to the short follow-up periods or as a result of a good treatment response.

### Serial retinal fluorescein angiography and immune therapy in susac's syndrome [^60d1b988]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

We report a patient with Susac's disease presenting classically in a young female with an encephalopathy and visual disturbance with later deafness and tinnitus. Her encephalopathy settled, but subsequent serial fluorescein angiograms allowed sensitive monitoring of continuing sub-clinical disease activity, and provide evidence of a clear therapeutic response to immune suppression with tacrolimus (but not steroids alone) — and of a lack of efficacy of nimodipine and aspirin. We believe this single case study has both pathogenetic and useful practical implications: the apparently favourable response to immunosuppression lends support to the hypothesis that Susac's Syndrome is an immune-mediated disease; while the presence during symptomatic clinical remission of sporadic, multi-focal episodes of hyper-fluorescence, suggestive of breakthrough vasculopathy despite treatment, underlines the fact that the natural history of this rare condition is still not fully understood. Fluorescein angiography is proposed as a sensitive and important approach to the monitoring of sub-clinical disease activity, and so optimising immune suppressive treatment.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^c5e6de3e]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — acute management and stroke evaluation emphasize urgent referral, targeted systemic workup, and selective outpatient evaluation. Once a diagnosis of an acute, symptomatic CRAO, BRAO, or OAO has been made, the ophthalmologist should refer to an emergency department affiliated with a stroke center for prompt systemic evaluation, with clear instructions that the patient has experienced an eye "stroke," and an expedited workup offers the best opportunity to evaluate, assess, and manage the risk for cerebral stroke or myocardial infarction. In addition, corticosteroids should be initiated empirically and a temporal artery biopsy scheduled in patients with high clinical suspicion for GCA. In the absence of a clear etiology such as an embolus, the workup should include evaluation for antiphospholipid antibodies and other hematologic diatheses, and autoimmune or other hypercoagulable states; Susac syndrome should be considered in younger patients with multiple or recurrent BRAOs, and clinicians should inquire about signs or symptoms of carotid dissection. Poor choroidal circulation on fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography is suggestive of OAO or GCA. At present, there is no conclusive evidence to support referring asymptomatic patients who have a BRAO or asymptomatic plaques for an expedited stroke workup; these patients should be referred to their primary care physician for a comprehensive systemic vascular workup on an outpatient basis. Stroke risk associated with newly diagnosed OAO, CRAO, or BRAO may be as high as 25%.

### Aggressive immunosuppressive treatment of susac's syndrome in an adolescent: using treatment of dermatomyositis as a model [^71c7ecb6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Because SS and JDM appear to have much in common, we suggest that lessons learned from study of the immunopathogenesis, clinical course and treatment of JDM may be applicable to SS. With this in mind, we treated our patient with an aggressive immunosuppressive approach that has been effective for severe JDM.

Although we believe her treatment served her very well, the varied and only somewhat predictable natural history of SS makes it difficult to know exactly how much credit her treatment should be given for suppressing and maintaining control over her disease. To date, our knowledge of the natural history of SS and its responsiveness to treatment is based entirely on anecdotal case reports and retrospective analysis of short series of patients. No controlled studies of treatment have been conducted.

Analysis of reported cases reveals that some patients with SS, despite receiving no immunosuppressive treatment, have experienced a monocyclic course that has remitted spontaneously and resulted in good clinical outcome. (Such cases initially suggested that SS might not be an autoimmune disorder.) Other patients have seemed to respond dramatically to corticosteroid therapy – strongly suggesting that SS is an autoimmune disorder. Others have failed to respond adequately to corticosteroid therapy, but have seemed to respond well to cyclophosphamide – suggesting that SS sometimes needs more than just corticosteroid therapy. Some patients have failed to respond to both corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy – suggesting that some patients may have such severe disease that usual corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy may be inadequate. Many patients have responded well to immunosuppressive therapy, but have relapsed (either spontaneously or when immunosuppressive therapy has been tapered too quickly), and have again responded to reinstitution or escalation of immunosuppression.

### Clinical characterization and prognostic risk factors of susac syndrome: a retrospective multicenter study [^3b87c5f5]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Susac syndrome (SuS) is a rare disorder characterized by encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusion, and sensorineural hearing loss, often accompanied by vertigo. Recent updates to diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines have been made. This study examines clinical manifestations; disease activity; and risk factors of disability, dependency, and return to work in patients with SuS.

Methods

A retrospective multicenter study was conducted on 20 consecutive patients with SuS with at least 2 years of follow-up. Clinical and paraclinical activities were assessed and rated according to the severity at onset and the end of follow-up. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment while disability and dependence in daily activities were measured using the modified Rankin Scale. Employment status was graded.

Results

The mean age at onset was 38.9 years, with a mean follow-up of 55.9 months. The female-to-male ratio was 1.86, and 45% of patients had the complete clinical triad. Severe cerebral involvement at onset was associated with a higher risk of cerebral exacerbations within the first year and with an increased long-term disability and dependency. Cognitive function improved in 75% of patients during follow-up. At disease onset, hearing loss excluding low frequencies occurred in 46.7%. Relapse of hearing loss was associated with greater impairment in daily activities. Male sex and elevated CSF protein levels were linked to poorer prognosis. Cerebral and inner ear exacerbations were most common in the first year while retinal exacerbations occurred more frequently, mainly within the first 2 years. Approximately 50% of patients resumed employment while 25% did not return to work.

Discussion

Current treatment strategies for SuS do not fully prevent relapses. Severe brain manifestation at onset, male sex, and high CSF protein levels are risk factors of a worse prognosis of disability and dependence, indicating the need for intensive treatment. High-frequency hearing loss does not exclude SuS diagnosis.

### Immunosuppressive agents or intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to glucocorticoids in the treatment of susac syndrome: a French national cohort study [^b4307329]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Susac syndrome is a rare disease affecting mainly young women and is characterised by an occlusive microvessel disease limited to the brain, retina, and inner ear. No randomised controlled trial has been published or declared as ongoing to investigate treatments for Susac syndrome. We aimed to compare the effect of glucocorticoids given alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents or intravenous immunoglobulin for the prevention of relapse in patients with Susac syndrome.

Methods

The Phenotypic and Etiological Characterization of Susac Syndrome-National Clinical Research Hospital Program study is a prospective national cohort study that started enrolling on Nov 29, 2011, and included all consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with Susac syndrome who were referred to the French reference centre (Department of Internal Medicine, Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris). Susac syndrome was defined by either the triad of encephalopathy with typical brain MRI abnormalities, cochleo-vestibular damage, and multiple occlusions of retinal central artery branches, or at least two of the three criteria without any alternative diagnosis. Collected data included fundoscopy, retinal angiography, audiometry, cerebrospinal fluid, brain MRI, and treatment received at diagnosis; months 1, 3, 6, and 12 after diagnosis; and then annually for 5 years or in the case of a relapse. The primary outcome was defined as the first relapse occurring within a 36-month follow-up period from the first day of treatment, characterised by new clinical symptoms or signs, and new abnormalities observed on retinal angiography, audiometry, or brain MRI, necessitating treatment intensification. There was no involvement of people with lived experience at any stage. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01481662.

Findings

Between Nov 29, 2011, and Dec 2, 2022, 64 patients were included in the study, with a mean age at diagnosis of 35 years (SD 11); 41 (64%) were women and 23 (36%) were men. At diagnosis, 60 patients received glucocorticoids; 40 (63%) of 64 patients received glucocorticoids alone as a first-line therapy while 20 (31%) received glucocorticoids in combination with immunosuppressive agents or intravenous immunoglobulin. Overall, 46 (72%) of 64 patients had a first relapse with a median relapse-free survival time of 3·96 months (95% CI 2·24–16·07). Comparison of relapse-free survival showed no significant difference between the two treatment strategies (hazard ratio [HR] 1·11 [95% CI 0·56–2·17], p = 0·76), compared with glucocorticoids alone as the reference group. In patients who first relapsed while treated with glucocorticoids alone, there was no significant difference in second relapse-free survival between those who did or did not receive immunosuppressive agents or intravenous immunoglobulin as a second-line therapy (HR 2·66 [95% CI 0·63–11·18], p = 0·18).

Interpretation

The combination of glucocorticoids with immunosuppressive agents or intravenous immunoglobulin did not appear to reduce the risk of Susac syndrome relapse compared with glucocorticoids alone. Our findings did not support the systematic use of immunosuppressive agents in Susac syndrome.

### Successful natalizumab treatment of two female individuals with susac syndrome [^0d267f90]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Susac syndrome (SuS) is a rare neuroinflammatory disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, encephalopathy, and branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO). It predominantly affects women, with a female‐to‐male ratio of approximately 3.5:1, typically presenting in their third and fourth decades. Due to the disease rarity, epidemiological data are scarce, with an estimated annual incidence of 0.24 per 1,000,000 people in Central Europe.

Diagnosing SuS is particularly challenging, as the clinical triad is present in only 47% of the patients at disease onset, necessitating a high degree of clinical awareness for this rare disease. SuS has several differential diagnoses, including multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), migraine, Meniere's disease, viral and autoimmune encephalitis, and cerebral vasculitis, owing to the overlapping symptoms and imaging features. Diagnosis typically relies on MR imaging for callosal lesions, retinal angiography to assess BRAO, and vestibulocochlear function tests. Formal diagnostic criteria have been established to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The 2016 European Susac Consortium (EuSaC) criteria categorize SuS into three levels: definite SuS, where all three organs (brain, eye, and ear) are affected; probable SuS, with involvement of two organs; and possible SuS, where only one organ is affected.

### Clinical characterization and prognostic risk factors of susac syndrome: a retrospective multicenter study [^b2484ab5]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This observational retrospective study was conducted in 3 major Israeli medical centers: Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Rabin Medical Center, and Shamir Medical Center.

Study Participants and Inclusion Characteristics

The study cohort comprised 20 consecutive adult patients with probable or definite SuS according to Kleffner criteria, diagnosed between July 2017 and August 2023 and followed for at least 2 years. Treatment followed the immunotherapy guidelines(Table 1).

Table 1
Characteristics of Patients With Susac Syndrome (N = 20)

SuS diagnosis was based on typical clinical symptoms evaluated by neurologists, rheumatologists, ophthalmologists, and otorhinolaryngologist specialists, combined with typical paraclinical findings on brain MRI; BRAO and AWH on FA; and vestibulocochlear involvement confirmed by audiogram, video head impulse test, and cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials. A follow-up period of at least two years was required because of the monocyclic course of SuS observed in the first 1–2 years.

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were obtained from the institutional medical records. All patients received treatment per guidelines immediately after diagnosis, which continued throughout the follow-up period. The patients came for routine follow-up visits at least once every 3 months and whenever new symptoms were suspected. The patients were hospitalized in neurology departments or treated in infusion units during an exacerbation. The ongoing parenteral treatment was given in the infusion units. All patients remained under follow-up after their diagnosis, and there were no cases of discontinuation of follow-up.

### Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy in susac's syndrome [^e232f6ad]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Susac's syndrome is the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and sensorineural hearing loss (Susac 1994) [1]. It occurs predominantly in young females and is believed to be an immune-mediated endotheliopathy of small vessels of the brain, retina and cochlea (Neumayer et al. 2009) [2]. Early, aggressive, and sustained immunosuppressive therapy has been recommended for Susac's syndrome and anecdotal evidence has suggested a therapeutic role for monoclonal antibodies (Rennebohm et al. 2008, Lee and Amezcua 2009) [3,4]. We report a case of Susac's syndrome in which the patient improved immediately after tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibition with the monoclonal antibody, infliximab.

Table 2
Summary of clinical features of sixteen patients with Susac syndrome

Encephalopathy was the most common central nervous system (CNS) manifestation after headache, seen at some point during the illness, although only 6/16 (37.5%) patients had it at onset. The ophthalmologic involvement was clinically silent and subtle on dilated retinal examination in some patients, in whom fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) aided the diagnosis.

Callosal and/or peri-callosal lesions on brain MRI were seen in all patients (Fig. 1). Only 1/14 patient had CSF leukocytosis (26 lymphocytes) and 12/14 patients had raised CSF protein. Oligo-clonal bands were absent in all 13 patients who were tested for it.

Histological findings

One of our patients (patient 1) underwent stereotactic brain biopsy whilst another patient (patient 4) had an autopsy, both of which showed multiple microinfarcts involving grey/white matter, deep grey nuclei, brain stem and corpus callosum with endothelial cell necrosis and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration (Fig. 2 A, B). C4d immunostaining showed complement deposition in the capillaries and venules in 30% of the vessels, suggesting humoral mediated microangiopathy. Patient 4 presented with encephalopathy and cognitive impairment with a compatible MRI but had no accompanying retinal or vestibulo-cochlear symptoms. Histology showed evidence of micro-infarcts and histopathological evidence of microangiopathy in the brain on postmortem study.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^f5305c83]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study systematically reports the diagnostic experience in Susac syndrome, and the association between various clinical presentations and diagnostic delay. Our results indicate that a diagnostic evaluation requiring the involvement of several healthcare professionals is associated with a substantial increase in diagnostic delay, that patients presenting with visual symptoms or vestibulocochlear symptoms are associated with greater diagnostic delay (Figure 1) and that there is an under‐appreciation of the specific clinical features and imaging findings in Susac syndrome which may contribute to diagnostic delay.

The first specialist healthcare professionals, other than general practitioners, that Susac syndrome patients in our study typically encountered were neurologists, with only a minority of patients being reviewed by other clinicians. The seven patients who were initially reviewed by a clinician with expertise in neuro‐immunology had the shortest time to diagnosis of Susac syndrome. However, the referral of patients directly to an expert centre is dependent on patient location and accessibility to neuro‐immunology services. Direct referral to a neuro‐immunologist was associated with a substantially shorter diagnostic delay even if the referral diagnosis was unclear. Once patients were reviewed by a neuro‐immunologist they were more likely to undergo complete evaluation for audiological and ophthalmic involvement which aided the diagnosis of Susac syndrome with a median time to diagnosis of 0.5 months.

The differential diagnosis for Susac syndrome includes common and rare neuro‐inflammatory conditions, especially multiple sclerosis, genetic conditions such as adult‐onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia, and miscellaneous conditions including microembolic stroke and Ménière's disease (Table 5). Our study found that migraine, cerebrovascular diseases such as cerebral vasculitis, multiple sclerosis and stroke were the commonest misdiagnoses. Our study also adds further differential diagnoses to this list including histoplasmosis, viral encephalitis, Hashimoto's encephalitis and CNS lymphoma.

TABLE 5
Differential diagnoses of Susac syndrome

The median diagnostic delay of 3 months in this series was slightly less than that reported in a retrospective review of cases in the literature (7 months). The shorter time to diagnosis in our series may be due to clinical deterioration in some patients and referral to sub‐specialist neuro‐immunology clinics. Furthermore, the ability to assess the delay in comparison to the types of presentations is unique to our study. The diagnosis of Susac syndrome was similar amongst patients who presented before and after 2015 indicating that recognition of Susac syndrome as a diagnosis has not substantially improved over the last 10 years.

### Clinical features, diagnostic findings, and treatment of susac syndrome: a case series [^1d2782d5]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Susac syndrome (SS) is a rare, presumed autoimmune condition characterized by the clinical triad of branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAOs), encephalopathy, and sensorineural hearing loss. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical features, diagnostic results, treatment, and outcomes in SS.

Methods

Five patients with SS were referred to three tertiary care centers in Boston. The observation period across these patients was 7-57months.

Results

At initial presentation, none of the patients demonstrated the complete triad of BRAO, sensorineural hearing loss, and encephalopathy. The interval between symptom onset and diagnosis of SS was 4-30weeks. Brain MRI findings thought to be characteristic of SS (including callosal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense and T1 hypointense lesions) were frequently absent. Microinfarcts noted on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), BRAOs and vessel wall hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography (FA) were present in all cases in the acute encephalopathic phase. All patients treated with glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) alone experienced further clinical progression until additional immunosuppressive therapy was instituted.

Conclusions

The rarity of SS, its incomplete and variable presentation, and the nonspecific imaging findings invariably led to delayed diagnosis. DWI and FA should be used to identify the acute microvascular injury and monitor treatment response. Immunomodulatory agents more potent than glucocorticoids and IVIg might be required to control the disease.

Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome) is a lysosomal storage disease that is characterized by systemic clinical manifestations and significant functional impairment. Diagnosis and management are often challenging because of the considerable variability in symptom presentation and rate of progression. The optimal standard of care should be based on evidence from randomized, controlled trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. In support of this goal, comprehensive management guidelines have been drafted by an international group of experts in the management of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis VI. The guidelines provide a detailed outline of disease manifestations by body system, recommendations for regular assessments, and an overview of current treatment options.

### Clinical characterization and ancillary tests in susac syndrome: a systematic review [^63db96c8]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present updated epidemiology data of SuS, classified by our recently proposed criteria, and summarized newly used diagnostic methods for evaluation of brain, ocular, and vestibulocochlear involvement. Our data show similar demographic and clinical manifestations compared with our previous review which strengthen our current results and the clinical manifestation of SuS. Moreover, we describe current and updated ancillary tests. Our results support early and extensive ophthalmologic evaluation including FA and OCT in patients presenting with neurocognitive symptoms and suggestive MRI findings. Specific MRI sequences such as DWI and postcontrast FLAIR should be added to increased sensitivity when SuS is suspected. The fact that only half of the patients were defined as definite SuS and the progress in ancillary tests suggest an update of the current SuS diagnostic criteria.

### Diagnosis and classification of susac syndrome [^7bb812c1]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Susac syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and neuro-sensorial hearing loss; it is due to a microangiopathy affecting the precapillary arterioles of the brain, retina and inner ear. SS is characterized by typical radiological features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which, together with clinical symptoms, may permit a diagnosis. Branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAOs) are best evaluated using fluorescein angiography (FA) which may show the typical multifocal fluorescence. SS is an autoimmune endotheliopathy that requires treatment with immunosuppressive agents: steroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and intravenous immunoglobulin, usually in combination. Plasma exchange is also useful. In addition, antiplatelet agents may be a useful adjunct. Correct immunosuppressive therapy results in significant clinical and radiological improvement. An early diagnosis and treatment are important to delay the disease progression and prevent permanent disability.

### Update on susac's syndrome [^3028ae79]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

PURPOSE OF VIEW: We review recent developments in the clinical course and imaging modalities for Susac's syndrome, a clinical triad consisting of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and sensorineural hearing loss.

Recent Findings

Susac's syndrome has variable clinical presentations; recently described presentations include epileptic seizures and transient inverted vision. Advances in neuroradiology suggest that magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates distinctive patterns in the white and grey matter and in the leptomeninges. Reports have verified that Susac's syndrome is under-diagnosed because of its multisystem involvement and confusion with other imitating disorders (such as multiple sclerosis), and because of the fact that neuroradiologists are not acquainted with this syndrome.

Summary

The precise aetiology of Susac's syndrome is still unknown and many areas have not yet been explored. Magnetic resonance imaging is the neuroimaging study of choice. Findings include multiple small hyperintense foci on T2-weighted images and contrast enhancement in white and grey matter of both supratentorial and infratentorial structures, corpus callosum and, occasionally, leptomeninges. Callosal lesions typically involve the central fibres and are probably pathognomonic for Susac's syndrome. When assessing patients with unexplained encephalopathy involving white and grey matter, leptomeninges and corpus callosum, the findings of sensorinueral hearing loss or visual disturbances may yield important clues regarding the possibility of Susac's syndrome.

### A young woman presenting with encephalopathy: a case report [^e7a79c73]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Susac Syndrome is a rare but probably under-recognized condition typically manifesting with headache, encephalopathy, and focal neurological signs. It occurs primarily in young women (3–4 times more often than in men) at a median age of 30–35 years at onset and affects the microvasculature of the brain, retina, and inner ear. Pathophysiologic mechanisms are incompletely understood; however, histopathologic findings and clinical improvement after initiation of immunosuppressive therapy strongly suggest an immune-mediated mechanism. The full diagnostic triad consists of (1) neurological manifestations and typical MRI findings (brain involvement), (2) branch retinal artery occlusions or arterial wall hyperfluorescence in retinal fluorescein angiography or signs of retinal branch ischemia in fundoscopy or optical coherence tomography (retinal involvement), and (3) new tinnitus, hearing loss or peripheral vertigo (cochlear involvement). Recommended treatment includes corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and mycophenolate mofetil. Depending on disease severity, tacrolimus, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab may be added. Treatment for at least 2 years is recommended. Important differential diagnoses include MS, CNS vasculitis, autoimmune encephalopathies, and juvenile stroke.

### A young woman presenting with encephalopathy: a case report [^1cc89366]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When cerebral white matter lesions are detected in young patients presenting with neurologic symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is multiple sclerosis (MS). Still, it is crucial to screen for important differential diagnoses which require sophisticated workup and sometimes immediate treatment, such as autoimmune encephalopathies, juvenile stroke, central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, and, as in this case, Susac syndrome. Knowledge about key clinical and neuro-imaging features is therefore of utmost importance. Here, we report a case of a young woman presenting with encephalopathy, focal neurological deficits, and cerebral white matter lesions and discuss our diagnostic approach.

### Fluorescein angiography as a surrogate marker of disease activity in susac syndrome [^5ddc3ef1]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the sensitivity of fluorescein angiography (FA) in detecting disease activity in Susac syndrome.

Methods

We conducted a blinded analysis of all FA, brain MRI, and audiogram examinations performed throughout the follow-up of patients with Susac syndrome.

Results

A total of 79 FA examinations, 85 brain MRI scans, and 49 audiograms were analyzed from 9 patients followed for a mean (SD) period of 6 (4) years. Disease activity was detected in 41.5% of FA examinations, 10.5% of MRI scans, and 25% of audiograms (FA vs MRI, p < 0.0001; FA vs audiogram, p = 0.06; audiogram vs MRI, p < 0.05). Within 3 months of clinical relapses, activity was observed in 57%, 24%, and 27% of FA, MRI, and audiogram examinations, respectively (FA vs MRI, p < 0.05; FA vs audiogram, p = 0.09; audiogram vs MRI, p = 1). Quantitative analysis of FA showed a mean (SD) of 2.5 (2.5) leakages (both eyes) during relapses compared with 1.2 (1.4) during remission (p < 0.05).

Discussion

FA, particularly arterial leakage, demonstrated the highest sensitivity in detecting disease activity and may be a valuable tool for treatment management in Susac syndrome. Future studies with larger samples should aim to identify the optimal threshold of FA changes associated with an increased risk of relapse.

### Susac's syndrome: an update [^ac273a58]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Susac's syndrome (SS) is a relatively rare cause of multiple recurrent branch retinal arterial occlusions (BRAO). SS is frequently misdiagnosed and probably underdiagnosed. Ophthalmic manifestations may be the sole presenting sign of SS. Comprehensive literature review The typical triad of encephalopathy, sensorineural hearing loss and multiple recurrent BRAO is seldom seen at presentation in SS. The characteristic ophthalmological feature in SS is the presence of recurrent multiple BRAO in the absence of intraocular inflammation. Yellow to yellow-white, non-refractile or refractile retinal arterial wall plaques (Gass plaques) found at midarteriolar segments not associated to bifurcations are commonly found in SS. Because of its ability to capture more peripheral retinal area, ultrawide field fluorescein angiography (FA) has definite advantages over conventional FA and its use should be encouraged in patients suspected of having SS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), particularly spectral domain OCT complements FA. Patients with BRAO and hearing loss that do not develop encephalopathy during the initial 2 years will most likely not develop encephalopathy. However, these patients will be prone to recurrent BRAO and hearing loss. Imunosuppression is the cornerstone of treatment but the best regimen still needs to be defined. A minority of patients with SS present with the typical triad. A high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis promptly. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to delay disease progression and prevent blindness, deafness and dementia.

### Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies in susac syndrome [^0930bdcf]. Retina (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Susac syndrome is a rare microangiopathy of the brain, retina, and cochlea that mainly affects young women. We studied the management of this disease using retinal fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies.

Methods

Retrospective, observational case series of seven patients with Susac syndrome identified in ophthalmology and internal medicine departments. We reviewed medical, ophthalmologic, and angiographic records at study enrollment and during long-term treatment. Mean follow-up was 37 months. Best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular inflammation score, ophthalmoscopy data, automated perimetry score, and fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographic features were analyzed with the results of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and spinal fluid analysis and ENT signs.

Results

Retinal fluorescein angiography showed focal nonperfused retinal arterioles with hyperfluorescent walls in all cases. Indocyanine green angiography showed normal choroidal circulation. Retinal vasculitis was uncontrolled in a patient treated with steroids. Improvement of retinal arteriole perfusion occurred during immunosuppressive treatment with cyclophosphamide.

Conclusion

Absence of intraocular inflammation and focal, labile nonperfused retinal arterioles with integrity of choroidal circulation are monomorphic ophthalmologic features that could immediately suggest the diagnosis of Susac syndrome. Early ophthalmologic examination aided by retinal fluorescein angiography could be useful for managing cases of unexplained neurologic symptoms in women.

### The neuro-otology of susac syndrome [^a670a045]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

We characterised the clinical and neuro-otological characteristics of patients with Susac syndrome.

Methods

The medical records of 30 patients with Susac syndrome were reviewed for details of their clinical presentation and course, neuro-otological symptoms, investigation results including audiology and vestibular function tests, treatment and outcomes.

Results

Our findings demonstrate that 29 of our 30 patients with Susac syndrome developed neuro-otological symptoms such as hearing loss, disequilibrium, tinnitus or vertigo during their disease course. Hearing loss was the most common neuro-otological symptom occurring in 93% of patients. A rising configuration of low-frequency greater than the high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss was the most characteristic finding on audiological testing (37% of reviewed audiograms). Disproportionately poor speech discrimination was identified in 20% of cases, and one case demonstrated a retrocochlear pattern on electrophysiological testing. Four patients required hearing aids and a further two patients required a cochlear implant due to severe hearing loss. Two out of two treated patients had improvements in hearing after the prompt administration of corticosteroids, indicating the potential for recoverable hearing loss if relapses are treated early. Effects on vestibular function were variable in ten patients who were tested, with most showing preservation of function despite significant hearing loss.

Conclusions

Neuro-otological symptoms in Susac syndrome are almost universal. In the correct clinical context, a rising configuration of low to high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss should prompt consideration of Susac syndrome. Treatment of inner ear symptoms in Susac syndrome requires further research as early immunotherapy may be beneficial.

### Atypical clinical and novel radiological findings in susac syndrome: experience from a large monocentric cohort [^f18ee3ea]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Susac syndrome (SuS) is a rare immune-mediated endotheliopathy that affects the brain, retina and inner ear and is characterised by the variable clinical triad of encephalopathy, visual and vestibulocochlear dysfunction. Here, we present clinical and paraclinical data of 19 SuS patients followed at Ghent University Hospital and highlight some atypical clinical and novel radiological findings. Our findings suggest that spinal involvement expands the clinical phenotype of SuS. We further introduce dark blood sequences as a more sensitive technique to detect radiological disease activity in SuS. Our data add to the current understanding of the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of SuS.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^e23b25db]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune mediated brain–eye–ear (BEE) syndrome affecting the small arterial vessels of the brain, inner ear and retina. It is characterized by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAOs) and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), usually affecting low‐ to mid‐frequencies. The annual incidence of Susac syndrome is estimated to be in the range 0.024–0.13 per 100,000, with 60% of individuals aged between 21 and 35 years at the time of diagnosis and a reported male:female ratio of 1:3.5.

The classic triad of features is present in only 13% of patients at onset, yet over 80% of patients eventually develop all symptoms. Moreover, BEE organ involvement at onset may suggest other disorders, and a lack of awareness of clinical and radiological features and incomplete evaluation may lead to under‐diagnosis, or critical delays in diagnosis, as well as morbidity from a delay in appropriate treatment. Commonly reported misdiagnoses of Susac syndrome include multiple sclerosis, Ménière's disease, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and cerebral vasculitis. Whilst the median time to diagnosis for Susac syndrome in one study was 7 months from symptom onset, for some patients the diagnosis can take years. Diagnostic delays or misdiagnosis may lead to recurrence or the development of new clinical symptoms.

To improve diagnosis, formal diagnostic criteria have been developed. The 2017 European Susac Consortium (EuSaC) diagnostic criteria allow a diagnosis of definite Susac syndrome if there is evidence of all three BEE organs being affected, with probable Susac syndrome if only two BEE organs are involved and possible Susac syndrome if one BEE organ is affected (Table 1). Brain involvement is defined as at least one clinical finding consistent with encephalopathy together with characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of Susac syndrome. Ocular involvement is defined as BRAOs or arterial wall hyperfluorescence by fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) or characteristic signs of retinal branch ischaemia in funduscopy or spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Vestibulocochlear involvement is defined as new tinnitus and/or hearing loss and/or peripheral vertigo with classic findings on an audiogram of sensorineural hearing loss.

Alternative diagnoses

Thirty patients (94%) were initially diagnosed with an alternative diagnosis prior to Susac syndrome including seven patients (23%) with two or more diagnoses (Table 3). The commonest misdiagnoses were migraine in 10 patients (31%), primary cerebral vasculitis in six patients (19%), multiple sclerosis in five patients (16%) and stroke in five patients (16%). Viral encephalitis was presumed, or at least considered, in four patients (13%), all of whom were commenced on anti‐viral therapy. At the time of the alternative diagnosis, seven patients (22%) met the criteria for definite Susac syndrome, 19 (56%) for probable and six (19%) for possible Susac syndrome. Three of the 19 patients (16%) with probable Susac syndrome developed further symptoms and subsequently would have met the criteria for definite Susac syndrome but were misdiagnosed prior to the final diagnosis of Susac syndrome.

TABLE 3
Diagnostic information

At initial presentation up to 26 of the 32 patients (81%) in this series would have met criteria for probable or definite Susac syndrome if complete ophthalmological and audiological assessments were performed.

Diagnostic delay

The median time to diagnosis of Susac syndrome was 3 months (range 0.5–38 months). Twenty‐one patients (66%) were diagnosed with Susac syndrome within 6 months of presentation and diagnosis was delayed by over 12 months in eight patients (25%).

### Fluorescein angiography as a surrogate marker of disease activity in susac syndrome [^144cdbb5]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune microangiopathy characterized by a clinical triad that may present either synchronously in approximately 30% of patients or asynchronously and consists of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAOs), and sensorineural hearing loss.CNS and ocular involvements were the most common presentations, observed in approximately 60% of patients, followed by neuro-otological involvement in around 30% of patients.

There is no established consensus on the optimal therapeutic regimen for Susac syndrome. In this context, sensitive modalities capable of detecting ongoing disease activity are crucial for guiding therapy. Several studies based on small sample sizes have suggested that fluorescein angiography (FA), which directly visualizes the microvascular involvement characteristic of Susac syndrome, may be a valuable tool for assessing disease activity. In this study, we analyzed all FA, MRI, and audiogram examinations performed on patients with Susac syndrome who were followed at the Department of Neurology in Marseille.

### Clinical characterization and ancillary tests in susac syndrome: a systematic review [^5d61c1e2]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Classification According to the 2016 Criteria

According to the criteria proposed by Kleffner et al. in 2016, patients with definite SuS must have brain and vestibulocochlear involvement with both clinical manifestations and findings in objective testing and ocular involvement which may be present in objective testing alone. We classified the current cohort according to the 2016 criteria. A total of 169 patients (50.9%) fulfilled the definition of definite SuS according to these criteria. 163 (49.1%) patients did not meet the "definite" criteria and were defined probable SuS.

We analyzed which specific criterion was missing to meet definite SuS. This analysis was performed only in case studies in which specific data for patient were provided (n = 67). The most often missing criterion was vestibulocochlear involvement in 26 patients (39%), from which, 9 (23%) did not have any vestibulocochlear involvement, 4 (20%) did not have clinical SNHL, and 13 (33%) did not have a test demonstrating SNHL. Only 2 patients (3%) had no retinal involvement, and in 6 patients (9%), a supporting ophthalmologic examination was not available. Three patients with SuS (4%) had MRI supporting CNS involvement with no clinical presentation (including headache), and in 1 patient, the lack of corpus callosum involvement on MRI was the sole missing criterion.

These results may imply that these criteria may not be sensitive enough for the diagnosis of SuS. We think, however, that data are not yet robust enough to draw any specific recommendations for now, but future collaborative work with other centers will facilitate a more comprehensive database.

Limitations

Data regarding SuS have greatly expanded during the last decade. Therefore, most of the articles that were published in recent years are case series. In addition, many of these publications focus on new diagnostic techniques as part of SuS evaluation, which often resulted in partial description of the manifestation and do not provide the comprehensive data that were necessary for this review. Whenever the authors declared a previous publication of a particular patient, we removed the respective data to avoid duplication. However, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of some duplication. "Normal" SuS with no unusual features and unspectacular course are less likely to be published and therefore underrepresented. Treatment response was beyond the scope of our review and is discussed in a recently published review.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^5a17582d]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Factors leading to misdiagnosis

Factors that led to a misdiagnosis included insufficient investigation of patient symptoms or failure to screen BEE organs for asymptomatic involvement, which contributed to misdiagnosis in 23 patients, and radiologist or treating clinician being unaware of known diagnostic features such as classic MRI findings in 16 patients (50%).

All patients underwent an MRI brain with corpus callosum lesions specific for Susac syndrome identified on the initial scans in 25 patients (78%) (Table 4). Prior to an alternative diagnosis being made of the 20 patients who presented with auditory symptoms, only six (30%) patients underwent evaluation with audiogram or vestibular function testing and only five (42%) of the 12 patients who presented with visual symptoms underwent evaluation with FFA prior to an alternative diagnosis being made, one of which was incorrectly interpreted, leading to a 1‐month delay in the diagnosis of Susac syndrome.

TABLE 4
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities on initial MRI brain

Treatment

Twenty‐two patients (69%) (four definite, 14 probable, four possible) received treatment for their alternative diagnosis (Table 1). Treatment included intravenous or oral corticosteroids in 17 patients (53%), intravenous immunoglobulin in three (9%), plasma exchange in one (3%), migraine preventative medication in five (19%), aspirin in five (19%), anti‐viral medication in four (13%), beta‐interferon immunotherapy for multiple sclerosis in one (3%) and surgical closure of a patent foramen ovale in one patient (3%).

Clinical relapses or new symptoms developed prior to the diagnosis of Susac syndrome in 10 of the 22 patients (45%) who received treatment for an alternative diagnosis and three patients who had received no treatment for their alternative diagnosis. Amongst the 10 patients who received treatment, isolated visual impairment developed in two patients, isolated central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction in two patients, a combination of vestibulocochlear dysfunction plus CNS dysfunction in two patients, visual and CNS dysfunction in two patients and one patient each experienced vestibulocochlear plus visual loss or CNS, visual and vestibulocochlear manifestations. The one patient who received beta‐interferon for multiple sclerosis had new, recurrent visual dysfunction prior to the diagnosis of Susac syndrome. All three patients who received no treatment developed encephalopathy requiring hospitalization; one of these patients also had new vestibulocochlear dysfunction.

### Susac syndrome [^5a953045]. Otology & Neurotology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations; radiographic, audiometric, and retinal fluorescein angiography findings; pathogenesis and treatment of Susac syndrome with review of the literature.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective case review.

Setting

This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center.

Patient

A 50-year-old woman presented with recurrent episodes of neurologic symptoms, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and silent retinal artery occlusion.

Interventions

The patient underwent complete evaluation, including magnetic resonance image studies, audiometric tests, and retinal fluorescein angiography. She was treated initially with corticosteroids and later with other immunosuppressive agents.

Results

The patient was initially diagnosed with left sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Despite comprehensive clinical and laboratory studies that did not reveal systemic disease, 3 weeks later, the patient developed vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus in the opposite ear. The neurologic involvement and the bilateral audiologic manifestations raised the possibility of Susac syndrome.

Conclusion

Susac syndrome is a rare disorder of unknown origin characterized by the triad of encephalopathy, fluctuating hearing loss, and visual loss resulting from microangiopathy of the brain, cochlea, and retina. The multiple organ involvement seen in Susac syndrome raises a differential diagnosis ranging from autoimmune disease, through systemic vasculitis, to multiple sclerosis. Otolaryngologists should be aware of this syndrome as a result of the vestibulocochlear manifestations and the multidisciplinary evaluation that is required.

### In reply… [^7af12f14]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

We thank Dr Sirikci for his interest in our article. Dr Sirikci comments on the differential diagnosis between microangiopathy of the inner ear, retina, and brain and MS. In addition to deafness and retinal occlusions, the main clinical manifestation of Susac syndrome is an encephalopathy, and all these manifestations are never observed or are quite rare in MS. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings are different in MS and Susac syndrome. Brain scans suggest MS when several high-signal lesions are observed in the cerebral white matter, ovoid lesions oriented perpendicular to ventricules, or lesions with a diameter greater than 6 mm or located in the corpus callosum. 1 In Susac syndrome, the high-signal lesions are punctiform and are observed not. only in the white matter but also in the gray matter.

2, 3 In MS, cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals a normal or discrete increase in proteins, mainly in γ-globulins, with IgG oligoclonal bands. 4 In Susac syndrome, cerebrospinal fluid protein levels are often higher. than 1 g/L, and there are no IgG oligoclonal bands. 2, 3 Finally, treatment of MS and Susac syndrome differs largely: in MS, several specific treatments are available, but in Susac's syndrome treatment remains empirical. We do not believe that MS and Susac syndrome are confounding diseases because of the differences in diagnostic criteria. 2, 5. Gout O, Ayache D. In reply. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2001;

### Clinical characterization and prognostic risk factors of susac syndrome: a retrospective multicenter study [^def07340]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The study cohort demographics, clinical manifestations, CSF analysis, and treatment combinations are presented in Table 1. The study group included 20 patients (13 women and 7 men, ratio 1.86), whose mean age at SuS onset was 38.9 ± 9.6 years (range 19–62 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 55.9 ± 24.7 months (range 24–105 months) with a total of follow-up of 92.5 patient-years.

Table 1 provides the rates of the various clinical manifestations at disease onset and throughout the follow-up and the rates of unilateral and bilateral involvement of the retinas and inner ears at onset and at the end of follow-up.

All patients were treated after diagnosis with a combination of immunologic/immunosuppressive medications according to the severity of the clinical neurologic presentation as provided in Table 1. Overall, throughout the follow-up, the patients received the following treatments: corticosteroids (methylprednisolone or prednisone), 19 patients; IV immunoglobulins, 19 patients; mycophenolate mofetil, 12 patients; azathioprine, 2 patients; rituximab, 10 patients; and cyclophosphamide (CTX), 7 patients.

Clinical Manifestations and Severity of the Disease at Onset and the End of Follow-Up

At SuS onset, 16 patients had symptomatic cerebral manifestations, 15 patients presented with hearing loss, and 17 patients sustained BRAOs and/or AWH. A complete clinical triad of SuS was found in 9 patients (45.0%) at the time of disease onset and in 14 patients (70.0%) at the end of follow-up (Table 1). Table 2 lists the clinical severity of each target organ affected by the disease.

### Evaluation of tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy in susac syndrome [^f5a23c78]. Retina (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy on ocular relapses in patients with Susac syndrome.

Methods

Multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with Susac syndrome according to classical clinical criteria. We evaluated the disease activity before and after introduction of anti-TNF therapy and its value as a steroid-sparing agent.

Results

Five patients were included. All were initially treated with a combination of corticosteroids and classical immunosuppressive drugs. Infliximab was started in three patients, and adalimumab was started in two patients. Patients had on average 5 ocular relapses during a mean follow-up time of 2.59 years before introducing a TNF inhibitor, corresponding with on average 1.93 relapses per year. After the introduction of an anti-TNF agent, this number was reduced by factor 5.51 to an average of 0.35 relapses per year for a mean follow-up of 2.86 years (P = 0.10). Before anti-TNF introduction ocular relapses occurred at a mean daily dose of 34 mg of prednisone, whereas with anti-TNF treatment, corticosteroid administration could be completely stopped in four patients with one patient still needing 5 mg daily (P = 0.10). Infliximab and adalimumab generally were well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

Although not statistically significant, our results suggest that anti-TNF therapy can be a valuable option for the treatment of ocular Susac syndrome and may especially be considered in those patients unresponsive to more conventional immunosuppressive treatment.

### Susac's syndrome: a case of simultaneous development of all three components of the triad [^aaec61a3]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Susac's syndrome is characterized by the clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions and sensorineural hearing loss. We here report a case of 46 year old woman with a sudden diminution in visual acuity at the left eye, headache and decreased hearing at the right ear with mild confusion considered as Susac's syndrome with complete triad. Although it's a relatively rare entity, it should be kept in mind in differential diagnosis of the neurological disorders, especially in women in 20- to 40-year of age presenting with acute hearing loss.

### Cognitive outcomes in susac syndrome: a 2-year neuropsychological follow-up study [^39489c49]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

This is the first prospective study to evaluate cognition in SuS over time and our data suggest normal cognitive functioning at a group level. Individual data showed interindividual variability, with most impairments being in attention, executive functioning and language. These improved after a 2‐year period, but patients only rarely performed normally in all cognitive domains over time. The high educational level of our patients, the treatment modalities and the activity of the disease, however, are factors that need to be taken into account. Patients reported significantly lower physical and mental well‐being, at the beginning of and throughout the disease course, emphasizing the importance of screening and treatment of these issues. Standardized multicentric testing is crucial to gain further insight into the impact of SuS on cognition.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^2ba40ae3]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid examination was performed in 28 patients and protein was markedly elevated at 1.77 g/l. This is in keeping with previously reported CSF findings in Susac syndrome revealing a mean protein of 1.6 g/l and may be an important early diagnostic clue to Susac syndrome. The CSF findings are again different from those found in multiple sclerosis where a cellular CSF is uncommon, CSF protein is usually normal or mildly elevated and oligoclonal bands are frequent; and also different from viral encephalitides where the CSF is usually highly cellular.

Incorrect alternative diagnoses may result in treatment with inappropriate medications including beta‐interferon for multiple sclerosis, placing patients at risk of harm from adverse effects. Beta‐interferon has previously been reported to be associated with worsening of ocular manifestations in Susac syndrome, and although it was not associated with abrupt clinical deterioration our patient did re‐present with visual disturbance after it was commenced. One patient also underwent a closure of a patent foramen ovale during the work up to their eventual diagnosis of Susac syndrome due to the MRI brain appearance of multiple small ischaemic infarcts which were thought to be due to microembolic disease. Although no patient who received intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange suffered significant side effects from these therapies they were exposed to unnecessary procedures. Brain biopsy was performed in four patients contributing to morbidity and placing these patients at risk of procedure‐related complications. A brain biopsy should not be required routinely for the diagnosis of Susac syndrome.

Our study is limited by small numbers of patients and the retrospective data collection which meant that it could be difficult to be certain of the precise onset of symptoms such as headache or visual disturbance. In addition, clinicians often consider several potential diagnoses at once, or establish a provisional diagnosis, only coming to a firmer conclusion later in the diagnostic process. It is therefore possible that Susac syndrome was considered early in the diagnostic process by some clinicians but not made explicit in the patient record until other more common diagnoses had been excluded. Our data were collected at two specialty neuro‐immunology clinics with a special interest in Susac syndrome. Nevertheless, most patients were assessed at other centres first and so our data would appear to be representative of real‐world experience with the disease but a selection bias toward less typical cases cannot be excluded. Notably, our cohort had a relatively even male to female ratio which is different from the female preponderance reported in other studies.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of susac syndrome [^49190297]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

The finding in this series that headache was the most common presenting symptom occurring in 78% (25/32) is similar to other studies which report its presence in over 60% of patients at disease onset. Headache in Susac syndrome can be indistinguishable from migraine which explains why migraine was a common initial diagnosis in our study and why patients with headache and visual disturbance had a longer time to diagnosis than other presentations. It is argued that Susac syndrome should be considered in any patient with new onset migraine with visual symptoms and an MRI brain showing white matter lesions involving the corpus callosum, or if associated with diffusion‐weighted imaging change and/or gadolinium enhancement. It is advocated that these patients also have an ocular review and audiology specifically to exclude Susac syndrome or another BEE syndrome.

Previous reports suggest that 40% of patients have auditory and/or visual disturbance at presentation. In this series 63% (20/32) had vestibulocochlear disturbance and 38% (12/32) visual disturbance at presentation. Patients with visual disturbance at presentation had a longer delay in time to diagnosis than those with vestibulocochlear presentations (5.25 vs. 3 months). Vestibulocochlear symptoms were common at presentation yet were only fully investigated with quantitative neuro‐otology testing at presentation in 30% of patients (6/20). SNHL in Susac syndrome can be acute or subacute, unilateral or bilateral, simultaneous or sequential in nature, and typically affects low‐ to mid‐frequencies. A potential diagnostic dilemma is the commonly encountered overlap of vestibular migraine and Ménière's disease, particularly in young females, which also presents with headache, vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss. It is suggested that, in addition to MRI of the internal acoustic canals to exclude a retrocochlear lesion in any patient who presents with headache, vertigo and documented low‐ to mid‐frequency asymmetric SNHL, a full MRI of the brain should also be obtained concurrently with a view to excluding Susac syndrome. Visual symptoms were investigated with FFA in only 42% (5/12) of patients at presentation. Furthermore, one of the five patients who underwent FFA had the FFA inaccurately reported at the time of presentation, leading to a 1‐month delay in diagnosis.

### Clinical characterization and ancillary tests in susac syndrome: a systematic review [^938aee31]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Clinical Presentation at Disease Onset and During Follow-Up

Ocular and neuro-otological involvement were reported in 190 (61.1%) and 161 (51.8%) of cases, respectively. These numbers represent a numerical increase compared with our previous data, which is probably because of increased awareness and the use of ancillary tests. It is now becoming obvious that the diagnosis of SuS should not be solely on the basis of the complete triad, and a targeted search for subclinical involvement using diagnostic imaging, fluorescein angiography (FA), and audiometry is needed.

During disease with a mean follow-up of 36 months, the complete triad was documented in 60% of cases with available data. The remaining 40% of cases were interpreted as incomplete SuS, had an incomplete diagnostic workup, or were not sufficiently described. Neurologic (91%), ophthalmologic (84%), and neuro-otological (67%) manifestations occurred at similar proportions in most cases during disease. Neuro-otological involvement remains the least reported manifestation (67%). CNS manifestations are described in Table 3. The most common CNS symptoms were neuropsychiatric and included cognitive impairment, confusion, and emotional and behavioral disturbances as previously reported. In the 2 cohorts together, 49% of patients with SuS suffered from confusion and 49% from cognitive impairment. These features are difficult to define and are not uniform from one case report to the other. Because they are nonspecific, caution should be taken in patients in which the presentation is mainly neuropsychiatric, and an extensive objective evaluation including the search for asymptomatic eye involvement can be crucial for the diagnosis. Only 6% of patients with SuS had ocular symptoms, which emphasized that ocular involvement can often be subclinical. Tinnitus was reported in 32% in total, and vertigo were reported in 22% in our current cohort. Vertigo was not described in our previous review, and it is now emerging as an important symptom. While a proportion of these patients may have vertigo because of brainstem or cerebellar involvement, in others, it may reflect peripheral vestibular pathology. Detailed study of vestibular involvement in SuS is lacking although the diagnostic criteria require an abnormal testing. In a recent publication on the neuro-otology of SuS, caloric testing and vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) were pathologic in 3 patients with SuS, demonstrating horizontal semicircular canal dysfunction in one and utricular dysfunction and saccular deficits in others.

### Susac's syndrome – A new ocular finding and disease outcome [^bce2592f]. Eye (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Susac's syndrome, a rare autoimmune vasculo-occlusive disease, may pose a diagnostic challenge and result in a devastating ocular and systemic outcome. Our study identifies a new retinal finding and evaluates disease outcome. We aimed to assess clinical and imaging findings, systemic manifestations and disease outcome in patients with ocular Susac's syndrome under immunosuppressive/immunomodulation therapies.

Methods

Retrospective tertiary center study including patients with a diagnosis of Susac's syndrome with > 12 months follow up. Medical record review including ocular, neurological and auditory clinical and imaging findings, and treatment modalities. Main outcome measures were clinical manifestations and disease outcome.

Results

Seven patients (14 eyes) with a mean age of 34.1 years were included. Mean follow-up was 31.9 months (12.4–72.4). All had bilateral ocular disease. Retinal microaneurysms, a new ocular finding, were demonstrated in 5 patients and persisted at the final visit. In 5 eyes, they further extended during follow-up. All were treated with immunosuppressive drugs and 5/7 additional immunomodulation therapy. At last examination, best corrected visual acuity was > 20/40 in all eyes, 1/10 eyes had visual field deterioration, no eye had active ocular disease, all patients achieved neurological stability, and 1 patient had auditory deterioration.

Conclusion

Retinal microaneurysms, a new ocular finding in Susac's syndrome, were present in most of our patients, indicating ischemic retinal damage. Immunosuppressive and immunomodulation therapies seem to be highly effective in the control of disease activity.

Guidelines

Guidelines on polycystic ovary syndrome vary in their methodological quality, approach to diagnosis, approach to screening for health risks, and recommendations for the use of drug treatments. The 2023 update to the international polycystic ovary syndrome guidelines, which uses consensus methodology and clear grading systems for clinical recommendations, has now been released. These evidence based guidelines were developed after consultation with international multidisciplinary and consumer bodies to support clinicians and patients in the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome and reduce variation in care.

### Brain microstructural damage through serial diffusion tensor imaging and outcomes in susac syndrome: a prospective cohort study [^5a753a83]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of SuS is empirical, based on the hypothesis of an autoimmune endotheliopathy supporting the use of immunosuppressive (IS) drugs in addition to corticosteroids. In the absence of randomized trials, it remains unclear how much and for how long treatment is required and what is the real impact of IS drugs on the natural history of SuS. Because brain microstructural damage in the corpus callosum occurs early and is associated with poor outcome, brain DTI might help to identify SuS patients with a more severe disease in whom the use of IS drugs might be required at early stage.

Surprisingly, we observed a dissociation between MD and FA in the splenium of the corpus callosum, with a significant increase in FA during follow‐up. Kleffner et al. found no decrease in FA in the splenium of nine SuS patients, whereas the genu of the corpus callosum was affected. Several hypotheses could explain such an unexpected finding. The normal splenium appears to exhibit a distinct DTI behavior, with increased FA as compared to the rest of the corpus callosum. Lesional mechanisms in the splenium might also be specific. For instance, cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum, primarily affecting the splenium, could be due to intramyelinic edema, which might partially explain the reversibility of these lesions. In traumatic brain injury, splenium lesions are also observed, but these are likely caused by diffuse axonal injury leading to axonal degeneration. In Susac syndrome, the lesions are probably due to direct microvascular impairment. The combined effects of the splenium's microstructural specificity and the lesions caused by Susac syndrome might partially explain the dissociation observed between MD and FA. Another hypothesis could involve other causes of increased FA, such as tighter axonal fibers or changes in the perivascular composition, with an increase in the collagenous component.

### Incomplete susac syndrome exacerbated after natalizumab [^2bc93d0e]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Increased relapse frequency after the start of immunomodulatory drugs effective in MS, such as alemtuzumab, interferon β, and natalizumab, in patients with "atypical" inflammatory diseases of the CNS has been described. In our case, there was a dramatic temporal relationship between the initiation of natalizumab and disease exacerbation. It is possible that natalizumab altered the balance of the immune system by decreasing circulating T regulatory cells with a subsequent increase in the number of proinflammatory cytokine-producing T cells or blocked egress of regulatory natural killer cells from the periphery into the brain, hence precipitating the relapse. Another hypothesis is that natalizumab, being a monoclonal antibody, may be causing activation of the complement and thus inducing the relapse, although no supporting evidence was found in the literature.

Our case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing atypical relapsing idiopathic inflammatory disease of the CNS, even with the help of a brain biopsy, and demonstrates the risk of treating these conditions with MS-specific immune-modulating drugs.

### Susac syndrome with the typical clinical triad: a case report and literature review [^91091e43]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Susac syndrome is an immune-mediated microvascular disease characterized by the clinical triad of acute multiple encephalopathies, branch retinal artery occlusion, and sensorineural hearing loss. However, the typical clinical triad is not seen in all patients at disease onset. In this study, a 29-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to aggravation of headache accompanied by retarded reaction. After treatment for a diagnosis of possible central nervous system vasculitis, the patient's retarded reaction and neurological dysfunction were improved. One year after discharge, the patient had no abnormal clinical symptoms and he discontinued taking prednisone voluntarily five months after discharge. Two years later, the patient was admitted to our hospital again owing to a sudden visual field defect in the superonasal quadrant of the left eye for one week, and Susac syndrome was diagnosed. After treatment, the patient's condition became stabilized with no further progress, but the visual field defect did not recover. At the onset of Susac syndrome, the typical clinical triad of Susac syndrome is rare, so this disease is difficult to be recognized at the beginning. The case we report presented the clinical triad two years after the disease onset. We expect that this case report will increase physicians' understanding of Susac syndrome.
