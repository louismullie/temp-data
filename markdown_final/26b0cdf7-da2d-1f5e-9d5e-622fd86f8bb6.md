## Question

Diabetes Insipidus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diabetes insipidus, including its definition, pathophysiology, classification, diagnostic approach, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and why the nomenclature is changing. Then, I should classify the etiologies and explain the pathophysiology. Next, I will review the diagnostic strategy, including when to use copeptin versus the water deprivation test. After that, I need to outline management by subtype, including special populations and emergencies. Finally, I should consider prognosis, follow-up, and key pitfalls, and I will double-check any points that seem uncertain as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the definition and the rationale for renaming. Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by excretion of large volumes of hypotonic urine with compensatory polydipsia, due to impaired AVP secretion or renal resistance to AVP; importantly, it is distinct from diabetes mellitus and should not be conflated with it. Wait, let me verify the new nomenclature: the working group proposes arginine vasopressin deficiency for central etiologies and arginine vasopressin resistance for nephrogenic etiologies, and this change has been adopted by SNOMED, which better reflects pathophysiology and reduces harmful confusion with diabetes mellitus [^489e042e] [^62a83993].

> I will now examine the classification and pathophysiology. Central DI, now AVP deficiency, results from impaired synthesis or release of AVP from the hypothalamic–posterior pituitary axis, often due to pituitary surgery, trauma, infiltrative disease, or familial forms; nephrogenic DI, now AVP resistance, reflects impaired renal response to AVP, most classically from V2 receptor or AQP2 mutations or from acquired causes such as lithium, hypercalcemia, or hypokalemia; gestational DI arises from placental vasopressinase degrading AVP; and primary polydipsia reflects excessive fluid intake suppressing AVP and blunting renal concentrating ability, which can mimic DI phenotypically [^5ba46e12] [^9ae1ba30] [^fc5b4b7b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnosis before I confirm the initial workup. I should first exclude osmotic diuresis and confirm hypotonic polyuria, typically defined as urine output greater than 50 mL/kg/day with urine osmolality less than 300 mOsm/kg and serum osmolality greater than 295 mOsm/kg, while ensuring urine glucose is negative to rule out glycosuria as a driver of polyuria [^a1cc6ecb] [^3347c930]. Let me double-check that these thresholds align with contemporary guidance; yes, they remain standard in endocrine practice and help anchor the differential before proceeding to subtype testing [^a1cc6ecb].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. Historically, the water deprivation test was the reference standard, but it has only about 70–77% accuracy and is cumbersome, with frequent indeterminate results; therefore, I need to consider copeptin-based strategies that outperform it in prospective studies [^0197102c] [^eeeea1d3]. Let me verify the copeptin cutoffs: baseline copeptin greater than 21.4 pmol/L essentially rules in nephrogenic DI with near-perfect sensitivity and specificity, obviating further testing; osmotically stimulated copeptin greater than 4.9 pmol/L after hypertonic saline infusion distinguishes AVP deficiency from primary polydipsia with about 96–97% accuracy; and arginine-stimulated copeptin with a 60-minute cutoff around 3.8 pmol/L provides about 93% accuracy and avoids hypertonic saline risks, though I should confirm local assay performance and protocols before relying on it [^5fa70f9f] [^0197102c] [^b31ea5d1] [^3d9f3a59]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the arginine cutoff was 4.9 pmol/L; let me correct that — the validated 60-minute cutoff is approximately 3.8 pmol/L in pooled analyses, not 4.9 pmol/L, which applies to hypertonic saline stimulation instead [^b31ea5d1] [^0197102c].

> I should confirm the role of MRI and when to order it. Once biochemical DI is established, MRI of the pituitary and hypothalamus with appropriate protocols is indicated to identify structural causes such as tumors, infiltrative disease, or stalk abnormalities; the absence of the posterior pituitary bright spot supports central DI but is not specific, as it can also be absent in primary polydipsia, so I need to interpret imaging in clinical context [^ca27693c] [^075a839f] [^00a97e15]. But wait, what if the patient has adipsia or altered thirst? In that scenario, I need to ensure close monitoring and a regimented fluid–desmopressin plan because hypernatremia risk is high and patients may not self-correct [^ee5eaaf1].

> Now, I will outline management by subtype, starting with AVP deficiency. Desmopressin is first-line, with individualized dosing and periodic intentional aquaresis to mitigate hyponatremia risk; patients should be educated on overdose risk and wear emergency identification, and in the perioperative setting, I should anticipate triphasic patterns and titrate therapy to the phase to avoid over- or undertreatment [^7cfee946] [^47da491e] [^47da491e]. Hold on, I should verify inpatient hypernatremia correction rates; yes, in acute hypernatremia, correction should not exceed about 0.5 mmol/L per hour and no more than 10 mmol/L in 24 hours to reduce cerebral risks, with faster initial correction only if symptomatic, and desmopressin can be given parenterally when needed [^0e19c87b] [^b1ac3736] [^6cdc2b28].

> For AVP resistance, I need to ensure I address the cause and use adjuncts. Stop offending drugs like lithium when feasible, correct metabolic disturbances such as hypercalcemia or hypokalemia, and consider thiazide diuretics with dietary sodium restriction to reduce polyuria; in refractory cases, amiloride or prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors may help, and emerging therapies targeting the cAMP pathway are under study, so I should tailor choices to severity and comorbidities [^5ba46e12] [^cc0a2009]. Let me reconsider infant-specific therapy: in neonates and infants, a low-solute formula plus thiazide is preferred to avoid sodium fluctuations with desmopressin, which I should remember when counseling families [^8e15d9d9].

> For primary polydipsia, I should confirm the diagnosis with copeptin-based testing and then focus on behavioral modification to gradually reduce fluid intake, often with psychiatric or psychosomatic support, while monitoring for hyponatremia if fluid restriction is too aggressive; I need to ensure we do not mistakenly treat with desmopressin, which can precipitate dangerous hyponatremia in this group [^fc5b4b7b] [^8084adfd]. Hold on, I should verify that the diagnostic accuracy of copeptin truly exceeds the water deprivation test for this distinction; yes, multiple prospective studies show about 96–97% accuracy for hypertonic saline–stimulated copeptin versus roughly 70–77% for water deprivation, supporting this approach when available [^0197102c] [^25efc5bb].

> I need to check special populations and emergencies. In pregnancy, desmopressin is safe and effective for gestational DI because it is not degraded by vasopressinase; I should monitor closely for preeclampsia and adjust dosing as pregnancy progresses [^9ae1ba30]. In children, I should maintain a high index of suspicion for infiltrative disease or tumors and use MRI early; polyuria thresholds are adjusted to body surface area, and urgent referral is warranted if dehydration is present [^e21ccd91] [^21f907ed] [^23c8070c]. In adipsic DI, I must implement fixed fluid and desmopressin regimens with frequent sodium checks to prevent catastrophic hypernatremia, and I should coordinate multidisciplinary care [^ee5eaaf1]. For postoperative patients, I should monitor fluid balance every 3–6 hours initially, anticipate triphasic patterns, and consider early copeptin on postoperative day 1 to predict persistent DI, while avoiding premature desmopressin in transient cases [^e1b6acbc] [^77f05ea7].

> Let me consider prognosis and follow-up. Many cases of postoperative or post-traumatic DI are transient, so I should attempt withdrawal of desmopressin over weeks to months to assess recovery; persistent DI requires lifelong therapy and education, with periodic reassessment of anterior pituitary axes because combined deficits are common, especially after surgery or infiltrative disease [^7cfee946] [^325180b0]. I should confirm that patients have emergency identification and understand sick-day rules, and I will monitor for hyponatremia at follow-up visits given its frequency with desmopressin therapy [^7cfee946].

> Finally, I should double-check key pitfalls and how to avoid them. Confusion with diabetes mellitus can delay desmopressin and lead to harm, which is why the name change is important; SGLT2 inhibitors can obscure hypotonic polyuria and blunt desmopressin response, so I should hold them when evaluating suspected DI; and glucocorticoid therapy can unmask partial DI, so I need to monitor for new polyuria after starting steroids in hypopituitarism [^489e042e] [^81e48591] [^776bdaa0]. Hold on, I should verify that these pitfalls are supported by evidence; yes, case reports and guidelines document these scenarios, reinforcing the need for careful medication reconciliation and anticipatory guidance during endocrine replacement [^81e48591] [^776bdaa0].

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder of impaired water balance characterized by **polyuria and polydipsia** due to either arginine vasopressin deficiency (central DI) or renal resistance to AVP (nephrogenic DI). Diagnosis relies on confirming hypotonic polyuria, then differentiating subtypes using **copeptin-based testing** [^0197102c] or a water deprivation test [^eeeea1d3]. Central DI is treated with desmopressin [^c03ceba0], while nephrogenic DI focuses on removing the cause and using thiazides or amiloride [^5ba46e12]; all patients need education on fluid management and emergency protocols [^7cfee946]. Accurate diagnosis and individualized therapy are essential to prevent complications such as hypernatremia, dehydration, and hyponatremia [^7cfee946].

---

## Pathophysiology and classification

DI is classified into **four main types** based on the underlying mechanism:

| **Type** | **Mechanism** | **Causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Central DI (CDI) | Deficiency of AVP secretion from the posterior pituitary | - Trauma <br/> - Surgery <br/> - Tumors <br/> - Infiltrative diseases <br/> - Idiopathic [^6d82e39b] [^840eee58] |
| Nephrogenic DI (NDI) | Renal resistance to AVP | - Genetic mutations (AVPR2, AQP2) <br/> - Lithium <br/> - Hypercalcemia <br/> - Hypokalemia <br/> - Obstructive uropathy [^5ba46e12] [^cc0a2009] |
| Gestational DI | Increased AVP degradation by placental vasopressinase | Pregnancy [^9ae1ba30] |
| Primary polydipsia | Excessive fluid intake suppressing AVP | - Psychiatric disorders <br/> - Dipsogenic DI [^6d82e39b] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Polyuria**: > 3 liters/day of dilute urine (specific gravity < 1.005) [^6d82e39b].
- **Polydipsia**: Excessive thirst, often craving cold water [^6d82e39b].
- **Nocturia**: Frequent nighttime urination [^6d82e39b].
- **Hypernatremia**: If fluid restricted or access limited, especially in adipsic CDI [^ee5eaaf1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Serum and urine osmolality**: Serum osmolality > 295 mOsm/kg with urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg supports DI [^a1cc6ecb].
- **Serum sodium**: May be normal or elevated depending on fluid intake [^252c172f].
- **Glucose**: Exclude diabetes mellitus as a cause of polyuria [^69c6121c].

---

### Differentiation of DI subtypes

The **water deprivation test** has long been the gold standard [^eeeea1d3], but copeptin-based tests offer higher accuracy and safety [^0197102c]:

| **Test** | **Method** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Water deprivation test | - Deprive fluids <br/> - Measure urine osmolality <br/> - Give desmopressin | - Central DI: urine osmolality rises > 50% after desmopressin <br/> - Nephrogenic DI: minimal response <br/> - Primary polydipsia: intermediate response [^eeeea1d3] |
| Hypertonic saline-stimulated copeptin | Infuse 3% saline to raise Na+ > 147 mmol/L; measure copeptin | - Central DI: copeptin < 4.9 pmol/L <br/> - Primary polydipsia: copeptin > 4.9 pmol/L [^0197102c] |
| Arginine-stimulated copeptin | - Give arginine <br/> - Measure copeptin at 60 min | - Central DI: copeptin < 3.8 pmol/L <br/> - Primary polydipsia: copeptin > 3.8 pmol/L [^b31ea5d1] |

---

Baseline copeptin > 21.4 pmol/L **diagnoses nephrogenic DI** with 100% sensitivity and specificity [^5fa70f9f].

---

## Management strategies

### Central diabetes insipidus

- **Desmopressin (DDAVP)**: Intranasal, oral, or injectable; individualized dosing to balance control and hyponatremia risk [^7cfee946].
- **Patient education**: Fluid management, overdose risk, and emergency protocols [^7cfee946].
- **Monitoring**: Regular serum sodium and urine output checks [^7cfee946].

---

### Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus

- **Treat underlying cause**: Stop lithium, correct calcium/potassium, relieve obstruction [^5ba46e12].
- **Thiazide diuretics**: Induce mild volume contraction, reducing polyuria [^5ba46e12].
- **Amiloride**: Especially with lithium-induced NDI [^notfound].
- **Dietary measures**: Low-salt, low-protein diet to reduce osmotic load [^notfound].

---

### Gestational diabetes insipidus

Desmopressin is safe and effective because it is **not degraded by vasopressinase** [^9ae1ba30].

---

## Complications

Untreated or improperly managed DI can lead to:

- **Hypernatremia**: Dehydration, confusion, seizures, coma [^ee5eaaf1].
- **Hyponatremia**: From overtreatment with desmopressin [^7cfee946].
- **Dehydration**: Especially in children and elderly [^b30732ec].
- **Quality of life**: Sleep disruption, social impairment, psychological distress [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on etiology and adherence. Postoperative or traumatic CDI may be transient, whereas idiopathic or genetic forms are often permanent [^e1b6acbc]. With appropriate therapy, most patients achieve good symptom control and quality of life [^325180b0].

---

## Recent advances

- **Copeptin testing**: Higher diagnostic accuracy and safety than water deprivation [^0197102c] [^b31ea5d1].
- **New desmopressin formulations**: Improved pharmacokinetics and patient adherence [^notfound].
- **Genetic testing**: Guides diagnosis and counseling in hereditary DI [^3bb6fd24].

---

Diabetes insipidus is a disorder of impaired water balance with **polyuria and polydipsia**; accurate diagnosis and subtype differentiation are essential for effective management. Copeptin-based testing improves diagnostic accuracy, and therapy should be individualized to minimize complications and optimize quality of life [^0197102c].

### Familial forms of diabetes insipidus: clinical and molecular characteristics [^fd0726a2]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Over the past two decades, the genetic and molecular basis of familial forms of diabetes insipidus has been elucidated. Diabetes insipidus is a clinical syndrome characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of diluted urine (polyuria) and increased fluid intake (polydipsia). The most common type of diabetes insipidus is caused by lack of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (vasopressin), which is produced in the hypothalamus and secreted by the neurohypophysis. This type of diabetes insipidus is referred to here as neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. The syndrome can also result from resistance to the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin on the kidney, either at the level of the vasopressin 2 receptor or the aquaporin 2 water channel (which mediates the re-absorption of water from urine), and is referred to as renal or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between these two types of diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia can be difficult owing to the existence of partial as well as complete forms of vasopressin deficiency or resistance. Seven different familial forms of diabetes insipidus are known to exist. The clinical presentation, genetic basis and cellular mechanisms responsible for them vary considerably. This information has led to improved methods of differential diagnosis and could provide the basis of new forms of therapy.

### Clinical review: current state and future perspectives in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus: a clinical review [^a4459510]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

The differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI) is often challenging but essential, because treatment may vary substantially. This article analyzes the database and performance of currently used differential diagnostic tests for DI and discusses future perspectives for diagnostic improvement.

Evidence Acquisition

A review of electronic and print data comprising original and review articles retrieved from the PubMed or Cochrane Library database up to January 2012 was conducted. The search term "polyuria polydipsia syndrome" was cross-referenced with underlying forms of disease and associated clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic MeSH terms. In addition, references from review articles and textbook chapters were screened for papers containing original data. Search results were narrowed to articles containing primary data with a description of criteria for the differential diagnosis of DI.

Evidence Synthesis

Fifteen articles on differential diagnosis of DI were identified, mainly consisting of small series of patients, and mostly covering only part of the differential diagnostic spectrum of DI. Test protocols differed, and prospective validation of diagnostic criteria was consistently missing. Inconsistent data were reported on the diagnostic superiority of direct plasma arginine vasopressin determination over the indirect water deprivation test. Both test methods revealed limitations, especially in the differentiation of disorders with a milder phenotype.

Conclusion

The available data demonstrate limitations of current biochemical tests for the differential diagnosis of DI, potentially leading to incorrect diagnosis and treatment. The newly available assay for copeptin, the C terminus of the vasopressin precursor, holds promise for a higher diagnostic specificity and simplification of the differential diagnostic protocol in DI.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: how to define and grade this complication? [^8cb58a44]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pituitary tumors require specialized care in particular for surgical management. Centralization of care for patients with a pituitary tumor in Pituitary Centers of Excellence that deal with high surgical volumes and harbor multidisciplinary teams is advocated to minimize disease- and treatment-related morbidity. Local audits within treatment facilities, but also comparison of treatment results and complications between centers, hold the promise for future quality assurance. Uniform application of the same definitions is mandatory to reliably measure and compare outcomes. However, establishing uniform definitions is challenging, especially for early postoperative complications such as diabetes insipidus (DI) and postoperative hyponatremia.

Postoperative DI is caused by vasopressin deficiency and is one of the most reported complications after pituitary tumor surgery. While in the future measurement of copeptin might be a viable alternative to vasopressin measurement and diagnose DI, to date, diagnosis of DI is based on clinical and indirect laboratory findings as serum vasopressin measurement is expensive and results are not available within the time frame necessary in this setting. The majority of studies reporting on the incidence of postoperative DI do not provide uniform definitions. There is variation in the use of clinical and biochemical parameters which limits reliable comparisons between studies (Table 1) and results in reported incidence range between 2 and 54%. Although there is evidence on the etiology, prevalence numbers, variety of DI patterns, predisposing factors, and treatment of postoperative diabetes insipidus, a formal and widely used definition or consensus statement is not yet available.

The primary objective of this review is to compose a definition and accompanying grading scheme for postoperative polyuria and DI. This study incorporates our data and experience from our center and a review of literature on pathophysiological mechanisms and definitions used in clinical studies reporting on postoperative DI.

### Vasopressin analog DDAVP in the treatment of diabetes insipidus… [^40d6a074]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- A synthetic vasopressin analog, 1-desamino-8D-arginine vasopressin, was found to be highly effective in the treatment of seven children and one adult with vasopressin-sensitive diabetes insipidus. The average duration of action of DDAVP was 10 to 11 hours, and with proper adjustment of dose, the subjects were able to control their symptoms satisfactorily with one or two inhalations daily. The youngest child in whom adequate control was achieved was 2 years of age. All subjects found the use of intranasal DDAVP superior to other forms of therapy, and none experienced any known side-effects after six months of treatment. All subjects in this study are currently using 2. 5μg to 10μg of DDAVP once or twice daily. Lee WP, Lippe BM, La Franchi SH, Kaplan SA.

### Diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus for the internist: an update [^cc2b2c9f]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Four entities have to be differentiated: central diabetes insipidus resulting from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus resulting from resistance to AVP in the kidneys, gestational diabetes insipidus resulting from an increase in placental vasopressinase and finally primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Distinguishing between the different types of diabetes insipidus can be challenging. A detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to detect the aetiology of diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between the various forms of hypotonic polyuria is then done by the classical water deprivation test or the more recently developed hypertonic saline or arginine stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. In patients with idiopathic central DI, a close follow-up is needed since central DI can be the first sign of an underlying pathology. Treatment of diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. This review will discuss issues and newest developments in diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment, with a focus on central diabetes insipidus.

### Changing the name of diabetes insipidus: a position statement of the working group for renaming diabetes insipidus [^489e042e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Changing the Name of Diabetes Insipidus

There are multiple reasons to change the name of diabetes insipidus at this time. First and foremost, although the terms mellitus and insipidus do differentiate between the clinical characteristics of these two very different causes of polyuria, and clearly are not eponyms, the use of the common term "diabetes" in both has unfortunately led to confusion for both patients and their caretakers. This confusion with diabetes mellitus has been to the detriment of patients with diabetes insipidus when they are under the care of non-endocrine specialists. Some physicians and nurses do not appreciate the difference between these two very different disorders. In several patients with central diabetes insipidus, desmopressin treatment was withheld with serious adverse outcomes, including death. This has led to high profile litigation cases and coroners' inquests involving the police, with wide media coverage. Subsequent to these unfortunate but avoidable cases, national safety alerts, surveys among endocrinologists, and a global task-force consisting of a wide range of senior clinicians involved with the care of patients with diabetes insipidus has led to a strong impetus to change the name of the condition. Second, patients with diabetes insipidus strongly support changing the name to eliminate "diabetes". In a survey of > 1000 patients with central diabetes insipidus recently published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology, 85% preferred the name to be changed, mainly because of experiences with insufficient understanding of the disease by health professionals who confused this disorder with diabetes mellitus. Indeed, 87% percent of patients felt that this lack of knowledge and the resulting clinical confusion affected the management of their condition, eg, repeated blood sugar measurements or prescription of medication for diabetes mellitus during hospitalization. Finally, we believe the names of medical disorders optimally should reflect the underlying pathophysiology, which in the case of diabetes insipidus is now well known to be deficient secretion and/or end-organ effects of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). Hence, for all the above reasons, the working group proposes that the name diabetes insipidus should be changed to arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) for central etiologies, and arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R) for nephrogenic etiologies, and this proposal has been endorsed by the following societies represented by the working group members: Endocrine Society, European Society of Endocrinology, Pituitary Society, Society for Endocrinology, European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology, Endocrine Society of Australia, Brazilian Endocrine Society, and Japanese Endocrine Society, and is under review at several other societies.

### Diabetes insipidus [^6d82e39b]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterized by excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine. Central DI results from a deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, whereas nephrogenic DI results from resistance to AVP in the kidneys. Central and nephrogenic DI are usually acquired, but genetic causes must be evaluated, especially if symptoms occur in early childhood. Central or nephrogenic DI must be differentiated from primary polydipsia, which involves excessive intake of large amounts of water despite normal AVP secretion and action. Primary polydipsia is most common in psychiatric patients and health enthusiasts but the polydipsia in a small subgroup of patients seems to be due to an abnormally low thirst threshold, a condition termed dipsogenic DI. Distinguishing between the different types of DI can be challenging and is done either by a water deprivation test or by hypertonic saline stimulation together with copeptin (or AVP) measurement. Furthermore, a detailed medical history, physical examination and imaging studies are needed to ensure an accurate DI diagnosis. Treatment of DI or primary polydipsia depends on the underlying aetiology and differs in central DI, nephrogenic DI and primary polydipsia.

### Diabetes insipidus: an update [^45148170]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus involves the distinction between central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. Differentiation is important because treatment strategies vary; the wrong treatment can be dangerous. Reliable differentiation is difficult especially in patients with primary polydipsia or partial forms of diabetes insipidus. New diagnostic algorithms are based on the measurement of copeptin after osmotic stimulation by hypertonic saline infusion or after nonosmotic stimulation by arginine and have a higher diagnostic accuracy than the water deprivation test. Treatment involves correcting preexisting water deficits, but is different for central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and primary polydipsia.

### Diagnostic accuracy of copeptin in the differential diagnosis of patients with diabetes insipidus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9c3c663d]. Endocrine Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Accurate diagnosis of diabetes insipidus (DI) is of significant importance for correct management. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of copeptin level measurements in the differential diagnosis between DI and primary polydipsia (PP).

Methods

A literature search of electronic databases from January 1, 2005, to July 13, 2022, was performed. Primary studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of copeptin concentration in patients with DI and PP were considered eligible. Two reviewers independently screened relevant articles and extracted data. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model and bivariate method were used.

Results

Seven studies including 422 patients with polydipsia-polyuria syndrome were included; of the 422 patients, 189 (44.79%) presented with arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, cranial DI) and 212 (50.24%) with PP. The summary estimates of the diagnostic performance of stimulated copeptin to differentiate between PP and AVP-D were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.97) for sensitivity and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.88–1.00) for specificity. Baseline copeptin level showed high performance in identifying AVP resistance (nephrogenic DI), with a pooled sensitivity of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.82–1.00) and specificity of 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98–1.00); however, it showed little value in the differentiation between PP and AVP-D.

Conclusion

Copeptin level measurement is a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of patients with DI and PP. Stimulation before copeptin measurement is necessary in the diagnosis of AVP-D.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: how to define and grade this complication? [^a2e5bdc0]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although transient diabetes insipidus (DI) is the most common complication of pituitary surgery, there is no consensus on its definition. Polyuria is the most overt symptoms of DI, but can also reflect several physiological adaptive mechanisms in the postoperative phase. These may be difficult to distinguish from and might coincide with DI. The difficulty to distinguish DI from other causes of postoperative polyuria might explain the high variation in incidence rates. This limits interpretation of outcomes, in particular complication rates between centers, and may lead to unnecessary treatment. Aim of this review is to determine a pathophysiologically sound and practical definition of DI for uniform outcome evaluations and treatment recommendations.

Methods

This study incorporates actual data and the experience of our center and combines this with a review of literature on pathophysiological mechanisms and definitions used in clinical studies reporting of postoperative DI.

Results

The occurrence of excessive thirst and/or hyperosmolality or hypernatremia are the best indicators to discriminate between pathophysiological symptoms and signs of DI and other causes. Urine osmolality distinguishes DI from osmotic diuresis.

Conclusions

To improve reliability and comparability we propose the following definition for postoperative DI: polyuria (urine production > 300 ml/hour for 3 h) accompanied by a urine specific gravity (USG) < 1.005, and at least one of the following symptoms: excessive thirst, serum osmolality > 300 mosmol/kg, or serum sodium > 145 mmol/L. To prevent unnecessary treatment with desmopressin, we present an algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative DI.

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^cde7ec53]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impairment of AVP secretion from the posterior pituitary. In clinical practice, it needs to be distinguished from renal resistance to the antidiuretic effects of AVP (nephrogenic DI), and abnormalities of thirst appreciation (primary polydipsia). As nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is rare in adults, unless they are treated with lithium salts, the practical challenge is how to differentiate between CDI and clinical disorders of excess thirst. The differential diagnosis is usually straight forward, but the recommended gold standard test, the water deprivation test, is not without interpretative pitfalls. The addition of the measurement of plasma AVP concentrations improves diagnostic accuracy, but the radioimmunoassay for AVP is technically difficult, and is only available in a few specialized centres. More recently, the measurement of plasma copeptin concentrations has been claimed to provide a reliable alternative to measurement of plasma AVP, without the sampling handling challenges. In addition, the measurement of thirst ratings can help the differentiation between CDI and primary polydipsia. Once the diagnosis of CDI is biochemically certain, investigations to determine the cause of AVP deficiency are needed. In this review, we will outline the diagnostic approach to polyuria, revisit the caveats of the water deprivation test and review recent data on value of adding AVP/copeptin measurement. We will also discuss treatment strategies for CDI, with analysis of potential complications of treatment.

Historical Context

Before explaining the rational for the name change, it is instructive to review the historical context for the name of diabetes insipidus. The polyuria and polydipsia of diabetes was first described by Demetrius of Apameia (first-second century BC), who used the term diabetes, meaning "passing water like a siphon" to describe the polyuria characteristic of this condition. Araetus of Cappadocia (81–138 AD) further defined the clinical characteristics of this disease. Although observations that the urine was sweet were alluded to in both Greek and Indian history, the first documented report of the sweet character of diabetic urine was published by the English physician Sir Thomas Willis in 1674 (The Diabetes or Pissing Evil). However, the differentiation between the saccharine urine of glucosuria and the non-saccharine urine of other forms of polyuria is attributed to the Scottish physician William Cullen, who appended the Latin word mellitus (sweet) to the Greek term diabetes to distinguish between these two types of polyuria. In 1794, Johann Peter Frank first introduced the term diabetes insipidus to differentiate these patients from those with diabetes mellitus. These terms persisted as valid clinical descriptions without known pathophysiology until the vasopressor and antidiuretic actions of posterior pituitary extracts were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th century, including use of posterior pituitary extracts to treat diabetes insipidus. In the mid-20th century, arginine vasopressin was synthesized and identified as the antidiuretic hormone, and the distinct central and nephrogenic etiologies of diabetes insipidus were recognized and characterized. Despite new knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of the different etiologies of diabetes insipidus by the late 20th century, no attempts were made to rename diabetes insipidus according to the known causes of the disorder, namely deficiency of arginine vasopressin or resistance to the receptor-mediated actions of arginine vasopressin.

### Diabetes insipidus: historical aspects [^183b8dff]. Pituitary (2004). Low credibility.

The contributions to our present knowledge and understanding of diabetes insipidus are briefly surveyed. Though a disease presenting with polyuria and thirst had been recognized since Antiquity, it was not until the 17. Century the distinction was made between diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus. At the beginning of the 20. Century almost nothing was known about the function of the pituitary. It was generally believed that diabetes insipidus was a renal disease. Two clinical observations in 1912 suggested an association between the hypophysis and diabetes insipidus. This view was supported by the recognition in 1913 that extract of the posterior lobe of the pituitary was effective in diabetes insipidus. Despite much evidence to the contrary, it was assumed that the antidiuretic hormone was produced in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. Around 1950 it was finally established that 'the posterior lobe hormones' are in fact secreted in the hypothalamus. At the same time the antidiuretic hormone was isolated and synthesized. More recently, progress within genetics has made it possible to characterize in details other rare types of diabetes insipidus.

### New developments and concepts in the diagnosis and management of diabetes insipidus (AVP-deficiency and resistance) [^2c8a430c]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder characterised by the excretion of large amounts of hypotonic urine, with a prevalence of 1 per 25,000 population. Central DI (CDI), better now referred to as arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficiency, is the most common form of DI resulting from deficiency of the hormone AVP from the pituitary. The less common nephrogenic DI (NDI) or AVP-resistance develops secondary to AVP resistance in the kidneys. The majority of causes of DI are acquired, with CDI developing when more than 80% of AVP-secreting neurons are damaged. Inherited/familial CDI causes account for approximately 1% of cases. Although the pathogenesis of NDI is unclear, more than 280 disease-causing mutations affecting the AVP2 protein or AVP V2 receptor, as well as in aquaporin 2 (AQP2), have been described. Although the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway remains the major regulatory pathway of AVP/AQP2 action, in vitro data have also revealed additional cAMP independent pathways of NDI pathogenesis. Diagnosing partial forms of DI, and distinguishing them from primary polydipsia, can be challenging, previously necessitating the use of the water deprivation test. However, measurements of circulating copeptin levels, especially after stimulation, are increasingly replacing the classical tests in clinical practice because of their ease of use and high sensitivity and specificity. The treatment of CDI relies on desmopressin administration, whereas NDI requires the management of any underlying diseases, removal of offending drugs and, in some cases, administration of diuretics. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of DI has led to novel evolving therapeutic agents that are under clinical trial.

### A history of diabetes insipidus: paving the road to internal water balance [^d68caa9e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is an ancient disease considered under the rubric of diabetes, the Greek descriptive term for polyuria, which was unrecognized even after the sweetness of urine was reported as a characteristic of diabetes mellitus in the 17th century. It would be another century before diabetes insipidus was identified from the insipid rather than saccharine taste of urine in cases of polyuria. After its increased recognition, pathologic observations and experimental studies connected diabetes insipidus to the pituitary gland in the opening decades of the 20th century. Simultaneously, posterior pituitary lobe extracts were shown to be vasoconstrictive (vasopressin) and antidiuretic (antidiuretic hormone). As vasopressin was purified and synthesized and its assay became available, it was shown to be released in response to both osmotic and volume stimuli that are integrated in the hypothalamus, and vasopressin thereby was essential to maintaining internal water balance. The antidiuretic properties of vasopressin to treat the rare cases of diabetes insipidus were of limited clinical utility until its vasoconstrictive effects were resuscitated in the 1970s, with the consequent increasing wider use of vasopressin for the treatment of compromised hemodynamic states. In addition, the discovery of antidiuretic hormone receptor blockers has led to their increasing use in managing hypo-osmolar states.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus [^5ba46e12]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Healthy kidneys maintain fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis by adjusting urine volume and composition according to physiological needs. The final urine composition is determined in the last tubular segment: the collecting duct. Water permeability in the collecting duct is regulated by arginine vasopressin (AVP). Secretion of AVP from the neurohypophysis is regulated by a complex signalling network that involves osmosensors, barosensors and volume sensors. AVP facilitates aquaporin (AQP)-mediated water reabsorption via activation of the vasopressin V2 receptor (AVPR2) in the collecting duct, thus enabling concentration of urine. In nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), inability of the kidneys to respond to AVP results in functional AQP deficiency. Consequently, affected patients have constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine. Primary forms of NDI result from mutations in the genes that encode the key proteins AVPR2 and AQP2, whereas secondary forms are associated with biochemical abnormalities, obstructive uropathy or the use of certain medications, particularly lithium. Treatment of the disease is informed by identification of the underlying cause. Here we review the clinical aspects and diagnosis of NDI, the various aetiologies, current treatment options and potential future developments.

3 THE ROLE OF COPEPTIN IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES INSIPIDUS

3.1 Polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome

Polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome is a common problem in clinical practice with the main entities being central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia. 38

While central diabetes insipidus is characterized by a complete (complete central diabetes insipidus) or partial (partial central diabetes insipidus) insufficient vasopressin (AVP) secretion from the pituitary, 39, 40 nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from an AVP resistance of the kidneys 41 both leading to hypotonic polyuria with compensatory polydipsia. Central diabetes insipidus can result from various conditions affecting the hypothalamic‐neurohypophyseal system such as trauma resulting from surgery or accident, local tumours or metastases, inflammatory/autoimmune or granulomatous diseases. 1, 42 Several reports also described genetic defects in the AVP synthesis leading to inherited forms of central diabetes insipidus. 20, 43 The most challenging form of central diabetes insipidus involves an impairment of the thirst perception and consecutive hypodipsia, which can result in severe hypernatremia. 38, 44

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from a lack of aquaporin 2 (AQP2)‐mediated water reabsorption in the collecting duct. This is either a consequence of gene mutations in the key proteins vasopressin V2 receptor or AQP2, is secondarily triggered by electrolyte disorders or is induced by certain drugs especially lithium. 41

The pathomechanism of primary polydipsia, which is characterized by excessive fluid intake, is less clear. An analysis of 23 patients with profound hyponatraemia due to primary polydipsia revealed an increased prevalence for psychiatric diagnoses such as dependency disorders (43%) and depression (35%). 45 Another prospective study with 156 patients with polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome however showed a similar rate (around 30%) of psychiatric disorders in patients with primary polydipsia and patients with central diabetes insipidus. 46 As chronic excessive fluid intake in patients with primary polydipsia leads to a down‐regulation of the AQP2 channels in the kidneys, the renal medullary concentration gradient is reduced, making any diagnostic evaluation of the urine osmolality and urinary output difficult. 47

Differentiation between the three mentioned entities is important since treatment strategies vary and application of the wrong treatment can be dangerous. 48 However, reliable differentiation is often difficult to achieve, 49 especially in patients with primary polydipsia or partial forms of diabetes insipidus. 2, 50

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^d6c8e640]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is the main regulating hormone of body fluid homeostasis. It is secreted from the posterior pituitary upon osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli, with the main osmotic stimulus being increased plasma osmolality and the main nonosmotic stimulus being hypovolaemia and promotes water reabsorption via V2 receptors in the kidney, thereby normalizing hypertonicity and vasomotor tone.

Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyper‐ and hypoosmolar circumstances: the classical hyperosmolar disorder (deficiency of body fluid relative to body solute 1) is diabetes insipidus, while the most common hypoosmolar disorder (excess of body fluid relative to body solute) is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD).

Diabetes insipidus belongs to the polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome and is characterized by a high urinary output of more than 50 mL per kg body weight per 24 hours, accompanied by polydipsia of more than 3 L a day. 2 After exclusion of osmotic diuresis (such as hyperglycaemia), the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome includes impaired AVP synthesis (central diabetes insipidus) or action (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) as well as primary polydipsia.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis is the predominant cause of hyponatraemia 3, 4 and is characterized by reduced free water excretion and secondary natriuresis, 5 mostly due to an imbalanced secretion of the antidiuretic hormone AVP. 6, 7

Arginine vasopressin measurement could theoretically help in the guidance of diagnosis and treatment of body fluid disorders. However, AVP is difficult to measure and unreliable, mainly due to complex pre‐analytical requirements. 8 Copeptin is the C‐terminal segment of the AVP precursor peptide and mirrors AVP concentrations. 9 It can easily be measured providing a reliable surrogate marker for AVP.

This review focuses on copeptin and its role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and SIAD.

Results

Baseline characteristics

A total of 96 patients underwent the arginine stimulation test from May 2013 to September 2018; 38 (40%) had AVP deficiency, and 58 (60%) had primary polydipsia. The median age for patients with AVP deficiency was 43 years [IQR, 31–54], with 58% female, compared to a median age of 35 years [30–41] and 72% female for patients with primary polydipsia. Among patients with AVP deficiency, 17 (45%) exhibited isolated posterior pituitary dysfunction, and 21 (55%) had combined anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunction. Patients with AVP deficiency and primary polydipsia showed similar total volumes of polyuria and polydipsia, baseline plasma sodium, and plasma copeptin levels. Baseline characteristics are summarised in Table 1.

Copeptin Based Tests to Differentiate Diabetes Insipidus From Primary Polydipsia

Given the different etiologies of these disorders, there are major differences in treatment. For example, while central diabetes insipidus is mainly treated with exogenous AVP (desmopressin), patients with primary polydipsia are advised to slowly reduce their fluid intake. Therefore, a diagnostic test with high diagnostic accuracy is crucial to avoid wrong treatment decisions. While the standard water deprivation test as described for our patient has been the diagnostic gold standard for decades despite its low diagnostic accuracy of only 70%, recent evaluations showed improved diagnostic accuracy for copeptin based tests.

The easiest etiology to diagnose is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, since copeptin measurements of these patients revealed consistently high levels. In fact, it has been shown that using an unstimulated copeptin cut-off of > 21.4 pmol/L had a 100% sensitivity and specificity to diagnose nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Accordingly, no further evaluations than a random copeptin measurement are needed in these patients.

Background

In March 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a worldwide pandemic with a significant mortality rate. One of the prominent features of COVID-19 is that it has the potential to affect various organ systems. Similar to other infectious diseases, one of the challenges for COVID-19 is the presence of both common and uncommon disease manifestations. Uncommon manifestations have a greater risk of going undiagnosed for a longer time. As an atypical manifestation, the spectrum of endocrine presentations in COVID-19 is still incomplete. Here, we describe a novel case of diabetes insipidus as a possible late-onset sequel of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^379458d4]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Copeptin is secreted in an equimolar amount to arginine vasopressin (AVP) but can easily be measured in plasma or serum with a sandwich immunoassay. The main stimuli for copeptin are similar to AVP, that is an increase in osmolality and a decrease in arterial blood volume and pressure. A high correlation between copeptin and AVP has been shown. Accordingly, copeptin mirrors the amount of AVP in the circulation. Copeptin has, therefore, been evaluated as diagnostic biomarker in vasopressin-dependent disorders of body fluid homeostasis. Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyper- and hypoosmolar circumstances: the classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus, while the most common hypoosmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Copeptin measurement has led to a "revival" of the direct test in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Baseline copeptin levels, without prior thirsting, unequivocally identify patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In contrast, for the difficult differentiation between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia, a stimulated copeptin level of 4.9 pmol/L upon hypertonic saline infusion differentiates these two entities with a high diagnostic accuracy and is clearly superior to the classical water deprivation test. On the contrary, in the SIAD, copeptin measurement is of only little diagnostic value. Copeptin levels widely overlap in patients with hyponatraemia and emphasize the heterogeneity of the disease. Additionally, a variety of factors lead to unspecific copeptin elevations in the acute setting further complicating its interpretation. The broad use of copeptin as diagnostic marker in hyponatraemia and specifically to detect cancer-related disease in SIADH patients can, therefore, not be recommended.

### Current perspective on the pathogenesis of central diabetes insipidus [^ad6aec30]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a heterogeneous condition characterised by polyuria and polydipsia caused by a lack of secretion of vasopressin, its physiological suppression following excessive water intake, or kidney resistance to its action. The clinical and laboratory diagnosis is confirmed by standard tests, but recent advances in molecular biology and imaging techniques have shed new light on the pathophysiology of this disease. In many patients, central diabetes insipidus is caused by a germinoma or craniopharyngioma; Langerhans' cell histiocytosis and sarcoidosis of the central nervous system; local inflammatory, autoimmune or vascular diseases; trauma from surgery or accident; and, rarely, genetic defects in vasopressin biosynthesis inherited as autosomal dominant or X-linked recessive traits. Thirty to fifty percent of cases are considered idiopathic. Tumour-associated central diabetes insipidus is uncommon in children younger than 5 years old. Biopsy of enlarged pituitary stalk should be reserved for patients with hypothalamic-pituitary mass and progressive thickening of the pituitary stalk since spontaneous recovery may occur. Molecular biology in selected patients may identify those with apparently idiopathic diabetes insipidus carrying the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene mutation.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology review on immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-mediated endocrinopathies provides a practical approach for clinicians based on a literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus and evidence from prospective, randomized clinical studies; cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; case-based studies; and an expert consensus. Immunotherapy with ICIs has transformed cancer care but frequently results in immune-mediated endocrinopathies that can cause acute and persistent morbidity and, rarely, death. Patterns differ between inhibitors of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programmed cell death protein 1 or programmed cell death ligand 1 pathways and most often involve the thyroid and pituitary glands, while less common presentations include insulin-deficient diabetes mellitus, primary adrenal insufficiency, primary hypoparathyroidism, central diabetes insipidus, primary hypogonadism, and pancreatitis, with or without progression to diabetes mellitus or exocrine insufficiency. The review emphasizes the need for a high index of clinical suspicion across specialties, provides diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for ICI-induced endocrinopathies, and proposes that patients on ICI therapy be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team in collaboration with endocrinologists.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^62a83993]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Investigation and management of hypotonic polyuria is a common challenge in clinical endocrinology. The 3 main causes, recently renamed to arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), and primary polydipsia (PP) require accurate diagnosis, as management differs for each. This new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and has now been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED). Advances in diagnosis over the last few years have centered around the use of copeptin measurement. Here, we use 3 patient case histories to highlight the use of this approach, and to demonstrate how it can succeed where other approaches, such as the water deprivation test, sometimes fail. We discuss the overall approach to each type of patient and the strengths and limitations of diagnostic strategies, illustrating the use of the new nomenclature.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, copeptin is a reliable surrogate parameter of AVP. In contrast to AVP, it is stable and can be measured easily with a sandwich immunoassay in serum or plasma. Copeptin is a promising new parameter clearly simplifying the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome. Here, high baseline levels unequivocally indicate nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and hypertonic saline‐stimulated copeptin levels differentiate between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia with a high sensitivity and specificity. Consequently, hypertonic saline infusion plus copeptin measurement could replace the indirect water deprivation test in the routine evaluation of patients with hypotonic polyuria.

In contrast, in SIAD, copeptin measurement is of only little diagnostic value. Copeptin levels widely overlap in patients with hyponatraemia and emphasize the heterogeneity of the disease. Additionally, a variety of factors leads to unspecific copeptin elevations in the acute setting further complicating its interpretation. The broad use of copeptin as diagnostic marker in hyponatraemia and specifically to detect cancer‐related disease in SIAD patients can, therefore, not be recommended. Nevertheless, extreme values point to a specific underlying pathophysiology: copeptin levels above 84 pmol/L indicate hypovolaemic hyponatraemia and the need for fluid infusion while low levels < 3.9 pmol/L are associated with primary polydipsia. Hyponatraemic patients presenting with undetectable copeptin levels and low free water clearance should be investigated for nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis.

Management of DI

In this section, we present the algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of postoperative DI that was reached consensus on at a local level to aid centers that do not have an operational protocol or are yet in the process of developing one. We would like to stress that the diagnostic and treatment process is complex and is both patient and situation dependent. Other centers might use different or adjusted protocols to satisfaction and with similar treatment results. Ideally, a consensus meeting between expert centers or within networks (as Endo-ERN) would be planned to take this further towards a general guideline for postoperative DI.

Diagnosis of postoperative DI (Fig. 1)

Fluid balance should continuously be monitored at six-hour intervals after surgery. A three-hour interval should be used in patients at high risk for DI or experiencing a current episode of DI (see Fig. 1). Specific attention should be given to the fluid balance during transfers between locations (e.g. from the operation room to the recovery room, recovery room to ward, intensive care unit to ward). Furthermore, unnecessary perioperative fluid administration of in the holding or operation room should be discouraged. As glucocorticoids suppress vasopressin release DI in patients with new adrenal insufficiency without glucocorticoid treatment may not become manifest and underestimated. Specific attention should be given to patients in which glucocorticoid treatment is initiated as an episode of DI may be "unmasked".

Utility of Copeptin Measurement in the Differential Diagnosis of Diabetes Insipidus

Differential Diagnoses of Polyuria–Polydipsia Syndrome

As discussed above, AVP is the main regulatory hormone for salt-water homeostasis. Stimulated by an increase in plasma osmolality or hypovolemia, AVP induces water reabsorption via V2 receptors in the kidneys. Impairment of this process leads to diabetes insipidus, characterized by polyuria of more than 50 mL per kg body weight per 24 hours of hypotonic urine and polydipsia of more than 3 L a day. Diabetes insipidus is further divided into a central and a nephrogenic origin. While the first cause is due to impaired AVP production or secretion upon osmotic or nonosmotic stimulation, the second cause results from renal resistance to AVP.

Central diabetes insipidus is mainly caused by destruction of the producing or secreting cells, leading to a partial or complete form. The main causes are accordingly pituitary surgery, head trauma, and infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis or metastases; inflammatory or autoimmune disorders such as hypophysitis and familial forms due to a genetic defect leading to impaired AVP synthesis are also known. A rare form, gestational diabetes insipidus, manifests during pregnancy and is caused by increased AVP metabolism due to the placental enzyme vasopressinase.

Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is mainly secondary to adverse drug effects (lithium), electrolyte disturbances (hypercalemia or hypokalemia) or kidney diseases, resulting in renal insensitivity to AVP and corresponding lack of aquaporin 2–mediated water reabsorption. If discovered early on, these secondary forms are often reversible in contrast to rare congenital forms due to mutations in the AVPR2 or the AQP2 genes.

An important differential diagnosis to central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is primary polydipsia. Here, polyuria–polydipsia occurs despite intact AVP secretion and renal sensitivity. As a result of this chronic excessive fluid intake, the concentration gradient in the renal medulla is continuously reduced with a downregulation of aquaporin 2 channels. Chronic central AVP suppression may also play a role. These factors lead to the excretion of hypotonic urine, making it difficult to distinguish it from diabetes insipidus. Primary polydipsia has been increasingly observed in health conscious people who aim for a high daily water intake; other possible triggers are dependency disorders or a reduced thirst threshold. Severe polydipsia has primarily been described in psychiatric patients.

Vasopressin receptor type 2 and AQP2 loss‐of‐function mutations: diabetes insipidus. There are four entities (central, nephrogenic, gestational, and primary polydipsia) that lead to excretion of large amounts of hypoosmotic urine, a condition known as diabetes insipidus. These different forms of diabetes insipidus have been reviewed very recently. Here, we will focus on the nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), which can be seen as a renal resistance to vasopressin (AVP), the antidiuretic hormone. This disease can either be inherited or acquired (mainly caused by lithium therapy, see below). Most (> 90%) of the inherited NDI cases are related to loss‐of‐function mutations of the AVPR2 gene encoding for the vasopressin receptor type 2 (V2R), expressed at the basolateral side of the PC in the CD. The remaining 10% are linked to mutations in the AQP2 gene.

### Arginine-stimulated copeptin measurements in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus: a prospective diagnostic study [^b31ea5d1]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus is challenging. The most reliable approach is hypertonic saline-stimulated copeptin measurements. However, this test is based on the induction of hypernatraemia and requires close monitoring of plasma sodium concentrations. Arginine-stimulated copeptin measurements might provide an alternative, simple, and safe test.

Methods

In this prospective diagnostic study, we recruited a development cohort from University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland, and a validation cohort from five centres in Basel, Aarau, Luzern, Bern, and St Gallen, Switzerland, and the University Hospital Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany. For both cohorts, patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 18 years or older, were newly referred with polyuria (> 50 mL/kg bodyweight per day) or had a known diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia. We also recruited a comparator cohort of healthy controls in parallel to each cohort, comprising adults (aged 18 years and older, with normal drinking habits, and no history of polyuria) and children who underwent arginine stimulation to diagnose growth hormone deficiency (children were only included in the comparator cohort to the development cohort as proof of concept). Patients and healthy controls underwent arginine stimulation with measurement of plasma copeptin at baseline and 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. The primary objective in the development cohort was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of plasma copeptin concentrations to discriminate between diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia, and in the validation cohort was to confirm those results. Adverse effects of the test were monitored in all participants, with tolerability of the test rated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) that ranged from no (0) to maximum (10) discomfort. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00757276.

Findings

Between May 24, 2013, and Jan 11, 2017, 52 patients were enrolled in the development cohort (12 [23%] with complete diabetes insipidus, nine [17%] with partial diabetes insipidus, and 31 [60%] with primary polydipsia) alongside 20 healthy adults and 42 child controls. Between Oct 24, 2017, and June 27, 2018, 46 patients were enrolled in the validation cohort (12 [26%] with complete diabetes insipidus, seven [15%] with partial diabetes insipidus, and 27 [59%] with primary polydipsia) alongside 30 healthy adult controls (two patients in this cohort were excluded from the main analysis because of early vomiting during the test). In the pooled patient and control datasets, median arginine-stimulated copeptin concentrations increased in healthy adult controls (from 5.2 pM [IQR 3.3–10.9] to a maximum of 9.8 pM [6.4–19.6]) and in participants with primary polydipsia (from 3.6 pM [IQR 2.4–5.7] to a maximum of 7.9 pM [5.1–11.8]), but only minimally in those with diabetes insipidus (2.1 pM [IQR 1.9–2.7] to a maximum of 2.5 pM [1.9–3.1]). In the development cohort, a cutoff of 3.5 pM at 60 min provided the highest diagnostic accuracy of 94% (95% CI 84–98). The accuracy of this cutoff in the validation cohort was 86% (95% CI 73–94). By pooling the data from both cohorts, an optimal accuracy of 93% (95% CI 86–97) was reached at a cutoff of 3.8 pM copeptin at 60 min (sensitivity 93%, 95% CI 86–98; specificity 92%, 95% CI 84–100). The test was safe and well tolerated, with median VAS scores of 3.5 (IQR 2–4) in patients with diabetes insipidus, 3 (2–4) in those with primary polydipsia, 1 (1–3) in healthy adults, and 1 (0–5) in healthy children in the pooled participant dataset.

Interpretation

Arginine-stimulated copeptin measurements are an innovative test for diabetes insipidus with high diagnostic accuracy, and could be a simplified, novel, and safe diagnostic approach to diabetes insipidus in clinical practice.

### Changing the name of diabetes insipidus: a position statement of the working group for renaming diabetes insipidus [^0cf85ebe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation of the Name Change for Diabetes Insipidus

In order to ease the transition in terms of online searches and avoid confusion in the literature, we propose that for several years we keep the previous name in parentheses. Therefore, we will begin using the terms AVP-Deficiency (cranial DI) and AVP-Resistance (nephrogenic DI) in manuscripts and chapters. Once the transition is complete, it is likely that the parenthetic term will be lost, albeit people can still use it if they wish. In addition, we have initiated a request to the ICD Coordination and Maintenance Committee to have the ICD-11 coding changed to reflect the new names.

We fully recognize that changing a name for a long-standing disease is never easy. But just as the rheumatologists who proposed the name change of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis), we hope that our medical colleagues will recognize and accept the above rationale for making this change, both in the interest of scientific accuracy, but more so for the benefit and safety of our mutual patients with diabetes insipidus so that their disease and its treatment will no longer be confused with diabetes mellitus.

### Diabetes insipidus in pregnancy: etiology, evaluation, and management [^9ae1ba30]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the approach to a patient with diabetes insipidus during pregnancy.

Methods

This review examines the normal physiology of water homeostasis, the related changes that occur during pregnancy, and the pathophysiology of diabetes insipidus in pregnancy. Associated complications, evaluation, and management are discussed.

Results

Diabetes insipidus can complicate up to 1 in 30,000 pregnancies. Diabetes insipidus during pregnancy has a variety of causes, some that predate the pregnancy and others that begin during gestation. Polyuria and polydipsia can occur or be exacerbated in women with overt or subclinical central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. These women have either decreased central secretory reserve or impaired renal responsiveness to vasopressin. In addition, women can experience diabetes insipidus de novo in pregnancy through the actions of placental vasopressinase, which causes accelerated degradation of vasopressin. This form of diabetes insipidus may be associated with increased complications of pregnancy, including preeclampsia. Management of central diabetes insipidus and transient diabetes insipidus of pregnancy can be achieved with 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin acetate) (DDAVP), a vasopressin analogue. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is typically resistant to both DDAVP and vasopressin and underlying causes should be addressed.

Conclusions

Increased awareness of diabetes insipidus in pregnancy may lead to early diagnosis and appropriate treatment that will reduce the risks of maternal and fetal morbidity. Overall, growing experience with DDAVP has shown that it is a safe and effective treatment for diabetes insipidus caused by a variety of factors.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^1103d26f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, the distinction between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia is not quite so straightforward because of the considerable overlap in baseline copeptin levels. In particular, distinguishing partial central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia is very challenging. Two new copeptin-based test procedures with high diagnostic accuracy have been proposed to overcome these difficulties: the hypertonic saline stimulation test and the arginine stimulation test.

Using osmotically stimulated copeptin levels as a diagnostic measure for diabetes insipidus was first described by our group in a study involving 55 patients with polyuria–polydipsia syndrome. Here, the cut-off value for copeptin of 4.9 mmol/L, measured after a rise in plasma sodium levels above 147 mmol/L, showed high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing central diabetes insipidus from primary polydipsia. We have recently validated this derived copeptin cut-off level in an international multicenter study including 156 patients with polyuria–polydipsia syndrome. For this study, plasma sodium levels were increased up to 150 mmol/L by an infusion of 3% hypertonic saline adjusted for body weight. The diagnostic value of the osmotically stimulated copeptin level was confirmed, with a threshold of 4.9 pmol/L showing a diagnostic accuracy of 97% for the diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus (Table 2). The diagnostic accuracy was only slightly lower with 95% when comparing partial central diabetes insipidus with primary polydipsia. In addition, the test proved to be safe and well tolerated, with a majority of patients preferring it over the standard water deprivation test.

3.3 Direct AVP measurements

Consequently, a recent evaluation of 156 patients with polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome 46 pointed out the problems with this diagnostic test, by reaching a diagnostic accuracy (the percentage of correctly diagnosed patients) of only 77% (sensitivity 86%, specificity 70%).

Already in 1981, Zerbe et al 51 described a different approach including measurement of plasma AVP upon osmotic stimulation into the diagnostic evaluation (thus called the direct measurement method). In their work, AVP levels were evaluated in relation to the area of normality describing the physiological relationship between AVP release and plasma osmolality. Plasma AVP levels above the area of normality were defined as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, levels below as central diabetes insipidus and levels in the normal range were defined as primary polydipsia. 43, 51 Although the study showed that direct measurement of plasma AVP substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy, it failed to be adopted in clinical practice mainly due to the above‐mentioned inherent assay problems. 2, 52

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is one of the common disorders affecting sodium and water homeostasis, and results when ADH is either inadequately produced, or unable to negotiate its actions on the renal collecting tubules through aquaporins. The diagnostic algorithm starts with exclusion of other causes of polyuria and establishing low urine osmolality in the presence of high serum osmolality. In this paper, we have reviewed the diagnosis, etiology and management of DI in children, with special emphasis on recent advances in the field.

### Approach to the patient with suspected hypotonic polyuria [^bebc64b7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

It is common for endocrinologists to receive referred patients who have polyuria and polydipsia that need investigation. When initial investigations reveal the urine to be hypotonic, differentiating between the 3 main causes is essential, as the management differs for each. Over the past 2 years, due to concerns about patient safety and in response to patient feedback, the causes of hypotonic polyuria have been renamed as arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, formerly central diabetes insipidus), arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R, formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), while the name of the third cause is retained as primary polydipsia (PP), in which excess fluid intake suppresses AVP secretion. In a survey of more than one thousand patients with AVP-D, the large majority had experienced confusion of their condition by health care workers with diabetes mellitus, resulting in delays in availability of desmopressin and unnecessary capillary glucose monitoring when hospitalized, and 85% favored changing the name. The new nomenclature more accurately reflects pathophysiology and clearly identifies the patients' condition as different from diabetes mellitus, and now has been adopted by the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) taxonomy hierarchy codes for electronic patient records. In parallel, the last several years have seen improvements in the diagnostic tools used for the investigation of hypotonic polyuria, with a particular emphasis on the use of measurement of plasma copeptin. This Approach to the Patient review presents the use of this copeptin-based approach in 3 specific cases, and places each in the context of the revised nomenclature. We then describe the overall approach to the patient presenting with hypotonic polyuria, itemize the causes, and discuss when and how testing should be performed (Fig. 1), highlighting specific areas that frequently cause diagnostic and management difficulties.

### Approach to the pediatric patient: central diabetes insipidus [^e21ccd91]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a complex disorder in which large volumes of dilute urine are excreted due to arginine-vasopressin deficiency, and it is caused by a variety of disorders affecting the hypothalamic-posterior pituitary network. The differential diagnosis is challenging and requires a detailed medical history, physical examination, biochemical approach, imaging studies, and, in some cases, histological confirmation. Magnetic resonance imaging is the gold standard method for evaluating congenital or acquired cerebral and pituitary stalk lesions. Pituitary stalk size at presentation could be normal, but it may change over time, depending on the underlying condition, while other brain areas or organs may become involved during follow-up. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to avoid central nervous system damage and germ cell tumor dissemination and to minimize complications of multiple pituitary hormone defects. We provide a practical update on the diagnosis and management of patients with CDI and highlight several pitfalls that may complicate the differential diagnosis of conditions presenting with polyuria and polydipsia. The need for a careful and close follow-up of patients with apparently idiopathic CDI is particularly emphasized because the underlying condition may be recognized over time. The clinical scenario that we outline at the beginning of this article represents the basis for the discussion about how the etiological diagnosis of CDI can be overlooked and demonstrates how a water intake and urine output improvement can be a sign of progressive damage of both hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland with associated pituitary hormonal deficiencies.

3.2 Indirect water deprivation test

For decades, the standard diagnostic test for the evaluation of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome was the indirect water deprivation test. 40 Hereby, patients are required to stop any fluid intake from midnight onwards. During the water deprivation period, urinary excretion and urine osmolality as well as plasma sodium and osmolality are measured regularly. Fluid deprivation is continued for a maximum of 17 hours or until a plasma sodium concentration ≥ 150 mmol/L has been reached or until the patient has lost 3%‐5% of his initial body weight. At this time point, exogenous AVP is administered and the corresponding change in urine osmolality is analysed. Thus, insufficient AVP secretion or effect is indirectly diagnosed by urine osmolality, giving the test the name indirect measurement method. Interpretation of the test results is based on recommendations from Miller et al 40 according to the results of 29 patients with central diabetes insipidus (of whom 11 with a partial form), 2 patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and 5 patients with primary polydipsia. Patients showing a urinary osmolality below 300 mosm/kg during the water deprivation test are classified as complete central diabetes insipidus if the urinary osmolality increased > 50% after exogenous AVP injection. Patients staying below this cut‐off are diagnosed with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Patients with partial central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia are expected to have a urinary osmolality between 300 and 800 mosm/kg upon thirsting. An increase in the urinary osmolality of > 9% after AVP administration further differentiates patients with partial central diabetes insipidus from patients with primary polydipsia. However, the proposed cut‐off levels were post hoc derived on a small patient cohort, showed a wide overlap in urinary osmolalities and were never prospectively validated. 40

### International expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (arginine vasopressin resistance) [^b30732ec]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI; also known as arginine vasopressin resistance) is a rare inherited disorder of water homeostasis, caused by insensitivity of the distal nephron to arginine vasopressin. Consequently, the kidney loses its ability to concentrate urine, which leads to polyuria, polydipsia and the risk of hypertonic dehydration. The diagnosis and management of NDI are very challenging and require an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. Here, we present 36 recommendations for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up in both children and adults, as well as emergency management, genetic counselling and family planning, for patients with NDI. These recommendations were formulated and graded by an international group of experts in NDI from paediatric and adult nephrology, urology and clinical genetics from the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network and the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology, as well as patient advocates, and were validated by a voting panel in a Delphi process. The goal of these recommendations is to provide guidance to health care professionals who care for patients with NDI and to patients and their families. In addition, we emphasize the need for further research on different aspects of this potentially life-threatening disorder to support the development of evidence-based guidelines in the future.

### A copeptin-based approach in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus [^0197102c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

The indirect water-deprivation test is the current reference standard for the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. However, it is technically cumbersome to administer, and the results are often inaccurate. The current study compared the indirect water-deprivation test with direct detection of plasma copeptin, a precursor-derived surrogate of arginine vasopressin.

Methods

From 2013 to 2017, we recruited 156 patients with hypotonic polyuria at 11 medical centers to undergo both water-deprivation and hypertonic saline infusion tests. In the latter test, plasma copeptin was measured when the plasma sodium level had increased to at least 150 mmol per liter after infusion of hypertonic saline. The primary outcome was the overall diagnostic accuracy of each test as compared with the final reference diagnosis, which was determined on the basis of medical history, test results, and treatment response, with copeptin levels masked.

Results

A total of 144 patients underwent both tests. The final diagnosis was primary polydipsia in 82 patients (57%), central diabetes insipidus in 59 (41%), and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in 3 (2%). Overall, among the 141 patients included in the analysis, the indirect water-deprivation test determined the correct diagnosis in 108 patients (diagnostic accuracy, 76.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 68.9 to 83.2), and the hypertonic saline infusion test (with a copeptin cutoff level of > 4.9 pmol per liter) determined the correct diagnosis in 136 patients (96.5%; 95% CI, 92.1 to 98.6; P < 0.001). The indirect water-deprivation test correctly distinguished primary polydipsia from partial central diabetes insipidus in 77 of 105 patients (73.3%; 95% CI, 63.9 to 81.2), and the hypertonic saline infusion test distinguished between the two conditions in 99 of 104 patients (95.2%; 95% CI, 89.4 to 98.1; adjusted P < 0.001). One serious adverse event (desmopressin-induced hyponatremia that resulted in hospitalization) occurred during the water-deprivation test.

Conclusions

The direct measurement of hypertonic saline-stimulated plasma copeptin had greater diagnostic accuracy than the water-deprivation test in patients with hypotonic polyuria. (Funded by the Swiss National Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01940614 .).

3.4 Direct copeptin measurements

With the development of the copeptin assay, 9, 13, 53 interest in the direct measurement arose again. In a first study, Fenske et al aimed to increase the diagnostic accuracy of the water deprivation test by combining it with copeptin measurements. 50 In their cohort of 50 patients with polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome, baseline plasma copeptin levels > 20 pmol/L diagnosed patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, while levels < 2.6 pmol/L after an overnight water deprivation test indicated central diabetes insipidus. A ratio of the Δplasma copeptin levels (before and after the water deprivation phase) to the plasma sodium level at the end of the test showed a high diagnostic accuracy of 94% in differentiating patients with central diabetes insipidus from patients with primary polydipsia. 50

In an evaluation of 55 patients with nephrogenic or central diabetes insipidus or primary polydipsia, Timper et al 54 described copeptin further as a promising new tool for the diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome. This study confirmed in a larger patient number that patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be easily diagnosed by using a single baseline copeptin level of > 21.4 pmol/L without prior thirsting. Baseline copeptin values in the other entities (ie, central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia) however largely overlapped. Further, the study showed that osmotically stimulated copeptin levels of > 4.9 pmol/L differentiated patients with central diabetes insipidus from patients with primary polydipsia with a high diagnostic accuracy of 96%. Osmotic stimulation was reached by water deprivation and if needed by additional 3% saline infusion aiming at an increase in plasma sodium levels above 147 mmol/L. The evaluation of osmotically stimulated AVP instead of copeptin measurement showed a lower overall diagnostic accuracy of only 80%, and the accuracy was especially low for differentiation between partial central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia (44%).

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^00a97e15]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Back to Patient Presentation

Although the water deprivation test initially indicated partial diabetes insipidus, the further course of the disease under desmopressin treatment was suspicious for primary polydipsia. Therefore, our patient underwent the hypertonic saline infusion test for further evaluation. During osmotic stimulation to a plasma sodium level of 150 mmol/L, his copeptin level rose to 16 pmol/L. Accordingly, the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was revised to primary polydipsia and the patient referred to our colleagues from the psychosomatic department. With their help, the patient was able to slowly decrease his daily fluid intake to 3 L per day. During the last follow-up, the sodium levels remained stable and the patient reported wellbeing. Occasionally, he felt an increased sense of thirst, but he learned to deal with it.

This case illustrates that clinical signs and symptoms, such as severe polyuria–polydipsia with a high daily fluid intake or nocturia that are sometimes described as characteristic of diabetes insipidus, are unspecific. Similarly, the magnetic resonance imaging finding "absence of posterior pituitary bright spot" is not specific for central diabetes insipidus as the bright spot is also invisible in up to 40% of primary polydipsia patients (compared to 70% of patients with central diabetes insipidus).

Several observations during the water deprivation test wrongly led to the diagnosis of partial diabetes insipidus: high amount of polyuria and loss of body weight, moderate increase of urine osmolality during test period and good urine osmolality response to desmopressin. At this point it must be mentioned that the diagnostic criteria of the water deprivation test were based on data from only 36 patients and, unsurprisingly, the overall diagnostic accuracy of this test is very poor (diagnostic accuracy 70%). Moreover, to reliably interpret AVP action or urine concentration capacity, a hypernatremic state has to be reached. This is often not the case during the water deprivation test, as exemplified by our case. With the hypertonic saline test, a hypernatremic state is ensured and the measurement of stimulated copeptin values increases the diagnostic accuracy of the test to 97%.

Consider administering further doses of desmopressin when production of higher volumes of dilute (100 mosmol/kg) urine returns to avoid the development of overly rapid correction of hypernatremia through the combination of high fluid loads together with the obligate antidiuresis of exogenous desmopressin.

### Diagnosis and management of central diabetes insipidus in adults [^840eee58]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a clinical syndrome which results from loss or impaired function of vasopressinergic neurons in the hypothalamus/posterior pituitary, resulting in impaired synthesis and/or secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP deficiency leads to the inability to concentrate urine and excessive renal water losses, resulting in a clinical syndrome of hypotonic polyuria with compensatory thirst. CDI is caused by diverse etiologies, although it typically develops due to neoplastic, traumatic, or autoimmune destruction of AVP-synthesizing/secreting neurons. This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of CDI, providing insights into the physiological disturbances underpinning the syndrome. Recent developments in diagnostic techniques, particularly the development of the copeptin assay, have improved accuracy and acceptability of the diagnostic approach to the hypotonic polyuria syndrome. We discuss the management of CDI with particular emphasis on management of fluid intake and pharmacological replacement of AVP. Specific clinical syndromes such as adipsic diabetes insipidus and diabetes insipidus in pregnancy as well as management of the perioperative patient with diabetes insipidus are also discussed.

We report the unique coincidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. A 46-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes complained of polyuria with a daily output of 5 L. Although urinalysis demonstrated significant glucosuria, diabetes insipidus was suspected owing to a low urine specific gravity (1.008). The low specific gravity persisted during a water deprivation test. Ultimately, diabetes insipidus was confirmed when urine specific gravity and urine osmolality normalized following desmopressin administration. This case emphasizes the importance of accurately interpreting the urine specific gravity in patients with polyuria and diabetes mellitus to detect diabetes insipidus.

Central diabetes insipidus — initial laboratory evaluation in polyuria: We recommend simultaneously measuring serum and urine osmolality in patients with polyuria defined as more than 50 mL/kg of body weight/24 hours (3.5 L/d in a 70-kg person), and in the presence of high serum osmolality (≥ 295 mOsmol/L) urine osmolality should reach approximately 600 mOsmol/L with a urine osmolality/plasma osmolality ratio ≥ 2, while the urine dipstick should be negative for glucose.

Copeptin as a Predictive Marker for Central Diabetes Insipidus

In addition to diagnosing diabetes insipidus in the outpatient clinic, copeptin measurement has also been proposed in the evaluation of postoperative central diabetes insipidus. While 1 study showed a high diagnostic accuracy of 100% for insulin-induced hypoglycemia-stimulated copeptin with a cut-off value of 4.75 pmol/L to detect central diabetes insipidus 3 months after pituitary surgery, the risks of this test outweigh its potential value. Other studies used surgery itself as a stress test. In a study including 205 patients of which 49 had a postoperative diabetes insipidus, a copeptin level < 2.5 pmol/L measured on the first postoperative day had a positive predictive level of 81% and specificity of 97%. Meanwhile, a copeptin level > 30 pmol/L had a negative predictive value of 95% and sensitivity of 94%. A second study examined the use of copeptin levels 1 hour after extubation after pituitary surgery. While a cut-off value below 4.2 pmol/L indicated permanent central diabetes insipidus, a value above 12.8 pmol/L was predictive of an unremarkable postoperative course. Since only 8 of the included 66 patients had central diabetes insipidus, however, these results should be confirmed in a larger cohort.

In conclusion, copeptin-based tests are valuable diagnostic measures in the difficult distinction between diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia.

### An observation of hydrochlorothiazide in diabetes insipidus… [^64475e09]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In studying a single case of the idiopathic variety of diabetes insipidus, it was found that hydrochlorothiazide, after a short latent period, brought about a marked reduction in urinary output. The patient, a 45-year-old woman, had been treated for diabetes insipidus for more than 6 years, but the antidiuretic action of injected vasopressin tannate had become unpredictable and its local side effects were the cause of concern. Orally administered hydrochlorothiazide reduced her mean daily urinary volume to 5, 520 cc. Electrolyteloading tests indicated that electrolyte alterations were not responsible for this action. After several months of treatment, a reduced dosage continued to be effective. Calesnick B, Brenner SA. An Observation of Hydrochlorothiazide in Diabetes Insipidus. JAMA. 1961; 176: 1088–1091.

### The diagnosis of children with central diabetes insipidus [^8f31dbd8]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Central diabetes insipidus is the end result of a number of different diseases that affect the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal system. In many patients, especially children and young adults, it is caused by the destruction or degeneration of neurons that originate in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. The known causes of these lesions include germinoma or craniopharyngioma; Langerhans cell histiocytosis; local inflammatory, autoimmune or vascular diseases; trauma resulting from surgery or an accident; sarcoidosis; metastases; and midline cerebral and cranial malformations. In rare cases, genetic defects in AVP synthesis that are inherited as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive traits are the underlying cause. Accurate diagnostic differentiation is essential for both safe and effective disease management. Proper etiological diagnosis can be achieved via a series of steps that start with clinical observations and then progress, as needed, to more sophisticated methods. Indeed, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the examination method of choice for evaluating hypothalamic-pituitary-related endocrine diseases due to its ability to provide strongly-contrasted high-resolution multi-planar and spatial images. Specifically, MRI allows a detailed and precise anatomical study of the pituitary gland by differentiating between the anterior and posterior pituitary lobes. MRI identification of pituitary hyperintensity in the posterior part of the sella, now considered to be a clear marker of neurohypophyseal functional integrity, together with careful analysis of pituitary stalk shape and size, have provided the most striking recent findings contributing to the diagnosis and understanding of some forms of 'idiopathic' central diabetes insipidus.

### The management of diabetes insipidus in adults… [^c03ceba0]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

The management of patients with diabetes insipidus can be confusing because of the disorder's variable pathophysiology, the numerous medications used, and the possible complications related to their use. Nevertheless, the primary care physician, rather than the subspecialist, will increasingly be called on to manage patients with such relatively uncommon conditions in the future. If a few basic facts and principles are kept in mind, the care of most patients with diabetes insipidus can be successful. A comprehensive, practical review of the short- and long-term therapy for patients with diabetes insipidus, including central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and the "excessive vasopressinase syndrome, " is presented. The use of single and multidrug regimens, and of the newly marketed oral formulation of desmopressin acetate, is described for common clinical settings.

### Neuroimaging of central diabetes insipidus-when, how and findings [^075a839f]. Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Central or neurogenic diabetes insipidus (CDI) is due to deficient synthesis or secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin peptide (AVP). It is clinically characterised by polydipsia and polyuria (urine output > 30 mL/kg/day) of dilute urine (< 250 mOsm/L). It is the result of a defect in one of more sites involving the hypothalamic osmoreceptors, supraoptic or paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, median eminence of the hypothalamus, infundibulum or the posterior pituitary gland. A focused MRI pituitary gland or sella protocol is essential. There are several neuroimaging correlates and causes of CDI, illustrated in this review. The most common causes are benign or malignant neoplasms of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (25%), surgery (20%), head trauma (16%) or familial causes (10%). No cause is identified in up to 30% of cases. Knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal axis is crucial when evaluating a patient with CDI. Establishing the aetiology of CDI with MRI in combination with clinical and biochemical assessment facilitates appropriate targeted treatment. The aim of the pictorial review is to illustrate the wide variety of causes of CDI on neuroimaging, highlight the optimal MRI protocol and to revise the detailed neuroanatomy and neurophysiology required to interpret these studies.

### Diabetes insipidus in children… [^1c3b1f65]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Diabetes insipidus is a symptom which may be due to a variety of causes. Its diagnosis and treatment, unsatisfactory as the latter may be, present no difficulty, but the detection of the underlying cause often requires considerable study and may at times be impossible. When this underlying cause is not ascertainable a diagnosis of idiopathic diabetes insipidus may be made. In many instances this classification will be correct, since neither the further course nor the necropsy will reveal an anatomic cause for the polydipsia and polyuria. In other cases the basic process will be recognized only after the symptoms have progressed for months or years. The observation of a few cases of polyuria and polydipsia and the attempt to formulate their prognoses induced us to study the literature of diabetes insipidus in children. This survey demonstrated that definite progress has recently been made in the understanding of some of the. WARKANY J, MITCHELL AG.

### Vasopressin-dependent disorders: what is new in children? [^4e5785b0]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP)-mediated osmoregulatory disorders, such as diabetes insipidus (DI) and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) are common in the differential diagnosis for children with hypo- and hypernatremia and require timely recognition and treatment. DI is caused by a failure to concentrate urine secondary to impaired production of or response to AVP, resulting in hypernatremia. Newer methods of diagnosing DI include measuring copeptin levels; copeptin is AVP's chaperone protein and serves as a surrogate biomarker of AVP secretion. Intraoperative copeptin levels may also help predict the risk for developing DI after neurosurgical procedures. Copeptin levels hold diagnostic promise in other pediatric conditions, too. Recently, expanded genotype and phenotype correlations in inherited DI disorders have been described and may better predict the clinical course in affected children and infants. Similarly, newer formulations of synthetic AVP may improve pediatric DI treatment. In contrast to DI, SIADH, characterized by inappropriate AVP secretion, commonly leads to severe hyponatremia. Contemporary methods aid clinicians in distinguishing SIADH from other hyponatremic conditions, particularly cerebral salt wasting. Further research on the efficacy of therapies for pediatric SIADH is needed, although some adult treatments hold promise for pediatrics. Lastly, expansion of home point-of-care sodium testing may transform management of SIADH and DI in children. In this article, we review recent developments in the understanding of pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment of better outcomes and quality of life for children with these challenging disorders.

### Water deprivation test in children with polyuria [^0b2db07c]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Polyuria is an uncommon clinical presentation in paediatric practice. When diabetes mellitus has been excluded by history taking and preliminary investigations and impaired renal concentrating ability is confirmed, water deprivation test (WDT) is necessary to differentiate among central diabetes insipidus (CDI), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, or primary polydipsia. Traditionally, responsiveness to desmopressin injection is defined as urine osmolality > 750 mOsm/kg. However, that level could not be reached in the review of our patients. We discuss how to arrive at the diagnosis of CDI in WDT. An approach to polyuria and WDT will also be discussed.

Hypertonic saline infusion lead to a correct diagnosis in 97% (95% CI: 92, 99) of the patients using the copeptin cut‐off level of > 4.9 pmol/L (Figure 3), which was clearly superior to the diagnostic accuracy of the indirect water deprivation test of 77% (95%CI: 69, 83; P < 0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of hypertonic saline‐stimulated copeptin was similarly accurate in distinguishing patients with partial diabetes insipidus from patients with primary polydipsia with a correct diagnosis in 95%, compared to 73% with the water deprivation test.

### Central diabetes insipidus: clinical characteristics and long-term course in a large cohort of adults [^325180b0]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a rare heterogeneous condition with various underlying causes. This study sought to increase the still-limited data on the clinical characteristics and long-term course in adults diagnosed with CDI.

Methods

Data on demographics, presentation, imaging findings, affected pituitary axes, treatment, and complications were collected retrospectively from the files of 70 adult patients with CDI followed at a referral endocrine clinic.

Results

Forty women and 30 men were included. Mean age was 46.8 ± 15 years at the time of this study and 29.3 ± 20 years at CDI diagnosis. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed in childhood. Forty patients (57%) acquired CDI following surgery. Main sellar pathologies were: craniopharyngioma, 17 patients (11 diagnosed in childhood); Langerhans histiocytosis, 10 patients (5 diagnosed in childhood); 7 patients (all diagnosed as adults) had a growth hormone-secreting adenoma; 12 patients (17%; 6 diagnosed in childhood) had idiopathic CDI. At least one anterior pituitary axis was affected in 73% of the cohort: 59% had growth hormone deficiency, 56% hypogonadism, 55% central hypothyroidism, 44% adrenocorticotropic hormone-cortisol deficiency. Patients with postoperative/trauma CDI (n = 44) tended to have multiple anterior pituitary axes deficits compared to the nonsurgical group of patients. All patients were treated with vasopressin preparations, mostly nasal spray. Hyponatremia developed in 32 patients, more in women, and was severe (< 125 mEq/L) in 10 patients. Hypernatremia (> 150 mEq/L) was noticed in 5 patients. Overall, the calculated complication rate was 22 in 1,250 treatment-years.

Conclusion

Most adult patients with CDI have anterior pituitary dysfunction. Stability is usually achieved with long-term treatment. Women were more susceptible to desmopressin complications, albeit with an overall relatively low complication rate.

### Copeptin in the diagnosis of vasopressin-dependent disorders of fluid homeostasis [^b3a1b50c]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Copeptin and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are derived from a common precursor molecule and have equimolar secretion and response to osmotic, haemodynamic and stress-related stimuli. Plasma concentrations of copeptin and AVP in relation to serum osmolality are highly correlated. The physiological functions of AVP with respect to homeostasis of fluid balance, vascular tonus and regulation of the endocrine stress response are well known, but the exact function of copeptin is undetermined. Quantification of AVP can be difficult, but copeptin is stable in plasma and can be easily measured with a sandwich immunoassay. For this reason, copeptin has emerged as a promising marker for the diagnosis of AVP-dependent fluid disorders. Copeptin measurements can enable differentiation between various conditions within the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome. In the absence of prior fluid deprivation, baseline copeptin levels > 20 pmol/l identify patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Conversely, copeptin levels measured upon osmotic stimulation differentiate primary polydipsia from partial central diabetes insipidus. In patients with hyponatraemia, low levels of copeptin together with low urine osmolality identify patients with primary polydipsia, and the ratio of copeptin to urinary sodium can distinguish the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion from other AVP-dependent forms of hyponatraemia.

### Use of copeptin in interpretation of the water deprivation test [^1f740d3a]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Currently, the water deprivation test remains the standard method for distinguishing primary polydipsia (PP) from cranial diabetes insipidus (cDI) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (nDI). There is increasing interest in a direct estimate of antidiuretic hormone using plasma copeptin as a stable and reliable surrogate marker. We present our experience of measuring copeptin during the water deprivation test.

Methods

Forty-seven people (17 men) underwent a standard water deprivation test between 2013 and 2021. Plasma copeptin was measured at the start of the test and at the end of the period of water deprivation (maximum osmotic stimulation). Results were classified using prespecified diagnostic criteria. As it is known that a significant proportion of tests will reveal indeterminate results, a final diagnosis was obtained by including relevant pre- and post-test clinical criteria. This diagnosis was then used to plan individual treatment.

Results

Basal and stimulated copeptin were significantly higher in the nephrogenic DI group than other categories (p < .001). There was no significant difference in basal or stimulated copeptin between PP, cDI or partial DI. Nine results were indeterminate where the serum and urine osmolality did not give a unified diagnosis. Stimulated copeptin was helpful in reclassifying these patients into the final diagnostic groups.

Conclusion

Plasma copeptin has additional clinical utility in interpretation of the water deprivation test and may continue to have a place alongside newer stimulation tests.

### Differences between immunotherapy-induced and primary hypophysitis-a multicenter retrospective study [^7819962c]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause various immune-related adverse events including secondary hypophysitis. We compared clinical characteristics of immunotherapy-induced hypophysitis (IIH) and primary hypophysitis (PH) DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter cohort study including 56 patients with IIH and 60 patients with PH.

Methods

All patients underwent extensive endocrine testing. Data on age, gender, symptoms, endocrine dysfunction, MRI, immunotherapeutic agents and autoimmune diseases were collected.

Results

Median time of follow-up was 18 months in IIH and 69 months in PH. The median time from initiation of immunotherapy to IIH diagnosis was 3 months. IIH affected males more frequently than PH (p < 0.001) and led to more impaired pituitary axes in males (p < 0.001). The distribution of deficient adenohypophysial axes was comparable between both entities, however, central hypocortisolism was more frequent (p < 0.001) and diabetes insipidus considerably less frequent in IIH (p < 0.001). Symptoms were similar except that visual impairment occurred more rarely in IIH (p < 0.001). 20% of IIH patients reported no symptoms at all. Regarding MRI, pituitary stalk thickening was less frequent in IIH (p = 0.009). Concomitant autoimmune diseases were more prevalent in PH patients before the diagnosis of hypophysitis (p = 0.003) and more frequent in IIH during follow-up (p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Clinically, IIH and PH present with similar symptoms. Diabetes insipidus very rarely occurs in IIH. Central hypocortisolism, in contrast, is a typical feature of IIH. Preexisting autoimmunity seems not to be indicative of developing IIH.

### Approach to the patient: "Utility of the copeptin assay" [^3d9f3a59]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, copeptin is secreted in equimolar amounts to AVP and reliably mirrors AVP concentrations in the circulation. Its measurement has several advantages over AVP since it is stable ex vivo, can easily be measured, and results are available within a few hours. The 2 assays with sufficient technical description and clinical data justifying their routine clinical use are the sandwich LIA and its automated immunofluorescent successor on the KRYPTOR platform.

The main and best-validated indication for copeptin measurement is in the differential diagnosis of polyuria–polydipsia syndrome. Here, baseline levels > 21 pmol/L identify patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and osmotically stimulated levels with hypertonic saline (cut-off 4.9 pmol/L) or nonosmotically stimulated levels with arginine (cut-off 3.8 pmol/L) differentiate between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia with a high diagnostic accuracy.

In hyponatremia, the diagnostic utility of copeptin is of minor relevance and may be limited to fast and reliable identification of patients with underlying primary polydipsia. No differentiation between SIAD and other etiologies of hyponatremia seems possible, nor can copeptin reliably differentiate between cancer-related SIAD and other etiologies.

In hypernatremia, copeptin measurements below 4.4 pmol/L are diagnostic for central diabetes insipidus and allow identifying patients in need of desmopressin treatment.

Of note, in clinical settings where copeptin assays are unavailable or not available on the same day, close clinical supervision and judgment of routinely measured plasma and urine parameters are still the mainstay of differential diagnosis of disturbances in water homeostasis. Copeptin has also emerged as an unspecific marker of stress, predicting outcome in patients with sepsis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or pneumonia, among others. In patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, copeptin seems to be a predictive marker for the development of diabetic kidney disease. In addition, in ADPKD, it is suggested that copeptin predicts disease progression and treatment response to vaptans. Whether measurement of copeptin in these diseases has real clinical implications remains to be shown in future studies.

### Adipsic diabetes insipidus: a review [^ee5eaaf1]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is a rare disorder consisting of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and a deficient or absent thirst response to hyperosmolality. Patients with ADI experience marked morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis and management of these patients is quite challenging, even in expert hands. In this review, we aim to provide an updated overview of this difficult clinical scenario.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed search for articles related to ADI. The search terms "adipsia", "adipsic", "thirst", and "diabetes insipidus" were used to identify relevant literature.

Results

ADI has been described in only approximately 100 patients. This rarity has limited the quality and quantity of literature to case reports, case series, and expert opinion. Diagnosis focuses on confirmation of CDI followed by documenting subnormal or completely absent thirst in response to a hypertonic stimulus. Among the described patients with ADI, the majority experience morbidity (e.g., severe hypernatremia, sleep apnea, venous thromboembolism [VTE], and obesity) and an increased mortality risk. Management focuses on frequent reassessment of daily prescribed water intake with fixed antidiuretic therapy (desmopressin) and comorbidity screening.

Conclusion

The complexity of patients with ADI provides a difficult challenge for clinicians. Prompt recognition of thirst disorders in patients with CDI should lead to appropriately regimented management strategies and can result in safe outpatient care for these unique patients.

### Diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism as a first presentation of silent adenocarcinoma of lung: a case report and literature review [^eb1c8472]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Metastasis to pituitary gland is a rare situation in clinical practice with a poor prognosis. The prevalence of metastatic pituitary tumors was approximately 1% among all pituitary tumor resections and 1 to 3.6% among post-mortem studies. Most of them were asymptomatic and were typically detected incidentally on imaging or at autopsy. One series found that only 7% of patients with pituitary metastases were symptomatic. Symptomatic pituitary metastasis as the first presentation of primary tumor is uncommon.

Pituitary metastasis is often associated with the presence of multiple additional metastatic sites, especially in bones. Isolated pituitary metastasis is rare, and its clinical presentations, pituitary hormonal profiles, and radiological imaging features mimic those of the more common primary pituitary tumors. These characteristics may lead to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment, especially in individuals without a known pre-existing malignancy. Here, we report a rare case of isolated pituitary metastasis from adenocarcinoma of the lung first presenting as central diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism without known evidence of the primary malignancy. A literature review was performed. A search of the literature was performed on the PubMed and Ovid Medline databases. The initial search string used was "Pituitary AND Metastas". References cited in the articles identified by our original search were also assessed for relevance. Most of the papers identified were case studies and case series; those in languages other than English were excluded.

1 INTRODUCTION

For many years, the water deprivation test has been the standard method for differentiating between the causes of the polyuria/ polydipsia syndrome. The test will distinguish between diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of primary polydipsia (PP). With cranial diabetes insipidus (cDI), there is a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin (AVP) following damage to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary, resulting in an inability to retain water and concentrate urine. With PP, there is an urge to drink excessively that results in high urine output. It is recognized that there may be partial deficiency of ADH — partial cranial diabetes insipidus (pDI) resulting in abnormal but not total inability to concentrate urine. There are a smaller group of people who develop resistance to the action of antidiuretic hormone at the level of the kidney (nephrogenic DI). It is important to distinguish between PP and cDI as the management of the two conditions is significantly different. The major difference between the two conditions is the ability to release ADH in response to osmotic stimulation but the assay is time‐consuming. In the absence of a significant increase in serum osmolality, measured concentrations are often very low. The water deprivation test involves a medically supervised period of water restriction where the individual's weight, urine output, serum and urine osmolalities are measured. For a significant proportion of people, the test will be equivocal with some concentration of the urine but not achieving the established cut‐off for normality. This may be because there is partial impairment of ADH production or because large volumes of dilute urine associated with polydipsia will degrade the ability of kidney to produce concentrated urine by reducing the renal medullary concentration gradient. Although the test is widely used, it has significant drawbacks and is an indirect way of diagnosing ADH deficiency.

### Diagnostic accuracy of copeptin in the differential diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome: a prospective multicenter study [^5fa70f9f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

The polyuria-polydipsia syndrome comprises primary polydipsia (PP) and central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI). Correctly discriminating these entities is mandatory, given that inadequate treatment causes serious complications. The diagnostic "gold standard" is the water deprivation test with assessment of arginine vasopressin (AVP) activity. However, test interpretation and AVP measurement are challenging.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the accuracy of copeptin, a stable peptide stoichiometrically cosecreted with AVP, in the differential diagnosis of polyuria-polydipsia syndrome.

Design, Setting, and Patients

This was a prospective multicenter observational cohort study from four Swiss or German tertiary referral centers of adults > 18 years old with the history of polyuria and polydipsia.

Measurements

A standardized combined water deprivation/3% saline infusion test was performed and terminated when serum sodium exceeded 147 mmol/L. Circulating copeptin and AVP levels were measured regularly throughout the test. Final diagnosis was based on the water deprivation/saline infusion test results, clinical information, and the treatment response.

Results

Fifty-five patients were enrolled (11 with complete central DI, 16 with partial central DI, 18 with PP, and 10 with nephrogenic DI). Without prior thirsting, a single baseline copeptin level > 21.4 pmol/L differentiated nephrogenic DI from other etiologies with a 100% sensitivity and specificity, rendering a water deprivation testing unnecessary in such cases. A stimulated copeptin > 4.9 pmol/L (at sodium levels > 147 mmol/L) differentiated between patients with PP and patients with partial central DI with a 94.0% specificity and a 94.4% sensitivity. A stimulated AVP > 1.8 pg/mL differentiated between the same categories with a 93.0% specificity and a 83.0% sensitivity.

Limitation

This study was limited by incorporation bias from including AVP levels as a diagnostic criterion.

Conclusion

Copeptin is a promising new tool in the differential diagnosis of the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome, and a valid surrogate marker for AVP. Primary Funding Sources: Swiss National Science Foundation, University of Basel.

### Pituitary society guidance: pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^4249127c]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

Hypopituitarism during COVID-19 — clinicians should remain vigilant given increased background mortality and management trade-offs. Patients with hypopituitarism have increased mortality, particularly from cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. There is a careful balance between preventing adrenal insufficiency and avoiding prolonged glucocorticoid over-replacement with consequent immunosuppression. Diabetes insipidus poses fluid-balance challenges during significant illness, and hypernatremia is linked to increased mortality in intensive care admissions.

### Non-functioning pituitary adenomas: indications for pituitary surgery and post-surgical management [^e1b6acbc]. Pituitary (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetes insipidus

DI occurs in 18–31% of patients after pituitary surgery. Several factors are associated with the increased risk of postoperative DI, including male sex, young age, large pituitary mass, CSF leak, and administration of high perioperative glucocorticoid doses. In most patients, the disease is transient, being caused by the temporary dysfunction of ADH-secreting neurons. It usually occurs 24–48 h postoperatively and resolves when ADH-secreting cells recover their normal function.

Triphasic DI occurs in 3–4% of patients. The first phase is characterized by DI (usually 5–7 days) due to a partial or complete posterior pituitary dysfunction. The second phase is caused by an uncontrolled release of ADH leading to SIADH, which usually lasts 2–14 days. Finally, the last phase occurs if > 80–90% of the ADH-secreting cells have degenerated, which leads to permanent DI.

Postoperative DI should be suspected if polyuria (≥ 3 L per day) and polydipsia occur in combination with low urine osmolality. Serum hyperosmolality and hypernatremia strongly support the diagnosis of DI. In this clinical context, a water deprivation test is not needed. A urine osmolality < 300 mOsm/kg and subsequent positive response to ADH confirms the diagnosis of central DI.

In patients who are able to drink in response to thirst and when sodium levels remain within the normal range, no treatment is needed. In other cases, treatment with desmopressin may be required. In treated patients, urine output and osmolality, as well as serum sodium levels, should be monitored regularly to avoid hyponatremia. Because postoperative DI can be transient, each dose of desmopressin should be administered after the recurrence of polyuria and thirst. This approach allows recognition of restored ADH secretion and transient DI in the early and late postoperative phases.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^315a11be]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, copeptin is a valuable and reliable diagnostic marker in the differential diagnosis of polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome. In a patient with unclear polyuria‐polydipsia syndrome, determination of basal copeptin levels is recommended to exclude nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In patients with high suspicion of complete central diabetes insipidus, an overnight water deprivation test might confirm diagnosis provided urine osmolality remains below 300 mosm/kg and plasma sodium levels increase above 147 mmol/L. In all other patients, copeptin measurement after osmotic stimulation with 3% saline solution aiming at a plasma sodium level above 147 mmol/L is recommended (see diagnostic work flow in Figure 4).

The determination of copeptin on the first postoperative day after pituitary surgery is useful to predict the development of central diabetes insipidus.

### Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: essential insights into the molecular background and potential therapies for treatment [^cc0a2009]. Endocrine Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2), expressed in the kidney collecting ducts, plays a pivotal role in maintaining body water balance. The channel is regulated by the peptide hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which exerts its effects through the type 2 vasopressin receptor (AVPR2). Disrupted function or regulation of AQP2 or the AVPR2 results in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a common clinical condition of renal origin characterized by polydipsia and polyuria. Over several years, major research efforts have advanced our understanding of NDI at the genetic, cellular, molecular, and biological levels. NDI is commonly characterized as hereditary (congenital) NDI, arising from genetic mutations in the AVPR2 or AQP2; or acquired NDI, due to for exmple medical treatment or electrolyte disturbances. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the genetic, cell biological, and pathophysiological causes of NDI, with emphasis on the congenital forms and the acquired forms arising from lithium and other drug therapies, acute and chronic renal failure, and disturbed levels of calcium and potassium. Additionally, we provide an overview of the exciting new treatment strategies that have been recently proposed for alleviating the symptoms of some forms of the disease and for bypassing G protein-coupled receptor signaling.

### Partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus associated with Castleman's disease [^bdecd351]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a syndrome characterized by the chronic excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine. There are four types of DI: central (pituitary) DI, primary polydipsia, gestational DI, and nephrogenic DI. In central DI, the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) level is lower than normal. Diseases of the hypothalamus-pituitary gland axis may cause central DI. Primary polydipsia is due to the suppression of arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion by excessive fluid intake, and gestational DI is caused by a deficiency of plasma AVP, resulting from increased hormone degradation by an enzyme made in the placenta. In contrast, nephrogenic DI results from a failure of the kidneys to concentrate the urine due to an insensitivity of the distal nephron to the antidiuretic hormone, AVP.

Nephrogenic DI can be classified as congenital or acquired. Acquired nephrogenic DI has been described in a number of clinical settings; however, nephrogenic DI secondary to a urinary tract obstruction is a rare clinical problem. This condition was first reported in 1954 by Roussak and Oleesky. Ureteral obstruction may result from stones, a transitional cell carcinoma, or external compression (by tumors, enlarged lymph nodes, or retroperitoneal fibrosis).

In 1956, Castleman et al. described an entity involving localized mediastinal lymph node hyperplasia, resembling a thymoma. Castleman's disease, which is diagnosed as retroperitoneal fibrosis with hydronephrosis, has rarely been reported. Herein, we report the first known case of partial nephrogenic DI with hydronephrosis in a patient with Castleman's disease.

### SGLT2 inhibitor in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient coexisted with central diabetes insipidus following hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^81e48591]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

CDI is characterized by hypotonic polyuria due to impaired vasopressin physiology often accompanied by hypernatremia and hyperosmolality if fluid losses are not adequately replaced. Discriminating CDI from primary polydipsia can be challenging. A water deprivation test remains a valuable tool for differential diagnosis. In this case, polyuria was not initially associated with hypotonic urine (maximum specific urine gravity: 1.018) while the patient was on dapagliflozin. However, two days after discontinuing dapagliflozin, hypotonic polyuria became evident, and a water deprivation test confirmed CDI, showing an increase in urine specific gravity from 1.005 to 1.010 and urine osmolality from 19 to 86 mOsm/kg.

Several intriguing features were observed in this patient. During her second admission, she presented with hypernatremia without thirst, but by her third admission, she developed significant polydipsia (up to 10 L/day). This transient adipsia may have resulted from temporary damage to thirst-regulating neurons and osmoreceptors due to hypovolemia, which resolved over time. Additionally, the osmotic diuresis caused by poorly controlled diabetes and the use of SGLT2 inhibitors likely exacerbated her polydipsia and polyuria. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, contributing to osmotic diuresis. A similar case was reported in a patient with adipsic CDI following traumatic brain injury, where empagliflozin obscured low urine osmolality (a relatively high urine osmolality: 529mOsm/kg) and partially attenuated the antidiuretic effect of desmopressin. Five days after discontinuing empagliflozin, a second desmopressin test exhibited a significant reduction in urine volume. Refardt et al. also demonstrated that empagliflozin increased urinary excretion (total urinary excretion of 579 mL ± 194.8 mL in empagliflozin treatment for 8 h versus 367 mL ± 158.8 mL in the placebo group, p = 0.017.) in healthy volunteers with artificially induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion by administration of desmopressin. These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors can influence urine osmolality and may slightly reduce the efficacy of desmopressin. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued when evaluating urine osmolality to differentiate polyuria.

Pituitary disease management during COVID-19 — diabetes insipidus (DI) guidance emphasizes safety: in patients with DI without concomitant illness the main risk is iatrogenic hyponatremia; if access to regular electrolyte monitoring is difficult it would be prudent to advise patients to withhold a weekly dose of desmopressin to allow for an aquaresis and favor under-dosing during daytime, with an aim to relieve symptoms of polyuria particularly overnight; in those with mild or partial DI, treatment with desmopressin may not be required as long as patients are instructed to drink to thirst and have access to fluids; in hospitalized patients, hypernatremia is more likely to occur, particularly in those with adipsic DI, and regular electrolyte monitoring is required, with requirement for parenteral desmopressin and intravenous fluids in cases of severe illness.

In addition, in specific regions of the brain, specifically in periventricular areas, the blood–brain barrier is adjusted to allow the required compounds in the systemic circulation to enter the central nervous system. In such areas, the blood–brain barrier vessels exhibit fewer tight junctions, resulting in a more permeable barrier. Our patient revealed chronic small vessel infarction in the periventricular region, which may be a potential cause of SARS-CoV-2 possible access to the hypothalamus. However, due to the limitations of our case study, we could not prove the underlying mechanism. The unknown etiologies also cannot be ruled out.

A previously published case report described a 44-year-old female diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and central diabetes insipidus 24 days after COVID-19 symptom onset. The other case reported by the same author was a 28-year-old male who developed diabetes insipidus and myocarditis after COVID-19 recovery. Another case report described polydipsia and polyuria in a critically ill 68-year-old patient with hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He developed central diabetes insipidus about one month after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The brain MRI of these patients showed no abnormal findings. However, Misgar et al. reported evidence of infundibuloneurohypophysitis in the brain MRI of a 60-year-old woman. Eight weeks after the onset of COVID-19, the patient developed central diabetes insipidus. It is also notable that all patients developed diabetes insipidus as a late sequel of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the role of viral infections in this rare presentation of COVID-19 remains to be investigated.

In conclusion, we reported a unique case of diabetes insipidus in a patient following COVID-19 disease. Laboratory findings were compatible with central diabetes insipidus. The patient did not exhibit any known etiology of diabetes insipidus. Central diabetes insipidus may be included in clinical manifestations of the COVID-19, in case of new-onset polyuria and polydipsia following COVID-19 disease. However, further studies are required to investigate the potential association between COVID-19 and central diabetes insipidus and unfold the possible underlying mechanisms.

Child with suspected diabetes insipidus — testing and infant therapy guidance states that a water deprivation test should only be performed under close supervision by a specialist for confirmation of this diagnosis as patients can have cardiovascular collapse if not properly monitored. For infants with DI, first-line management is diet plus thiazide: first line of therapy in neonates and infants with DI is using expressed breast milk or a low solute formula like PM 60/40 and hydrochlorothiazide, as their diet consists mainly of liquids, and hydrochlorothiazide has been proven to be a safe and effective way to treat mild to moderate DI while avoiding the sodium fluctuations often seen with desmopressin treatment in infants.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^cef1d950]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

3.6 Prediction of postoperative diabetes insipidus

Another role of copeptin is its use as a prognostic marker for the development of diabetes insipidus after pituitary surgery. A first proof‐of‐concept study in 2007 used the classical insulin tolerance test and showed that copeptin measured during hypoglycaemia is a useful measure to identify patients with complete central diabetes insipidus at 3 months after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. 56 In this study, copeptin levels of patients with intact posterior pituitary showed a maximal increase to 11.1 ± 4.6 pmol/L, while copeptin levels in patients with central diabetes insipidus remained low upon hypoglycaemia at 3.7 ± 0.7 pmol/L. A hypoglycaemic stimulated copeptin level < 4.75 pmol/L had an optimal diagnostic accuracy to detect central diabetes insipidus of 100%.

Despite its reliable diagnostic performance, the insulin tolerance test is not appropriate in the immediate postoperative recovery phase. Moreover, this test is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease or seizure history. However, surgery — itself known as a stressful event stimulating hypothalamic stress hormone release including AVP, 57 — can be used as a "stress test" to assess functionality of AVP and copeptin secretion. In a prospective multicentre trial including 205 patients undergoing pituitary surgery, 24% of patients developed postoperative central diabetes insipidus. Those patients had significantly lower copeptin levels on the first postoperative day compared to patients without postoperative diabetes insipidus. The post hoc‐derived copeptin cut‐off level of < 2.5 pmol/L had a positive predictive value for the development of central diabetes insipidus of 81% and a specificity of 97%, while a level > 30 pmol/L excluded it with a negative predictive value of 95% and a sensitivity of 94%. Accordingly, copeptin measurement after pituitary surgery is helpful to predict the onset of central diabetes insipidus, allowing earlier targeted therapeutic measures.

Diabetes insipidus (DI) management — Good Practice Statements for desmopressin (DDAVP) state that we suggest individualized therapeutic schedules, and some patients with partial DI may prefer no treatment; to reduce hyponatremia risk, we recommend that clinicians educate all patients about the risk of overdosing and have patients periodically (at least weekly) experience a phase of polyuria when the medication effect has worn off. In postpituitary surgery DI, we suggest that clinicians should make at least one attempt to discontinue DDAVP during the weeks to months after surgery to determine whether posterior pituitary function has recovered. In cases of adipsic DI, we suggest careful DDAVP and fluid intake titration that includes frequent weighing and serum sodium level monitoring. We suggest that all patients with DI wear an emergency bracelet or necklace to inform clinicians of the patient's health problem if incapacitated.
