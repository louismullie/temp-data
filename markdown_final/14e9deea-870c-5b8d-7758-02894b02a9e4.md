## Question

Gray platelets syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Gray Platelet Syndrome (GPS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining GPS and its core phenotype. Then, I should verify the genetic basis and inheritance patterns. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology, including megakaryocyte and immune cell defects. After that, I need to review clinical manifestations and natural history. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic approach, including labs, imaging, and genetics. Finally, I will consider differential diagnosis, management, and special situations like pregnancy and surgery, and close with prognosis and emerging therapies.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classic phenotype. GPS is a rare inherited platelet disorder characterized by macrothrombocytopenia, large agranular platelets that appear gray on smear, and a marked reduction or absence of α-granules with their hemostatic and nonhemostatic cargo; bleeding is typically mucocutaneous and variable in severity, and patients often develop splenomegaly and progressive bone marrow fibrosis over time [^7b8cd665] [^4a6d61e6].

> I need to check the genetic basis next. The predominant cause is biallelic loss-of-function variants in NBEAL2, encoding a BEACH-domain scaffolding protein essential for α-granule biogenesis; this establishes autosomal recessive inheritance in most cases, with compound heterozygosity common in cohorts [^cbadd029] [^9d10058f] [^5c5cc198]. Wait, let me verify exceptions: a dominant-negative GFI1B mutation has been reported to cause an autosomal dominant GPS-like phenotype with α-granule deficiency, so I should not overgeneralize recessive inheritance to every family [^2c20211e]. I should also note that GATA1 variants can cause α-granule deficiency via reduced NBEAL2 expression, linking XLTT to a GPS spectrum in some contexts, though the phenotype and genetics differ from classic GPS [^e783cf69] [^9817212e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without anchoring it to megakaryocyte biology. NBEAL2 localizes to the dense tubular system and is required for α-granule formation and cargo retention; loss of NBEAL2 impairs granule packaging and leads to empty vacuoles and emperipolesis, with abnormal megakaryocyte–extracellular matrix interactions and reduced proplatelet formation, explaining macrothrombocytopenia and fibrosis over time [^9d10058f] [^7b8cd665]. I should double-check interactors: NBEAL2 binds SEC22B and P-selectin, and GPS variants disrupt SEC22B binding, reinforcing a trafficking defect; Dock7 and Vac14 also interact with NBEAL2 and are dysregulated in GPS, contributing to cytoskeletal and signaling abnormalities [^8f57eeeb] [^37df14b1].

> Next, I should review the immune cell defects, because I recall early reports of neutrophil abnormalities. Let me verify: neutrophils in GPS show reduced specific granules and impaired NETosis, yet in vitro bacterial killing and ROS production are often preserved, suggesting a nuanced innate immune phenotype rather than overt immunodeficiency; monocytes and T cells also show transcriptomic and proteomic alterations, and low CTLA-4 expression in activated T cells may underlie autoimmunity in a subset [^2cedbf93] [^551bcedc] [^013a13f7]. But wait, what if infections are frequent? Large cohorts show that while autoimmunity and recurrent infections occur, they are not universal, so I should frame this as a risk phenotype rather than a defining feature [^4a6d61e6].

> I will now examine the clinical manifestations and natural history. Bleeding is typically mild to moderate, with easy bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia, and postprocedural bleeding; severity does not correlate tightly with platelet count, reflecting the qualitative defect [^7b8cd665]. Thrombocytopenia is often progressive, and many patients develop splenomegaly and myelofibrosis over years; high serum vitamin B12 is a consistent biochemical clue, though its pathophysiologic significance remains uncertain [^423dda60] [^7b8cd665]. I should confirm that fatal hemorrhages are reported in a minority, underscoring the need for longitudinal surveillance in severe cases [^423dda60].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach, and I should double-check the sequence. First-line clues include macrothrombocytopenia with large, agranular platelets on smear and a compatible bleeding history; confirmatory testing relies on electron microscopy demonstrating markedly reduced or absent α-granules, and genetic testing with NBEAL2 sequencing is now standard to establish the diagnosis and enable cascade testing in relatives [^7b8cd665] [^d3a19413]. Hold on, I should verify that some centers use immunofluorescence or proteomics to document α-granule protein deficiency when EM is unavailable, but EM remains the gold standard for granule assessment in suspected GPS [^d7eab832] [^d3a19413].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis so I don't anchor prematurely. Other inherited macrothrombocytopenias with α-granule abnormalities include GFI1B-related disease and GATA1-related XLTT, which can mimic GPS but have distinct genetics and additional features; MYH9-related disorders can show giant platelets and neutrophil inclusions but have a different granule pattern; Bernard-Soulier syndrome presents with macrothrombocytopenia and a different functional defect; ARC syndrome due to VPS33B/VIPAS39 mutations causes α-granule deficiency with systemic features; and pseudo–gray platelet phenomena from antibody-mediated in vitro degranulation can confound smear interpretation, so I need to ensure proper anticoagulation and repeat smears in citrate when suspicious [^2c20211e] [^e783cf69] [^041e1660] [^c6f0f3e8] [^6a06df54].

> I need to ensure management recommendations align with evidence and guidelines. For bleeding, local measures and antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid are first-line; platelet transfusion is reserved for active bleeding, invasive procedures, or severe thrombocytopenia with bleeding risk, ideally using HLA-matched units if repeated exposures are anticipated to mitigate alloimmunization [^77d1307a] [^393bc812]. For chronic thrombocytopenia, thrombopoietin receptor agonists such as romiplostim or eltrombopag can be considered case-by-case to raise counts before procedures, though data in GPS are limited and decisions should be individualized; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been pursued in select patients with severe disease or progressive myelofibrosis, with reports of improvement in fibrosis, but risks and donor availability must be weighed carefully [^77d1307a] [^a2d86579]. I should confirm that patients should avoid NSAIDs and coordinate perioperative plans with hematology to minimize bleeding risk [^77d1307a].

> Let me consider special situations, starting with pregnancy and delivery. There are no GPS-specific obstetric guidelines, so I should extrapolate from inherited platelet disorders and obstetric hemorrhage guidance: coordinate prenatal planning, consider prophylactic platelets around delivery if counts are low or there is significant bleeding history, and use tranexamic acid adjunctively; HLA-matched platelets are preferred if repeated transfusions are anticipated, and multidisciplinary planning is essential [^393bc812]. For surgery, I should confirm that most patients with inherited platelet disorders can undergo procedures safely with appropriate hemostatic support, with platelet transfusion thresholds individualized to bleeding phenotype, procedure risk, and count trajectory [^f1a6cc9f].

> I should double-check prognosis and emerging directions. GPS is a chronic disorder with variable bleeding severity and a risk of progressive thrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis; autoimmune manifestations and immune dysregulation occur in a substantial subset, warranting vigilance for autoimmunity and infections [^4a6d61e6] [^551bcedc]. Gene therapy remains investigational, but advances in lentiviral and CRISPR-based approaches for inherited platelet disorders suggest future curative strategies; in the meantime, early genetic diagnosis enables counseling, prenatal testing, and targeted surveillance for complications [^77d1307a] [^bb090fe8].

> In summary, GPS is best understood as a disorder of α-granule biogenesis due to NBEAL2 deficiency, with macrothrombocytopenia, bleeding, splenomegaly, and myelofibrosis as core features and broader immune cell defects emerging as important modifiers of phenotype; diagnosis hinges on smear, EM, and NBEAL2 sequencing, and management is supportive with judicious transfusion, antifibrinolytics, and selective use of TPO mimetics or transplant in severe cases [^7b8cd665] [^cbadd029] [^77d1307a].

Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by **NBEAL2 mutations** [^cbadd029], leading to absent platelet α-granules and macrothrombocytopenia [^9d10058f]. Patients have a **moderate bleeding tendency** [^7b8cd665], splenomegaly, and progressive myelofibrosis [^4a6d61e6]; neutrophils may show specific granule defects and impaired NETosis [^2cedbf93]. Diagnosis relies on **peripheral smear** showing large, agranular platelets [^7b8cd665], **electron microscopy** confirming α-granule absence [^d3a19413], and **genetic testing** for NBEAL2 variants [^d7eab832]. Management is supportive, with platelet transfusions for bleeding or procedures, antifibrinolytics, and selective use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is considered for severe disease or myelofibrosis [^77d1307a].

## Genetic basis and inheritance

- **Gene**: NBEAL2 (neurobeachin-like 2) on chromosome 3p21.31 [^cbadd029].
- **Inheritance**: Autosomal recessive; compound heterozygous mutations are common [^d7eab832].
- **Function**: NBEAL2 is a BEACH-domain protein essential for α-granule biogenesis and cargo retention in megakaryocytes [^9d10058f] [^8f57eeeb].

---

## Pathophysiology

- **Α-granule deficiency**: Platelets lack α-granules, which store hemostatic proteins (e.g. fibrinogen, vWF, factor V) and growth factors, causing impaired adhesion, aggregation, and clot stabilization [^aebe70b2].
- **Macrothrombocytopenia**: Large platelets result from defective megakaryopoiesis and abnormal proplatelet formation [^7b8cd665].
- **Myelofibrosis**: Progressive marrow fibrosis arises from dysregulated megakaryocyte–neutrophil interactions and cytokine release (e.g. TGF-β) [^b9bc05c8].
- **Immune defects**: Neutrophils may have reduced specific granules and impaired NETosis, contributing to infection risk [^2cedbf93].

---

## Clinical manifestations

| **System** | **Manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Hematologic | - Moderate bleeding (epistaxis, menorrhagia, easy bruising) [^7b8cd665] <br/> - Macrothrombocytopenia <br/> - Splenomegaly <br/> - Progressive myelofibrosis [^4a6d61e6] |
| Immune | - Recurrent infections <br/> - Autoimmune phenomena (e.g. ITP-like features) [^551bcedc] |
| Laboratory | - Elevated serum vitamin B12 [^423dda60] <br/> - Prolonged bleeding time <br/> - Impaired platelet aggregation to collagen, epinephrine, and ADP [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Peripheral smear**: Large, agranular platelets with gray appearance [^7b8cd665].
- **Electron microscopy**: Confirms absence of α-granules in platelets and megakaryocytes [^2019eb26].
- **Genetic testing**: Identifies biallelic NBEAL2 variants [^d7eab832].
- **Platelet function tests**: Reduced aggregation to collagen, epinephrine, and ADP; normal response to ristocetin [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **GATA1-related thrombocytopenia**: X-linked; milder α-granule defect, thalassemia features [^e783cf69].
- **GFI1B-related thrombocytopenia**: Autosomal dominant; α-granule deficiency with dysmegakaryopoiesis [^2c20211e].
- **Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome**: Dense granule defect with oculocutaneous albinism [^6cb69609].
- **MYH9-related disorders**: Macrothrombocytopenia with neutrophil inclusions, nephritis, hearing loss [^041e1660].

---

## Management

- **Supportive care**: Patient education, avoidance of trauma, and local hemostatic measures [^f9343279].
- **Platelet transfusion**: For bleeding or invasive procedures; consider HLA-matching if repeated transfusions are needed [^393bc812].
- **Antifibrinolytics**: Tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid for mucosal bleeding [^77d1307a].
- **Thrombopoietin receptor agonists**: Romiplostim or eltrombopag for severe thrombocytopenia refractory to other measures [^77d1307a].
- **Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation**: For severe disease, progressive myelofibrosis, or transfusion dependence [^77d1307a].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with supportive care, though bleeding risk persists and myelofibrosis may progress [^7b8cd665]. Severe complications include **life-threatening hemorrhage** and **bone marrow failure** in advanced myelofibrosis [^423dda60].

---

Gray platelet syndrome is a recessive NBEAL2 disorder with α-granule deficiency, macrothrombocytopenia, and bleeding, often with myelofibrosis; diagnosis rests on smear, EM, and genetics, and management is supportive with transfusions, antifibrinolytics, and selective TPO-RA or HSCT in severe cases.

### Should any genetic defect affecting α-granules in platelets be classified as gray platelet syndrome? [^08364148]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

There is much current interest in the role of the platelet storage pool of α-granule proteins both in hemostasis and non-hemostatic events. As well as in the arrest of bleeding, the secreted proteins participate in wound healing, inflammation, and innate immunity while in pathology they may be actors in arterial thrombosis and atherosclerosis as well as cancer and metastasis. For a long time, gray platelet syndrome (GPS) has been regarded as the classic inherited platelet disorder caused by an absence of α-granules and their contents. While NBEAL2 is the major source of mutations in GPS, other gene variants may give rise to significant α-granule deficiencies in platelets. These include GATA1, VPS33B, or VIPAS39 in the arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome and now GFI1B. Nevertheless, many phenotypic differences are associated with mutations in these genes. This critical review was aimed to assess genotype/phenotype variability in disorders of platelet α-granule biogenesis and to urge caution in grouping all genetic defects of α-granules as GPS. Am. J.

### Immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, and granule defects in gray platelet syndrome [^4a6d61e6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Since the description of the first case with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) in 1971, this rare inherited platelet disorder has been the focus of extensive clinical and basic research. These studies have not only increased our knowledge about the clinical manifestations of GPS but also deepened our understanding of the biogenesis of platelet α-granules and their pathophysiology in hemostasis and thrombosis. The discovery of the causal gene, neurobeachin-like 2, in 2011 was a milestone in hematology. Following this was the rapid diagnosis and phenotyping of many new patients and the further development of experimental models to characterize the pathophysiological relevance of neurobeachin-like 2 in hemostasis and immunity. The impact of altered protein function on cells other than platelets became apparent, including defects in the granules of neutrophils and monocytes and changes in the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of other immune cells such as T lymphocytes. Besides the previously recognized clinical manifestations of macrothrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and early-onset bone marrow fibrosis, we now recognize that immunologic abnormalities, including autoimmune diseases and recurrent infections, affect a proportion of patients with GPS. There is a proinflammatory signature of the plasma in GPS, with quantitative alterations of multiple proteins, including many produced by the liver. This review will cover the classical features of GPS and then focus on additional clinical manifestations of immune dysregulation and cellular defects beyond platelets in patients with this rare disorder.

Introduction

In this review we compare clinical, biological and genetic characteristics of inherited platelet disorders (IPD) with abnormal platelet function but a normal platelet count (listed in Table 1) and highlight anti-ischemic drugs developed based on the discoveries made regarding these disorders. A low platelet count does not exclude altered platelet function but we refrain from repeating details for disorders such as Bernard-Soulier and gray platelet syndromes included in our companion paper in this journal and summarized in Online Supplementary Table S1. After briefly detailing therapy, we discuss the current lessons and perspectives for clinical practice and highlight how it is important for clinicians to constitute a pivot between genetic platforms and basic research.

### Gray platelet syndrome: natural history of a large patient cohort and locus assignment to chromosome 3p [^423dda60]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is an inherited bleeding disorder characterized by macrothrombocytopenia and absence of platelet α-granules resulting in typical gray platelets on peripheral smears. GPS is associated with a bleeding tendency, myelofibrosis, and splenomegaly. Reports on GPS are limited to case presentations. The causative gene and underlying pathophysiology are largely unknown. We present the results of molecular genetic analysis of 116 individuals including 25 GPS patients from 14 independent families as well as novel clinical data on the natural history of the disease. The mode of inheritance was autosomal recessive (AR) in 11 and indeterminate in 3 families. Using genome-wide linkage analysis, we mapped the AR-GPS gene to a 9.4-Mb interval on 3p21.1-3p22.1, containing 197 protein-coding genes. Sequencing of 1423 (69%) of the 2075 exons in the interval did not identify the GPS gene. Long-term follow-up data demonstrated the progressive nature of the thrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis of GPS resulting in fatal hemorrhages in some patients. We identified high serum vitamin B(12) as a consistent, novel finding in GPS. Chromosome 3p21.1-3p22.1 has not been previously linked to a platelet disorder; identification of the GPS gene will likely lead to the discovery of novel components of platelet organelle biogenesis. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00069680 and NCT00369421.

### Exome sequencing identifies NBEAL2 as the causative gene for gray platelet syndrome [^cbadd029]. Nature Genetics (2011). Medium credibility.

Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a predominantly recessive platelet disorder that is characterized by mild thrombocytopenia with large platelets and a paucity of α-granules; these abnormalities cause mostly moderate but in rare cases severe bleeding. We sequenced the exomes of four unrelated individuals and identified NBEAL2 as the causative gene; it has no previously known function but is a member of a gene family that is involved in granule development. Silencing of nbeal2 in zebrafish abrogated thrombocyte formation.

Gray platelet syndrome and related disorders

A qualitative disorder characterized by moderate macrothrombocytopenia with "gray-colored" platelets on a stained blood smear, gray platelet syndrome has mostly AR inheritance. Patients have enlarged platelets lacking α-granules and their storage pool of proteins. Thrombocytopenia is often progressive and bleeding highly variable. Enlarged spleens, myelofibrosis, high serum vitamin B12 levels and reduced platelet function help define the phenotype. In 2011, three groups using different approaches including next-generation WES and RNA profiling showed that mutations in NBEAL2 caused gray platelet syndrome in large, but distinct cohorts of patients (data reviewed by Chen et al.). NBEAL2 is a scaffolding protein involved in α-granule ontogeny. Mouse Nbeal2 −/− models recapitulated the gray platelet syndrome phenotype and showed how the lack of the secretory pool of biologically active proteins affects wound healing, and has consequences for thrombosis and inflammation. Cultured megakaryocytes from patients with NBEAL2 mutations interacted abnormally with extracellular matrix proteins, including type I collagen, with reduced proplatelet formation and branching. Extensive emperipolesis of neutrophils by the megakaryocytes is another feature of gray platelet syndrome. Although altered neutrophil structure and increased infections were reported in early studies on this syndrome, only recently was a role for NBEAL2 in immunity confirmed. New avenues for research on autoimmunity and inflammation in gray platelet syndrome have now opened.

### A dominant-negative GFI1B mutation in the gray platelet syndrome [^2c20211e]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The gray platelet syndrome is a hereditary, usually autosomal recessive bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha granules in platelets. We detected a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the transcription factor GFI1B (growth factor independent 1B) that causes autosomal dominant gray platelet syndrome. Both gray platelets and megakaryocytes had abnormal marker expression. In addition, the megakaryocytes had dysplastic features, and they were abnormally distributed in the bone marrow. The GFI1B mutant protein inhibited nonmutant GFI1B transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative manner. Our studies show that GFI1B, in addition to being causally related to the gray platelet syndrome, is key to megakaryocyte and platelet development.

### NBEAL2 is mutated in gray platelet syndrome and is required for biogenesis of platelet α-granules [^9d10058f]. Nature Genetics (2011). Medium credibility.

Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder that is characterized by large platelets that lack α-granules. Here we show that mutations in NBEAL2 (neurobeachin-like 2), which encodes a BEACH/ARM/WD40 domain protein, cause GPS and that megakaryocytes and platelets from individuals with GPS express a unique combination of NBEAL2 transcripts. Proteomic analysis of sucrose-gradient subcellular fractions of platelets indicated that NBEAL2 localizes to the dense tubular system (endoplasmic reticulum) in platelets.

### Mutations in NBEAL2, encoding a BEACH protein, cause gray platelet syndrome [^5c5cc198]. Nature Genetics (2011). Medium credibility.

Next-generation RNA sequence analysis of platelets from an individual with autosomal recessive gray platelet syndrome (GPS, MIM139090) detected abnormal transcript reads, including intron retention, mapping to NBEAL2 (encoding neurobeachin-like 2). Genomic DNA sequencing confirmed mutations in NBEAL2 as the genetic cause of GPS. NBEAL2 encodes a protein containing a BEACH domain that is predicted to be involved in vesicular trafficking and may be critical for the development of platelet α-granules.

### Novel manifestations of immune dysregulation and granule defects in gray platelet syndrome [^551bcedc]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a rare recessive disorder caused by biallelic variants in NBEAL2 and characterized by bleeding symptoms, the absence of platelet α-granules, splenomegaly, and bone marrow (BM) fibrosis. Due to the rarity of GPS, it has been difficult to fully understand the pathogenic processes that lead to these clinical sequelae. To discern the spectrum of pathologic features, we performed a detailed clinical genotypic and phenotypic study of 47 patients with GPS and identified 32 new etiologic variants in NBEAL2. The GPS patient cohort exhibited known phenotypes, including macrothrombocytopenia, BM fibrosis, megakaryocyte emperipolesis of neutrophils, splenomegaly, and elevated serum vitamin B12 levels. Novel clinical phenotypes were also observed, including reduced leukocyte counts and increased presence of autoimmune disease and positive autoantibodies. There were widespread differences in the transcriptome and proteome of GPS platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, and CD4 lymphocytes. Proteins less abundant in these cells were enriched for constituents of granules, supporting a role for Nbeal2 in the function of these organelles across a wide range of blood cells. Proteomic analysis of GPS plasma showed increased levels of proteins associated with inflammation and immune response. One-quarter of plasma proteins increased in GPS are known to be synthesized outside of hematopoietic cells, predominantly in the liver. In summary, our data show that, in addition to the well-described platelet defects in GPS, there are immune defects. The abnormal immune cells may be the drivers of systemic abnormalities such as autoimmune disease.

### Neutrophil specific granule and NETosis defects in gray platelet syndrome [^2cedbf93]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by a lack of α-granules in platelets and progressive myelofibrosis. Rare loss-of-function variants in neurobeachin-like 2 (NBEAL2), a member of the family of beige and Chédiak-Higashi (BEACH) genes, are causal of GPS. It is suggested that BEACH domain containing proteins are involved in fusion, fission, and trafficking of vesicles and granules. Studies in knockout mice suggest that NBEAL2 may control the formation and retention of granules in neutrophils. We found that neutrophils obtained from the peripheral blood from 13 patients with GPS have a normal distribution of azurophilic granules but show a deficiency of specific granules (SGs), as confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy and mass spectrometry proteomics analyses. CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from patients with GPS differentiated into mature neutrophils also lacked NBEAL2 expression but showed similar SG protein expression as control cells. This is indicative of normal granulopoiesis in GPS and identifies NBEAL2 as a potentially important regulator of granule release. Patient neutrophil functions, including production of reactive oxygen species, chemotaxis, and killing of bacteria and fungi, were intact. NETosis was absent in circulating GPS neutrophils. Lack of NETosis is suggested to be independent of NBEAL2 expression but associated with SG defects instead, as indicated by comparison with HSC-derived neutrophils. Since patients with GPS do not excessively suffer from infections, the consequence of the reduced SG content and lack of NETosis for innate immunity remains to be explored.

### The transcription factor GATA1 regulates NBEAL2 expression through a long-distance enhancer [^e783cf69]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Gray platelet syndrome is named after the gray appearance of platelets due to the absence of α-granules. It is caused by recessive mutations in NBEAL2, resulting in macrothrombocytopenia and myelofibrosis. Though using the term gray platelets for GATA1 deficiency has been debated, a reduced number of α-granules has been described for macrothrombocytopenia due to GATA1 mutations. We compared platelet size and number of α-granules for two NBEAL2 and two GATA1-deficient patients and found reduced numbers of α-granules for all, with the defect being more pronounced for NBEAL2 deficiency. We further hypothesized that the granule defect for GATA1 is due to a defective control of NBEAL2 expression. Remarkably, platelets from two patients, and Gata1-deficient mice, expressed almost no NBEAL2. The differentiation of GATA1 patient-derived CD34 + stem cells to megakaryocytes showed defective proplatelet and α-granule formation with strongly reduced NBEAL2 protein and ribonucleic acid expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed 5 GATA binding sites in a regulatory region 31 kb upstream of NBEAL2 covered by a H3K4Me1 mark indicative of an enhancer locus. Luciferase reporter constructs containing this region confirmed its enhancer activity in K562 cells, and mutagenesis of the GATA1 binding sites resulted in significantly reduced enhancer activity. Moreover, DNA binding studies showed that GATA1 and GATA2 physically interact with this enhancer region. GATA1 depletion using small interfering ribonucleic acid in K562 cells also resulted in reduced NBEAL2 expression. In conclusion, we herein show a long-distance regulatory region with GATA1 binding sites as being a strong enhancer for NBEAL2 expression.

### Defective platelet responsiveness to thrombin and protease-activated receptors agonists in a novel case of gray platelet syndrome: correlation between the platelet defect and the α-granule content in the patient and four relatives [^733365cc]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

We report a novel case of gray platelet syndrome (GPS). A 14-year-old boy had bleeding diathesis, mild thrombocytopenia, giant platelets with severe defect of alpha-granule secretory proteins, myelofibrosis and splenomegaly.

Methods and Results

Platelet function studies showed a marked reduction of aggregation and Ca(2+) mobilization by thrombin, protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-activating peptide (AP) and PAR4-AP, PAR1 expression at 55% of normal levels, and a more than two hundred fold reduction of in vitro whole-blood thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) production. Sequencing of coding regions of the PAR1 gene failed to show abnormalities. This patient was initially classified as a sporadic case of GPS, as electron microscopy failed to identify giant platelets and/or alpha-granule deficiency in his relatives. However, further studies on the father and three other relatives showed a relative lack of platelet alpha-granule proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy, a defective platelet response to PAR4-AP, and severely reduced in vitro whole-blood TXB(2) production. On this basis, we suggest that in this family, GPS was transmitted in a dominant fashion with highly variable penetrance.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that current diagnostic criteria fail to identify some patients with a mild GPS phenotype and that such patients might be identified by the methods cited above. It also better characterizes the pathogenesis of defective platelet responses to thrombin, and raises interesting questions on the correlation between abnormal PAR function and the lack of alpha-granule content in GPS.

### Gray platelet syndrome presenting with pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and bone marrow fibrosis [^2019eb26]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a rare platelet storage pool disorder associated with a marked decrease or absence of platelet α-granules and their contents. It is characterized clinically by mild to moderate bleeding; moderate macrothrombocytopenia with large, agranular platelets; splenomegaly; and bone marrow fibrosis. Electron microscopy confirms markedly reduced or absent α-granules in platelets and megakaryocytes. The classic description of GPS is caused by homozygous mutations in NBEAL2 (neurobeachinlike 2).

Methods

A 28-year-old Hispanic man with a history of easy bruising and occasional episodes of epistaxis sought treatment for pancytopenia and splenomegaly. Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow analysis, electron microscopy, and next-generation sequencing were performed.

Results

Large and agranular platelets were present in the peripheral blood. There was bone marrow fibrosis. Electron microscopy of the platelets showed absence of α-granules. Next-generation sequencing revealed a germline apparently homozygous nonsense variant in the NBEAL2 gene: c.5674C > T, p. Gln1892X (p.Q1829X).

Conclusions

The differential diagnosis of GPS includes a myeloid neoplasm such as myelodysplastic syndrome with bone marrow fibrosis. The availability of diagnostic genetic panels for hereditable platelet disorders can assist in the recognition of GPS and other platelet disorders. We also describe a previously unreported pathogenic germline homozygous nonsense variant in the NBEAL2 gene: c.5674C > T, p. Gln1892X (p.Q1829X) in a patient with GPS.

### A new genetic isolate of gray platelet syndrome (GPS): clinical, cellular, and hematologic characteristics [^9b8a9935]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and large platelets that lack alpha granules and their contents. We describe two siblings with GPS who are members of a Moslem Bedouin genetic isolate. The children, an 8-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy, had characteristic pale blue platelets lacking alpha granules on electron microscopy. Platelet aggregation studies were normal. The girl underwent a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy which showed mild myelofibrosis and extensive emperipolesis, i.e., the passage of other hematopoietic cells through megakaryocytes. Both children lacked high-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and had reduced activity and antigens of vWf. Platelet activation was approximately normal when ADP was employed as agonist, but significantly impaired using the thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP). These findings are explained in light of the mechanism of action of each agonist. In addition, we propose that the emperipolesis was caused by increased P-selectin in megakaryocytes, and resulted in release of fibroblastic growth factors, explaining the myelofibrosis. The detailed description of these cases provides a basis for future differentiation of the various types of GPS, and for our current attempts to isolate the gene causing GPS in this genetic isolate.

### Platelet proteome and function in X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia andcomparisons with gray platelet syndrome [^23b932df]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The inherited platelet disorder, X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT; OMIM 314050) was first described in 1977 in a family where three men presented with macrothrombocytopenia, bleeding diathesis, splenomegaly and mild hemolysis of the b-thalassemia type. Three additional families were reportedprior to our description of two Swedish XLTT families exhibiting a previously not reported grade 1−2/3 myelofibrosis. Recently, a Danish−Swedish whole-exome sequencing study of 156 patients with bleeding tendency identified two additional families (three individuals) with the disease. All reported XLTT patients carried the same exon 4 GATA1 p.R216Q mutation. Similarities with the autosomal inherited disorder gray platelet syndrome (GPS)have been noted regarding deficiency of platelet a-granules, splenomegaly, and, more recently, myelofibrosis.

Bleeding diathesis beyond what could be expected from blood platelet counts was observed in several male XLTT patients, with occasional severe bleeds requiring platelet and/or erythrocyte transfusions,6, We, therefore, set out to evaluate hemostasis and platelet functions in members of our two Swedish XLTT families, as a complement to earlier investigations. Our approach was to map the XLTT platelet proteome in order to disclose anticipated platelet granule deficiencies and other abnormalities. Subsequently, we sought to validate alterations of selected proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in bone marrow (BM) megakaryocytes and platelet functional reactions related to granule deficiencies by flow cytometry. Finally, we compared our platelet proteomic findings to those of a published dataset from a NBEAL2 mutated patient diagnosed with GPS (by courtesy of Dr. Meral Gunay-Aygun, Johns Hopkins University, e-mail, 24 October 2018), aiming to disclose similarities and differences.

### X-linked gray platelet syndrome due to a GATA1 arg216Gln mutation [^9817212e]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

We identified a family with gray platelet syndrome (GPS) segregating as a sex-linked trait. Affected males had a mild bleeding disorder, thrombocytopenia, and large agranular platelets characteristic of GPS, while obligate carrier females were asymptomatic but had dimorphic platelets on peripheral smear. Associated findings included mild erythrocyte abnormalities in affected males. Linkage analysis revealed a 63 cM region on the X chromosome between markers G10578 and DXS6797, which segregated with the platelet phenotype and included the GATA1 gene. Sequencing of GATA1 revealed a G-to-A mutation at position 759 corresponding to amino acid change Arg216Gln. This mutation was previously described as a cause of X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT) but not of gray platelet syndrome. Our findings suggest that XLTT is within a spectrum of disorders constituting the gray platelet syndrome, and we propose that GATA1 is an upstream regulator of the genes required for platelet alpha-granule biogenesis.

### Megakaryocyte and platelet transcriptomics for discoveries in human health and disease [^81a4f8cb]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Alterations in the megakaryocyte transcriptome and proteome may be passed on to newly developing platelets. The overarching theme depicted in this schematic is that physiological stimuli, diseases, and differences in racial background may alter the portfolio of RNAs and proteins in megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytes may then invest newly developing platelets with an altered set of RNAs (eg, transcriptome) and proteins (eg, proteome) that influences cellular functions and host responses. The accompanying Table 1 in the article lists some examples of settings where the platelet transcriptome and proteome are altered. Of note, many studies referenced in the text interrogated changes in the platelet proteome for a limited subset of genes, rather than performing global analyses of the proteome.

Table.
Examples of Settings Where Published Studies Demonstrate That the Platelet Transcriptome and Proteome of Humans Is Altered

Seminal work, spanning > 70 years, demonstrating that platelets contain mRNA and possess the machinery to translate mRNAshas opened the door to diverse RNA-based investigations that have significantly advanced the field of megakaryocyte and platelet biology.

With the development of techniques such as next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), transcriptome analyses of platelets and megakaryocytes are increasingly used for discoveries on novel aspects of platelet biology, as diagnostic and prognostic markers, and for therapeutic development efforts. For example, platelet RNA-seq (gene expression profiling) led to the identification of the causative gene for gray platelet syndrome. Moreover, in recent years, the concept of tumor-educated platelets has emerged as an innovative way to detect and track the progression of certain solid tumors. In these patients, platelet RNA-seq can reveal specific transcriptional signatures of lung, brain, and breast tumors.

In this focused review, we will highlight selected recent studies leveraging platelet and megakaryocyte transcriptomics for genetic discoveries, for intriguing insights into disease pathology, and for diagnostics and prognostics efforts.

### Correlation between platelet phenotype and NBEAL2 genotype in patients with congenital thrombocytopenia and α-granule deficiency [^d7eab832]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

The gray platelet syndrome is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by macrothrombocytopenia and deficiency of alpha (α)-granules in platelets. The genetic defect responsible for gray platelet syndrome was recently identified in biallelic mutations in the NBEAL2 gene. We studied 11 consecutive families with inherited macrothrombocytopenia of unknown origin and α-granule deficiency. All of them underwent NBEAL2 DNA sequencing and evaluation of the platelet phenotype, including a systematic assessment of the α-granule content by immunofluorescence analysis for α-granule secretory proteins. We identified 9 novel mutations hitting the two alleles of NBEAL2 in 4 probands. They included missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations, as well as nucleotide substitutions that altered the splicing mechanisms as determined at the RNA level. All the individuals with NBEAL2 biallelic mutations showed almost complete absence of platelet α-granules. Interestingly, the 13 individuals assumed to be asymptomatic because carriers of a mutated allele had platelet macrocytosis and significant reduction of the α-granule content. However, they were not thrombocytopenic. In the remaining 7 probands, we did not identify any NBEAL2 alterations, suggesting that other genetic defect(s) are responsible for their platelet phenotype. Of note, these patients were characterized by a lower severity of the α-granule deficiency than individuals with two NBEAL2 mutated alleles. Our data extend the spectrum of mutations responsible for gray platelet syndrome and demonstrate that macrothrombocytopenia with α-granule deficiency is a genetic heterogeneous trait. In terms of practical applications, the screening of NBEAL2 is worthwhile only in patients with macrothrombocytopenia and severe reduction of the α-granules. Finally, individuals carrying one NBEAL2 mutated allele have mild laboratory abnormalities, suggesting that even haploinsufficiency has an effect on platelet phenotype.

### Molecular study of the hematopoietic zinc finger gene in three unrelated families with gray platelet syndrome [^e1393a10]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Hematopoietic zinc finger (HZF) null mice have features reminiscent of patients with gray platelet syndrome (GPS), a rare inherited bleeding disorder. This similarity has suggested that HZF deregulation might be involved in the human disease. The sequence of the eight exons of the HZF gene as well as the study of its expression in blood samples from five patients belonging to three different families did not reveal any modifications when compared with healthy donors. This study indicates that HZF is unlikely to be responsible for GPS.

### Newly recognized cellular abnormalities in the gray platelet syndrome [^e5d459f7]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

The gray platelet syndrome (GPS) is a rare congenital bleeding disorder in which thrombocytopenia is associated with increased platelet size and decreased alpha-granule content. This report describes 3 new pediatric cases presenting with the classical platelet abnormalities of GPS within one family with normal parents. Examination of blood smears of the 3 patients demonstrated not only gray platelets, but also gray polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) with decreased or abnormally distributed components of secretory compartments (alkaline phosphatase, CD35, CD11b/CD18). Secondary granules were also decreased in number as assayed by immunoelectron microscopy. These data confirm that the secretory compartments in neutrophils were also deficient in this family. Megakaryocytes (MKs) were cultured from the peripheral blood CD34+ cells of the 3 patients for 14 days, in the presence of thrombopoietin and processed for immunoelectron microscopy. Although von Willebrand factor (vWF) was virtually undetectable in platelets, vWF immunolabeling was conspicuous in cultured maturing MKs, particularly within Golgi saccules, but instead of being packaged in alpha-granules, it was released into the demarcation membrane system. In contrast, P-selectin followed a more classical pathway. Double-labeling experiments confirmed that vWF was following an intracellular pathway distinct from the one of P-selectin. In these 3 new cases of GPS, the MKs appeared to abnormally process vWF, with secretion into the extracellular space instead of normal alpha-granule packaging. Furthermore, the secretory compartment of another blood cell line, the neutrophil, was also affected in this family of GPS.

### Nbeal2 interacts with dock7, sec16a, and vac14 [^37df14b1]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Mutations in NBEAL2, the gene encoding the scaffolding protein Nbeal2, are causal of gray platelet syndrome (GPS), a rare recessive bleeding disorder characterized by platelets lacking α-granules and progressive marrow fibrosis. We present here the interactome of Nbeal2 with additional validation by reverse immunoprecipitation of Dock7, Sec16a, and Vac14 as interactors of Nbeal2. We show that GPS-causing mutations in its BEACH domain have profound and possible effects on the interaction with Dock7 and Vac14, respectively. Proximity ligation assays show that these 2 proteins are physically proximal to Nbeal2 in human megakaryocytes. In addition, we demonstrate that Nbeal2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and Dock7 on the membrane of or in α-granules. Interestingly, platelets from GPS cases and Nbeal2 -/- mice are almost devoid of Dock7, resulting in a profound dysregulation of its signaling pathway, leading to defective actin polymerization, platelet activation, and shape change. This study shows for the first time proteins interacting with Nbeal2 and points to the dysregulation of the canonical signaling pathway of Dock7 as a possible cause of the aberrant formation of platelets in GPS cases and Nbeal2- deficient mice.

### Inherited disorders of platelet function: selected updates [^5077f4ad]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

The gene variants responsible for the primary genotype of many platelet disorders have now been identified. Next-generation sequencing technology (NGST), mainly exome sequencing, has highlighted genes responsible for defects in platelet secretion (NBEAL2, gray platelet syndrome), procoagulant activity (STIM1, Stormorken syndrome), and activation pathways (RASGRP2, CalDAG-GEFI deficiency and integrin dysfunction; PRKACG, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase deficiency). Often disorders of platelet function are associated with a modified platelet production with changes in platelet number and size and can accompany malfunction of other organs or tissues. Most families have private mutations, and gene variants may prevent protein synthesis, abrogate function, or result in aberrant activated proteins. Nevertheless, bleeding severity is difficult to predict by genotype alone suggesting other factors. A major new challenge of NGST is to identify these factors and help improve patient care. This review concentrates on recent developments and is illustrated from personal observations.

### Molecular basis of platelet granule defects [^aebe70b2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Platelets are small, discoid, anucleate blood cells that play key roles in clotting and other functions involved in health and disease. Platelets are derived from bone marrow-resident megakaryocytes, which undergo a complex developmental process where they increase dramatically in size and produce an abundance of organelles destined for platelets. These organelles include mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and 2 unique types of secretory organelles: α- and dense (δ-) granules. δ-Granules contain small molecules, including adenosine triphosphate, adenosine diphosphate, serotonin, and ions, such as calcium and zinc (Ca²⁺ and Zn²⁺). α-Granules contain a variety of cargo proteins, which, when secreted by activated platelets, are involved in processes such as hemostasis (eg, fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor), angiogenesis, inflammation, and wound healing. Investigations of patients with inherited conditions resulting in decreased/abnormal platelet secretory granules have led to the identification of proteins, protein complexes, and cellular processes involved in their production by megakaryocytes. Notably, studies of ARPC1B deficiency, Hermansky-Pudlak, and Chediak-Higashi syndromes have linked several genes/proteins to δ-granule biogenesis. Studies of multisystemic arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis syndrome revealed the requirement of 2 proteins, VPS33B and VPS16B, in α-granule formation. Identification of the genetic cause of gray platelet syndrome established that NBEAL2 is an additional protein needed for α-granule cargo retention. These discoveries enabled studies using animal models, cell culture, and molecular analysis to gain insights into the roles of proteins and cellular processes involved in platelet secretory granule production, which are discussed in this review.

### Expression of cellular prion protein on platelets from patients with gray platelet or Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and the protein's association with α-granules [^c3512762]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

The cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a membrane glycoprotein expressed on many human cells including platelets. We investigated the cellular localization of platelet PrPc. In resting platelets most PrPc was localized inside the cells. The correlation of PrPc and P-selectin surface up-regulation after platelet activation suggested its association with alpha-granules. This was confirmed by normal expression of PrPc on Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome platelets, which lack dense granules, and failure of gray platelet syndrome platelets, which lack alpha-granules, to up-regulate PrPc. Our results warrant further studies on the role of platelet PrPc in the transmission of prion diseases by blood transfusion.

### Platelet transfusion: 2025 AABB and ICTMG international clinical… [^e9df1923]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

For hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in nonbleeding patients receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 10 × 10³/μL. For consumptive thrombocytopenia in neonates without major bleeding, platelet transfusion is recommended when platelet count is less than 25 × 10³/μL. The panel strongly recommends restrictive over liberal platelet transfusion strategies based on high- or moderate-certainty evidence in the 4 populations defined below. Table 2 provides the summary of findings and Table 3 summarizes all recommendations. Recommendation 1. 1: in nonbleeding patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia actively receiving chemotherapy or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 10 × 10³/μL. Recommendation 1.

4: in patients with Dengue-related consumptive thrombocytopenia in the absence of major bleeding, the panel recommends no platelet transfusion. Recommendation 2. 1: in nonbleeding adult patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia undergoing autologous SCT or with aplastic anemia, the panel recommends a no-prophylaxis strategy. Recommendation 2. 2: in adult patients with consumptive thrombocytopenia due to critical illness and without major bleeding, platelet transfusion should be administered when the platelet count is less than 10 × 10³/μL. Full details of the identified evidence are shown in the Supplement. Three RCTs evaluated patients with HPT undergoing autologous SCT. 17, 22, 23 For WHO grade 2–4 bleeding, the ARD was 19. 5%.

The benefit from prophylactic platelet transfusion is less likely in this HPT subpopulation compared with the HPT subpopulation for which the panel made a strong recommendation to transfuse platelets when the platelet count is less than 10 × 10³/μL. 63 In contrast, although the duration of thrombocytopenia in aplastic anemia is often prolonged, the panel conditionally recommended a no-prophylaxis strategy given value placed on quality of life.

### Advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of disorders of platelet function [^384e14b5]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Genetic defects of platelet function give rise to mucocutaneous bleeding of varying severity because platelets fail to fulfil their haemostatic role after vessel injury. Abnormalities of pathways involving glycoprotein (GP) mediators of adhesion (Bernard-Soulier syndrome, platelet-type von Willebrand disease) and aggregation (Glanzmann thrombasthenia) are the most studied and affect the GPIb-IX-V complex and integrin αIIbβ3, respectively. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-III combines Glanzmann thrombasthenia with infections and defects of kindlin-3, a mediator of integrin activation. Agonist-specific deficiencies in platelet aggregation relate to mutations of primary receptors for ADP (P2Y(12)), thromboxane A(2) (TXA2R) and collagen (GPVI); however, selective abnormalities of intracellular signalling pathways remain better understood in mouse models. Defects of secretion from δ-granules are accompanied by pigment defects in the Hermansky-Pudlak and Chediak-Higashi syndromes; they concern multiple genes and protein complexes involved in secretory organelle biogenesis and function. Quebec syndrome is linked to a tandem duplication of the urokinase plasminogen activator (PLAU) gene while locus assignment to chromosome 3p has advanced the search for the gene(s) responsible for α-granule deficiency in the gray platelet syndrome. Defects of α-granule biosynthesis also involve germline VPS33B mutations in the ARC (arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis) syndrome. A mutation in transmembrane protein 16F (TMEM16F) has been linked to a defective procoagulant activity and phosphatidylserine expression in the Scott syndrome. Cytoskeletal dysfunction (with platelet anisotrophy) occurs not only in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome but also in filamin A deficiency or MYH9-related disease while GATA1 mutations or RUNX1 haploinsufficiency can affect expression of multiple platelet proteins.

### Nbeal2 deficiency increases organ damage but does not affect host defense during Gram-Negative pneumonia-derived sepsis [^e18538d4]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective- Nbeal2 -/- mice, a model of human gray platelet syndrome, have reduced neutrophil granularity and impaired host defense against systemic Staphylococcus aureus infection. We here aimed to study the role of Nbeal2 deficiency in both leukocytes and platelets during gram-negative pneumonia and sepsis. Approach and Results- We studied the role of Nbeal2 in platelets and leukocytes during murine pneumonia and sepsis by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Apart from platelet α-granule deficiency and reduced neutrophil granularity, also monocyte granularity was reduced in Nbeal2 -/- mice, whereas plasma levels of MPO (myeloperoxidase), elastase, NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), and MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), and leukocyte CD11b expression were increased. Nbeal2 -/- leukocytes showed unaltered in vitro antibacterial response and phagocytosis capacity against Klebsiella, and unchanged reactive nitrogen species and cytokine production. Also during Klebsiella pneumonia and sepsis, Nbeal2 -/- mice had similar bacterial growth in lung and distant body sites, with enhanced leukocyte migration to the bronchoalveolar space. Despite similar infection-induced inflammation, organ damage was increased in Nbeal2 -/- mice, which was also seen during endotoxemia. Platelet-specific Nbeal2 deficiency did not influence leukocyte functions, indicating that Nbeal2 directly modifies leukocytes. Transfusion of Nbeal2 -/- but not of Nbeal2 +/+ platelets into thrombocytopenic mice was associated with bleeding in the lung but similar host defense, pointing at a role for platelet α-granules in maintaining vascular integrity but not host defense during Klebsiella pneumosepsis. Conclusions- These data show that Nbeal2 deficiency-resulting in gray platelet syndrome-affects platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes, with intact host defense but increased organ damage during gram-negative pneumosepsis.

### NBEAL2 deficiency in humans leads to low CTLA-4 expression in activated conventional T cells [^013a13f7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Recessive mutations in the NBEAL2 gene lead to grey platelet syndrome (GPS), characterized by macrothrombocytopenia, α-granule-deficient platelets, bleeding disorders, and (in some cases) splenomegaly and progression to myelofibrosis –.

The clinical phenotype of Nbeal2 knock-out mice recapitulates human GPS. Moreover, several immune cell anomalies have been observed in Nbeal2 –/– mice. The granule count in neutrophils was abnormally low, and natural killer (NK) cell degranulation was impaired – leading to greater susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections (with Staphylococcus aureus, and murine cytomegalovirus, respectively). After the induction of systemic inflammation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the Nbeal2 –/– mice's circulating monocyte and neutrophil counts were found to be abnormally low. The observations in mouse models therefore suggest that NBEAL2 has a role in immune cell function.

Initially, GPS was described as a platelet disorder. However, some NBEAL2-deficient patients present clinical features of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)– suggesting a role for NBEAL2 in immune homeostasis and tolerance. More recently, characterization of a broad international cohort of patients with GPS revealed immune system abnormalities (autoimmune disease, autoantibodies, leukopenia, etc.) in 81% of the individuals. The consequences of recessive NBEAL2 mutations on neutrophils' biological functions have also been described. Neutrophils from patients with GPS exhibit defective neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (also referred to as NETosis) and contain an abnormally low number of specific granules (due to premature release). The early release of granule contents is also observed in platelets, where the α-granules cargoes are not retained in the platelets. Although NBEAL2's role in granule retention has been well described, the mechanism leading to the development of autoimmune manifestations in patients with GPS has not.

### A case of chronic thrombocytopenia in a 17-year-old female [^d3a19413]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Storage pool deficiency (SPD) is a group of rare platelet disorders that result from deficiencies in α-granules, δ-granules, or both. One type of α-SPD is gray platelet syndrome (GPS), caused by mutations in the neurobeachin-like 2 (NBEAL2) gene that results in a bleeding diathesis, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and progressive myelofibrosis. Due to the lack of α-granules, platelets have a gray and degranulated appearance by light microscopy. However, definitive diagnosis of GPS requires confirmation of α-granule deficiency by electron microscopy. Treatment is nonspecific, with the conservative utilization of platelet transfusions being the most important form of therapy. We present a case of a 17-year-old female with a past medical history of thrombocytopenia, first identified at the age of five. Her clinical symptomatology included chronic fatigue, gingival bleeding, bruising, menorrhagia, and leg pain. This report will discuss both the clinical and the pathophysiologic aspects of this rare platelet disorder.

### Platelet proteome and function in X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia andcomparisons with gray platelet syndrome [^dd5bf79e]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

In X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT; OMIM 314050), caused by the mutation p.R216Q in exon 4 of the GATA1 gene, male hemizygous patients display macrothrombocytopenia, bleeding diathesis and a b-thalassemia trait. Herein, we describe findings in two unrelated Swedish XLTT families with a bleeding tendency exceeding what is expected from the thrombocytopenia. Blood tests revealed low P-PAI-1 and P-factor 5, and elevated S-thrombopoietin levels. Transmission electron microscopy showed diminished numbers of platelet a- and dense granules. The proteomes of isolated blood platelets from five male XLTT patients, compared to five sex- and agematched controls, were explored. Quantitative mass spectrometry showed alterations of 83 proteins (fold change ≥ ± 1.2, q < 0.05). Of 46 downregulated proteins, 39 were previously reported to be associated with platelet granules. Reduced protein levels of PTGS1 and SLC35D3 were validated in megakaryocytes of XLTT bone marrow biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Platelet function testing by flow cytometry revealed low dense- and a-granule release and fibrinogen binding in response to ligation of receptors for ADP, the thrombin receptor PAR4 and the collagen receptor GPVI. Significant reductions of a number of agranule proteins overlapped with a previous platelet proteomics investigation in the inherited macrothrombocytopenia gray platelet syndrome. In contrast, Ca 2+ transporter proteins that facilitate dense granule release were downregulated in XLTT but upregulated in gray platelet syndrome. Ingenuity pathway analysis showed altered coagulation system and protein ubiquitination pathways in the XLTT platelets. Collectively, the results revealed protein and functional alterations affecting platelet a- and dense granules in XLTT, probably contributing to bleeding.

### Platelet geometry sensing spatially regulates α-granule secretion to enable matrix self-deposition [^1f607e4b]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Although the biology of platelet adhesion on subendothelial matrix after vascular injury is well characterized, how the matrix biophysical properties affect platelet physiology is unknown. Here we demonstrate that geometric orientation of the matrix itself regulates platelet α-granule secretion, a key component of platelet activation. Using protein microcontact printing, we show that platelets spread beyond the geometric constraints of fibrinogen or collagen micropatterns with < 5-µm features. Interestingly, α-granule exocytosis and deposition of the α-granule contents such as fibrinogen and fibronectin were primarily observed in those areas of platelet extension beyond the matrix protein micropatterns. This enables platelets to "self-deposit" additional matrix, provide more cellular membrane to extend spreading, and reinforce platelet-platelet connections. Mechanistically, this phenomenon is mediated by actin polymerization, Rac1 activation, and αIIbβ3 integrin redistribution and activation, and is attenuated in gray platelet syndrome platelets, which lack α-granules, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome platelets, which have cytoskeletal defects. Overall, these studies demonstrate how platelets transduce geometric cues of the underlying matrix geometry into intracellular signals to extend spreading, which endows platelets spatial flexibility when spreading onto small sites of exposed subendothelium.

### Use of a cDNA microarray to determine molecular mechanisms involved in Grey platelet syndrome [^113a9037]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

The grey platelet syndrome (GPS) is a bleeding disorder of unknown aetiology with phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. Affected patients exhibit macrothrombocytopenia, decreased alpha-granule content and, sometimes, myelofibrosis. We used microarray technology to investigate changes in gene expression that might reveal mechanisms involved in GPS. The expression of 4900 unique genes and expressed sequence tags was evaluated in fibroblasts from a GPS patient; normal fibroblasts provided the reference standard. Genes that were differentially regulated in the GPS cells were categorized into gene clusters based upon similarity/differences of expression differences. The results showed that genes with functional similarities clustered together. This analysis revealed significant upregulation of selected biological processes involving the production of cytoskeleton proteins, including fibronectin 1, thrombospondins 1 and 2, and collagen VI alpha. These genes appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of GPS. Indeed, Northern blot analyses confirmed that fibronectin, thrombospondin and matrix metalloprotease-2 were overexpressed in GPS fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts. Moreover, immunohistochemistry studies revealed robust fibronectin staining in GPS fibroblasts compared with normal ones. Our findings support the feasibility of using cDNA microarray techniques to detect distinctive and informative differences in gene expression patterns relevant to GPS, and suggest that the molecular basis for myelofibrosis in GPS involves upregulation of cytoskeleton proteins.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^bb090fe8]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

As highlighted throughout our review, applying NGS to inherited thrombocytopenias is greatly expanding the list of causative genes as well as increasing the number of variants implicated in the classic diseases. The initial success of WES in genotyping gray platelet syndrome and the TAR syndromes led to the BRIDGE-Bleeding and Platelet Disorders (BRIDGE-BPD) project, orchestrated by Professor W. Ouwehand, which combines the unique sequencing and bioinformatics resources of the Sanger Institute in Cambridge (UK). The Genotyping and Platelet Phenotyping (GAPP) consortium led by Professor S. Watson in Birmingham, UK has been another major player. As the number of causal genes for all forms of inherited platelet disorders increased, BRIDGE-BPD and GAPP both put together platforms to test patients for potentially pathogenic variants against previously identified target genes concentrating on exomes, untranslated regions and selected intronic regions. – Indeed, GAPP designed a gene panel specific for inherited thrombocytopenias. In contrast, the ThromboGenomics Consortium (Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, UK) included a limited number of genes causal for other blood and thrombotic disorders; the panel was regularly updated and a large cohort of 2,396 patients screened. The use of NGS and high-throughput procedures for diagnosing platelet disorders including thrombocytopenias has quickly expanded worldwide as is illustrated by reports from Italy, Japan, Spain, France, Holland and Scandinavia as well as North America.,

The question now is not whether to apply NGS procedures in the mainstream of diagnosis but when and how. Certainly, a strong argument can now be made to use them upfront: early identification of a causal mutation in a known gene will avoid much unnecessary biological characterization, as we have stated recently in this journal. It is certainly necessary if prenatal diagnosis or HSC transplantation is on the agenda. Nonetheless, upwards of 200 potential gene variants can be located for each patient, so prioritizing and filtering the variants is key. Variant selection includes the exclusion of synonymous variants and those with a minor allele frequency > 0.01 in the normal population. Therefore, in the absence of a previously validated mutation in a known causal gene for inherited thrombocytopenia much care must be taken. Only for a limited number of cases can linkage in large families be performed. Data evaluation in terms of quality control, depth of coverage of each gene, the conservation of affected nucleotides or amino acids, the choice of in silico pathogenicity prediction software, and the classification of variants according to appropriate genetic guidelines have been nicely reviewed elsewhere.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^77d1307a]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Managing bleeding in inherited thrombocytopenia is much the same as in all inherited platelet disorders, with platelet and red blood cell transfusions being the first options. The use of recombinant activated factor VII is especially recommended in BSS in which the absence of a major surface constituent (GPIb-IX-V) makes isoantibody formation likely and platelet transfusion ineffective. Tranexamic acid or local measures are the most frequent options for mild bleeding and tranexamic acid is counseled prior to surgery or childbirth if the thrombocytopenia is severe, with platelet concentrates on standby. A quantitated bleeding score, such as the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool, is useful for assessing disease severity but will not predict bleeding risk. – Curing the disease is still at its debut for inherited thrombocytopenia. Human stem cell and allogeneic bone marrow transplants have been used very successfully in children with WAS in whom the immunodeficiency is accompanied by a major bleeding risk. It has also been used in congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and more recently in gray platelet syndrome, in which a positive effect was noted on myelofibrosis, but each procedure has its complications in terms of donor matching and the choice of conditioning regime. Lentivirus-based gene therapy is already a proven therapy in WAS when donor-matching for HSC transplantation is a problem, although restoration of the platelet count remains incomplete. Clearly the gain versus risk profile for the patient must be evaluated case-by-case and current gene therapy procedures can only be considered when a patient's long-term survival is in question or perhaps when CRISPR-Cas gene editing becomes available. One highly promising, non-invasive approach to raising the platelet count is the use of the thrombopoietin-mimetics, eltrombopag or romiplostim. Although bleeding is generally mild in MYH9 -related disease, eltrombopag was first used successfully prior to surgery in a case with aggravated thrombocytopenia over 10 years ago. Thrombopoietin-mimetics have more recently been used for a patient with a DIAPH1 mutation prior to hip arthroplasty and as a "bridge" for a child with WAS and severe thrombocytopenia awaiting HSC transplantation. The goal in such situations is to transiently increase the platelet count to > 50×10⁹ platelets/L. Romiplostim has been successful in correcting the platelet count resulting from mutations in THPO in congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia in which the patient's own thrombopoietin is absent or non-functional. Overall, a careful and complete diagnosis is essential for the optimal management of patients, not only for those in need of special care but also to avoid over-reacting for patients with little risk of bleeding.

### Qualitative disorders of platelets and megakaryocytes [^3ea667a0]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

Qualitative disorders of platelet function and production form a large group of rare diseases which cover a multitude of genetic defects that by and large have as a common symptom, excessive mucocutaneous bleeding. Glanzmann thrombasthenia, is enabling us to learn much about the pathophysiology of integrins and of how alphaIIb beta3 functions. Bernard-Soulier syndrome, an example of macrothrombocytopenia, combines the production of large platelets with a deficit or non-functioning of the major adhesion receptor of platelets, the GPIb-IX-V complex. Amino acid substitutions in GPIb alpha, may lead to up-regulation and spontaneous binding of von Willebrand factor as in Platelet-type von Willebrand disease. In disorders with defects in the MYH9 gene, macrothrombocytopenias are linked to modifications in kidney, eye or ear, whereas other inherited thrombocytopenias variously link a low platelet count with a propensity to leukemia, skeletal defects, learning impairment, and abnormal red cells. Defects of secretion from platelets include an abnormal alpha-granule formation as in the gray platelet syndrome (with marrow myelofibrosis), and of organelle biogenesis in the Hermansky-Pudlak and Chediak-Higashi syndromes where platelet dense body defects are linked to abnormalities of other lysosomal-like organelles including melanosomes. Finally, defects involving surface receptors (P2Y(12), TPalpha) for activating stimuli, of proteins essential for signaling pathways (including Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), and of platelet-derived procoagulant activity (Scott syndrome) show how studies on platelet disorders are helping unravel the pathways of primary hemostasis.

### Identification of platelet function defects by multi-parameter assessment of thrombus formation [^4edc3dd3]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Also investigated was blood from a patient with grey platelet syndrome, phenotyped with a partial deficiency in platelet α-granules. The thrombi formed were reduced in most parameters, with the exception of procoagulant activity, typically on type III-inducing surfaces, that is, vWF/rhodocytin, vWF/GFOGER-(GPO)ⁿ and collagen I (Fig. 8d). P-selectin expression was markedly reduced on all surfaces, as expected. Overall, these results may point to impaired thrombus formation due to the reduced α-granule release, in particular on surfaces activating via CLEC-2 or GPVI. Furthermore, testing the blood from a patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia (deficiency in α IIb β 3) resulted in a significant reduction in platelet aggregation tendency (morphological score, integrated feature size and/or fibrinogen binding) on most surfaces, thus substantiating α IIb β 3 as being invariably implicated in platelet–platelet interactions. Platelet activation parameters (P-selectin expression, platelet deposition) were most prominently reduced on vWF/fibrinogen surface. A final blood sample was used from a patient with Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome, characterized by absence of dense granules. In this case, parameters of thrombus formation decreased with vWF/vitronectin, vWF/rhodocytin, vWF/GFOGER-(GPO)ⁿ and collagen I. Thrombus formation hence diminished on surfaces binding GPIb plus α v β 3, CLEC-2 or GPVI. For all patients together, thrombus formation was mostly altered on vWF-containing surfaces with rhodocytin, GFOGER-(GPO)ⁿ or collagen-I; the most affected parameters were morphological score, integrated feature size and fibrinogen binding.

The causative genes are grouped according to the nature of the encoded protein and/or the secondary condition(s) that may accompany the macrothrombocytopenia. MTP: macrothrombocytopenias; BSS: Bernard-Soulier syndrome; pl-type VWD: platelet-type von Willebrand syndrome; VWD2B: von Willebrand disease type 2B; GPS: gray platelet syndrome.

In megakaryocytes, the role of apoptosis during proplatelet formation and platelet biogenesis is controversial and largely unproven although it may intervene after platelet release or during stress situations such as infections and inflammation. In a classic paper, the pro-survival protein, Bcl-X L, was proposed to constrain the pro-death Bak in platelets; the balance acting as a molecular clock for platelet survival. Others have shown how apoptotic pathways and necrosis engage pro-death proteins triggering mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome C release and caspase activation leading to Ca²⁺ -dependent exposure of phosphatidylserine, which is not only recognized by phagocytic cells but also leads to procoagulant activity.

The following sections of this review will describe familial defects of platelet production and megakaryopoiesis; affected genes will be shown to interfere with HSC proliferation, megakaryocyte maturation and migration and the alteration of platelet lifespan. Many are accompanied by an increased platelet size (Figure 2) while others have a normal platelet size or even small platelets (Figure 3). Platelet function is variably affected. While some thrombocytopenias are isolated, many are syndromic and/or associated with other conditions that may be of major clinical importance. Bleeding is mostly mucocutaneous, severe in some disorders, but infrequent or even absent in others, particularly when the decrease in platelet count is modest. A summary of the genes involved and the principle characteristics of each disorder are presented in Online Supplementary Table S1.

### Multimerin 1 supports platelet function in vivo and binds to specific GPAGPOGPX motifs in fibrillar collagens that enhance platelet adhesion [^892b0978]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Collagens are ubiquitous proteins that represent ~30% of total protein mass in mammals, 68 with about 90% of collagens estimated to be type I fibrillar collagen. 69 Injuries that sever or rupture a vessel would expose blood to the collagen‐rich outer layers of the vessel wall and extravascular connective tissues where Mmrn1 binding to GPAGPOGPX motifs may be very relevant to platelet adhesion. Disease‐causing mutations that impair MMRN1–collagen binding might affect platelet adhesion. While no pathogenic MMRN1 mutations are reported, G845R and G848R mutations in the GPAGPOGPI motif are associated with type II (perinatal lethal) osteogenesis imperfecta and a G852C mutation in GPAGPOGPQ is associated with type IV (vascular type) Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome, which causes hematomas, hemothorax, and vessel rupture. 70, 71 Many mucocutaneous bleeding disorders remain uncharacterized and MMRN1 defects might go undetected by current bleeding disorder investigations. An assessment of platelet adhesion to collagen, and to combinations of CRP, GPAGPOGPX, and GFOGER peptides, could help identify cases of MMRN1 deficiency, but this would be a time‐ and resource‐intensive undertaking. Nonetheless, platelet MMRN1 deficiency might account for some platelet function abnormalities noted in gray platelet syndrome, Quebec platelet disorder, and αδ‐storage pool deficiency.

In summary, our study provides direct evidence that Mmrn1 contributes to platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in vivo, supports platelet adhesion and aggregate formation onto a variety of protein surfaces, and contributes to platelet adhesion to collagen through its interactions with Mmrn1‐specific GPAGPOGPX motifs in vessel wall fibrillar collagens.

### Super-resolution microscopy as a potential approach to diagnosis of platelet granule disorders [^3d2c72c4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Current LTA methods are not specific for dense‐granule disorders and provide no information about platelet structure. A whole‐mount EM approach to analyze platelets is also limited to the visualization of dense granules and thus alpha granule disorders, such as Gray platelet syndrome, cannot be identified by this method; transmission EM of thin sections of fixed embedded platelets 30 can be used to visualize alpha granules but sample preparation to achieve this is even more time consuming and requires highly skilled technicians, and is therefore not practical to routinely implement in a clinical context.

For routine diagnostic purposes it could be argued that it is counter‐productive to categorize granules as alpha and dense granules, as there is no efficient technique to analyze both within a large number of platelets. Alpha and dense granules are distinct but many markers that are claimed to label alpha granules and dense granules do not share the same structures when analyzed by immunofluorescence. For example, Kamykowski et al. report that 15 different markers for alpha granules fail to show any significant co‐clustering 31. Whether a large super‐resolution morphometric dataset collected over time from many patients would reveal marker clustering associated with different diseases will therefore be of significant interest.

In 2013 it was reported that 76% of patients with HPS were initially misdiagnosed and 28% of patients had to see four to six specialists before receiving the correct diagnosis 32. Thus improvements to speed, accuracy and sensitivity would be welcome.

The procedure presented here provides a quantitative automated unbiased methodology, which can be further extended by the addition of other marker‐specific immunoprobes to simultaneously quantify other platelet structures such as α‐granules, and can also measure parameters such as the size and shape of organelles, and novel parameters that arise, such as the fraction of any membrane protein on the platelet surface, can also be extracted from the morphometric datasets to provide other or compound diagnostics. Finally, analysts would also be able to mine an increasing collection of standardized morphometric data to reveal new disease phenotypes, as well as combinations of markers that would improve future diagnosis.

Upstream regulators, predicted from the dataset using IPA, were then compared between the XLTT and GPS datasets. All proteins with FC ≥ ± 1.2 (compared to the respective controls regardless of statistical significance) were included. The upstream regulators with predicted inhibition and activation, respectively (Z-score ≥ ± 2.0; P < 0.05), in XLTT and GPS are presented in Figure 3. RPTOR independent companion of mTOR complex 2 (aka RICTOR) showed the strongest predicted altered activity in XLTT, with its inhibition predicted mainly by elevated expression of downstream proteasome proteins (Online Supplementary Figure S5A) participating in the protein ubiquitination pathway. In GPS, the X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1, which responds to unfolded protein increases) had the highest absolute Z-score (activated with Z-score 4.02) among upstream regulators (Figure 3; Online Supplementary Figure S5B). VIPAS39, a protein that regulates platelet granule biogenesis, had predicted inhibited activity in both XLTT and GPS (Figure 3; Online Supplementary Figure S5A and B).

Analysis of possible protein−protein interaction network using STRING tool. The list of 83 differentially expressed proteins in X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT) platelets was subjected to STRING analysis, which found significantly more associations between proteins than would have occurred by chance (P = 7.85e-12). Three clusters detected by k-means algorithm were colored as follows: cluster 1, 60 proteins, red (those of the 83 proteins of Table 2 and 3 not included in cluster 2 and 3); cluster 2, 15 proteins, green; cluster 3, eight proteins, cyan. The top three gene ontology (GO) enrichment terms regarding Biological Process given in STRING were for cluster 1: regulated exocytosis, vesicle-mediated transport, and secretion; for cluster 2: platelet degranulation, regulated exocytosis, and vesicle-mediated transport; for cluster 3: protein modification by small protein removal, cellular macromolecular catabolic process, and protein deubiquitination.

### The RNA-binding protein SRSF3 has an essential role in megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production [^c522fc8e]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The phenotype of the Pf4-Srsf3 Δ/Δ mice resembles human macrothrombocytopenias (Table 2). For example, we identified Nbeal2, causative of Gray platelet syndrome, as a direct SRSF3 RNA target. Nbeal2 was among the RNAs that were not properly induced from 8N to ≥ 16N MK following SRSF3 depletion. The Pf4-Srsf3 Δ/Δ mice shared some features with Nbeal2 loss-of-function models, including macrothrombocytopenia, reduction in platelet granule density, and increased emperipolesis associated with platelet pathologies and hematopoietic stress. Thus, the Pf4-Srsf3 Δ/Δ mouse model may provide a tool to understand platelet disorders, in particular the role of posttranscriptional gene regulation in platelet diseases. Albeit the SRSF3 depletion was limited to MKs, Pf4-Srsf3 Δ/Δ mice displayed changes in peripheral blood and bone marrow hematopoietic cell counts, suggesting that the MK maturation defect in Pf4-Srsf3 Δ/Δ mice may affect hematopoiesis more broadly in line with the previously identified functional relationship between MKs and hematopoietic stem cells.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates how the RNA binding protein SRSF3 governs a MK maturation program that further guides the deposition of RNA into platelets, thus providing key insights into the role of posttranscriptional gene regulation during thrombopoiesis.

### Platelet proteome and function in X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia andcomparisons with gray platelet syndrome [^fba495da]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Transmission electron microscopy

TEM of platelets from three males with XLTT, representing both families, showed the presence of abnormally large platelets and deficiencies in the numbers and contents of a-granules compared to controls investigated in parallel (Figure 1A to I). Empty looking vacuoles were abundant, probably representing "ghost a-granules". The dense tubular system and open canalicular system were well represented. Dense granules were not observed in XLTT but were found in platelets from healthy controls, although whole mounts were not used. Thus, we corroborated previous reports of a-granule, and one report of dense granuledeficiencies in XLTT, with probable significance for the bleeding diathesis. Overall, the ultrastructural alterations in XLTT platelets were largely similar to those described in an earlier patient.

### Pathogenetic and clinical study of a patient with thrombocytopenia due to the p.E527K gain-of-function variant of SRC [^69bf885c]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Concerning the clinical aspects, this case demonstrates that the disorder deriving from SRC mutation can present as isolated, non-syndromic thrombocytopenia. Of note, the only feature common to all the reported patients is platelet anisocytosis and macrocytosis with a proportion of hypo- or agranular platelets (Online Supplementary Table S4). The other inherited thrombocytopenias that can present with this picture are thrombocytopenia due to GFI1B mutations and gray platelet syndrome due to NBEAL2 variants, although in the latter the a-granule defect is usually more pronounced. Therefore, these disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis. A defective aggregation or activation response to collagen, albeit of varying degrees, was observed in most reported patients: this finding too could be considered a feature of the disorder. Similar to other cases, our patient presented a bleeding tendency more severe than expected based on the platelet count: the a-granule deficiency and the impaired response to collagen could explain the excessive bleeding. Finally, the moderate thrombocytopenia observed at diagnosis evolved during childhood toward a picture characterized by transfusion-dependent anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and trilineage BM dysplasia with significant fibrosis. The disorder can therefore be rapidly progressive, underlining the importance of recognizing SRC -related thrombocytopenia among the other forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. In conclusion, the investigation of this patient provides novel information on the pathogenetic and clinical features of SRC -related thrombocytopenia and on the functions of SRC in human Mk.

Analysis of upstream regulators in X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia and gray platelet syndrome. Comparison of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) core analyses of X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT) and gray platelet syndrome (GPS), where fold change (FC) ≥ ± 1.2 compared to controls was used as the only criterion for inclusion of dysregulated proteins. The upstream regulators are sorted by ascending Z-scores in XLTT. The results are filtered to show genes, mRNA and proteins with upstream regulator Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P < 0.05 and absolute Z-score ≥ ± 2. However, when present as a result of comparison with the other group, predicted regulators with Z-score < ± 2 are marked by dots in the heatmap. Several known/suggested fibrosis regulators including RICTOR, SMAD2, CTGF, TGFB1, FLI1, ERK1/2, PI3K, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 were predicted to be inhibited in XLTT, and less so or activated in GPS. Contrarily, EGFR and PDGFDD (also involved in fibrosis) were predicted to be activated in XLTT. NBEAL2 (mutated in GPS) showed predicted inhibited activity in XLTT. GATA1 (mutated in XLTT) was predicted to be activated in GPS. IL1, OSM, VIPAS39, RICTOR, HIF1A and F2 were significant predicted inhibited upstream regulators (Z-score ≤ -2) in XLTT when only the 83 proteins with FC ≥ ± 1.2 and q < 0.05 were included for the underlying core analysis; no upstream regulator was then predicted to be activated with Z-score ≥ 2 (not shown).

When BM biopsies from controls and XLTT patients were stained for solute carrier family 35 member D3 (SLC35D3), the second most downregulated protein (FC = -3.40), important for dense granule formation, we found a greater than 50% reduction in median megakaryocyte cytoplasmic H-score in XLTT compared to controls (P = 0.006) (Figure 4B).

Introduction

Platelets play a critical role in hemostasis and contain secretory granules that are essential to maintain their normal function. Of the three types of granules (dense, α and lysosomes), α-granules are the most abundant type that store essential proteins for platelet adhesion and blood coagulation. Platelets are shed into the blood stream after the formation of long cytoplasmic extensions from differentiated megakaryocytes (MKs), a process called proplatelet formation. The α-granules are formed in the early MKs and are actively transported along microtubules from the MK cell body towards the proplatelets. In circulating platelets, these α-granules mature further and proteins will be actively or passively taken up from the plasma by receptor-mediated endocytosis, in addition to the proteins loaded in these granules during their biosynthesis in the MK. Recently, it has become clear that α-granule proteins play important roles in nonhemostatic events, such as wound healing, cancer, inflammation and innate immunity.

Gray platelet syndrome (GPS, MIM139090) is a rare inherited platelet disorder characterized by mild to moderate bleeding, macrothrombocytopenia and markedly reduced or absent α-granules that typically results in a grayish appearance of platelets under a light microscope. Using three independent next-generation sequencing approaches, recessive mutations in NBEAL2 were found to cause GPS. – NBEAL2 encodes a 2.754 amino acid polypeptide, neurobeachin-like-2, that contains BEACH (named after Beige and Chediak-Higashi), ARM (Armadillo), Con A-like lectin (Concanavalin A-like lectin domain), PH (Pleckstrin Homology-domain like) and WD40 domains. The exact role of BEACH domain-containing proteins remains largely unknown, but they are generally large proteins that are able to control diverse cellular mechanisms such as vesicular transport, apoptosis, membrane dynamics and receptor signaling. Interestingly, LYST and NBEA, two other BEACH domain-containing proteins, have been shown to be implicated in platelet dense granule defects. – Regarding these proteins, their exact contribution in granule formation and trafficking during MK and platelet formation also remains unknown.

### Sorting nexin 24 is required for α-granule biogenesis and cargo delivery in megakaryocytes [^c6f0f3e8]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies in patients with inherited defects that cause deficiencies in α-granule cargo and number have yielded valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying platelet granule biogenesis. Thus, defects in the genes encoding the VPS33B-VPS16B complex, and the BEACH-domain containing NBEAL2, have been shown to underlie the absence of α-granules in arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome and in gray platelet syndrome, respectively. Loss of VPS33B results in the absence of α-granules, decreased levels of α-granule cargo and a reduction in MVB. Likewise, loss of VPS16B results in reduced or undetectable α-granule proteins as well as a complete absence of α-granules in platelets. The VPS33B/16B complex localizes on endosomes and promotes protein trafficking between MVB and α-gran-ules. Megakaryocytes deficient in NBEAL2 show a loss of α-granules and a reduction in α-granule cargo proteins such as VWF but retain some CD62Pand Sec22b was recently identified as an interaction partner of NBEAL2, which facilitates α-granule cargo stability and granule development.

Our TEM observations indicated an α-granule defect in SNX24 KO cells, which led us to assess whether SNX24 was distributed within α-granules and intermediate compartments. We have shown that SNX24 is co-localized with CD62P in α-granules during megakaryopoiesis. Vesicles carrying α-granule cargo bud off from either the trans -Golgi network or plasma membrane and are subsequently directed to MVB via endosomes. We show that SNX24 is co-localized with the early endosome marker EEA1 around the cell periphery, and partially associated with Rab7 + MVB. This suggests that SNX24 traffics between, or binds to α-granule components during their maturation. Likewise, known α-granule machinery such as VPS16B and VPS33B traffic between late endosomes and α-granules. We observed that loss of SNX24 leads to a reduction in expression of α-granule cargo including VWF and CD62P. P-selectin is a membrane protein that contains a signal peptide to direct it towards a developing granule.VWF is a soluble protein that self-assembles into large aggregates and eventually forms tubular structures within α-granules. The differences in expression of VWF and CD62P seen in SNX24 KO cells could reflect differential packaging or vesicle transport to distinct sub-compartments within α-granules.

### Neutrophil transit time and localization within the megakaryocyte define morphologically distinct forms of emperipolesis [^3299a7e5]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Megakaryocytes (MKs) are the largest cells in the bone marrow (50–100 µm) and constitute ∼0.05% of marrow cells.MKs produce platelets by extending long protrusions called proplatelets into sinusoids where shear stress causes platelet release into the circulation. This ability to generate platelets has been extensively studied. Recent observations have begun to suggest that MKs also have important immune functions.MKs express Toll-like receptorsand other immune receptorsand produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Early MK progenitors express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. Mature MKs cross-present antigens to CD8 + T cells via MHC Ito CD4 + T cells via MHC IIand exhibit antiviral potency. In COVID-19 patients, the percentage of MKs in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction is increased, and a hyperinflammatory MK subset, enriched in critically ill individuals, may contribute to systemic inflammation. Thus, the functional portfolio of MKs extends considerably beyond platelet production.

One intriguing functional specialization of MKs is to interact directly with leukocytes, predominantly neutrophils, in a cell-in-cell interaction termed emperipolesis (EP). Derived from the Greek for "inside round about wandering", EP was first described in 1956 by Humble et al. Passage through MKs occurs without apparent harm to either cell. Efficient neutrophil EP requires active cytoskeletal rearrangement by both the host MK and the transiting neutrophil. These features distinguish EP from cell-in-cell interactions such as phagocytosis or entosis in which the engulfed cell remains passive and is typically digested. Under physiological conditions, conventional paraffin sections identify EP in approximately 2% to 5% of MKs in healthy mice. This frequency can more than double with systemic inflammation, chronic blood loss, myelofibrosis, myeloproliferative diseases, and gray platelet syndrome.

### Romiplostim (Nplate) [^f32c8a21]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For Pediatric Patients with ITP

The initial dose of Nplate is 1 mcg/kg. Actual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when calculating initial dose. In pediatric patients, future dose adjustments are based on changes in platelet counts and changes in body weight. Reassessment of body weight is recommended every 12 weeks.

Adjust the weekly dose of Nplate by increments of 1 mcg/kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding; do not exceed a maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a pediatric placebo-controlled clinical study, the median of the most frequent dose of Nplate received by patients during weeks 17 through 24 was 5.5 mcg/kg.

Adjust the dose as follows for pediatric patients:

If the platelet count is < 50 × 10⁹/L, increase the dose by 1 mcg/kg.
If platelet count is > 200 × 10⁹/L and ≤ 400 × 10⁹/L for 2 consecutive weeks, reduce the dose by 1 mcg/kg.
If platelet count is > 400 × 10⁹/L, do not dose. Continue to assess the platelet count weekly. After the platelet count has fallen to < 200 × 10⁹/L, resume Nplate at a dose reduced by 1 mcg/kg.

2.2 Patients with Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome

For Adult and Pediatric Patients (including term neonates)

The recommended dose of Nplate is 10 mcg/kg administered once as a subcutaneous injection. Administer the dose as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation levels greater than 2 gray (Gy).

Administer Nplate regardless of whether a complete blood count (CBC) can be obtained. Estimate a patient's absorbed whole body radiation dose (i.e., level of radiation exposure) based on information from public health authorities, biodosimetry if available, or clinical findings such as time to onset of vomiting or lymphocyte depletion kinetics.

### What to do when you suspect an inherited platelet disorder [^d1d14542]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

Inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) comprise a heterogenous group of diseases that include defects in platelet function and disordered megakaryopoiesis. Some IPDs overlap as both defects in function and thrombopoiesis, resulting in both altered aggregation and/or secretion and thrombocytopenia. This review examines the key features of the presentation of IPDs in children and adults and presents a diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of these patients. In addition, recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of platelet disorders are addressed, with attention given to some of the novel genetic associations. Finally, treatment options and future therapies are briefly discussed.

### Thrombocytopenia, renal failure and hearing loss in a young patient:-related disorder [^041e1660]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

One of the most common causes of thrombocytopenia is ITP, which was considered in this patient. Although giant platelets are a feature of ITP, their percentage usually does not exceed 10%, whereas, in MYH9 -RD, giant platelets constitute more than 40% of the total platelets. The presence of neutrophilic inclusions on the smear, renal failure and hearing loss favoured a diagnosis of MYH9 -RD. Another diagnosis to consider in young patients with nephritis and hearing loss is Alport syndrome; however, the platelet count is usually unaffected in Alport syndrome, thus excluding this diagnosis in our case.

Grey platelet syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder, can present with macrothrombocytopenia. However, patients with grey platelet syndrome usually have bleeding diathesis and splenomegaly. Their peripheral blood smear shows grey platelets. Our patient did not have these clinical features. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uraemic syndrome were part of the differential diagnosis because of the presence of thrombocytopenia and renal failure; however, these were excluded due to the absence of fragmented red blood cells on the smear and the lack of microangiopathic haemolysis.

Autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, can cause thrombocytopenia and nephritis; however, ANA and ANCA testing were negative in this patient.

### Cell surface platelet tissue factor expression: regulation by P2Yand link to residual platelet reactivity [^196861ec]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2023). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, unlike the regulation of platelet adhesion and aggregation, the 2 P2Y receptors are differently involved in the prothrombotic activity of platelets. Indeed, inhibition of P2Y 12 only, and not of P2Y 1, significantly reduces phosphatidylserine exposure. Whether this occurs also for platelet-associated TF is currently unknown. Since previous studies showing that TF is localized both in α-granules and in the open canalicular system (OCS) of resting platelets, it can be hypothesized that both P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 receptors regulate TF expression similarly to the α-granule–stored P-selectin. To date, however, this evidence is lacking.

Based on this rationale, the aim of the study was to assess the involvement of P2Y 1 and P2Y 12 receptors in ADP-induced TF expression on the platelet surface. For this purpose, we also took advantage of the analysis of platelets from a P2Y 12 -deficient patient.

Since our data showed the unique involvement of P2Y 12 in platelet-associated TF expression, 2 additional aims were pursued in this study. First, we assessed in vivo TF by P2Y 12 antagonists in platelets of patients with CAD, establishing the relationship, if any, between TF expression and the residual platelet reactivity, a condition known to be significantly associated with recurrent cardiovascular events. Second, we reanalyzed the cytoplasmic localization of TF to shed light on how a protein reported to be stored both in the α-granules and in OCS could be regulated by P2Y 12 only. This was accomplished by means of a pharmacological approach using cytoskeleton blockers such as cytochalasin D and colchicine and taking advantage from analysis of platelets from patients with gray platelet syndrome (GPS). TF intracellular localization was finally evaluated by immune gold transmission electron microscopy.

The most upregulated protein of our study, CA2 (FC = 2.91, q = 0.0006), was one of 26 dysregulated proteins included in the "response to stress" gene ontology found significantly enriched in STRING analysis (not shown).CA2 participates in several biological processes, including regulations of ion transport and cytosol acidity. CA2 was recently found to predict aspirin resistance in platelet aggregation tests with arachidonic acid. Elevated expression of CA2 mRNA was found in Down syndrome-associated acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL-DS), which harbors GATA1 exon 2 mutations, compared to other AMKL (NCBI GEO2 Accession: GSE4119).

A recent investigation based on patients with GPS (NBEAL2 mutations) and the GATA1 mutations p.D218G and p.D218Y suggested that GATA1 enhances NBEAL2 expression via interaction with the GATA1 co-activator friend of GATA1 (FOG1), possibly explaining the agranule deficiency in the GATA1 mutated patients. However, GATA1 interaction with FOG1 should not be affected in XLTT due to the different mutation localization of p.R216Q which does not alter the FOG1 binding site. In addition, NBEAL2 protein expression was not altered in XLTT platelets in our study. Thus, the mechanisms for the platelet defects in XLTT must be investigated and evaluated on their own terms.

Autoimmune manifestations in patients with NBEAL2 deficiency

We studied 11 patients with GPS (out of a cohort of 13) from nine unrelated families (Supplementary Fig. 1A); all carried recessive NBEAL2 mutations (Table 1), which variously affected several domains (Fig. 1a). Most of the patients have previously been reported in other studies, as stated in Supplementary table 1. Very low levels of NBEAL2 protein (P3, P4.1) or the absence of NBEAL2 protein were observed in lysates prepared from the patients' activated T cells, thus confirming the harmful impact of the recessive NBEAL2 mutations (Fig. 1b).

All patients exhibited a bleeding tendency (epistaxis and bruising) and grey platelets lacking α-granules on blood smears. Splenomegaly was noted in four patients (Table 1). One patient (P3) had several episodes of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation (> 3 log), without macrophage activation syndrome, that were finally controlled after four courses of anti-CD20 therapy. After B cell recovery, a mild hypogammaglobulinemia (6 mg/dl) persisted without related infection. One patient (P4.2) underwent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to bone marrow fibrosis. Bone marrow biopsies were performed in five patients and myelofibrosis was diagnosed in 4 (Table 1).

### The role of platelets and ε-aminocaproic acid in arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome associated hemorrhage [^8ba7094f]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis (ARC) syndrome is a rare disorder associated with platelet abnormalities resembling gray platelet syndrome. Affected patients have normal platelet numbers but abnormal morphology and function. Bleeding symptomatology ranges from postprocedural to spontaneous life-threatening hemorrhage. We report a patient with ARC syndrome and compound heterozygous mutations in VPS33B (vacuolar protein sorting 33B) who presented with significant bleeding requiring numerous admissions and transfusions. She was treated with prophylactic platelet transfusions and ε-aminocaproic acid. This was well-tolerated and significantly decreased transfusion requirements and admissions for bleeding. Our experience provides support for consideration of prophylactic measures in these patients as well as the possibility of using prophylaxis in related disorders.

### The endoplasmic reticulum protein SEC22B interacts with NBEAL2 and is required for megakaryocyte α-granule biogenesis [^8f57eeeb]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Studies of inherited platelet disorders have provided many insights into platelet development and function. Loss of function of neurobeachin-like 2 (NBEAL2) causes gray platelet syndrome (GPS), where the absence of platelet α-granules indicates NBEAL2 is required for their production by precursor megakaryocytes. The endoplasmic reticulum is a dynamic network that interacts with numerous intracellular vesicles and organelles and plays key roles in their development. The megakaryocyte endoplasmic reticulum is extensive, and in this study we investigated its role in the biogenesis of α-granules by focusing on the membrane-resident trafficking protein SEC22B. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments using tagged proteins expressed in human HEK293 and megakaryocytic immortalized megakaryocyte progenitor (imMKCL) cells established binding of NBEAL2 with SEC22B, and demonstrated that NBEAL2 can simultaneously bind SEC22B and P-selectin. NBEAL2-SEC22B binding was also observed for endogenous proteins in human megakaryocytes using co-IP, and immunofluorescence microscopy detected substantial overlap. SEC22B binding was localized to a region of NBEAL2 spanning amino acids 1798 to 1903, where 2 GPS-associated missense variants have been reported: E1833K and R1839C. NBEAL2 containing either variant did not bind SEC22B coexpressed in HEK293 cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of SEC22B in imMKCL cells resulted in decreased NBEAL2, but not vice versa. Loss of either SEC22B or NBEAL2 expression resulted in failure of α-granule production and reduced granule proteins in imMKCL cells. We conclude that SEC22B is required for α-granule biogenesis in megakaryocytes, and that interactions with SEC22B and P-selectin facilitate the essential role of NBEAL2 in granule development and cargo stability.

### Platelet proteome and function in X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia andcomparisons with gray platelet syndrome [^c72a39ef]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

The platelet QMS revealed significant (FC ≥ ± 1.2, q < 0.05) reductions of 39 proteins associated with granules. These included SERPINE1/PAI-1, vWF, SELP/Pselectin and PTGS1/COX1 which are all important for hemostasis (Table 2). Latent transforming growth factor bbinding protein 1 (LTBP1), the fourth most downregulated protein and found in a-granules, has not previously been associated with bleeding diathesis, but its interactions with transforming growth factor b (TGFB), found in platelets in high concentrations, might be of significance for BM fibrosis development. This has also been discussed for GPS. Notably, TGFB1 was identified as a predicted inhibited upstream regulator in XLTT, but appeared somewhat activated in GPS (Figure 3), with possible implications for the respective myelofibrosis developments. In XLTT, both the present study (Figure 3 and LTBP1) and our former IHC investigation on BM expression of CTGF and VEGFshowed low TGFB stimulated protein expressions in XLTT megakaryocytes/platelets.

Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) was downregulated in XLTT platelets, and downregulated also in GPS. THBS1 is a matricellular glycoprotein first discovered in activated platelets. It interacts with a number of ligands and is of significance for, inter alia, inhibition of angiogenesis:XLTT BM fibrosis is characterized by increased angiogenesis. Though the exact role of THBS1 in hemostasis is unclear, it may interact with coagulation factor 13/F13A1 41 which was also found in reduced amounts in the XLTT and GPS platelet proteomes.

The identification of several jointly downregulated agranule proteins in XLTT and GPS is congruent with ultrastructural similarities regarding deficiencies of agranules. However, NBEAL2 mutated GPS platelets have shown normal morphology and numbers of dense bodies/ granules, whereas our XLTT results suggested ultrastructural and functional dense granule deficiency, consistent with an earlier ultrastructural study. Possible proteomic correlates to a suggested functional difference between XLTT and GPS regarding dense granule release included contraregulations of the three Ca²⁺ transporting ATPases ATP2A3, ATP2A2 44 and ATP2C1, downregulated in XLTT (although q = 0.057 for ATP2C1) but upregulated in GPS (Online Supplementary Table S1). Deficient dense granule ADP release could be a consequence in XLTT (Figure 5C and D).

Mid-stack slices of the marked regions of interest (white squares) are shown below, demonstrating cortical redistribution of actin isoforms in patient thrombocytes; b Mid-stack slices show strong cortical recruitment of NM-2A and α-actinin 1, and a moderate cortical enrichment of Filamin A in patient platelets; c Representative images demonstrate the highly disordered nature of β-tubulin in patient-derived platelets compared to those from a healthy control. 3–6 images (total of 20–60 platelets) were assessed for each protein of interest. All scale bars represent 2 µm

A fine balance between actin and microtubule cytoskeletal forces is pivotal for regulating platelet size during maturation and following activation. In healthy resting platelets, a band of microtubules localizes at the platelets cortex, maintaining its discoid shape. This cortical band is perturbed in diseases with giant platelets, where it is significantly thickened in the case of Gray platelet syndrome and disordered like a "ball of yarn" in Epstein's syndrome and May-Hegglin anomaly (caused by NM-2A mutations) platelets. As ACTB -AST platelets include those of enlarged size, we assessed β-tubulin localization and organization in control and patient cells. Our analysis shows microtubules in the typical cortical band in control platelets, but in a multitude of different organization patterns in patient platelets, all of which are highly disordered (Fig. 7c).

Classic inherited thrombocytopenias

We begin with a series of named inherited thrombocytopenias whose characterization has marked the history of inherited platelet disorders. In many of these syndromes, thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count < 150×10⁹ /L, is accompanied by platelet function defects that aggravate bleeding. In early studies genotyping mostly involved candidate gene sequencing and linkage studies.

### Altered platelet-megakaryocyte endocytosis and trafficking of albumin and fibrinogen in RUNX1 haplodeficiency [^4aec6049]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Endocytosis is the mechanism by which proteins, not synthesized by MK, are incorporated into α-granules. Platelet albumin, fibrinogen, and IgG were observed to be decreased in our patient(and Figure 1). We provide the first evidence that platelet endocytosis is defective in our patients (Figure 1), constituting 1 explanation. In addition, we provide evidence that RUNX1- deficient HEL cells and primary MK have increased endocytosis but defective trafficking of albumin and fibrinogen, by distinct mechanisms, leading to decreased levels. Multiple pathways drive endocytosis, mediated by clathrin, Cav1, and Flot1, and others. Cav1 and Flot1, but not clathrin, were increased in RUNX1 -deficient HEL cells (Figure 2 B) and MK (Figure 7 C). CAV1 KD nearly eliminated intracellular albumin (Figure 4) and the increase in albumin uptake with RUNX1 KD (Figure 2), indicating that Cav1 regulates albumin uptake, as shown in renal podocytes. CAV1 KD did not reduce intracellular fibrinogen (Figure 5), and CAV1 KD did not abrogate the increased fibrinogen uptake on RUNX1 KD (Figure 3), indicating that distinct mechanisms mediate albumin and fibrinogen endocytosis. Flot1 may have a role in fibrinogen handling, suggested by partial inhibition noted on FLOT1 KD in RUNX1 -deficient cells (Figure 3 B). MK from induced-pluripotent stem cells from a patient with FPDMM had increased uptake of factor V, a protein not synthesized by human MK. Thus, endocytosis of multiple proteins is increased in RHD. Interestingly, in NBEAL2 -null mouse (gray platelet syndrome) MK fibrinogen uptake was normal but associated with defective retention, indicating differences from RHD.

### Molecular mechanisms of bleeding disorderassociated GFI1Bmutation and its affected pathways in megakaryocytes and platelets [^91223459]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

GFI1B Q287* iPSC-derived megakaryocytic cells further revealed significantly increased levels of the MCM complex and MEIS1. This might be relevant as the MCM complex is involved in DNA replication/cell cycle progression and, in accordance with several studies, we observed that MCM proteins are downregulated upon megakaryocyte differentiation (Online Supplementary Figure S6D). In addition, we showed earlier that forced MEIS1 expression in CD34 + cells results in larger and more colonies in colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte assays. Thus, failure of downmodulation of DNA replication-associated genes by GFI1B as a consequence of sequestration of LSD1 and associated proteins by GFI1B Q287* might contribute to increased proliferation and lack of polyploidization.

The platelets of GFI1B Q287* patients showed a major reduction in α-granule proteins, ranging from a mild < 2-fold decrease (e.g. for SPARC, fibrinogen a and β chains) to a severe > 10-fold depletion (e.g. for VEGF and P-selectin). To our surprise, NBEAL2 showed significantly increased expression in both platelets and iPSC-derived cells harboring the GFI1B Q287* mutation. Inactivating mutations in NBEAL2 cause recessive gray platelet syndrome, a bleeding disorder characterized by a severe paucity in α-granules. – Although its exact function is still unclear, NBEAL2 is thought to be required for the biogenesis and/or retention of α-granules in megakaryocytes. – Other proteins with putative roles in α-granule formation, such as VPS33Band VIPAS39, and proposed NBEAL2 interactors DOCK7, SEC16A and VAC1447 were mostly unaffected in both GFI1B Q287* platelets and iPSC-derived cells, except SEC16A and VAC14, which showed a mild (< 2-fold) decrease and increase in GFI1B Q287* platelets, respectively. Possibly, these proteins are under differential control of GFI1B. In contrast to the GFI1B Q287* platelets there was no change in α-granule proteins observed in GFI1B Q287* iPSC-derived megakaryocytic cells. This could suggest that the observed α-granule defect in primary GFI1B Q287* platelets may not be caused by defective protein expression, but possibly originates from defective transport from proteins to α-granules and/or defective trafficking of α-granules to proplatelets.

Patients' characteristics

Four hundred and twenty-three patients (age 2–91 years; median 40; IQR 23.7–54; 56% females), with 25 different forms of IPDs (16 IPFDs and 9 IPNDs) enrolled by 49 centers across 17 countries underwent a total of 829 surgical procedures. Two hundred and thirty-eight (56.3%; median age 36 years; 58% females), for a total of 455 procedures, had an IPFD and 185 (43.7%; median age 43 years; 53.5% females), for a total of 374 procedures, an IPND. Diagnosis and baseline characteristics are reported in Table 1. In order of frequency, IPFDs were GT, primary secretion defect, biallelic BSS (bBSS), δ granule deficiency, HPS, Gray platelet syndrome (GPS) and autosomal dominant GT-variant; IPNDs were, in order, MYH9 -related disorder, ANKRD26 -related thrombocytopenia, monoallelic BSS (mBSS), ACTN1 -related thrombocytopenia. Bleeding history was on average mild (WHO grade median 2, IQR 1–3), but 25% of patients had a WHO grade 3 (79.8% of which were IPFD) and 3.3% a WHO grade 4 (64.3% of which were IPFD) (Online Supplementary Figure S1). Thrombocytopenia in IPNDs was on average mild (median 68×10⁹ /L; IQR 30–81×10⁹ /L) but 50% of patients had a platelet count less than 50×10⁹ /L and 25% less than 30×10⁹ /L. The ISTH bleeding assessment tools (BAT) bleeding score was available for 143 patients (33.5%), with a median score of 3 in the overall IPD population (IQR 1–7), 6 (IQR 2–11.25) for IPFD (n = 89), and 1 (IQR 0–1) for IPND (n = 54).

### Pseudothrombocytopenia and other conditions associated with spuriously low platelet counts [^6a06df54]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that the platelet clumps in PTCP are the result of platelet aggregation, rather than platelet agglutination. The hypothesis involving platelet aggregation was based on the finding that, in EDTA-anticoagulated blood, platelets time-dependently express markers of platelet activation, such as CD62 and CD63, which are normally associated with the membranes of intracytoplasmic platelet granules and are exposed on the plasma membrane as a consequence of activation-dependent platelet degranulation. Platelet aggregation would ensue as a consequence of the action of physiological agonists (such as adenosine diphosphate, ADP), secreted by the platelet granules. However, whatever the mechanism(s) responsible for the expression of activation markers on the plasma membrane by EDTA, it must be argued that platelet aggregation cannot occur in the presence of EDTA, which inactivates and disrupts the platelet GPIIb-IIIa complex, which is essential for platelet aggregation to occur. This interpretation is corroborated by the finding that a cold agglutinin of the IgM class, which was isolated from a patient with moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count of about 100×10⁹/L), caused degranulation of normal platelets by binding to GPVI both in EDTA- and citrate-anticoagulated blood samples, but caused an in vitro decrease in platelet count at 22°C accompanied by the formation of GPIIb-IIIa- and plasma fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregates in citrate-anticoagulated, but not in EDTA-anticoagulated samples. Indeed, citrate, being a weaker Ca 2+ chelator compared to EDTA, does not disrupt GPIIb-IIIa and, for this reason, can be generally used as the in vitro anticoagulant to study platelet aggregation. Similarly, rare cases of pseudo-gray platelet syndrome or pseudo-storage pool deficiency (which mimic congenital disorders characterized by defects of platelet α-granules and/or δ-granules) have been described, which are characterized by antibody-dependent in vitro platelet degranulation of EDTA-anticoagulated samples, usually without formation of platelet clumps and development of spurious thrombocytopenia, unless the combined action of the antibody and EDTA also causes PTCP-like platelet agglutination. In contrast, it was shown that aggregates of platelets with normal granularity formed in a citrate-anticoagulated blood sample from one of the patients with EDTA-dependent pseudo-gray platelet syndrome (Figure 4). Platelet aggregates in citrate- but not in EDTA-anticoagulated blood, which possibly formed as a consequence of increased platelet activation, were observed in patients with previous episodes of arterial thrombosis. Based on the aforementioned evidence, it can be safely concluded that PTCP is caused by platelet agglutination and not by platelet aggregation. This conclusion has important implications: for instance, it implies that, in order to prevent the in vitro formation of platelet plugs causing PTCP, it is unreasonable to use anticoagulant mixtures containing substances inhibiting platelet aggregation (such as prostaglandin E 1, adenosine, dipyridamole, pyridoxal phosphate) as alternatives to EDTA (see later).

A 13-year-old boy with meningiomatosis, McCune-Albright syndrome, and gray platelet syndrome presented with an enlarging "lump" on his right forehead. A head CT scan revealed a polyostotic fibrous dysplasia involving the entire skull. A 3.4-cm right frontal osseous cavity and an overlying right forehead subcutaneous soft-tissue mass were seen, measuring 5.2 cm in diameter and 1.6 cm thick. Ultrasound of the cavity and overlying mass showed swirling of blood and an arterialized waveform. MRI revealed an en plaque meningioma underlying the cavity. An intraosseous pseudoaneurysm fed by 3 distal anterior division branches of the right middle meningeal artery (MMA) with contrast extravasation was found on angiography. Two MMA feeders were embolized with Onyx, with anterograde filling of the intraosseous cavity with Onyx. A small pocket of residual intracavity contrast filling postembolization from a smaller third MMA feeder eventually thrombosed and the forehead lump regressed.

Proteome changes in GFI1B p.Q287* platelets are not limited to α-granule protein depletion

GFI1B Q287* iPSC-derived megakaryocytic cells show phenotypes that indicate aberrant differentiation. With platelets representing the final stage of megakaryopoiesis, we asked how this is translated to the platelet proteome. To identify the deregulated proteins, platelet protein levels of four GFI1B Q287* -affected individuals were compared to those of four healthy individuals using label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. Out of 2,550 quantified proteins, 1,005 proteins were differentially expressed between normal and GFI1B Q287* platelets, with the expression of 395 proteins being reduced and that of 610 elevated in the case of the GFI1B Q287* mutation (Figure 6A, B; Online Supplementary Table S3). In line with the reported α-granule deficiency,α-granule proteins such as VWF, THBS1, and platelet factor 4, showed markedly reduced levels in GFI1B Q287* platelets (Figure 6C). Of note, NBEAL2, which is mutated and causative for the α-granule deficiency in classical gray platelet syndrome, – was not among the proteins reduced in GFI1B Q287* platelets, but was in fact mildly elevated (Online Supplementary Table S3). In addition, strongly elevated expression of CD34 was observed in GFI1B Q287* platelets, compatible with findings reported above and published reports. Other proteins enriched in GFI1B Q287* platelets were proteasomal, ribosomal, and mitochondrial proteins (Online Supplementary Figure S7; Online Supplementary Table S3). GO terms associated with downregulated proteins in GFI1B Q287* platelets were strongly related to platelet functions and α-granules, including wound healing, chemotaxis, immune response, and vesicle secretion (Figure 6D; Online Supplementary Table S2). Proteins whose levels were elevated in GFI1B Q287* platelets were particularly enriched for GO terms on mitochondrial function and the respiratory electron transport chain (Figure 6E; Online Supplementary Table S2). In addition, a multitude of other cellular processes associated with underrepresented (e.g. the Golgi and ER systems, adhesion, and the cytoskeleton) and overrepresented proteins (e.g. ubiquitination, RNA processing, hematopoietic differentiation, and several metabolic functions) were observed (Figure 6D, E; Online Supplementary Table S2). Thus, in addition to a major reduction in α-granule proteins, GFI1B Q287* platelets exhibit aberrant expression of many other proteins with various functions.

### A gain-of-function variant in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome gene is associated with a MYH9-related disease-like syndrome [^164895e4]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Platelet function assessment, including adenosine diphosphate, collagen, arachidonic acid, thrombin, and ristocetin-induced aggregation tests, were normal. The morphological analysis showed the presence of large platelets with marked anisocytosis (40% immature platelet fraction in subject III.4). Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of approximately 20% giant platelets (> 17 fL). Some platelets had a gray appearance, containing few organelles and an open canalicular system, while others were crowded with organelles (Figure 1B). A similar abnormal distribution of platelet granules has been described in a Myh9 −/− mouse model.

Loss-of-function variants in WAS have already been associated with renal disease, mainly IgA nephropathies characterized by an increase of IgA with defective glycosylation. It has been suggested that immune complex deposition and insufficient immune complex clearance may be involved in the pathophysiology of renal disease in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients. Here, we show for the first time that a gain-of-function variant can also lead to kidney impairment. The resemblance with MYH9RD could be partly explained by the fact that MYH9 and WAS gene products are both involved in actin polymerization and can be part of the same multiprotein complex together with the WASp-interacting protein. Although the protein WASp has not been reported to be expressed in the podocyte in literature, histological slides of human glomeruli stained for WASp and accessible on the human protein atlas servershow evident glomerular staining. In addition, transcripts of WASp have been reported in kidney tissues at the GTExPortal and in kidney organoids at the Single Cell Portal. The glomerular proteinuria in the present family might therefore be attributed to excessive actin polymerization in the podocyte with tip lesion FSGS.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^1a1b083a]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### Bone marrow megakaryocytic activation predicts fibrotic evolution of Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms [^b9bc05c8]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

In this study we evaluated a new morphological parameter, defined by the coexistence of emperipolesis of megakaryocytes (MK) (i.e. the presence of an intact cell within the cytoplasm of another cell), MK clustering and peri-MK fibrosis in BM biopsy, which was named megakaryocytic activation (M-ACT). Larocca et al. in 2015 demonstrated that extensive BM emperipolesis associated to BM fibrosis was present in patients affected by gray platelet syndrome, with up to 65% MK containing two of four leukocytes engulfed within the cytoplasm; a similar phenomenon has been described either in BM patients with PMF, and in the BM of animal models of myelofibrosis.

We demonstrated that M-ACT is a useful morphological parameter in forecasting both PV and early/prefibrotic PMF to myelofibrosis progression and could also help in the differential diagnosis between ET and early/prefibrotic PMF.

### What we have learned from inherited platelet disorders [^961c962a]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Identifying the molecular basis of inherited platelet disorders has contributed to our understanding of normal platelet physiology. Many of these conditions are rare, but close observation of clinical and laboratory phenotype, and subsequent identification of the abnormal protein and mutated gene, have provided us with unique opportunities to examine specific aspects of platelet biogenesis and function. Phenotype-genotype association studies are providing a detailed understanding of the structure and function of platelet membrane receptors, the biogenesis and release of platelet granules, and the assembly of the cytoskeleton. Genetic polymorphisms contributing to decreased or increased platelet adhesion and activation may translate into increased clinical risks for bleeding or thrombosis. More recently, genome wide association studies have identified new genes contributing to the variation in normal platelet function.

### Congenital platelet disorders and understanding of platelet function [^5abbedbc]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Genetic defects of platelets constitute rare diseases that include bleeding syndromes of autosomal dominant, recessive or X-linked inheritance. They affect platelet production, resulting in a low circulating platelet count and changes in platelet morphology, platelet function, or a combination of both with altered megakaryopoiesis and a defective platelet response. As a result, blood platelets fail to fulfil their haemostatic function. Most studied of the platelet function disorders are deficiencies of glycoprotein mediators of adhesion and aggregation while defects of primary receptors for stimuli include the P2Y12 ADP receptor. Studies on inherited defects of (i) secretion from storage organelles (dense granules, α-granules), (ii) the platelet cytoskeleton and (iii) the generation of pro-coagulant activity have identified genes indirectly controlling the functional response. Signalling pathway defects leading to agonist-specific modifications of platelet aggregation are the current target of exome-sequencing strategies. We now review recent advances in the molecular characterization of platelet function defects.

The major clinical and biological characteristics of the 82 patients in the study group are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3. The majority (62.2%) were female; median age was 29 (1–82) years; median bleeding score was 5 (0–23); median platelet count was 96 (4–617) ×10⁹/L. Fifty-three cases (64.6%) presented with lifelong thrombocytopenia as the main inclusion criterion and the others had laboratory abnormalities consistent with an IPFD. Forty patients (50%) had a family history of bleeding, thrombocytopenia and/or hematological malignancies. In 34 cases (41.5%), clinical background and centralized laboratory assessment supported the diagnosis of a particular type of IT or IPFD: MYH9 related disease (MYH9 -RD), n = 7; DIAPH1 related disease (DIAPH1 -RD), n = 2; BSS, n = 4; Gray platelet syndrome (GPS), n = 4; sitosterolemia (STSL), n = 1; DiGeorge syndrome, n = 1; thrombocytopenia with absent radius syndrome (TAR), n = 1; filaminopathy or filamin-related disease (FLNA -RD), n = 1; RUNX1 -related disease (RUNX1 -RD), n = 1; Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), n = 1; GT, n = 6; glycoprotein VI (GPVI) signalling defect, n = 1; HPS, n = 3; Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS = 1), n = 1. The remaining 48 patients (58.5%) either had low platelet counts (n = 30) and/or platelet function abnormalities (n = 18) of uncertain etiology (Table 2 and Table 3).

The association of thrombocytopenia and increased ischaemic events remains poorly understood. It may reflect the presence of a greater degree of comorbidities that are unmeasured. Some authors have suggested that thrombocytopenia in ACS may reflect a greater burden of atherosclerosis predisposing to heightened platelet consumption, or reflect clinically significant thrombosis, and consequently, its presence should be viewed as a marker of disease severity.

### Inherited platelet disorders [^f9343279]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding disorders due to platelet dysfunction are a common hematologic complication affecting patients, and typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding or hemorrhage. An inherited platelet disorder should be suspected in individuals with a suggestive family history and no identified secondary causes of bleeding. Genetic defects have been described at all levels of platelet activation, including receptor binding, signaling, granule release, cytoskeletal remodeling, and platelet hematopoiesis. Management of these disorders is typically supportive, with an emphasis on awareness, patient education, and anticipatory guidance to prevent future episodes of bleeding.

General

Repeated courses of chloramphenicol treatment should be avoided if at all possible. Treatment should not be continued longer than required to produce a cure with little or no risk or relapse of the disease.

Excessive blood levels may result from administration of the recommended dose to patients with impaired liver or kidney function. The dosage should be adjusted accordingly, or preferably, the blood concentration should be determined at appropriate intervals.

The use of this antibiotic, as with other antibiotics, may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If infections caused by nonsusceptible organisms appear during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Laboratory Tests

Baseline blood studies should be followed by periodic blood studies approximately every two days during therapy. The drug should be discontinued upon appearance of reticulocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia or any other blood study findings attributable to chloramphenicol. However, it should be noted that such studies do not exclude the possible later appearance of the irreversible type of bone marrow depression.

Drug Interactions

Concurrent therapy with other drugs that may cause bone marrow depression should be avoided.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

No studies have been conducted in animals or humans to evaluate the possibility of these effects with chloramphenicol.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category C –

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with chloramphenicol. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies to establish safety of this drug in pregnancy. It is not known whether chloramphenicol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Orally administered chloramphenicol has been shown to cross the placental barrier. Because of potential toxic effects on the fetus (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, "Gray Syndrome"), chloramphenicol should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers

Chloramphenicol is excreted in human milk following oral administration of the drug. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from chloramphenicol, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, "Gray Syndrome").

Pediatric Use

Precaution should be used in therapy of premature and full-term neonates and infants to avoid "gray syndrome" toxicity. Due to immature metabolic processes in the neonate and infant, excessive blood levels may result from administration of the recommended dose. The dosage should be adjusted accordingly or, preferable, the blood concentration should be determined at appropriate intervals (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, "Gray Syndrome").

See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for dosing information in the pediatric population.

### Bleeding disorders in congenital syndromes [^3d8fa288]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatricians provide a medical home for children with congenital syndromes who often need complex multidisciplinary care. There are some syndromes associated with thrombocytopenia, inherited platelet disorders, factor deficiencies, connective tissue disorders, and vascular abnormalities, which pose a real risk of bleeding in affected children associated with trauma or surgeries. The risk of bleeding is not often an obvious feature of the syndrome and not well documented in the literature. This makes it especially hard for pediatricians who may care for a handful of children with these rare congenital syndromes in their lifetime. This review provides an overview of the etiology of bleeding in the different congenital syndromes along with a concise review of the hematologic and nonhematologic clinical manifestations. It also highlights the need and timing of diagnostic evaluation to uncover the bleeding risk in these syndromes emphasizing a primary care approach.

### Sticky platelet syndrome and thrombocythemia [^45930397]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Platelets are intimately involved in the pathogenesis of thromboembolic disorders, especially arterial forms of thrombosis. Although most arterial thromboses develop on the basis of endothelial injuries, some do not. In these instances "hyperactive" platelets could be the cause. Hyperaggregable platelets have been described in association with a number of acquired disease entities whereby the cause-and-effect relationship is unclear. In contrast, the sticky platelet syndrome is a congenital, autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by hyperaggregable platelets in response to ADP, epinephrine, or both. Patients usually seek treatment for transient or permanent arterial vascular occlusions. These are often precipitated by stressful events. Treatment with low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) reverses clinical symptoms and hyperaggregability in the laboratory.

Myelodysplastic syndromes — RUNX1 familial platelet disorder: Lesions within the RUNX1 gene cause an autosomal-dominant familial platelet disorder that predisposes to myeloid malignancies; in affected families, the incidence of MDS/AML is high, ranging from 20% to 60%, with the median age of onset 33 years. The disorder is characterized by thrombocytopenia and a tendency for mild-to-moderate bleeding generally from childhood, though some individuals may not display these characteristics. Cryptic RUNX1 lesions have been reported in some patients with Fanconi anemia and MDS/AML, and identification of Fanconi anemia is clinically important because it is associated with chromosomal fragility that results in variability of disease response to HMAs.

### Inherited platelet-based bleeding disorders [^5d9e1789]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Inherited platelet-based bleeding disorders include abnormalities of platelet number and function, and are generally classified based on the abnormal functions or responses. However, a clear distinction is problematic, and in this review, the classification has been based on abnormalities of platelet components that share common characteristics. Inherited thrombocytopenias are rare, but probably underdiagnosed. They are usually classified according to both platelet size and the presence or absence of clinical features other than those deriving from the platelet defect. Hereditary disorders of platelet function can be classified as resulting from: (i) abnormalities of the platelet receptors for adhesive proteins; (ii) abnormalities of the platelet receptors for soluble agonists; (iii) abnormalities of the platelet granules; (iv) abnormalities of the signal-transduction pathways; (v) abnormalities of the membrane phospholipids; and (vi) miscellaneous abnormalities of platelet function. The literature on these disorders is reviewed, and the underlying defects discussed.
