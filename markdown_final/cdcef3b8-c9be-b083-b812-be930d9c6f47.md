## Question

## Task 1–160721

After the coming-of-age ceremony, all students in a class had their individual photos taken. Each student had enough prints made of their photo, and then each student in this class exchanged their photo with each of their classmates.

How many students in this class exchanged photos with each other if exactly 812 photographs changed hands?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many students are in a class if each student exchanges photos with every classmate and exactly 812 photographs changed hands. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about modeling the exchanges as a graph where each student is a node and each photo exchange is an edge. Then, I should verify whether the exchanges are directed or undirected and how that affects the count. Next, I will set up the equation for total photos exchanged and solve for the number of students. Finally, I should double-check that the solution is an integer and makes sense in context.

> Let me first confirm the setup. If there are n students, and each student gives a photo to every other student, then each directed exchange is one photo from one student to another, so the total number of directed edges is n times (n minus 1), which equals 812 photos exchanged. Wait, let me verify that I'm not double-counting; yes, A giving to B is distinct from B giving to A, so directed counting is correct here.

> I will now examine the equation. The total number of directed exchanges is n(n − 1) = 812. Expanding that gives n² − n − 812 = 0, which is a quadratic equation. I need to solve for n using the quadratic formula, and I should confirm that the discriminant yields a perfect square so that n is an integer, because the number of students must be a whole number.

> Let me calculate the discriminant. b² − 4ac = (−1)² − 4(1)(−812) = 1 + 3248 = 3249. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 3249 might not be a perfect square, but hold on, I should verify; 57 squared is 3249, so the square root is 57, which means the solutions will be integers. That fits the context, so I can proceed confidently.

> Next, I should review the quadratic solutions. n = [(1 ± √3249)/2] = [1 ± 57] / 2, which gives n = 58/2 = 29 or n = −56/2 = −28. Since the number of students cannot be negative, I discard −28 and conclude n = 29. Let me double-check the arithmetic: 29 times 28 equals 812, which matches the given total, so the answer is consistent.

> Final answer: There are 29 students in the class.

---

The number of students in the class is **29**. Each student exchanges photos with every other student, so each student gives and receives **n − 1** photos. The total number of photos exchanged is **n(n − 1) = 812**, which solves to **n = 29**.

---

## Mathematical formulation

Let **n** be the number of students in the class. Each student exchanges photos with every other student, so each student gives photos to **n − 1** classmates and receives photos from **n − 1** classmates. The total number of photos exchanged is the product of the number of students and the number of photos each student gives or receives:

Total photos exchanged = n × (n − 1)

Given that the total number of photos exchanged is 812, we have:

n × (n − 1) = 812

---

## Solving the equation

We need to solve the quadratic equation:

n² − n − 812 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, **n = (-b ± √(b² − 4ac))/(2a)**, where a = 1, b = −1, and c = −812:

n = [(1 ± √(1 + 3248))/2]
n = [1 ± √3249] / 2
n = [(1 ± 57)/2]

This gives two solutions: **n = 29** and **n = −28**. Since the number of students cannot be negative, we discard **n = −28**. Therefore, **n = 29**.

---

## Verification

To verify, we calculate the total number of photos exchanged with 29 students:

29 × (29 − 1) = 29 × 28 = 812

This matches the given total, confirming that the number of students is indeed **29**.

---

## Conclusion

The number of students in the class is **29**.

### Posting edited photos of the self: increasing eating disorder risk or harmless behavior? [^116j9ZD4]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Social media use has been implicated as a correlate and a cause of increased disordered eating (DE), but little is known about the impact of specific aspects of social media use, such as posting edited photos of the self. Utilizing a two-stage design, the present study sought to determine how posting edited photos relates to DE, as well as anxiety and depression symptoms, in male and female college students.

Method

Stage 1 examined concurrent associations between posting edited photos and mental health measures in 2,485 undergraduates (76% female). Stage 2 examined causal associations between posting edited photos and eating disorder (ED) risk factors in 80 undergraduates (93% female) who endorsed posting edited photos in Stage 1 and volunteered for the experimental portion of the study.

Results

In Stage 1, those who endorsed posting edited photos (n = 660; 27%) reported greater eating pathology and anxiety than those who did not, but no differences were found for depressive symptoms. In Stage 2, posting edited photos caused increased weight/shape concerns. Posting photos reinforced urges to exercise and restrict food intake and anxiety. Editing photos without posting caused an immediate decrease in weight/shape concerns and a delayed decrease in sadness.

Discussion

Results support a consistent and direct link between posting edited photos and ED risk factors, suggesting that this is not a harmless behavior. Future work should explore the cumulative effects of this link to determine how specific uses of social media contribute to clinically meaningful outcomes.

### International exchange programs in dermatology: a prescription for the present, a hope for the future [^113djB7L]. Dermatologic Clinics (2008). Low credibility.

Little has been written about the various types and availability of international exchange programs in dermatology. These opportunities comprise medical student electives, mentorships for dermatology residents, international residencies, and clinical and research fellowships. For qualified dermatologists, there are opportunities for teaching and volunteering in emerging countries and career-development visiting fellowships to academic centers and private practices to learn specific techniques or to focus on particular areas. Exchange programs in dermatology, although minimal now, soon may be accessible to most dermatologists worldwide, thereby promoting the advancement of scientific and clinical dermatologic information. The tables summarize funding sources for these exchanges.

### Peer influence via instagram: effects on brain and behavior in adolescence and young adulthood [^111JU2Qr]. Child Development (2018). Low credibility.

Mobile social media often feature the ability to "Like" content posted by others. This study examined the effect of Likes on youths' neural and behavioral responses to photographs. High school and college students (N = 61, ages 13–21) viewed theirs and others' Instagram photographs while undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Participants more often Liked photographs that appeared to have received many (vs. few) Likes. Popular photographs elicited greater activity in multiple brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a hub of the brain's reward circuitry. NAcc responsivity increased with age for high school but not college students. When viewing images depicting risk-taking (vs. nonrisky photographs), high school students, but not college students, showed decreased activation of neural regions implicated in cognitive control.

### 'She sits all day in the attitude depicted in the photo': photography and the psychiatric patient in the late nineteenth century [^116emHC3]. Medical Humanities (2017). Low credibility.

The links between mental state and art in all its various forms and media have long been of interest to historians, critics, artists, patients and doctors. Photographs of patients constitute an extensive but largely unexplored archive that can be used to recover patient experience in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The camera and the photograph became tools to communicate information about mental ill health between doctors, their patients and their colleagues. They were published in textbooks and journals, exhibited, exchanged and pasted into medical case books alongside case notes. But they were also used by patients to communicate their own experiences, identity and sense of self. This article uses published and case book photographs from c. 1885–1910 to examine the networks of communication between different stakeholders and discourses.

### Students' perspectives and concerns for the 2020 to 2021 radiation oncology interview season [^114SiDoJ]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concerns about obtaining accurate program information

Applicants research residency programs' training curricula using program website information, peer reference, and web-hosted message boards. Participants detailed the lack of accuracy of some of these resources, and they expressed concern regarding their ability to find all desired program information through a program website. Applicants also fear some questions will go unanswered that are often discussed during an in-person interview.

Recommendations:

- Focus group participants strongly rely on program websites for information; therefore, the website should be kept current and easy to navigate.
- Students reported that many details about programs may become lost in large bodies of text. They felt that short videos would be a preferred means of communicating information, with the added benefit of demonstrating program personality and culture.
- Participants suggested "more photos, more people, more personality" when looking at multiple RO program websites. Specific components of what participants want as far as website design and information are detailed in Table 3. Table 3 Elements of website
- Participants also suggested creation of a separate website portal specifically for students who were invited to interview at a program. This website would detail information about the virtual interview, provide a virtual tour of the department, and invite applicants to a virtual hangout with current residents (replacing the preinterview dinner). This site would ideally be privately hosted, with a link sent directly to applicants once interview invitations are extended.

Concern about how to best present self during rotation season (fewest comments)

Concerns about a virtual elective

Students were concerned that a visiting virtual elective would have low educational yield if previous in-person RO rotations had been completed. One student said, "There isn't anything you'd learn doing telemedicine that you wouldn't learn in person, but you could learn from conferences and opportunities to work with residents/faculty for contouring & treatment planning". Another stated a virtual elective could be "a tool for learning about a program, rather than learning clinical oncology".

Recommendations:

- To date, virtual electives in RO have focused on providing clinical RO lectures and patient encounters.
- Students pursuing RO appear to prefer fewer didactic sessions and more opportunities for active learning. Specific examples provided by the participants were contouring, beam placement, and plan review to facilitate interactions with faculty and residents.
- Programs should be aware that goals of participating in a virtual visiting elective likely include exposure to the program's culture, experiencing intentional mentoring, and possibly obtaining strong letters of recommendation for RO residency application.

### Global health educational trips: ethical, equitable, environmental? [^115cJpii]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Second, is the global health trip founded on a bilateral institutional partnership that offers equitable educational experiences for all learners involved? Bilateral exchanges based on shared models of learning empower students to become agents of change in their local contexts by broadening their perspectives on justice and equity, increasing cultural and linguistic competence and stimulating motivation to work with underserved marginalised populations. Students who have participated in these experiences may further strengthen and sustain the partnership and enhance mutual understanding of health systems and cultures between institutions. While educational trips are often a collaboration between HIC and LMIC institutions, there is rarely parity in the partnership. Illustratively, few LMIC students participate in educational trips to HIC institutions or other LMICs. Equity at the most basic level may mean equal numbers of students from each institution benefiting from the exchange, but other mechanisms should be considered to ensure that the total benefits, as perceived by both parties, are of equitable worth. This could mean that a HIC institution has the opportunity to send students to an LMIC, and that the LMIC institution receives other benefits in return, for example, educational and academic opportunities, collaborations or resources. These other forms of benefits should be agreed on based on the LMIC institution's indication of what is considered meaningful. Similarly, potentially negative consequences of educational trips must be prevented and mitigated to ensure that the partnership is bilaterally beneficial. This may include efforts to alleviate the disproportionate time investment host institutions bear due to logistic support and interruptions to clinical care when LMIC students/teachers host visiting HIC students or go on corresponding trips to HICs.

Third, is the trip complemented with efforts to eliminate barriers to ensure reciprocity? This question is important as multiple barriers often hinder LMIC stakeholders from accessing the intended bidirectional benefits of HIC partnerships. The partnership should ensure to address such barriers to reciprocity, including (1) a lack of financial resources that may limit LMIC students/faculty from going to HIC institutions, (2) potential income loss that may be experienced during the time spent away from day-to-day occupations and (3) restrictive, complex and costly visa policies that disproportionally limit LMIC affiliates from travelling abroad for educational trips, courses, research fellowships or scientific conferences. Financial, logistical and, if needed, legal support should be made available and integrated into the planning of educational trips to ensure that all students/faculty can equitably participate in the partnership.

### Taking photographs with a microscope [^112jqvMZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2008). Low credibility.

We describe a simple, economical, and highly practical technique for taking digital photographs of specimens visualized through a light microscope. Most models of light microscope and compact digital camera, and even some cameraphones, can be used. The technique is quick to learn and can easily be performed in a resource-poor setting. It can be used to assist with diagnosis in remote areas and can be extremely useful for teaching.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 5 health care abroad [^114bhXk2]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Photographs in telemedicine — advice for travelers — emphasizes capturing key lesion features, including distribution, configuration and arrangement of lesions with respect to one another, a primary lesion, and lesions with secondary changes; if several lesions are present or if the lesion is subtle, highlight the specific lesion with a marking pen or (for digital images) editing software, and take pictures in a well-lit room or outdoors in a shaded area. High-quality image set-up includes an orientation view showing the entire body or affected body part with the lesion's location obvious, a mid-distance view centered on the lesion with an anatomical landmark for orientation and size, and a close-up view that can be physically close (under 18 inches) using the camera's macro function or from farther away if using a zoom lens; ensure the lesion is in the center and fills most of the frame with some normal skin, include a scale or size comparison using a ruler, measuring tape, or a standard object like a pencil, paper clip, or US coin, and take as many pictures as necessary and send sharply focused, well-lit photos only because blurry pictures are not helpful.

### A suture-specific photo score for metopic synostosis [^111wX8vD]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We aimed to develop a photo score that can be used by experts to assess the severity of characteristic trigonocephaly features in metopic synostosis patients. Our study indicates disagreement between experts on the interpretation of specific photo score items despite consensus on the photo score itself.

Several studies have investigated photo scores to assess the esthetic outcome of metopic synostosis surgery. However, many scores are not applicable preoperatively as they assess the effect of surgical intervention on esthetic outcome and the need for reintervention or only focus on specific features of the trigonocephaly phenotype. In addition, 2 studies investigated if parents were satisfied with results from either conservative management or surgical intervention. To our knowledge, only 1 previous study used a 2D photo score that assesses true phenotypical severity of the metopic synostosis phenotype. A junior plastic surgeon and medical student scored photographs on the shape of the forehead, hypotelorism, and temporal depression on a 3-point scale. The authors report substantial to almost perfect interrater reliability on the Landis and Koch scale for each item (κ statistic ranging from 0.65 (temporal depression) to 0.89 (shape of forehead). Similarly, we found substantial agreement for the summed score. However, both the total group interrater reliability, as well as the interrater reliability of centers in which multiple surgeons participated in our study, is lower for similar individual photo score items. The difference in interrater reliability, even in a single center setting, may be explained by different rating scales. In the current study, photographs were scored on a 4-point scale. Although a 4 -4-point scale is more informative to communicate the direction of the severity of the phenotype, the elimination of the neutral middle choice likely negatively impacts the interrater reliability measures. Although some photosets were of suboptimal quality, the moderate interrater reliability reflects a true difference in the interpretation of the photo score items by experts, as a subanalysis of high-quality photos did not improve interrater reliability. These findings highlight the subjective nature of esthetic assessments, even if assessments are made by expert raters. Although a subanalysis of high-quality photosets did not improve interrater reliability, consistent, uniform photographs may facilitate easier and more uniform scoring, and standardized photograph-taking should ideally be implemented across participating centers. In addition, an educational program for participants could be implemented using data and examples from our current study.

### Hear my voice: understanding how community health workers in the Peruvian amazon expanded their roles to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through community-based participatory research [^111x3Ktj]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

After the first session, researchers posed framing questions to CHWs during discussions. This empowered participants to take ownership of the project as they developed subsequent research questions and relevant themes. Notably, both groups chose to ask questions that further explored the responsibility of the CHWs during the pandemic (table 2). The groups voted on one photo from each participant to include in the final gallery during each session.

All sessions were led by TS and ARFP in Spanish. All discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim into Spanish by university anthropology students. Data saturation was met when participants from both districts independently voted that they no longer need photo taking sessions to complete their gallery for policy-makers. Thus, researchers did not play a role in determining saturation, or completeness of photo taking.

All English translations were first done by ARFP and then edited independently by TS. Any conflicts were jointly discussed until resolution. Translations were made without overt corrections to grammar or sentence structure to maintain the voice of participants and richness of text.

Consent

Written consents and photographic releases were obtained from each participant. Participation was voluntary. All participants were compensated S/15 (US$4.02) for each meeting session they attended. Participants received reimbursement for all travel expenses, overnight lodging and three meals per day. Participants were made aware of study goals and objectives. No pseudonyms were used during meeting sessions. Participants were required to obtain written consent of any human subjects they chose to photograph over the course of the study. The photovoice methodology resulted in the empowerment of CHWs. CHWs expressed empowerment by creating a federation to advocate for CHW rights independent of this study.

### Intraoperative photography [^113bxuJE]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Intraoperative photographs are a necessity when sharing unusual pathology or details of a procedure with peers in presentations or publications. Obtaining the proper equipment and taking time to refine settings for the operative suite will typically yield excellent images. Regularly taking time out of procedures to shoot photographs can yield a formidable archive of intraoperative images that will regularly be accessed for many purposes.

### A post-flexner comparative case study of medical training responses to health system needs in Brazil and Germany [^113MpBRp]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

One way of expressing the unique position of medical students could be to admit medical students based on the representation of socially disadvantaged groups and underserved regionsrather than selecting them almost exclusively by school or academic performance. That way, critical thinking based on life experience and personal socialisation could enter the much-needed discussions of HC provision for all people. At the same time, improved representation of all groups of societies in medical schools could help shape the thinking of other, perhaps more privileged students and teachers, adding to an understanding of students' and patients' needs from various social and regional backgrounds.

The German medical students association has already proposed an addition to the student roles summarising all of the aspects mentioned above: The role of the student visionary. The visionary medical student can be described as forward-thinking, community-oriented and attentive towards change. Medical students should be involved in implementing and executing this role in the curriculum. Key questions in curricular QM should be: What has the curriculum contributed to a medical student's future role in the community? How was the student prepared for global challenges and needs?

Strengths and limitations

Comparing our curricula was rewarding in exchanging ideas and critical reflection. The postcolonial perspective helped to overcome legacies and instead focus on challenges and similarities hitherto not discussed, such as the socio-historical influence of Flexner's rarely challenged ideal. The perspective helped us maintain an awareness of potential vulnerabilities of stakeholders in central and decentral training in the setting of each nation's colonial legacy. It also led us to question our view on 'ideal' teaching quality, the depth to which it affects our daily practice, and how it shapes professional competencies.

The scope of our paper is limited to the comparison of our two cases and does not represent a comprehensive analysis of global postcolonial aspects in medical education. This seems worth exploring further in future research. Integrating personal experience in research has methodological limitations. Our own political and ethical positions influenced our perception and writing. We were mindful of the subjective nature of our discussions and emphasised reflexivity on personal experience. The analysis and presentation of the results involved challenging traditional thinking and one's own professional socialisation. The difficulties of this were mirrored in many iterations of this article. Personal contact might have eased some tension but the COVID-19 situation effectively prevented such exchange.

We want to encourage other medical educational researchers around the world to engage in such rewarding studies.

### Committee opinion no. 653: concerns regarding social media and health issues in adolescents and young adults [^1165BbBR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Digital footprint — the term "digital footprint" refers to the data left behind by users of electronic media, an ongoing record of web sites visited, pictures and videos posted, and personal information shared online that cannot be removed and can lead to long-term implications if inappropriate information is shared; adolescents and young adults need to be aware of these records because colleges and employers increasingly are looking at a candidate's digital footprint when considering applications; privacy issues including identity theft and other fraud are a growing concern because adolescents are more likely to share private information such as their full name, date of birth, and address, and adolescents can help protect themselves by keeping passwords private, not sharing personal information on any electronic media, and sharing only positive electronic media.

### Media use in school-aged children and adolescents [^116mDAjm]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Cyberbullying, sexting, and online solicitation — cyberbullying and traditional bullying overlap, although online bullying presents unique challenges, and it can lead to short- and long-term negative social, academic, and health consequences for both the perpetrator and the target. Newer studies suggest that interventions that target bullying may reduce cyberbullying. "Sexting" is commonly defined as the electronic transmission of nude or seminude images as well as sexually explicit text messages, and it is estimated that ~12% of youth aged 10 to 19 years have ever sent a sexual photo to someone else. The Internet also has created opportunities for the exploitation of children by sex offenders through social networking, chat rooms, e-mail, and online games.

### Investigation of post-trial access views among study participants and stakeholders using photovoice and semistructured interviews [^1145Az6K]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Photovoice research process.

The inception workshop took place over 3 days where participants had comprehensive training on the methods, on using the cameras and ethics of photovoice. They had the opportunity to take pictures and receive guidance. They then had 1 month to capture images within their community that illustrated their perception of life before the trial, life during the trial and life after the trial. They were given notebooks with specific prompts: (1) Who or what is in the photo? (2) When did you take it? (3) Why did you take the picture? and (4) How does it make you feel? This was later used by the participants to construct their narratives and contextualisation for each specific photograph. All photographs were developed and printed in colour during the next workshop which lasted 4 days. During this workshop, participants reviewed their pictures and shared as a group why they took the picture. We applied narrative analysis techniques to explore the photographs and frame its accompanying narration and stories, as led by the participants. The participants led the categorisation and thematic grouping of photos and discussions. Some people asked for more time to take more pictures as they felt that they had not followed the brief. This was followed by the final review and reflection day where they discussed their photographs and the researchers assisted by typing out the narration/caption of each photograph. The same methodological process using narrative analysis techniques was applied to these photos. These were displayed on a wall and participants then organised the photos thematically and by prioritisation. On this last day, participants were invited to sign a release form for their photos and videos taken. Permission for reuse of photos was obtained from all participants. Participant identifiers are not used for photos or quotations to protect the privacy of the research participants.

### PHACES (photographs of academic clinicians and their educational status): a tool to improve delivery of family-centered care [^112fi1SN]. Academic Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine if an information sheet containing photographs and explanations of the training level of medical providers could enhance a parent's ability to identify their child's providers and whether this would impact parental attitudes toward trainee involvement and patient satisfaction.

Methods

This was a prospective, mixed methods study of parent-child dyads admitted to an academic general pediatric inpatient service. The intervention group received a photo information sheet (Photographs of Academic Clinicians and Their Educational Status [PHACES] tool) consisting of passport-sized photos of the medical team along with information regarding their training. Parents were asked to name their child's providers, were surveyed about their attitudes toward trainees, participated in a brief, semistructured interview and completed the patient satisfaction questionnaire (ABIM-PSQ).

Results

Comparing intervention with control parents, 40 of 49 (82%) versus 19 of 51 (37%) were able to name at least one provider (adjusted odds ratio 8.0; P < .01). Parents who received the intervention were more likely to correctly match the face with the name of the medical student (67% vs 14%; P < .01) and attending (80% vs 24%; P < .01). Parents who received the intervention were more likely to report acceptance of the involvement of medical students and house staff as well as an improved understanding of their roles. Parents who received the intervention scored higher on the ABIM-PSQ (mean 48.3 vs 45.4; P = 0.008).

Conclusions

An information sheet containing the photographs of health care providers along with an explanation of their training improves recognition of the health care team members, improves acceptance of trainee involvement, and improves satisfaction with care delivered by physicians in training.

### Primary care interventions to prevent tobacco use in… [^115JLWti]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

USPSTF ASSESSMENT The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that primary care–relevant behavioral interventions to prevent tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents have a moderate net benefit. ASSESSMENT OF RISK In 2009, 8. 2% of middle school students and
23. 9% of high school students reported current use of any tobacco product. 3 Although younger children may be susceptible to smoking, research indicates that adolescents may be especially vulnerable to nicotine addiction. The prevalence of smoking in the United States is higher in male high school students than female students. INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT TOBACCO USE The type and intensity of effective behavioral interventions substantially varied in the evidence review, ranging from no in-person interaction with a health care professional to seven group sessions totaling more than 15 hours.

The most intensive intervention focused on universal substance abuse and problem behavior prevention for families. In this intervention, the youth and at least one parent participated in seven group and family sessions over seven weeks and received workbooks with activities to complete at home. Even minimal interventions, such as mailing materials to a youth's home, had substantial effects on reducing smoking initiation. One intervention mailed tailored newsletters addressed to the student every three weeks; another intervention sent age-related materials four times over 12 months. In a third intervention, participants were mailed five core activity guides with newsletters and tip sheets approximately every two weeks, with one booster guide at one year.

1 Many interventions had similar content, such as the participant's attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about smoking; the consequences of smoking; the influence of the social environment, including tobacco marketing; and skills to decline cigarettes. Several interventions targeted parental attitudes and beliefs about smoking and parent-child communication. INTERVENTIONS FOR TOBACCO CESSATION Evidence on the effectiveness of cessation interventions delivered in primary care settings to school-aged children and adolescents who have experimented with smoking or are regular smokers is limited. The USPSTF examined the evidence on behavioral interventions to promote smoking cessation in children and adolescents who were classified as smokers. OTHER APPROACHES TO PREVENTION AND CESSATION The Community Preventive Services Task Force has made the following four recommendations for school-aged children and adolescents. 8.

### Integration of digital imaging into emergency medicine education [^116Rba9o]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Medical education has adopted the use of digital photography and other computer technology, which has changed the face of the classroom. Today's presentations couple a computer and digital projection system to create powerful teaching tools. Integration of quality medical images enhances presentations in a way never before possible and at a much lower cost. Changes to presentations can occur rapidly, at a fraction of the cost of slides. However, obtaining quality digital images for presentations is problematic. Services are available on the Internet that offer images for sale, but the cost to obtain images is high. Many institutions of higher learning provide images on the Internet for free, but the quality, number of available images, server capacity, and issues of consent limit the availability of these images. The authors describe their experience in collecting more than 20,000 clinical photographs, and provide examples of their use in emergency medicine education.

### Adolescents' use of purpose built shade in secondary schools: cluster randomised controlled trial [^116bBscz]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Sample size and randomisation

We calculated the sample size on the basis of a sign test for comparison of matched pairs. Cohen's power tables suggested that we needed 30 matched pairs for 80% power to detect a large intervention effect (g = 0.25). Before randomisation, we revised the design and primary analysis. We considered randomisation without matching or stratification to be a better control of potential confounding, given the multiple features of study sites that might vary and the feasibility of matching schools by only a few features, and we chose an unpaired t test comparing mean change in students' use from pre-test to post-test at the school level for the primary analysis. The unmatched design increases the degrees of freedom from 29 (matched pairs design) to 58, and the comparison of means is more statistically powerful than a simple comparison of the number of schools that did or did not increase in students' usage.

Statistical methods

A preliminary analysis examined group differences in weather conditions, missing observation data, and school enrolment size. We excluded observation dates with only one of the three lunch time observations at the school recorded for a given date from further analyses. For dates with two or three lunch time observations we calculated the mean to represent students' use for the observation date. Missing observations occurred as a result of difficulties with filming or access, whole school events, and public holidays.

For both the primary and alternative study sites of each school, we aggregated observations of students' use by calculating the mean value. We did this separately for the pre-test (16 weeks of observation) and post-test (14 weeks) periods. We then calculated the difference to describe the mean change in students' use from pre-test to post-test for each school study site.

The primary analysis compared these school specific differences in students' use at the primary site between the intervention and control schools by using an unpaired t test and on an intention to treat basis. The secondary analysis included the school specific differences in students' use for both the primary and alternative study sites, resulting in two outcome measures per school. We fitted generalised estimating equations with robust standard errors to the data, allowing for an interaction between group and site. In addition, we fitted linear mixed models to the non-aggregated data to determine intra-school correlation coefficients. The statistician (KMJ) was blinded to group assignment. We used Stata version 8 for all analyses.

Collaborating with an artist/photographer and cocreating an exhibition

Participants in this part of the project met with S. Parnell Johnson and E. Whitfield individually through video-call sessions once or twice before they attended small-group workshops, depending on what felt useful and possible for them. Timings varied but were usually for around 30–60 min. Participants provided photographs before sessions, including those explored in photo-elicitation interviews, and additional photographs that spoke to "things that are important to me".

S. Parnell Johnson led these video-call sessions discussing images, experiences, and stories participants wished to convey to audiences, and exhibition work (photographic arrangements) they wanted to develop; E. Whitfield took observational fieldnotes. S. Parnell Johnson used appropriate software to display and explore images and advised on lighting and other technical considerations. This online visual method was developed by her in her work with students during the COVID lockdown. The kinetic visual element was critical, enabling her to move images around in dialogue with participants, making new groupings/arrangements/sequences that prompted different connections. Most participants used their phones or own cameras and two borrowed cameras from the project.

Next, we held four half-day workshops (three in person, one video-call group) for four or five participants each. Developed photographs and printed arrangements from initial video-calls were given to participants at the beginning of the face-to-face workshops. Photographs were sent to virtual workshop participants after the session. Participants responded to each other's photos, wrote sticky notes on their own to describe meanings, arranged photographs, and wrote accompanying text. E. Whitfield and S. Parnell Johnson continued to support participants to develop their work after the workshops through email and video-call, and in some instances for E. Whitfield to further explore their thoughts, feelings, and reflections on the images. Participants had a designated space on the exhibition display boards and were invited to display photos and text. S. Parnell Johnson collaborated with participants on how to present work creatively, suggested other types of display for some sets of photos, and laid out the designs using appropriate software, to be printed onto large boards.

### Children and adolescents and digital media [^115a2wMj]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Sexting in adolescents — definition, prevalence, and associated risks are outlined: sexting is a serious issue and is commonly defined as the electronic transmission of nude or seminude images as well as sexually explicit text messages. It is estimated that approximately 12% of youth 10 to 19 years of age have ever sent a sexual photo to someone else; many youth who have participated in sexting report having felt pressured into sending a sext. In an urban population survey, "48.5% of girls and 63.6% of boys had sent a sext, and 70% of girls and 82% of boys had received a sext", and "52% of respondents said they would be comfortable talking with their doctor about sexting". Ibarra and Mitchell "suggest that sexting is related to behaviors indicative of psychosocial challenge and risky sexual behavior for some youth", with "a higher frequency of sexting among females and lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth" and "a greater number of past-year sex partners and a greater odds of depression and substance abuse" among teenagers who sext. Their study "found that sexting was indicative of sexual activity and risky sexual behaviors", and "One study suggests that sexting may precede sexual intercourse".

### Pediatric clerkship directors' social networking use and perceptions of online professionalism [^114HyQew]. Academic Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The use of social networking sites (SNS) is increasing among all ages, with implications for medical education faculty and trainee interactions. Our objective was to understand pediatric medical educators' use of SNS and perspectives on professional boundaries and posted content.

Methods

From September through December 2010, the Council on Medical Student Education in Pediatrics conducted its annual online survey. This survey included 11 questions regarding members' own SNS use, interactions with trainees, and perceptions about online behaviors by students. In addition, 3 open-ended questions about reasons for SNS use/nonuse and interactions with trainees were included. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted with the use of logistic regression for predictors of clerkship directors' SNS use and views about behaviors. Open-ended questions were analyzed qualitatively to identify themes.

Results

Of the 65% (94/144) of clerkship directors responding to the survey, 34% (32/94) currently use SNS, 54% (51/94) never used SNS, and 12% (11/94) previously used SNS. Lack of time was the main reason for non-use. Female respondents were more likely to perceive it as never/rarely acceptable to accept students' friend requests (odds ratio = 2.96, P = 0.03). Most felt hypothetical student online behaviors were rarely/never acceptable, such as photos of students holding alcohol (68/92, 74%), using discriminatory language (89/91, 98%), and sexually explicit posts (87/90, 97%).

Conclusions

Approximately one-third of pediatric clerkship directors currently use SNS, with use less likely with increasing age. Fewer have SNS relationships with students than with residents. Perceptions of appropriateness of faculty SNS behaviors and students' postings varied. These perceptions by medical education leaders can stimulate discussion to inform consensus guidelines on professional SNS use.

### Humans learn generalizable representations through efficient coding [^111tkGWy]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The experiment consisted of two types of trials: training and testing. Each training trial comprised three screens. Following a 500 ms fixation screen, the trial presented an alien stimulus in the upper middle of the screen, along with photographs of scenes, offering one correct and one incorrect choice. Participants were instructed, "Which scene is associated with this alien?" and asked to respond by pressing the "F" or "J" key. These choices' left-right order was counterbalanced across trials. The stimulus screen remained visible for ten seconds, followed by a one-second feedback screen displaying either "Correct! You got 1 point". or "Incorrect! You got 0 point". The test stage trials were identical, except that no feedback was provided after responses. In the testing stage, the experiment was directed to the next fixation screen following the participant's response or after a maximum duration of ten seconds.

### Cosmeceuticals in the pediatric population part II: ethical dilemmas and patient talking points [^112oGVGb]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Social Media's Influence

Cosmeceutical products are extensively advertised and discussed on social media platforms, underlying their popularity in the internet‐savvy pediatric population. A survey of 1044 female consumers in the U.S. found that 83% of Gen‐Z females have bought a cosmetic or cosmeceutical product after seeing it promoted on TikTok, as compared to approximately 60% of the general female population. Beyond just the marketing of these products on social media, comparison of one's skin to other users' skin on social media also drives demand for cosmeceutical products. The rampant use of blurring or "perfecting" filters that give users the appearance of flawless, glowing skin only adds to the unattainability of skin seen on social media. Prior qualitative research of adolescent social media use has found that teens who use social media often negatively compare themselves to people that they see on social media (whose photos may be heavily edited) and also feel significant pressure to achieve "likes" on their photos. This may help explain why a study of 257 college students found that 63.6% of participants had edited a photograph to remove a skin lesion in an Instagram post. Furthermore, another study with 220 college students found that a 50% reduction in social media use was found to significantly improve body image and satisfaction with appearance, suggesting that social media can harm young people's self‐confidence. By marketing to children via social media, cosmeceutical companies take advantage of the low self‐esteem experienced by many adolescents on social media and offer them products which young consumers may be likely to purchase in the hopes of improving their physical appearance.

### Microscopic image photography techniques of the past, present, and future [^1112jWYe]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Context

The field of pathology is driven by microscopic images. Educational activities for trainees and practicing pathologists alike are conducted through exposure to images of a variety of pathologic entities in textbooks, publications, online tutorials, national and international conferences, and interdepartmental conferences. During the past century and a half, photographic technology has progressed from primitive and bulky, glass-lantern projector slides to static and/or whole slide digital-image formats that can now be transferred around the world in a matter of moments via the Internet.

Objective

To provide a historic and technologic overview of the evolution of microscopic-image photographic tools and techniques.

Data Sources

Primary historic methods of microscopic image capture were delineated through interviews conducted with senior staff members in the Emory University Department of Pathology. Searches for the historic image-capturing methods were conducted using the Google search engine. Google Scholar and PubMed databases were used to research methods of digital photography, whole slide scanning, and smart phone cameras for microscopic image capture in a pathology practice setting.

Conclusions

Although film-based cameras dominated for much of the time, the rise of digital cameras outside of pathology generated a shift toward digital-image capturing methods, including mounted digital cameras and whole slide digital-slide scanning. Digital image capture techniques have ushered in new applications for slide sharing and second-opinion consultations of unusual or difficult cases in pathology. With their recent surge in popularity, we suspect that smart phone cameras are poised to become a widespread, cost-effective method for pathology image acquisition.

### Committee opinion no. 653: concerns regarding social media and health issues in adolescents and young adults [^1139gt5Q]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Sexting — definition, prevalence, associated behaviors, and legal/clinical considerations: Sexting is the act of sending sexually explicit messages or suggestive images by cell phone, and a 2008 survey showed that 19% of females (aged 13–19 years) and 32% of women (aged 20–26 years) had sent nude or seminude pictures, with 31% of the former group and 46% of the latter having received such pictures. Among college-aged individuals, those reporting sexting were more likely to report other high-risk behaviors, including multiple sexual partners over the past 3 months, unprotected sex, sex after alcohol or drug use, a higher number of total sexual partners, and a higher likelihood of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Legal risks are noted, as the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act prohibits visual depiction of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct and, under current child pornography laws, the dissemination of images of a juvenile to another person is prohibited and can result in prosecution. The gynecologist's office is a setting for routine discussion of sexual health, providing an opportunity to educate adolescents or young adults and to encourage guardians to monitor text and e-mail use, and monitoring or limiting an adolescent's text messaging has been linked to low incidence of sexting.

### Algorithmic content recommendations on a video-sharing platform used by children [^116MHEx8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Coding Scheme Development and Implementation

The thumbnail content coding scheme was developed based on iterative discussions as part of an undergraduate seminar that met weekly in the fall of 2021. Students were assigned videos and thumbnails to review and were asked to describe their impressions of salient visual features and attention-capture designs. Based on seminar discussions, prior research on attention-capture designs, and research describing heuristics in VSP content, a preliminary coding scheme comprising 8 features was developed. Students were then assigned thumbnails to code, and the scheme was iteratively reduced into 6 distinct feature codes around which consensus emerged. Each code was grouped into a coding level (0 = absent, 1 = mild or latent, and 2 = clear or dominant). Students were trained in biweekly meetings; we calculated their coding reliability by comparing it with a benchmark for 6 different screenshots (72 thumbnails). Three students with acceptable reliability (weighted κ > .70) coded the remainder of the thumbnails between January and September 2022. Coders met with the lead author (J.R.) weekly to review coding progress and uncertainties, which were resolved by consensus. To reduce coder bias, screenshot files were randomly named so that coders could not identify which search term or sequential screenshot they were coding. When thumbnails were identified as duplicates (ie, already coded on prior screenshot, [306 screenshots]), a consistent code was applied for all instances of that thumbnail.

Statistical Analysis

First, we calculated the frequency and proportion of codes for each thumbnail content feature (ie, occurrence of codes of levels 0, 1, or 2) across all search terms, and then separately for each search term. We also examined Spearman correlations between content features within the same thumbnail to determine which features tended to cooccur. To examine whether the frequency of content features changed over the course of 20 sequential screenshots, we conducted Spearman correlations between screenshot number (1 through 20) and each feature. We also dichotomized each feature as present (codes of levels 1 or 2) vs not present and tested significance of trend over 20 screenshots with the Cochran-Armitage trend test. The threshold for statistical significance was a 2-sided P < .05. Data analysis was conducted from April to December 2022 using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

### Arts-based approaches to promoting health in sub-saharan Africa: a scoping review [^1178p4bf]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Film, photography, photovoice

Six studies explored the use of film to promote health, one of which used a multiform approach. In Tanzania, a research team used participatory research methods to create video content to reflect on and challenge the reproductive health issues faced by adolescents. The study team worked with gender-balanced groups of school-going children aged 15–19 years, to identify and prioritise reasons why teenagers become pregnant, then writing scripts that worked with the prioritised reasons to create screenplays. Participants then worked with the research team to shoot and edit footage of their screenplays to produce films which were shown to policy-makers, broadcast on local television and shared through YouTube. Reflecting on their work, the author suggested that participatory video approaches can be a useful means of engaging young people in health issues, providing voice to their experience and empowering them. However, the author also noted that the researchers experienced considerable challenges relating to the power dynamics between the research team and the participants. Specifically, the participants argued that they should be paid a salary, as they saw their involvement in the project as work. This issue was resolved by providing a leisure event at the end of the project.

Photography and photovoice approaches to health promotion were used in eight papers. Researchers in Mozambique used photographs in combination with vignettes to elicit social norms relating to multiple concurrent sexual partnerships, with the aim of contributing to HIV/AIDS prevention efforts. The authors report that by using projective techniques, they were able to elicit rich narratives relating to sexual norms, HIV/AIDS transmission and risk perception, and that this method can be particularly useful during the development phases of interventions, allowing researchers to access local constructs and terminologies without imposing external assumptions.

In South Africa, Mitchell et al used a photovoice and participatory research methodology to facilitate community health workers and teachers to represent and respond to HIV/AIDS in their communities. Over the course of four sessions, participants formed groups, were taught to use cameras, encouraged to take pictures of the challenges and potential solutions for addressing HIV/AIDS-related issues, and gathered together to view and discuss the pictures that had been taken. The pictures and discussions provided insight into local experiences of HIV/AIDS but were also a platform for community organisation and mobilisation, with participants using their newly formed social networks as a platform to instigate stigma-reduction initiatives and education programmes.

### Beauty pageants in the Japanese colonial era of Korea (1931 and 1940) [^116ZgBNa]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to analyze the beauty pageants that were held in Korea during the Japanese colonial era (1931, 1940). Through searches of www.google.com and www.naver.com, 3 pageants were found: (1) 1931, Miss Korea, organized by Samchunli (a magazine): Any Korean woman, with the exception of Korean geishas, could apply by submitting her photographs. The number of candidates was 326. Nine Korean judges evaluated the photos of the candidates. Among them, the victor was an 18-year-old Korean woman. (2) 1931 (Oct), Miss Joseon, organized by Osaka Mainichi Shimbun: The candidates were categorized into 2 groups: 10 "internals" (Japanese) and 10 Koreans. Their heights and weights, along with their photographs, were provided for the readers' reference. The winners were determined based on the readers' votes. The Japanese victor was a 21-year-old student with a height of 150 cm and a weight of 52 kg (body mass index [BMI] 23.11 kg/m²). The Korean winner was a 19-year-old student standing at 157 cm and weighing 53 kg (BMI 21.50 kg/m²). (3) 1940, Venus of the Peninsula, organized by Modern Japan (a magazine): The candidates were Korean women residing in Japan or Korea. The panel of judges evaluated the photographs of the candidates. The victor was a 20-year-old Korean geisha. Her winning photograph was featured in the Korean edition of the magazine Modern Japan. She stood at 157 cm in height and weighed 45 kg (BMI 18.25 kg/m²). As beauty standards evolved over time, the beauty standards of the 1930s were markedly different from those of today.

### Professionalism in plastic surgery: attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors in medical students compared to surgeons in training and practice – one, but not the same [^115AmdGA]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Professionalism is now recognized as a core competency of surgical education and is required for certification and licensure. However, best teaching methods remain elusive, because (1) ethical standards are not absolute, and (2) learning and teaching styles vary considerably-both of which are influenced by cultural and generational forces. We sought to compare attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors in fourth year medical students, compared to surgeons in training and practice, focusing on issues related to professionalism in plastic surgery.

Methods

Fourth year medical students participating in a capstone course (n = 160), surgical residents (n = 219), and attending surgeons (n = 99) at a single institution were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding surgical professionalism. Participants (1) identified components of professionalism, (2) cited examples of unprofessional behavior, (3) ranked the egregiousness of 30 scenarios, and (4) indicated best educational practices. Cohorts were compared using t test and χ, with statistical significance assigned to P values less than 0.05.

Results

Compared to surgeons in training or practice, medical students were younger (27.8 vs 38.0 years, P < 0.001) and more often female (51.1% vs 36.6%, P < 0.03). Both groups cited "a body of ethics" as the defining component of professionalism. Respondents from both groups agreed that professionalism could be taught, learned, and assessed. Surgeons (94.3%) had observed unprofessional behavior, as did 88.0% of students; "poor anger management", "dishonesty", and "bullying" were the most common examples. Compared to students, however, surgeons were more likely to witness substance and physical abuse (P < 0.05). From the list of 30 scenarios, both groups picked the following as the most egregious, although in different order: working while impaired, fraudulent billing, dating a patient, lying on rounds, self-prescribing, and sexual harassment. Both students and surgeons agreed that the following scenarios were unethical: "fraudulent billing while on a mission trip" (84% vs 90%, NS), "showing inaccurate preop/postop photos" (70% vs 75%, NS), and "failing to disclose a conflict of interest" (56% vs 57%). Students and surgeons disagreed that the following scenarios were egregious: "owning biotech stock in a company whose product the surgeon uses" (33% vs 13%, P < 0.01), and "offering a breast augmentation as part of a charity raffle" (45% vs 58%, P < 0.05). Both students and surgeons agreed "advertising on a highway billboard was NOT unprofessional (87% vs 85%, NS).

Conclusions

Despite differences in age and sex, medical students and surgeons have similar attitudes about professionalism in plastic surgery, but differ in their knowledge and observations. Understanding cultural and generational factors may help educators teach and model cognitive and behavioral aspects of professionalism. The fact that some clearly egregious behaviors are not viewed as unethical by individual students, trainees, and surgeons, and that such behavior continues to be observed, indicates the need to improve our efforts in promoting professionalism in plastic surgery.

### Beauty sleep: experimental study on the perceived health and attractiveness of sleep deprived people [^116m91M3]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

For the photo shoot, participants wore no makeup, had their hair loose (combed backwards if long), underwent similar cleaning or shaving procedures for both conditions, and were instructed to "sit with a straight back and look straight into the camera with a neutral, relaxed facial expression". Although the photographer was not blinded to the sleep conditions, she followed a highly standardised procedure during each photo shoot, including minimal interaction with the participants. A blinded rater chose the most typical photograph from each series of photographs. This process resulted in 46 photographs; two (one from each sleep condition) of each of the 23 participants. This part of the study took place between June and September 2007.

In October 2007 the photographs were presented at a fixed interval of six seconds in a randomised order to 65 observers (mainly students at the Karolinska Institute, mean age 30 (range 18–61) years, 40 women), who were unaware of the conditions of the study. They rated the faces for attractiveness (very unattractive to very attractive), health (very sick to very healthy), and tiredness (not at all tired to very tired) on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. After every 23 photographs a brief intermission was allowed, including a working memory task lasting 23 seconds to prevent the faces being memorised. To ensure that the observers were not primed to tiredness when rating health and attractiveness they rated the photographs for attractiveness and health in the first two sessions and tiredness in the last. To avoid the influence of possible order effects we presented the photographs in a balanced order between conditions for each session.

Statistical analyses

Data were analysed using multilevel mixed effects linear regression, with two crossed independent random effects accounting for random variation between observers and participants using the xtmixed procedure in Stata 9.2. We present the effect of condition as a percentage of change from the baseline condition as the reference using the absolute value in millimetres (rated on the visual analogue scale). No data were missing in the analyses.

### Comparison of smartphone ophthalmoscopy vs conventional direct ophthalmoscopy as a teaching tool for medical students: the COSMOS study [^111eqpfR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Given the difficulties with direct ophthalmoscopy, alternative approaches have been investigated to teach medical students the fundus exam. The ToTEMS study used fundus photos as an adjunct to detecting eye diseases. Students were found to prefer learning ophthalmic disease using fundus photographs and found that it significantly improved diagnosis of eye diseases. Other methods to improve training with direct ophthalmoscopy include peer fundus photo matching and various simulators of direct ophthalmoscopy.–However, few comparative studies have been performed to assess their utility to effectiveness in improving competency with the DO.,

Improving accessibility and confidence of nonophthalmologist physicians in evaluating the fundus could have significant effects of healthcare resources. In a recent paper, it was demonstrated that half of all eye-related ER visits were nonemergencies. In general, nonurgent care costs are more than doubled if seen in the ER compared with being seen in other healthcare settings for the same problem. Thus, the ability of nonophthalmologist physicians to confidently evaluate the fundus could thus have large implications for healthcare utilization and costs.

Given the ubiquitous presence of smartphones, their portability, the ability for both the student and teacher to visualize the same image, as well as the ability to transmit information in an HIPAA compliant method, the smartphone serves as an attractive instrument for fundoscopy. Many versions of smartphone fundus cameras are now present in the marketplace. Smartphone fundus cameras have been demonstrated to take anterior and posterior segment images that are good enough to exclude urgent ocular findings in developing countries, and have been investigated as a proof of concept for diabetic retinopathy screening–as well as acute hypertension. In our study, we demonstrated that smartphone ophthalmoscopy is helpful in teaching fundoscopy to medical students.

As suggested by other studies, another consideration is, whether smartphone ophthalmoscopy could replace direct ophthalmoscopy as a fundus imaging modality for nonophthalmologists and medical students. This question is out of the scope of the current study but given the ubiquitous presence of smartphone, the relative low cost of smartphone fundus cameras compared with DOs, and the preference of medical students to use the smartphone ophthalmoscope compared with the DO as demonstrated in our study and others, this is a question worthy of future research.

### Professional experiences on use of the mental health act in ethnically diverse populations: a photovoice study [^113LUWHv]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Data analysis

The data consisted of photos, captions and recordings of meetings, which were transcribed, and these transcripts formed the basis of analysis; these were analysed by holding transcripts in MAXQDA (a qualitative software package) and manually reviewing digital transcripts and images. The narratives in part reflected these elaborations of the experiences represented by photographs, but more often, there was a general discussion around what CAT is like and their role as professionals. Thus, the photographs served as a photo-elicitation prompt.

We analysed the narratives more generally, and where images were referred to, we presented these alongside the thematic structure that emerged. Yet, many images were not related to the overall thematic structure (a full set of images is available on request).

The initial analysis involved coding of experiences and narratives, pictures and captions from professionals in the workshops. We carried out a thematic analysis (TA), as described by Braun and Clarke, as a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns within data. We also drew on the principles of polytextual TA. Participants considered the image data in group discussion, assessing it for meaning and context, and it was these narratives that entered the TA. Then, we undertook the following steps: viewing images and captions, reading transcripts of emergent narratives, familiarisation, searching for codes and higher-order common themes and important uncommon themes, reviewing and refining themes, and reporting. Analysis was conducted by RM and KB and iterated with the broader project team.

Reflexivity was built into the process, as at each stage, interpretation was by the participants viewing their own and others' data to produce narratives. However, there are no standard methods in photovoice analysis, hence we set out the adapted procedures. TAs were reviewed and refined by the investigators, including the peer researchers. KB holds a research doctorate (MD) and is a male Kenyan-born psychiatrist of Punjabi Sikh Indian heritage, and RM holds a PhD and is a woman of Indian and Irish heritage. KB and RM have undertaken extensive qualitative research in their doctorates and subsequently (over 25 and 10 years). However, there are no standard methods in photovoice analysis, hence setting out the adapted procedures. KB and RM reflected on notions of identity and influences on interpretation throughout the study, and conclusions were also interrogated by investigators and lived experience experts in the research.

### Teaching ophthalmoscopy to medical students (the TOTeMS study) [^114NJbSz]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine medical student preferences for learning the ocular fundus examination and to assess their accuracy using different examination modalities.

Design

Prospective, randomized study of medical student education approaches.

Methods

First-year medical students received training in direct ophthalmoscopy using simulators and human volunteers. Students were randomized to receive vs not receive specific training on interpreting fundus photographs prior to accuracy assessments. Students' preferences for each of the 3 methods (direct ophthalmoscopy on simulators or human volunteers, or use of fundus photographs) and recognition of normal and abnormal fundus features were assessed.

Results

Of 138 first-year medical students, 119 (86%) completed all required elements. For learning ophthalmoscopy, 85 (71%) preferred humans to simulators. For learning relevant features of the ocular fundus, 92 (77%) preferred photographs to ophthalmoscopy on simulators or humans. Accuracy of answers was better when interpreting fundus photographs than when performing ophthalmoscopy on simulators (P < .001). Performance improved after specific teaching about assessing fundus photographs before testing (P = 0.02). Examination of the ocular fundus was found easier and less frustrating when using photographs than when using ophthalmoscopy on simulators or humans. Eighty-four students (70%) said they would prefer to have fundus photographs instead of using the ophthalmoscope during upcoming clinical rotations.

Conclusions

Students preferred fundus photographs for both learning and examining the ocular fundus. Identification of ocular fundus features was more accurate on photographs compared to examination by direct ophthalmoscopy. In the future, the increasing availability of nonmydriatic ocular fundus photography may allow replacement of direct ophthalmoscopy in many clinical settings for non-ophthalmologists.

### How can we teach medical students to choose wisely? A randomised controlled cross-over study of video-versus text-based case scenarios [^113cfZ2H]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Case content was identical for all students but the format varied each week between 'text cases' or 'video cases'. In text cases, content was presented on the computer screen in written format while dealing with video cases involved watching five short films (mean duration 68 s), and answering a question (i.e. one item) after each film. Films were scripted based on written cases that had been piloted in two consecutive student cohorts. Wherever possible, videos were closely aligned to text cases. However, inevitably, minor differences arose in the exact wording of content, which are fundamental to the difference between written information and audio-visual material showing a true interaction between a patient and a physician. For a sample video, please refer to Additional file 2.

During the learning phase, students in the two study groups were alternately exposed to video-based or text-based e-seminars with all students being exposed to the same content in any given week. For example, in week 2, students in group A worked on video cases (Fig. 1, orange boxes) while students in group B were exposed to text cases presenting the same content (Fig. 1, blue boxes). The presentation format then alternated systematically for each group across 10 sessions. No specific measures were taken to prevent students from discussing e-seminar content outside the sessions.

Comparison of radiology to other medical specialties as a future career

Figure 4 summarizes the answers regarding the comparison of radiology to other medical specialties. Radiology was perceived favorably by more than three-quarters of students in terms of salary (1011, 85%) and work-life balance (1012, 85%). Regarding general work-life balance and overall working hours, a minority of 69 (6%) students expressed a desire to work more than 49 h a week, while the majority of 1063 students preferred working 30–39 h a week (548 students) or 40–49 h a week (515 students). There was no significant difference between students who could and could not envision themselves becoming radiologists regarding salary prospects in the field of radiology (p = 0.19). By contrast, students who could envision a career in radiology preferred to work fewer hours than their peers, who ruled out becoming radiologists (p < 0.05).

Fig. 4
Radiology, compared to other specialties, as perceived by 1184 medical students in terms of attractiveness, work-life balance, and salary perspectives

General specialty attractiveness was rated superior by 455 (37%) students, as comparable by 322 (27%) students, and as inferior to other specialties by 419 (35%) students.

Future perspectives

Regarding the future of radiologists, more than half of the students (628, 53%) maintain an optimistic outlook. The majority of 714 (60%) students believed that advancements in AI yield positive impacts, resulting in a collaborative relationship between doctors and AI. However, 270 (19%) students expressed concerns about AI solutions potentially replacing radiologists in the future.

Analysis depending on students' prior radiology exposure

Prior radiology exposure had a significant impact on students' perceptions of radiology's clinical role, attractiveness, and prospects, as well as their interest in becoming a radiologist (each p ≤ 0.002). Students who underwent dedicated clerkships or were engaged in radiology theses reported significantly higher values regarding attractivity, prospects, clinical importance, and overall interest in becoming a radiologist (Table 4).

### Effective clinical externships for international medical students: a qualitative study [^1175SSgp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

International student exchanges are a significant part of medical education, and experiences of North American and European medical students abroad have been extensively examined. By contrast, knowledge of visiting medical students in the United States (US) is limited largely to surveys of administrators and course directors.

Objective

To understand US attending physicians' thoughts on visiting international student clinical externships.

Design and Participants

Three clinician-educator physician focus groups were conducted across two US medical schools with broad representation of training backgrounds, clinical disciplines, and career stages. Focus groups and constant comparison analysis of transcripts were performed iteratively to identify emerging themes.

Main Measures

Qualitative themes and subthemes.

Key Results

Two main themes emerged from the data: (1) administrative requirements for success: hosting international students requires careful planning and coordination, which is daunting amidst demanding faculty responsibilities. Externships must address experiences of the people directly involved in the clinical setting, leadership, communication, and institutional, financial, physical, and personnel resources. (2) Impact of student qualities: When working with international students, the importance of administrative details and student characteristics increases due to higher student variability overall, inconsistent language and cultural fluency, and the consequent recognition of the student as an ambassador for their home institution and country.

Conclusions

Amidst already busy schedules, clinician educators identify the hosting of international medical students as a commitment resembling that for their own trainees. Linguistic and cultural distances, and the overall variability of international students amplify the importance of effective administration. The findings have influenced related processes at the University of Pittsburgh.

### 'FACE ME'-the impact and value of an arts-based project about the patient-parent-clinician relationship in European reference network CRANIO [^117WCWAB]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A good patient-clinician relationship is an important aspect of quality of care according to patients living with a rare congenital craniofacial condition and their parents. Despite efforts, the challenging question remains how to improve this relationship.

Objective

The authors describe the value and impact of using arts-based methods as a catalyst for bringing the 2 'worlds' of patients and their parents and that of clinicians together.

Methods

FACE ME, developed by 2 visual artists, consisted of reorganizing the house of a surgeon with a group of patients (n = 3), surgeons (n = 3), and a parent (n = 1) resulting in 2 artworks. The following data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis: the film recording the process, photos of the artworks (i.e., end-results of 2 reorganizations), conversations and reflections of the project group involved, and survey results of respondents who watched the film and photos.

Results

Four intertwined themes describe the impact and value of FACE ME: (1) importance of exchanging trust, (2) seeing each other as a person, (3) imagine standing in each other's shoes, and 4) working as a team. These themes represent both perspectives and their similarities in expectations of a good relationship, and findings were supported by the views of the project group and the audience watching the film.

Conclusion

FACE ME crossed the boundaries of clinicians, patients, and their parents, and created a better mutual understanding. This arts-based project started a different conversation, and reflection, changed mindsets, and provoked actions towards a better relationship.

### Exploring the use of instructional dermatology surface models within a dermatology focussed objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) station for medical students [^11383k4R]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) using real dermatology patients are challenging to standardise due to condition variability and urgent removal of cancerous lesions. Simulated patients alongside photographs offer standardisation but lack authenticity and disrupt consultation flow. Instructional Dermatology Surface Models (IDSMs) offer a realistic alternative, replicating dermatoses as temporary 3D transfers. This project evaluated medical student experiences using an IDSM depicting malignant melanoma within a OSCE involving 263 students. Post-exam, 80 students completed an online questionnaire assessing realism, utility, and communication. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and sentiment analysis. Students found the IDSM realistic and beneficial for enhancing consultation skills. Positive sentiments dominated; the net sentiment ratio was 5.3%, and 'realistic' was the most common descriptor. 91% of students preferred IDSMs over photographs. Findings suggest IDSMs benefit dermatology examinations by better simulating clinical practice. The increased cost of IDSMs compared to photographs, is an important consideration for their use.

### Photovoice as a promising public engagement approach: capturing and communicating ethnic minority people's lived experiences of severe mental illness and its treatment [^113XjSQo]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Method

Photovoice can facilitate an authentic and meaningful method of co-creating/co-producing knowledge in healthcare. Our workshops were hosted at community centres in London and Manchester (England). The project was explained verbally and through the distribution of information leaflets, while any queries were addressed. We then sought informed consent, distributed disposable cameras and notebooks with prepaid envelops for their return, before asking participants to take photos (post-workshop) of their realities of severe mental illness or its treatment. Participants were reassured that there were no 'right' or 'wrong' approaches and no professional photographic training was provided to ensure that photos represented their views. Photos from returned cameras were then developed for subsequent workshops (approximately 2–3 weeks later), where participants selected three to five photos for individual reflection guided by photo-trigger questions. Any individuals' faces shown in images, including participants', were blurred unless they signed a separate consent form. Based on their narratives, photo captions were produced with participants individually and closed exhibitions facilitated at the community centres to protect participants' identity and to give the option to amend their captions before the public exhibitions (figure 1).

### Testing the reinforcement learning hypothesis of social conformity [^1111QqnE]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Twenty‐nine right‐handed female students with no history of psychiatric disorders were recruited from the University of Southampton (mean age = 22.12 years). As in the original study (Klucharev et al. 2009), only female participants were recruited for the study as previous research suggests that there are gender differences in neural activity related to attractiveness rating (e.g. Cloutier, Heatherton, Whalen, & Kelley, 2008). Data from four participants were not included in the final analyses for the following reasons: excessive head movement (> 3 mm) in one participant, strong doubts regarding the social conformity manipulation in two participants (see below for more details), and technical problems with the response box in one participant (this participant could not complete all the fMRI tasks). The final sample consisted of 25 participants (mean age = 22.1 years). Written consent was obtained from all the participants prior to the experiment, and the study was approved by the University of Southampton ethics committee.

2.1 Stimuli

For the social conformity task, 100 digital color photographs of Caucasian women (aged 18–35) were used as stimuli. The images were taken from the set used in the study by Klucharev et al. (2009). All the women in the photographs were moderately attractive and had a moderate smile.

### Exposure to tobacco imagery in popular films and the risk of ever smoking among children in Southern India [^112ezd2d]. Tobacco Control (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the total of 1214 schools in Udupi district listed by the education department we excluded 5 that had closed, 7 that were special schools for differently abled children and 281 lower primary and 2 high schools with no students in grades 6–8. We contacted the principals of the remaining 919 schools, and 914 (99.4%) of these consented to participate. Of the 46 706 students in grades 6–8 in 914 schools, 3066 were absent on the day of the survey, 271 declined to participate, 315 were excluded by parental opt-out and 6 students consented but did not complete a questionnaire. The five schools that declined to participate, and 507 of the 586 students who themselves or whose parents declined consent were all from private schools. The remaining 43 048 students (92.2%) completed the survey questionnaire. After excluding 3766 questionnaires with insufficient or otherwise unusable data, 39 282 questionnaires (representing 84.1% of the eligible students in consenting schools) were available for analysis. The 3766 questionnaires were either not completed by the students or had made contradicting responses and hence were not included for analysis. Respondents included similar proportions of males (51%) and females (49%), and of students from grades 6, 7 and 8 (32.5%, 33.6% and 33.9%, respectively). Most participants were of Hindu religion (83.3%) and from rural areas (80.1%).

Ever smoking was reported by 914 (2.3%) participants and in univariate analysis varied significantly by age, was more prevalent among male participants, those attending government-funded or part-funded schools, those who were not Hindus, who had family members or friends who smoked, lived in a home where smoking is allowed, attended a school where smoking was seen, whose parents were less educated, whose families were relatively poor and who were rebellious, reported low self-esteem and had poor performance at school (table 1). In a mutually adjusted model retaining independently significant associations, smoking was related to age, being male, living in a home where smoking is allowed, having parents, siblings or friends who smoke, low paternal education, low levels of family wealth, low self-esteem, rebelliousness and poor performance at school (table 1).

### A protocol for dermatology service learning for medical students: supporting laser tattoo removal for adults impacted by the justice-system [^116Wcnf4]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2 provides a summary of students' interest in volunteering for this program. Importantly, 100% of students were interested in providing medical care to adults impacted by the justice system followed by professional development to support a potential career in dermatology (83%) and creating connections to dermatology faculty and residents (67% each) and like‐minded medical students (50%); other reasons less commonly cited are noted in Table 2. Students also reported on the primary way that the volunteering experience might contribute to their personal or professional growth. Students felt that participating in this program would help them support underserved communities and a career in dermatology (33% for each).

Table 2
Volunteers' motivations for program participation and anticipated growth due to volunteering in a tattoo removal service learning program for medical students (n = 6), San Diego, CA. January 2025.

We evaluated students' experience of undergoing the program's current training activities and results are described in Table 3. All students reported being very satisfied with their training and onboarding. At the time the evaluation survey was collected, participation in the clinic ranged from 0 sessions to 13 sessions (data not shown). The majority of students reported engaging in all of the volunteering activities, though operation of the smoke evacuator, uploading treatment photos to the patient's chart via the electronic medical record or shadowing other volunteers were less commonly reported. Students also reported on how confident they feel in their abilities to carry out certain clinical or collaborative activities. The majority of students felt confident or very confident in their clinical volunteering activities and professional connections, however, two students felt less confident in operating the smoke evacuator or understanding the way the laser treatment works.

### Formal mentorship as an opportunity to expand the urology pipeline: under represented trainees entering residency (UReTER) program evaluation 2020–2021 [^114LjQ5x]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To rank percentages of underrepresented residents in surgical subspecialties and understand the experience of mentees and mentors who participated in the inaugural University of California, San Francisco Urology UnderRepresented Trainees Entering Residency (UReTER) Mentorship Program for Black, Indigenous, and/or LatinX medical students applying into urology.

Methods

Medical student mentees across the country were recruited via social media and email listservs. Demographic information and photos of mentors were presented on the UReTER website. Medical students could choose a mentor, and once matched, both parties were notified. A survey was emailed to all participants on Urology Match Day 2021.

Result

The 2018–2019 ACGME Databook showed underrepresented minority residents made up 7.6% of urology residents, lagging behind neurosurgery, vascular surgery, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. 71 mentees and 101 mentors volunteered for the UReTER Mentorship Program (71 mentor-mentee couplets). Overall response rate was 51% [33 mentors and 32 mentees]. Of mentees who completed the survey, 16 (47%) participated in the 2021 Urology Match; 15 (94%) matched and 6 (38%) felt that UReTER helped them match.

Conclusion

Feedback on this pilot program was very positive including a high match rate among those who participated. Future changes to the program include expanded student outreach, increased structure, broadened mentor network. The implementation of a low-cost program to increase underrepresented applicants into Urology has great potential to increase representation and improve the field. This program can and should be replicated in all subspecialties.

### Exploring inequality through the lens of adolescents: a photovoice study in bissau, Guinea-Bissau [^111Bg9zi]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Photovoice research was conducted in Bissau from 20 January to 23 March 2024, involving three boys and three girls aged 16–19. They were purposefully selected from one neighbourhood for their diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and schooling experiences (public and private). Selection was facilitated by a local collaborator familiar with the community to ensure a range of perspectives.

Data collection involved two preparatory meetings and a focus group discussion, all facilitated by the first author (FNB) in Creole, supported by a translator. Participants were introduced to the project's objectives and attached ethical considerations in the first meeting. They received disposable cameras and notebooks, along with instructions on capturing up to 15 photos each, representing social inequalities they identified in their daily lives. Participants were guided to reflect on each photo using the PHOTO method, that is, structuring their notes around key questions about what the photo depicted, its context and potential implications for change.

Following a 2-week photo-taking period, the participants reconvened in a final group session. They presented 57 photos and their notebooks, including their reflections about the meanings and context of each image. Thereafter, they selected 4–5 photos that best represented their experiences of inequalities in their daily lives. That selection was determined by personal relevance, clarity of the message, and emotional or symbolic significance. During the selection process, they shared personal thoughts, and engaged in a collaborative analysis of inequalities in their daily lives.

In the final session, FNB encouraged open dialogue about manifestations of inequality, through which the main themes were identified. While general examples were provided during the initial instructions, such as the inequality between rural and urban settings or among friends and family, specific comparative elements, like differences between public and private schools or neighbourhood infrastructure, were not introduced. However, these contrasts frequently emerged in participants' reflections and were later integrated into the thematic analysis to reflect their lived experiences.

In the subsequent qualitative analysis in Atlas.ti, all 57 photos and accompanying notes were included. Specific segments of the text in the notebooks and related to each theme were coded and refined into distinct concepts or patterns to ensure that all relevant information was captured and analysed. This broader set of visual and written materials helped inform and strengthen the thematic categories the participating adolescents had developed in the final group discussion.

### Living with COPD: understanding patient experiences through the lens of photovoice [^111Zrdbc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Photovoice approach

Step 1: Baseline interview

Following consent, participants attended a baseline interview with a research assistant [LSC, AB]. The purpose was to build rapport with the participant and educate them on photo taking. During the interview, the project's aims were explained with a pictorial reference card. The card included an overview of what was meant by activities of daily living, instructions on photo taking and how to send the pictures or messages to the research team. Demographical data were also collected. If requested, participants' carers also attended the training session and supported participants during the study.

Step 2: Photo taking

Following Step 1, participants were given two weeks to take at least five photographs. Participants were informed that while there was no set limit on the number of photos they could capture, it might not be feasible to discuss each one in detail during the follow-up interview. Participants were advised to send photos directly to a dedicated mobile number managed by the research team.

Step 3: Follow-up interview

After two weeks, participants were invited back for a single interview to discuss their most important pictures. The interviews were conducted by two female health services researchers, trained in qualitative interview techniques [LSC (MSc) and AB (MPH)]. The interview guide followed the SHOWeD approach. For each photo, the participants were asked: What do you See here? What is really Happening here? How does this relate to Our lives? Why does this problem exist? What can we Do about it? The interviews were conducted in English or Chinese by a native speaker according to the participant's preference. Following the interviews, interviewers wrote memos to capture their immediate reflections, insights and take aways. Interviews lasted for approximately 45 min. All interviews were audio recorded and later transcribed. Chinese transcripts were translated to English by a native speaker and verified by a second native speaker for accuracy. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved by mutual consensus.

### Perceived community alignment increases information sharing [^116ieb9g]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Procedure

Participants completed an online survey that took 5–10 minutes and were compensated $0.85 after completing it. All participants saw the headlines and abstracts (i.e. short summaries) of five different news articles that were chosen uniformly at random from a sample of 29 news articles that we pretested in a pilot study to ensure that they (1) ranged in the extent to which their content would elicit similarity in interpretations across individuals and (2) were somewhat interesting, given that articles that are widely perceived to be uninteresting are unlikely to be shared (as a baseline), irrespective of how one believes others will interpret them.

The order of the five news articles was determined uniformly at random. Participants were asked their likelihood to share each article on social media with the question "How likely would you be to share this article on social media (e.g. on your Facebook timeline, Instagram, or Twitter)?" with the anchors "1 = extremely unlikely" and "5 = extremely likely". They also were asked the extent to which they believed that others in their social circles would have similar views as themselves about the article with the question "Consider the people with whom you are friends with on social media. How confident are you that they would all generally share your views on the content of the article?" with the anchors "0 = these people may or may not share my view" and "100 = I am confident that most of these people would share my view". To counteract potential effects of seeing one type of question before the other, participants were assigned uniformly at random to see either all of the sharing questions first (and subsequently see all of the associated perceived-similarity questions) or all of the perceived-similarity questions first (and subsequently see all of the associated sharing questions). The order of the news articles was determined uniformly at random for each set of questions. After answering all of the sharing and perceived-similarity questions, participants rated how positive or negative they thought their friends on social media would find each article and how interesting they thought their friends on social media would find each article. For the first question, they were asked "To what extent do you think your friends on social media would view the content of each article in a positive or negative light?" with the anchors "0 = extremely negative", "50 = neutral", and "100 = extremely positive". For the second question, they were asked "To what extent do you think your friends on social media would find the content of each article interesting?" with the anchors "0 = extremely uninteresting", "50 = neither interesting nor uninteresting", and "100 = extremely interesting".

### Lived experiences of adolescents with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder [^111KqPMi]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Data collection

Semi‐structured interviews were conducted using photo elicitation, an approach used with children and adolescents with disabilities to support them in making meaning of their world and reflecting upon their experiences, even when they may not have the capacity to discuss abstract concepts. Photo elicitation provides children with control over the photographs taken and discussed, and has been used with IPA to support understanding of lived experiences.

Participants were asked to take photographs of their daily activities and environments (e.g. home and community areas, artwork, projects, mealtimes, books) for 2 weeks before the interviews, then chose photographs to share and discuss with the interviewer. Adolescents were asked to take the photographs themselves and avoid photographing people or identifiable features (e.g. school signage) for privacy. Example photographs are provided in Figures 1, 2, and 3.

Figure 1
This photograph of an adolescent's artwork reflects their views about the importance of not making judgements based on appearance alone

Figure 2
This photograph depicts part of the adolescent's daily routine of reading with their mother before bed

Figure 3

Interviews were conducted by the first author for 45 minutes to 1 hour via Zoom (because of COVID‐19 restrictions) using an interview guide (Appendix S2), which was provided to participants in advance. Photographs were viewed one at a time and the researcher asked questions relating to the activities and environments shown, with probing questions used to elicit further information (e.g. 'Tell me about this photo?'; 'When do you usually do this activity?'). After all photographs were viewed, additional questions explored adolescents' daily routines, activities, perceived strengths and challenges, and influences of these on daily functioning (e.g. ' What do you find challenging to do during the day?'; 'What do you feel your strengths are?'). The adolescent who relayed answers through their caregiver became anxious during the interview and was unable to continue. A second appointment was arranged, and the interview was successfully completed. Interviews were audio and video recorded with permission and transcribed verbatim, and field notes were made during and after the interviews.

### Evaluation of medical student experience using medical student created studentPACS flash based PACS simulator tutorials for learning radiological topics [^1125bvgH]. Academic Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

With studies regularly containing hundreds of images, the authors believe that the ability to efficiently review numerous images and identify findings is an important skill to teach medical students. Using the StudentPACS Adobe Flash extension, created within their department, the authors created StudentPACS modules that provide users with a virtual picture archiving and communication system environment, in which findings can be selected by mouse, triggering questions with referenced answers. The aim was to assess medical students' impressions of how learning from these modules compared to their personal experiences learning radiology from textbooks or static images.

Materials and Methods

StudentPACS modules were created by medical students on elective under the supervision of resident and attending radiologists. MS I to IV students were then asked to complete StudentPACS modules that tied in with their current coursework, followed by an anonymous survey. Approximately 293 students participated.

Results

The majority of students reported that StudentPACS modules were either equivalent to or better than learning from static images or textbooks (90 ± 3% [257 of 285], P < .00002), were not difficult to use (85 ± 4% [248 of 293], P < .00002), presented them with clinical content that tied in well with the depicted imaging (90 ± 3% [263 of 293], P < .00002), and taught them new information (69 ± 5% [202 of 293], P < .00002). Most respondents felt the StudentPACS modules presented information they would find useful in clinical practice (91 ± 3% [266 of 293], P < .00002), reported satisfactory experiences using StudentPACS modules as a source of self-directed learning material (79 ± 5% [232 of 293], P < .00002), and stated that they would use StudentPACS modules for learning different topics in the future (85.6 ± 4% [244 of 285], P < .00002).

Conclusion

Medical students found using StudentPACS modules at least equivalent to, if not better than, using static books or annotated images.

### Our post-zoom reflection: turning off the monitor [^116qK3sD]. Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Over a year ago, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lockdowns and isolation, quickly shifting social interactions online. During this time, the authors cited worsening self-perception due to the altered and distorted image produced by front facing cameras, later called "Zoom Dysmorphia". A recent survey study was then conducted analyzing the mental health and self-image of people as they returned to in-person activities. Increased time spent online and use of filters, which provoked unrealistic expectations, correlated with worsening anxiety and worsening self-perception, especially in respondents under the age of 24 years. A large percentage of this cohort also planned to invest in their appearance to cope with this anxiety. After a year of being behind the screen, with the ability to enhance features with the click of a button, individuals are concerned about their appearance and their ability to return to a life in-person. Aesthetic physicians should be prepared to discuss the cosmetic concerns provoked by photo editing, filters, and videoconferencing to educate about realistic surgical goals and outcomes for patients.

We developed a simple method for displaying cine images on Web-based teaching files using an open-source utility, the Java applet. This interactive utility offers improved 3D visualizations compared with the traditional approach using thumbnail and static images. Because Java is a built-in component of common Web browsers and computer systems, no other software was required. We have used this applet successfully for more than 2 years in our Web-based teaching system, including in our teaching files and on our case-of-the-week page.

### The cleft aesthetic rating scale for 18-year-old unilateral cleft lip and palate patients: a tool for nasolabial aesthetics assessment [^113wVduv]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a reliable and easy-to-use method to assess the nasolabial appearance of 18-year-old patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (CLP).

Design

Retrospective analysis of nasolabial aesthetics using a 5-point ordinal scale and newly developed photographic reference scale: the Cleft Aesthetic Rating Scale (CARS). Three cleft surgeons and 20 medical students scored the nasolabial appearance on standardized frontal photographs.

Setting

VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam.

Patients

Inclusion criteria: 18-year-old patients, unilateral cleft lip and palate, available photograph of the frontal view.

Exclusion Criteria

history of facial trauma, congenital syndromes affecting facial appearance. Eighty photographs were available for scoring.

Main Outcome Measures

The interobserver and intraobserver reliability of the CARS for 18-year-old patients when used by cleft surgeons and medical students.

Results

The interobserver reliability for the nose and lip together was 0.64 for the cleft surgeons and 0.61 for the medical students. There was an intraobserver reliability of 0.75 and 0.78 from the surgeons and students, respectively, on the nose and lip together. No significant difference was found between the cleft surgeons and medical students in the way they scored the nose (P = 0.22) and lip (P = 0.72).

Conclusions

The Cleft Aesthetic Rating Scale for 18-year-old patients has a substantial overall estimated reliability when the average score is taken from three or more cleft surgeons or medical students assessing the nasolabial aesthetics of CLP patients.

### Establishing minimal clinically important difference for effectiveness of corrective exercises on craniovertebral and shoulder angles among students with forward head posture: a clinical trial [^116zgT5q]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The previous studies have suggested the photogrammetric method as a sensitive and reliable method for postural assessment. The exercise protocol was performed under the direct supervision of the first author. All participants who had two consecutive sessions or three non-continuous sessions of absence were excluded from the study. A blinded examiner took photographs and extracted data from photographs.

The CVA and SA angles were obtained using a commercial camera (Canon Camera, D5600). The camera was placed on a tripod holding at a distance of 80 cm apart from the frontal plane to the participants. The camera's height was set at the level of the seventh cervical vertebra for each participant. The privacy and comfort of the participants were guaranteed.

Skin markers were placed on the acromion, ear tragus, and spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra. Three pictures were taken from a lateral view to obtain CVA and SA. At the end, the photos were moved to the computer, and the target angles were calculated using the AutoCAD software (release 33, 2018). The mean average of angles extracted from three photos was considered as CVA and SA measures.

The angles in the lateral view were measured (Fig. 2) as follows:
Craniovertebral angle (CVA): It was considered as the angle between a horizontal line through the spinous process of the C7 vertebra and a line from the spinous process of the C7 vertebra through the ear tragus. If this angle was less than 50°, the subject were included in the study.
Shoulder angle (SA): It was considered as the angle between a horizontal line through the spinous process of the C7 vertebra and a line passes from the midpoint of the shoulder joint through the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra.

### Interactive display of stacks of images in scientific presentations with powerPoint [^111KP56z]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

We describe a new tool to facilitate the creation and interactive display of stacks of images for scientific and educational presentations using Microsoft PowerPoint.

Conclusion

This new tool allows interactive scrolling through stacks of images. After a presentation is created, all elements required to display the stacks of images are embedded in the PowerPoint file. These presentations can be run on any computer (Macintosh or IBM-compatible versions) using PowerPoint with no other preinstalled software, making this tool useful for scientific and educational presentations at national and international meetings.

Preferences for MATCH-IT version and specific design features

After exposure to both formats of the MATCH-IT tool, 86.3% (n = 133) of students reported a preference for version A. Concerning initial display of outcomes, 67.1% (n = 100) of students preferred having all outcomes displayed on entry (version A) while 32.9% (n = 49) students either preferred having to select outcomes (version B) or showed no preference at all. Concerning colour coding to reflect direction and magnitude of effects, 96.6% (n = 144) of students reported a clear preference for colour coding (version A), with only 3.4% (n = 3) of students reporting preference for the table without colour coding. Across all preference outcomes, there was no significant difference in preference whether you were randomised to version A or B first. Data on preferences is displayed in figure 4. All data from survey portion can be viewed in table 2.

### The use of peer optic nerve photographs for teaching direct ophthalmoscopy [^115rhjPY]. Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To use a novel teaching exercise to encourage students to practice ophthalmoscopy and to measure the learning effect both subjectively and objectively.

Design

Comparative case series.

Participants

One hundred thirty-one fourth-year medical students on their 1-week ophthalmology rotations with 89 in the experimental group and 42 in the control group.

Methods

Those in the experimental group had 1 eye dilated and their optic nerve photographed on the first day. The next day, these students received an unlabeled optic nerve photograph belonging to 1 of their peers (typically 8–10 per group) and were given 3 days to identify the student matching the photograph. The students in the control group were simply encouraged to practice ophthalmoscopy on each other without the use of photographs.

Main Outcome Measures

Both objective and subjective changes from the beginning to the end of the rotation were measured and compared between the 2 groups.

Results

In the 89 students who used peer optic nerve photographs, 75 (84.3%) showed improvement in direct ophthalmoscopy skills over the course of the week. In contrast, only 12 (28.6%) of the 42 control students demonstrated an objective improvement (P < 0.001). The subjective confidence levels likewise were more improved in the students who took part in the optic nerve photograph exercise.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the task of matching an unknown optic nerve photograph to the correct eye of a peer leads to increased self-confidence and more proficient use of the direct ophthalmoscope.

### Age differences in mental state inference of sarcasm: contributions of facial emotion recognition and cognitive performance [^111myQCi]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Older age is associated with poorer ability to accurately infer mental states, but some mental states are more complex than others. Sarcasm is a complex mental state because the literal and intended meaning of a speaker's words are in opposition. Individuals must rely on additional cues (e.g., facial expressions, intonation) for accurate inference. We hypothesized that understanding of sarcastic versus sincere exchanges would be more sensitive to age-related difficulty in mental state understanding.

Methods

We examined accuracy at identifying sarcasm among 263 adults (ages 18–90 years) using videos of social interactions in The Awareness of Social Inference Test. Hypotheses were tested using a logistic linear mixed effects model predicting correct/incorrect trial-level responses. To characterize why sarcasm differed with age, we measured 2 abilities commonly implicated in mental state understanding: facial emotion recognition and cognitive performance.

Results

Sarcasm understanding declined with age, whereas understanding of sincere exchanges did not. Both better emotion recognition and cognitive performance related to better understanding of sarcastic but not sincere exchanges. Only cognitive performance showed an age-related effect such that the cognitive performance among the oldest participants facilitated their understanding of both sarcastic and sincere exchanges.

Discussion

We showed that individual variation related to age and social and cognitive performance is more pronounced when the use of multiple mental state cues is more (sarcasm) or less (sincerity) necessary for accurate understanding of social interactions. Naturalistic paradigms involving multiple mental state cues can address important questions about how older adults make decisions in the real world.

### 'The world is full of magic things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper' (WB yeats): enhancing resilience among deaf young people in South Africa through photography and filmmaking [^112j3o93]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

The skills teaching component and approach

In broad terms, the teaching component of the input was designed to take the learners through tasks of gradually increasing complexity in terms of still and moving image creation as a means to grasp both core technical knowledge about how to use a camera and core compositional elements in the creation of a good quality image or short film. In schematic terms, see table 1.

Table 1
Summary of skills teaching and composition techniques

The teaching delivery component took the form of an interactive whole group workshop to describe and demonstrate the task, followed by small group work to reinforce the aim of the task, allow for clarification, support the ideas young people wanted to try out (through encouragement and discussion rather than direction), and specific hands-on technical skills teaching. This group-based approach was culturally coherent with preferences for learning among sign language users. The young people used the contexts of their own school environment to take pictures and later on to develop their short films as it was not practical, and in some cases unsafe, for them to do the work outside of the school boundaries. The working method included participants coming back together as a whole group to view each other's pictures and films. This provided the opportunity for them collectively to develop critical skills through a facilitated peer discussion of what they liked and why, and what could be improved. In later stages of the work as the young people became more skilled in group critical feedback which of itself was an important learning outcome in relation to understanding visual, aesthetic and representational possibilities and choices. A key objective was to facilitate the development of critical and reflexive skills, which are more readily acquired and understood in terms of the young people's embodied visual capacities than through other mediums, and whose knowledge can then be transferred and applied to different areas of learning and life. Looking at and giving attention to the world through the camera and its creative outputs becomes a shared basis for the development of collective critical skills and discussion. We also used these sessions to start to explore personal and shared emotional responses to images and intended meanings in portrayal and choice of image, shot, scene and sequence. These processes of formative feedback have for a long time been part of the practice-based filmmaking pedagogy of the Granada Centre for Visual Anthropology 45 and are meant to develop a critical understanding of the possibilities and constraints of different visual and sensory media instead of providing fixed rules or abstract general principles.

### Exposure to point-of-sale displays and changes in susceptibility to smoking: findings from a cohort study of school students [^116v5KKK]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Results

We received questionnaires from 4302 students (approximately 69% of those eligible, based on the total number of students reported by schools to be on their rolls) from the eight schools surveyed in 2012, of whom 3672 were in school years 8–11 and hence potentially also participants in the 2011 survey 11. We were able to link questionnaires from 2011 and 2012 for 2354 (64%) of these, but had to exclude 47 respondents who did not provide data on susceptibility to smoking in both years, and 37 respondents with incompatible primary outcome responses (24 who reported in 2012 that they were non‐susceptible never smokers, having been ever smokers in 2011; and 13 who indicated that they were susceptible never smokers in 2012, having been ever smokers in 2011). We were therefore able to track smoking and susceptibility status over time in 2270 respondents who, at baseline, comprised 1576 non‐susceptible never smokers, 494 susceptible never smokers and 200 ever smokers.

Of the non‐susceptible never smokers in 2011, 313 (19.9%) became susceptible never smokers in 2012 and 111 (7.0%) became ever smokers. Of the 494 susceptible never smokers in 2011, 224 (45.3%) did not change status, while 128 (25.9%) became non‐susceptible never smokers and 142 (28.7%) progressed to being a smoker. Other characteristics of the students included in the analysis are presented in Table 1.

### Restricting or banning alcohol advertising to reduce alcohol consumption in adults and adolescents [^114aSjJb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol is estimated to be the fifth leading risk factor for global disability-adjusted life years. Restricting or banning alcohol advertising may reduce exposure to the risk posed by alcohol at the individual and general population level. To date, no systematic review has evaluated the effectiveness, possible harms and cost-effectiveness of this intervention.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits, harms and costs of restricting or banning the advertising of alcohol, via any format, compared with no restrictions or counter-advertising, on alcohol consumption in adults and adolescents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialised Register (May 2014); CENTRAL (Issue 5, 2014); MEDLINE (1966 to 28 May 2014); EMBASE (1974 to 28 May 2014); PsychINFO (June 2013); and five alcohol and marketing databases in October 2013. We also searched seven conference databases and www.clinicaltrials.gov and http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/ in October 2013. We checked the reference lists of all studies identified and those of relevant systematic reviews or guidelines, and contacted researchers, policymakers and other experts in the field for published or unpublished data, regardless of language.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies that evaluated the restriction or banning of alcohol advertising via any format including advertising in the press, on the television, radio, or internet, via billboards, social media or product placement in films. The data could be at the individual (adults or adolescent) or population level.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included one small RCT (80 male student participants conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2009) and three ITS studies (general population studies in Canadian provinces conducted in the 1970s and 80s). The RCT found that young men exposed to movies with a low-alcohol content drank less than men exposed to movies with a high-alcohol content (mean difference (MD) -0.65 drinks; 95% CI -1.2, -0.07; p value = 0.03, very-low-quality evidence). Young men exposed to commercials with a neutral content compared with those exposed to commercials for alcohol drank less (MD -0.73 drinks; 95% CI -1.30, -0.16; p value = 0.01, very-low-quality evidence). Outcomes were assessed immediately after the end of the intervention (lasting 1.5 hours), so no follow-up data were available. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low due to a serious risk of bias, serious indirectness of the included population and serious level of imprecision. Two of the ITS studies evaluated the implementation of an advertising ban and one study evaluated the lifting of such a ban. Each of the three ITS studies evaluated a different type of ban (partial or full) compared with different degrees of restrictions or no restrictions during the control period. The results from the three ITS studies were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of the two studies that evaluated the implementation of a ban showed an overall mean non-significant increase in beer consumption in the general population of 1.10% following the ban (95% CI -5.26, 7.47; p value = 0.43; I(2) = 83%, very-low-quality evidence). This finding is consistent with an increase, no difference, or a decrease in alcohol consumption. In the study evaluating the lifting of a total ban on all forms of alcohol advertising to a partial ban on spirits advertising only, which utilised an Abrupt Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average model, the volume of all forms of alcohol sales decreased by 11.11 kilolitres (95% CI -27.56, 5.34; p value = 0.19) per month after the ban was lifted. In this model, beer and wine sales increased per month by 14.89 kilolitres (95% CI 0.39, 29.39; p value = 0.04) and 1.15 kilolitres (95% CI -0.91, 3.21; p value = 0.27), respectively, and spirits sales decreased statistically significantly by 22.49 kilolitres (95% CI -36.83, -8.15; p value = 0.002). Using the GRADE approach, the evidence from the ITS studies was rated as very low due to a high risk of bias arising from a lack of randomisation and imprecision in the results. No other prespecified outcomes (including economic loss or hardship due to decreased alcohol sales) were addressed in the included studies and no adverse effects were reported in any of the studies. None of the studies were funded by the alcohol or advertising industries.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of robust evidence for or against recommending the implementation of alcohol advertising restrictions. Advertising restrictions should be implemented within a high-quality, well-monitored research programme to ensure the evaluation over time of all relevant outcomes in order to build the evidence base.

### Satisfactory reliability among nursing students using the instrument PVC ASSESS to evaluate management of peripheral venous catheters [^116Uubrs]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Nursing students should be given opportunities to participate in clinical audits during their education. However, audit tools are seldom tested for reliability among nursing students. The aim of this study was to present reliability among nursing students using the instrument PVC assess to assess management of peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) and PVC-related signs of thrombophlebitis.

Methods

PVC assess was used to assess 67 inserted PVCs in 60 patients at ten wards at a university hospital. One group of nursing students (n = 4) assessed PVCs at the bedside (inter-rater reliability) and photographs of these PVCs were taken. Another group of students (n = 3) assessed the PVCs in the photographs after 4 weeks (test-retest reliability). To determine reliability, proportion of agreement [P(A)] and Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) were calculated.

Results

For bedside assessment of PVCs, P(A) ranged from good to excellent (0.80–1.0) in 55% of the 26 PVC assess items that were tested. P(A) was poor (< 0.70) for two items: "adherence of inner dressing to the skin" and "PVC location". In 81% of the items, κ was between moderate and almost perfect: moderate (n = 5), substantial (n = 3), almost perfect (n = 5). For edema at insertion site and two items on PVC dressing, κ was fair (0.21–0.40). Regarding test-retest reliability, P(A) varied between good and excellent (0.81–1) in 85%-95% of the items, and the κ ranged between moderate and almost perfect (0.41–1) in 90%-95%.

Conclusions

PVC assess demonstrated satisfactory reliability among nursing students. However, students need training in how to use the instrument before assessing PVCs.

### Artificial intelligence-based education assists medical students' interpretation of hip fracture [^1122256Z]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

In the past, medical image training has relied on the traditional apprenticeship model. Because this model depends on trainee relationships, and because there is limited time available to review preliminary reports with a staff radiologist, gains in knowledge and skills can vary among trainees. Hence, this apprenticeship education model is characterized by ever-increasing workload demands on both attending physicians and trainees and can be improved by a better understanding of relations between humans and tools. In conventional image teaching, students are expected to first learn diagnostic characteristics from educators and practice afterward. AI in medical education is still in the development stage. AI can empower flipped classroom-like teaching and complete the existing bottom-up platforms used to teach radiology. It has been argued that case-based learning should be implemented because it is more effective than traditional top-down approaches and is preferred by radiology educators and students. In the hip fracture detection task, the medical students had fundamental knowledge of anatomy, pathology, and the principle of imaging. The heatmap generated by AI provided an opportunity for the students to connect this domain knowledge and generate a new understanding of radiographic interpretation skills. Thus, they could improve their diagnostic accuracy with limited learning cases. Visualization techniques such as grad-CAM provide a rationale for humans to understand the black box mechanism. Students can utilize AI to supplement unsupervised learning during personal time. AI can be used for low-level supervision, while attending and staff physicians can continue to provide high-level supervision. This change would allow human educators to tailor training methods and lesson content to their students' strengths and weaknesses, promoting bidirectional information exchange and saving training time. Thus, AI supports unique education platforms that balance a standardized curriculum with inherently individualized learning.

### Projected digital radiologic images for teaching: balance of image quality with data size constraints [^115a3rQ3]. Academic Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The authors performed this study to determine, in the context of a teaching presentation with slides, the information content needed in a digitized radiologic image for it to be equivalent in quality to an analog image.

Materials and Methods

Eleven sets of radiologic images were obtained from a teaching file collection and digitized. The images were scanned at high resolution and saved as image files. The information content of each image was then halved repeatedly with repeat sampling of the image. This procedure was repeated nine times to yield a total of 10 images with an information content that ranged from very low (32 kB) to high (12 MB). Each of these image files was made into a 35-mm slide by using a digital slide maker. The original radiographs were subsequently made into slides by using conventional photographic methods. Care was taken to make the images identical in every respect except digitization and information content. The slides were shown to radiologists, who filled out questionnaires to rate image quality.

Results

Digitized slides that contain an average of 416 kB of data (the equivalent of a 750 x 570-pixel matrix with 8-bit gray levels) were equivalent to analog images for 90% of viewers. At 830 kB (1,060 x 800-pixel matrix with 8-bit gray levels), 100% of viewers found no difference between digitized and analog images.

Conclusion

Digital images become indistinguishable from analog images if a sufficient amount of information is retained in the digital image. There is a defined relationship between the perception of quality and the information content of a digital image.

### Understanding resilience in medical interns through ecological momentary assessments, predictive modelling, and topic analysis [^11313rAk]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Topic modelling of students' recommendations for building resilience to internship-related stress

At T3, 77 students (92% of the 84 students asked) reported on what they found most helpful and what they would recommend to reduce internship stress and increase resilience. Following splitting into sentences and removal of invalid responses, we had 298 documents. BERTopic modelling revealed 16 topics to which 229 documents were assigned. The remaining 69 documents were labelled as outliers. Following human evaluation, three topics were merged into other topics due to conceptual overlap, resulting in a final 13 topics (see Supplementary Fig. 8 for a visualisation of documents by topic). Topic labels were created through human interpretation. Checks revealed that the topic Work-Life Balance & Self-Care included the subtopic Social Exchange, so we re-applied topic modelling on its documents, setting the number of topics to two. Documents thereby assigned to Social Exchange (n = 10) were merged with Work-related Social Support, forming Work-related Social Support & Exchange. Finally, two independent human raters (L.M. and E.M.) assigned topics to the outlier documents with only 15 remaining unassigned (e.g. 'Problems can or may be addressed'. Rater agreement was acceptable (70%).

The identified topics cover distinct but related themes referring to structural aspects (e.g. Organisation and Working Conditions), interpersonal internship aspects (e.g. Team Support & Integration and Open Communication & Feedback), and aspects related to work-life balance and stress reduction techniques (e.g. Stress Management, Self-Calming). Most participants reported organisational improvements, work-related social support and exchange, and a good work-life balance as recommendations to tackle internship-related stress. For instance, participants suggested a nationally regulated training structure, talking difficult situations through with others, and deliberately planning time to exercise or spend with friends during leisure hours. Supplementary Data 3 shows the topics by number of documents, including the number of participants who reported a topic, top five keywords, and representative documents.

### Evaluating medical students on radiology clerkships in a filmless environment: use of an electronic test prepared from PACS and digital teaching collection images [^1162JdD8]. Academic Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The competency of medical students in radiology clerkships is traditionally evaluated with film images, projected slides of photographed films, or printed reproductions of films. As radiology departments switch to filmless imaging, it seemed appropriate to determine the feasibility of an electronic evaluation prepared directly from digital images.

Materials and Methods

The image-based portion of a multiple-choice final examination was prepared as a PowerPoint presentation that included images downloaded from the departmental picture archiving and communication system (PACS) or digital teaching collections. The images were downloaded as bitmap files, imported to Adobe Photoshop for image editing, converted to tagged image file format, and finally imported to PowerPoint, where they were combined with text to create 50 questions. A liquid crystal diode projector displayed the questions, with a timer set to advance them automatically.

Results

The examination was easy and inexpensive to prepare (no photography costs). In an initial survey of 25 students, 17 (71%) of 24 students rated the resolution of images as excellent and five (21%) as good. No student gave an image a poor rating. Students preferred that images cover at least 40%-50% of the slides, and most approved of a blue background. An original allowance of 30 seconds per slide was reported to be too fast; the interval was increased to 45 seconds.

Conclusion

An electronic final examination for medical students, prepared with images downloaded from PACS or digital teaching collections, is feasible, easy to prepare, and cost-effective, and it provides an excellent display of test images.

### Structure and inference in annotated networks [^113YVGA3]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

In our tests the desired division was one that places two of the underlying four groups in one community and the remaining two in the other. Two-valued metadata were generated that agree with this division 65% of the time, a relatively weak level of correlation, not far above the 50% of completely uncorrelated data. Nonetheless, as shown in Fig. 1b, this is enough for the algorithm to reliably find the correct division of the network in almost every case — 98% of the time in our tests. Without the metadata, by contrast, we succeed only 6% of the time. Some practical applications of this ability to select among competing divisions are given in the next section.

Real-world networks

In this section we describe applications of our method to a range of real-world networks, drawn from social, biological and technological domains.

For our first application we analyse a network of school students, drawn from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The network represents patterns of friendship, established by survey, among the 795 students in a medium-sized American high school (US grades 9–12, ages 14–18 years) and its feeder middle school (grades 7 and 8, ages 12–14 years).

Given that this network combines middle and high schools, it comes as no surprise that there is a clear division (previously documented) into two network communities corresponding roughly to the two schools. Previous work, however, has also shown the presence of divisions by ethnicity. Our method allows us to select between divisions by using metadata that correlate with the one we are interested in.

Figure 2 shows the results of applying our algorithm to the network three times. Each time, we asked the algorithm to divide the network into two communities. In Fig. 2a, we used the six school grades as metadata and the algorithm readily identifies a division into grades 7 and 8 on the one hand and grades 9–12 on the other — that is, the division into middle school and high school. In Fig. 2b, by contrast, we used the students' self-identified ethnicity as metadata, which in this data set takes one of four values: white, black, hispanic, or other (plus a small number of nodes with missing data). Now the algorithm finds a completely different division into two groups, one group consisting principally of black students and one of white. (The small number of remaining students are distributed roughly evenly between the groups.)

### Artificial intelligence assisted identification of newborn auricular deformities via smartphone application [^114XGdfo]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This paper introduces the development of an online system for identifying and classifying multiple sub-types of auricular deformities, accessible through a smartphone application or other mobile devices. The system is designed to assist in diagnosing newborn auricular deformities, evaluating improvements in auricle shape following therapeutic corrections, and providing educational training or testing for inexperienced physicians and medical students (see Fig. 1 C). Powered by a deep-learning model trained on over 4000 photographs of newborn auricles, the system operates in two stages: a Yolo v5 model for auricle detection, followed by a CNN for sub-type classification. Once photos are uploaded by users, the model can distinguish between normal auricles and five commonly observed deformities (see Fig. 1 B and Supplemental Table S1).

Comparing between human's and the model's performance on our internal test set demonstrated that it performs at the level of experienced frontline clinicians. The model's robust generalization capability was validated across four independent centers in China. It achieved an accuracy of 0.74–0.82 for six-class diagnoses and 0.79–0.86 for normal/abnormal diagnoses using photographs from multiple centers. These results confirm the system's feasibility for practical clinical applications.

### Exposure to point-of-sale displays and changes in susceptibility to smoking: findings from a cohort study of school students [^1144Qncz]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

We measured the frequency of visiting small shops and supermarkets by asking students how often they go to each of these categories of shops (almost every day, two or three times a week, once a week, two or three times a month, once a month, less than once a month), and merging these responses into a binary variable — fewer than two or three times a week, or two or three times a week or more — to avoid categories with small numbers. We measured frequency of noticing tobacco PoS displays by asking students whether, when going to shops, they noticed cigarettes on display every time, most times, sometimes, hardly ever or never. We merged these categories into a binary variable comprising sometimes or less, and most or every time to avoid categories with small numbers. We examined the brands of cigarettes and hand‐rolling tobacco that students recognized by listing the most popular brands (based on frequency of display in shops in Nottingham 23) in these categories and asking respondents to indicate all brands they noticed when visiting supermarkets or small shops. We grouped the total number of brands recognized in our analysis into three categories (none, one to five brands and more than five brands, split at the median value after excluding those who reported 'none').

### Accuracy of remote diagnosis of acute posterior segment pathology by residents and attendings captured with a smartphone and standard 20 / 28D lens [^114UM3fG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this study were the retrospective nature of the study, the lack of control subjects, the small sample size, the need for pharmacologic mydriasis, the inability to assess repeatability across multiple photographers, and inexperience of both the photographer and reviewers with smartphone-based photography. Furthermore, we only used one photographer in this study in order to eliminate variability in the quality of the images as a confounder in our analysis. The photographer was also a resident at the time of the study who had been well trained in indirect ophthalmoscopy. This meant that he had a short training process in obtaining high-quality photographs. The training process may be more difficult for technicians and medical students who are less experienced with positioning and skill required to take photographs with a 20D lens. However, we suggest that future studies assess the repeatability of image acquisition amongst multiple photographers. In addition, the accuracy for horseshoe retinal tear case 2 and optic nerve avulsion were fairly low, but the grade for quality of these photos was also low. However, the quality of photograph correlated with the confidence of diagnosis in both of these cases and with the accuracy of diagnosis of optic nerve avulsion. Thus, in a clinical setting, reviewers can avoid making clinical decisions based off of unclear photos and uncertain diagnoses that may inevitably lead to medical errors. The lower accuracy and quality of imaging of peripheral retinal tears argues for less utility in peripheral retinal pathology when compared to posterior pole/media pathology at this time. Future studies will need to examine how the sensitivity can be increased to detect various types of posterior segment pathology and reduce the number of false negatives. We also recommend that future studies investigate the reproducibility of quality smartphone-based fundus photographs in inpatient settings, telemedicine consults, and in resource poor areas and their utility in patient care.
