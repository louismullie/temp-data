## Question

Is Bartonella henselae associated with Kaposi sarcoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Bartonella henselae is associated with Kaposi sarcoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the established etiologies of Kaposi sarcoma and bacillary angiomatosis. Then, I should verify the clinical overlap that leads to diagnostic confusion. Next, I will examine the pathophysiologic mechanisms. After that, I should confirm the diagnostic criteria that separate them. Finally, I will review treatment implications to ensure the therapeutic divergence supports etiologic distinctness [^117AAvYk] [^112SxR74].

> Let me first confirm the etiologies to avoid any premature inference. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by human herpesvirus 8, also known as KSHV, and detection of HHV-8 latency associated nuclear antigen in tissue is a diagnostic cornerstone [^117AAvYk]. In contrast, bacillary angiomatosis is a vasoproliferative infection caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana, which are gram negative bacteria rather than oncogenic herpesviruses [^112SxR74] [^112WHj7x]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because clinical mimicry can sometimes mislead us, but on causality these diseases are etiologically distinct and do not share a common microbial cause [^116Fm5i9].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical overlap that drives the mistaken "association". Both Kaposi sarcoma and bacillary angiomatosis produce violaceous angioproliferative skin lesions in immunocompromised hosts, especially people with advanced HIV, and bacillary angiomatosis lesions are well described as mimicking Kaposi sarcoma clinically and even grossly on exam [^112WHj7x]. I should double check mechanistic angiogenesis in Bartonella infection, which induces vascular proliferation and can resemble Kaposi sarcoma lesions in appearance, thereby creating a diagnostic trap at the bedside [^111PG3ZH].

> I will now examine the biology to ensure there is no hidden causal link. In Kaposi sarcoma, KSHV oncogenes drive transformation of susceptible mesenchymal lineage cells and promote mesenchymal to endothelial transition with a neoplastic spindle cell phenotype, which is a viral oncogenesis model consistent with HHV-8 being necessary for disease [^114B69f8] [^116Fm5i9]. But wait, what if Bartonella were somehow upstream. Current evidence indicates Bartonella induces angiogenesis via host cytokines such as VEGF and IL 1 beta and IL 8, without malignant transformation, which supports infection driven reactive vasoproliferation rather than a neoplasm and argues against Bartonella as a cause of Kaposi sarcoma [^111PG3ZH].

> Next, I should review how we prove the diagnosis in tissue, because mutually exclusive pathogen detection strengthens the argument. For Kaposi sarcoma, expert pathology review with immunohistochemistry demonstrating HHV 8 LANA 1 is essential, and this viral signal is expected in lesional spindle cells if the diagnosis is correct [^117AAvYk]. For bacillary angiomatosis, Bartonella is identified by culture, PCR, or serology, while HHV 8 testing is not diagnostic for that entity, which further underscores their separation in practice and in pathogenesis [^112SxR74] [^112WHj7x]. Hold on, I should verify guideline level recommendations also call for histologic confirmation of Kaposi sarcoma when suspected, which they do [^115ke8Zs].

> Let me consider therapeutic implications as a sanity check. Kaposi sarcoma management hinges on HIV control with antiretroviral therapy and, when indicated, systemic agents such as liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel for symptomatic, advanced, or function threatening disease, which reflects treatment of a KSHV driven neoplasm rather than an antibacterial approach [^111RS2ab] [^113LQLDJ]. By contrast, bacillary angiomatosis is treated with prolonged antibiotics such as doxycycline or erythromycin for 8 to 12 weeks, and cures with antimicrobials, which would not be expected if this were Kaposi sarcoma biology, reinforcing that Bartonella does not cause Kaposi sarcoma [^112WHj7x].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Bartonella henselae is not causally associated with Kaposi sarcoma, and the perceived "association" arises from clinical mimicry of angioproliferative lesions in immunocompromised hosts rather than shared etiology, with Kaposi sarcoma requiring HHV 8 and bacillary angiomatosis resulting from Bartonella infection, and each diagnosis resting on pathogen specific testing with distinct, non overlapping treatments [^117AAvYk] [^112WHj7x] [^116Fm5i9].

---

In sum, **Bartonella henselae is not associated with Kaposi sarcoma** (KS); KS is caused by HHV-8 [^117AAvYk], and B. henselae causes bacillary angiomatosis (BA) [^116fj249], which can clinically and histologically mimic KS [^111PG3ZH] [^112WHj7x]. KS shows HHV-8 LANA-1 positivity [^117AAvYk], whereas BA shows Warthin-Starry–positive bacilli [^112SxR74]. Accurate diagnosis is essential because **KS requires antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy**, while **BA responds to antibiotics** [^112WHj7x].

## Pathogenesis and clinical features

| **Attribute** | **Kaposi sarcoma** | **Bacillary angiomatosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Etiology | KS is caused by HHV-8, which drives endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis [^117AAvYk] [^113b5TK1] | BA is caused by B. henselae or B. quintana [^112WHj7x], with cat exposure as a key risk [^114cqUYo] |
| Clinical presentation | Violaceous papules, nodules, or plaques on skin and mucosa; visceral involvement is common in immunocompromised patients [^111RS2ab] | Rapidly growing vascular lesions that mimic KS; often in immunocompromised hosts [^116fj249] [^112WHj7x] |
| Histopathology | Spindle cells, slit-like vascular spaces, and HHV-8 LANA-1 positivity [^117AAvYk] | Lobular capillary proliferation with neutrophilic infiltrate and Warthin-Starry–positive bacilli [^112SxR74] |

---

## Diagnostic differentiation

Accurate differentiation [^117AAvYk] between KS and BA is critical because **treatments and prognoses differ**. The following table summarizes key diagnostic features:

| **Feature** | **Kaposi sarcoma** | **Bacillary angiomatosis** |
|-|-|-|
| Etiologic agent | HHV-8 [^113b5TK1] | Bartonella henselae [^116fj249] |
| Histopathology | Spindle cells, slit-like vascular spaces [^112tbfkv] | Lobular capillary proliferation, neutrophilic infiltrate [^112SxR74] |
| Immunohistochemistry | HHV-8 LANA-1 positive [^117AAvYk] [^115ke8Zs] | Warthin-Starry positive bacilli [^112SxR74] |
| Clinical course | Indolent, chronic [^112tbfkv] | Rapidly progressive, acute [^112SxR74] |
| Treatment | Antiretroviral therapy, chemotherapy [^111RS2ab] | Antibiotics (doxycycline, erythromycin) [^112WHj7x] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

Kaposi sarcoma is managed with **antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy** [^111RS2ab] [^113uCjcQ]; prognosis varies with immune status and disease extent [^11296tf6]. In contrast, **bacillary angiomatosis** is treated with antibiotics [^112WHj7x] and carries an excellent prognosis with appropriate therapy [^112SxR74].

---

## Conclusion

Bartonella henselae is **not associated with Kaposi sarcoma**; KS is **HHV-8–driven** [^117AAvYk], whereas B. henselae causes BA [^116fj249], a KS mimic. Accurate diagnosis using histopathology and immunohistochemistry is essential to guide appropriate therapy [^117AAvYk].

### Successful treatment of bacillary angiomatosis with oral doxycycline in an HIV-infected child with skin lesions mimicking Kaposi sarcoma [^112WHj7x]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

BA is a rare multisystem bacterial infectious vasculoproliferative disorder caused by *Bartonella henselae* and *Bartonella quintana*, and it is most commonly seen in HIV-infected individuals with CD4 counts less than 200 cells per microliter. BA commonly presents in the skin but may affect almost any visceral organ, including the liver, spleen, or nasal cavity. Although there is no consensus treatment for BA, clinicians experienced in treating this condition recommend therapy with oral erythromycin or doxycycline for 8 to 12 weeks to avoid relapses.

KS is a rare angioproliferative opportunistic infection caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) that is also seen in HIV-infected patients with low CD4 counts. The overlapping constellation of cutaneous manifestations of BA and KS makes them clinically indistinguishable from each other when presenting as single or multiple violaceous papules, nodules, plaques, or tumors. Occasionally, clinical clues can lead toward one diagnosis or the other. KS may cause prominent lymphedema of the legs and oral lesions. BA may have a very rapid onset with swift growth of lesions, which may occur with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, further complicating the difficulty in distinguishing these entities without pathology. However, KS can also develop rapidly in severely immunocompromised patients and during immune reconstitution, and BA can have oral lesions that mimic KS. In addition, other HIV-associated dermatologic conditions, such as disseminated mycobacterial or fungal infections, can have similar presentations to those of KS or BA.

### Induction of a potential paracrine angiogenic loop between human THP-1 macrophages and human microvascular endothelial cells during Bartonella henselae infection [^111PG3ZH]. Infection and Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

Bartonella henselae is responsible for various disease syndromes that loosely correlate with the immune status of the host. In the immunocompromised individual, B. henselae-induced angiogenesis, or bacillary angiomatosis, is characterized by vascular proliferative lesions similar to those seen in Kaposi's sarcoma. We hypothesize that B. henselae-mediated interaction with immune cells, namely macrophages, induces potential angiogenic growth factors and cytokines, which contribute in a paracrine manner to the proliferation of endothelial cells.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a direct inducer of angiogenesis, and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), a potentiator of VEGF, were detected within 12 and 6 hours, respectively, in supernatants from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated human THP-1 macrophages exposed to live B. henselae. Pretreatment of macrophages with cytochalasin D, a phagocytosis inhibitor, yielded comparable results, suggesting that bacterium-cell attachment is sufficient for VEGF and IL-1beta induction.

IL-8, an angiogenic cytokine with chemotactic properties, was induced in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) within 6 hours of infection, whereas no IL-8 induction was observed in infected THP-1 cells. In addition, conditioned medium from infected macrophages induced the proliferation of HMEC-1, thus demonstrating angiogenic potential. These data suggest that Bartonella modulation of host or target cell cytokines and growth factors, rather than a direct role of the bacterium as an endothelial cell mitogen, is the predominant mechanism responsible for this process.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining the following workup for the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma:

- **Essential**: Review adequate slides from a paraffin block representative of the tumor by a pathologist with expertise in the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma. Perform a rebiopsy if the initial results are non-diagnostic. Conduct a histopathological review of an adequate biopsy (e.g. skin punch, incisional, or excisional), and perform adequate immunophenotyping to establish the diagnosis. An immunohistochemistry panel should include Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, HHV-8, and LANA-1.
- **Useful in certain circumstances**: Use immunohistochemistry markers CD31 and CD34 if it is unclear whether the tumor has a vascular origin. An additional biopsy of nodal or visceral sites should be encouraged if a coexisting disorder is suspected (e.g. infection, lymphoma, or multicentric Castleman disease).

### Evidence for Kaposi sarcoma originating from mesenchymal stem cell through KSHV-induced mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition [^114B69f8]. Cancer Research (2018). Low credibility.

The major transmission route for Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection is through the oral cavity via saliva. Kaposi sarcoma (KS) frequently occurs in the oral cavity of HIV-positive individuals and is often the first presenting sign of AIDS. However, the oral target cells for KSHV infection and the cellular origin of Kaposi sarcoma remain unknown.

Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that Kaposi sarcoma spindle cells may originate from virally modified oral mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). AIDS-KS spindle cells express neuroectodermal stem cell marker (Nestin) and oral MSC marker CD29, suggesting an oral/craniofacial MSC lineage of AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma. Moreover, oral MSCs show high susceptibility to KSHV infection, which promotes multilineage differentiation and mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition (MEndT).

KSHV infection of oral MSCs results in the expression of numerous cytokines, a characteristic of Kaposi sarcoma, and upregulation of Kaposi sarcoma signature and MEndT-associated genes. These findings propose that Kaposi sarcoma may originate from pluripotent MSC, with KSHV infection transforming MSC to Kaposi sarcoma-like cells through MEndT.

- **Significance**: These results suggest that Kaposi sarcomas, frequently arising in AIDS patients, originate from neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cells, with possible implications for improving the clinical treatment of this malignancy.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117Pqy7M]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines specifically address the management of limited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma. They recommend treating patients with relapsed or progressive disease after first-line therapy as for advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal Kaposi sarcoma.

Consider performing a biopsy of lesions in cases of progressive, relapsed, or refractory disease, as these areas may mimic Kaposi sarcoma and could be areas of post-inflammatory pigment. If Kaposi sarcoma is confirmed, evaluate for inadequate HIV control as a potential contributing factor to inadequate Kaposi sarcoma control. Address possible changes in antiretroviral therapy in conjunction with an HIV specialist.

Consider repeating the use of previously effective therapy if Kaposi sarcoma relapses or progresses after an initial response, particularly if the response was durable.

### Identification of novel zoonotic activity of Bartonella spp. France [^114cqUYo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Bartonella spp. cause varied and multifaceted human diseases, including cat scratch disease (B. henselae), Carrion's disease (B. bacilliformis), trench fever (B. quintana), endocarditis (B. quintana and B. henselae), bacillary angiomatosis (B. quintana and B. henselae), and hepatic peliosis (B. henselae). Bartonella spp. can also cause prolonged intra-erythrocytic bacteremia in both humans and animals: in humans, B. quintana, B. bacilliformis, and B. rochalimae are known pathogens, and in animals, B. henselae, B. clarridgeiae, and B. koehlerae have been identified in felids; B. grahamii, B. taylorii, B. doshiae, B. birtlesii, and others in rodents; and B. bovis, B. chomelii, B. schoenbuchensis in ruminants. In humans, chronic bacteremia caused by B. quintana causes few obvious symptoms apart from generalized fatigue and nonspecific leg pain.

It has been assumed that each Bartonella species infected one or a few closely related mammalian reservoir hosts, in which infection caused long-lasting bacteremia. Non-reservoir hosts were considered incidentally infected without bacteria being detected in blood. Recently, these assumptions have been contradicted by studies describing animal-associated Bartonella spp. indirectly associated with bacteremia and a spectrum of diverse symptoms in immunocompetent persons who had contact with animals, arthropods, or both, which are natural routes of Bartonella transmission. In some cases, the source of infection remains unknown; ticks have been suggested as a possible source of animal-associated Bartonella infection in humans.

### Persistent Kaposi sarcoma in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy: Characterizing the predictors of clinical response [^115naBHK]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

To evaluate the role of highly active antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy on tumor response among persons with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, and to identify factors associated with response in a clinical setting, a retrospective cohort study was conducted.

One hundred and fourteen patients from two HIV clinics with a diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma were identified via a clinical database. Their records were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma and to abstract clinical and chemotherapy information. Additionally, demographics, laboratory values, and highly active antiretroviral therapy use were abstracted electronically. Cox's proportional hazards models were utilized to identify predictors of Kaposi sarcoma improvement and resolution.

Thirty-six months following the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma, the rate of improvement among 64 patients with confirmed cases was 77%, with a complete resolution rate of 51%. In univariate analyses, recent chemotherapy was associated with Kaposi sarcoma improvement, while recent HIV viral load and highly active antiretroviral therapy were linked to both improvement and resolution. No measured baseline characteristics, such as tumor stage, diagnosis year, CD4 T-cell count, HIV viral load, or prior highly active antiretroviral therapy history, nor recent CD4 T-cell counts predicted improvement or resolution. In multivariate analyses, recent chemotherapy (hazard ratio 5.5, 95% confidence interval: 2.7–11.2, P < 0.001) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (hazard ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval: 1.4–12.6, P = 0.01) were identified as predictors of improvement.

### Bartonellosis [^112SxR74]. Clinics in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Bartonella spp are fastidious bacteria that occur in the blood of humans and mammals. They are usually vector-borne but can also be transmitted through animal scratches and bites. The bartonelloses of medical importance include Carrión's disease, trench fever, cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, and peliosis hepatis.

- **Carrión's disease**: Known as Oroya fever in the acute phase and verruga peruana (Peruvian wart) in its chronic form, it has manifestations that have traditionally been restricted to dwellers of the high, dry Andean valleys. However, new sites of the disease are emerging.

- **Trench fever**: Associated with louse-borne disease and homelessness.

- **Cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, and peliosis hepatis** are increasingly recognized as causes of human disease, especially in susceptible groups such as HIV-infected individuals.

Bartonella spp are considered emerging human pathogens. The clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions are discussed.

### Bartonella species bacteremia in two patients with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma [^115Uartu]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Bartonella henselae and B. koehlerae bacteremia was documented in two patients with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and B. koehlerae bacteremia in an asymptomatic partner of one of the patients. Considering the biology and clinically variable natural history of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, these results suggest that chronic Bartonella infection could have a role in the development of this vascular neoplasm. Bartonella spp. are known to induce vasoproliferative tumors in immunocompromised patients and may play a role in the development of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma in immunocompetent patients.

### Today's Kaposi sarcoma is not the same as it was 40 years ago, or is it [^113LMKg1]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

This review provides an overview of the notion that Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a disease that manifests under diverse and divergent circumstances. We begin with a historical introduction of KS and KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), highlighting the diversity of clinical presentations of KS. We also summarize what is known about the cell of origin for this tumor, explore KSHV viral load as a potential biomarker for acute KSHV infections and KS-associated complications, and discuss immune modulators that impact KSHV infection, KSHV persistence, and KS disease.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^115uNxz2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

Although it has been proposed that the risk of Kaposi sarcoma among HIV-infected individuals who have responded to cART may be a function of age and/or the duration of HIV infection, this association has not, to our knowledge, been fully explored. We, therefore, used a large dataset of men with well-estimated dates of HIV seroconversion (i.e. change in status from being HIV antibody negative to having HIV antibody detected) to evaluate whether the duration of HIV infection and age were associated with the risk of Kaposi sarcoma among HIV-infected homosexual men after the initiation of cART. Associations of aspects of immunosuppression with risk were also explored, including CD4 cell count, HIV RNA level, nadir CD4 cell count (i.e. the lowest CD4 cell count ever recorded for an individual), and the time-weighted average CD4 cell count throughout follow-up since HIV seroconversion.

We also explored associations between various CD4 cell levels and Kaposi sarcoma incidence among nontreated and cART-treated HIV-infected men to evaluate the extent to which the association between starting cART and the risk of Kaposi sarcoma may be mediated through CD4 cell count. Finally, because individuals who are known to have undergone HIV seroconversion are, by definition, diagnosed and come under medical care after infection, we compared our estimates of survival following a Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis with those derived from other cohorts of patients with prevalent HIV infection to provide information on whether late diagnosis of HIV is associated with prognosis for Kaposi sarcoma.

### Kaposi sarcoma in people living with HIV: incidence and associated factors in a French cohort between 2010 and 2015 [^11296tf6]. AIDS (2020). High credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma is still observed among people living with HIV (PLHIV), including those on ART with undetectable HIV viral load (HIV-VL). We aimed to assess Kaposi sarcoma incidence and trends between 2010 and 2015 in France and to highlight associated factors.

- **Design**: Retrospective study using longitudinal data from the Dat'AIDS cohort, including 44,642 PLWH. For the incidence assessment, Kaposi sarcoma cases occurring within 30 days of cohort enrollment were excluded.

- **Methods**: Demographic, immunological, and therapeutic characteristics were collected at the time of Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis or at the last visit for patients without Kaposi sarcoma.

- **Results**: Among 180,216.4 person-years, Kaposi sarcoma incidence was 76 (95% CI 64.3–89.9)/10,000 person-years. Multivariate analysis (Poisson regression) revealed a positive association with male sex, MSM transmission route, lower CD4 T-cell count, higher CD8 T-cell count, and not being on ART. Meanwhile, HIV follow-up time and duration with an HIV-VL of 50 copies/ml or less were negatively associated with Kaposi sarcoma. According to the different models tested, HIV-VL, CD4:CD8 ratio, and nadir CD4 cell count were associated with Kaposi sarcoma. Moreover, stratified analysis showed that patients with a CD4:CD8 ratio of 0.5 or less or a CD8 T-cell count greater than 1000 cells/μl were at higher risk of Kaposi sarcoma, regardless of the CD4 T-cell count.

- **Conclusion**: This study showed that in a resource-rich country setting with high ART coverage, Kaposi sarcoma still occurred among PLWH. CD8 hyperlymphocytosis and CD4:CD8 ratio should now be considered important factors.

### Bartonella infection associated with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [^1147KCn9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

A 4-year-old girl with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis had Bartonella infection diagnosed serologically. This case suggested that Bartonella (most probably Bartonella henselae) infection may, in part, be responsible for the development of systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

### Kaposi sarcoma of childhood: Inborn or acquired immunodeficiency to oncogenic HHV-8 [^11126D4h]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an inflammatory neoplasm of endothelial cell origin first defined by Hungarian dermatologist Moritz Kaposi in 1872. KS is probably a polyclonal proliferation of spindle cells latently infected by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), which often evolves into an oligoclonal/monoclonal disorder. It is currently classified under four epidemiologic forms.

- **Classic KS**: Primarily affects elderly men mostly over 60 years old of Eastern European and Mediterranean origin, typically presenting with indolent and chronic cutaneous plaques and nodules.
- **Endemic KS**: In Sub-Saharan Africa affects younger adults, with a rapidly progressive lymphadenopathic course.
- **Epidemic KS**: In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.
- **Iatrogenic KS**: In medically immunosuppressed (e.g. transplanted) patients, typically follows a rapidly progressive course, affecting the skin, mucosae, lymphatic system, and visceral organs.

HHV-8, also designated as KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is the causative agent for all epidemiological forms of KS in all patients. The vast majority of HHV-8 infected individuals (more than 40% individuals in some populations, based on seroprevalence) do not develop KS. This virus can cause at least two other conditions — some forms of multicentric Castleman's disease and primary effusion lymphoma — both of which can, however, occur in the absence of HHV-8 infection.

The prevalence of HHV-8 varies globally, with high levels of more than 40% seropositivity in parts of Africa.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113uCjcQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend offering systemic therapy to patients with advanced symptomatic cutaneous, visceral, nodal, or oral disease. The goal is to reduce or reverse symptoms, lymphedema, or threat to organ function. Complete remissions are recognized as rare. Treatment should continue until unacceptable toxicity or a plateau in response is reached. Maintenance therapy beyond two cycles of systemic therapy after determining a plateau is not recommended. If the response is clinically acceptable, consider observing patients while continuing antiretroviral therapy in those with HIV. Otherwise, alternative therapy should be initiated.

### Insights into the molecular biology and sero-epidemiology of Kaposi's sarcoma [^111VGoJf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in established market economies has fallen since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it remains the most common tumor in individuals with HIV infection. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and its role in the subversion of cellular machinery provides an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in immunobiology and carcinogenesis. The focus of this review is to discuss articles published from August 2001 to August 2002 that provide advances in our knowledge of this process, and also to review new data concerning the transmission and identification of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection in different populations.
- **Recent findings**: We have an improved understanding of the epidemiologies of classic, endemic, post-transplant, and AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. The role of specific genes in tumorigenesis has been further defined, with particular reference to the switch from latent to lytic infection and the involvement of cytokines and angiogenic factors.
- **Summary**: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is widespread in immunosuppressed individuals and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The study of Kaposi's sarcoma and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus represents an important model of the interplay between the immune system and cancer and may lead to the development of clinically useful therapies including vaccines.

### Bartonella henselae in skin biopsy specimens of patients with cat-scratch disease [^114Miety]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

We isolated *Bartonella henselae* from skin biopsy specimens of three patients with cat-scratch disease (CSD). Patients with CSD typically exhibit gradual regional lymph node enlargement accompanied by a papule that develops along the scratch line within 3–10 days. This papule may persist for a few days or as long as 2–3 weeks. The histopathologic appearance of the skin lesion resembles lymph node changes, consisting of a diffuse inflammatory cell infiltrate, with numerous neutrophils and histiocytes, mixed with scattered eosinophils and plasma cells.

Unusual skin manifestations may include morbilliform eruptions, urticaria, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme, and erythema marginatum. The presence of *B. henselae* in the skin papule was initially proposed by Wear et al, who reported that both the primary inoculation site and the lymph nodes of patients with CSD contained the same small Gram-negative bacilli. Using immunohistochemical staining, Lin et al. found *B. henselae* in the cytoplasm of histiocytes within the granulomatous lesions in nine lymph nodes and one skin biopsy specimen from patients with CSD. Avidor et al. identified *B. henselae* in the inflammatory papules and pustules of two patients with CSD. Our group recently identified *B. henselae* in patients presenting with scalp eschars and neck lymphadenopathy following tick bites. Additionally, Fournier et al. detected *B. henselae* in two skin biopsy specimens of a primary papule from patients in Australia who were clinically suspected of having CSD.

Swabs of lesions for the diagnosis and culture of *B. henselae* are not widely used. Fournier et al. found that swabs from six primary skin papules from patients with suspected CSD were useful for diagnosis.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^111qpR4b]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

As far as we know, this is the first case-control study reporting the use of glucocorticoids as a risk factor for KS-IRIS and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Some independent risk factors for KS-IRIS reported in the literature are detectable plasma HHV-8 DNA, hematocrit less than 30%, clinical Kaposi's sarcoma at pre-ART visit, CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 50 cells/μl, ART alone as Kaposi's sarcoma treatment, T1 Kaposi's sarcoma stage, plasma HIV-1 RNA more than 5 log 10 copies/ml, and tumor-associated edema. However, exposure to glucocorticoid therapy was not reported in these studies.

Mortality associated with Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported as 32.8% in individuals developing KS-IRIS and 11.1% in non-IRIS individuals, with a 3.3-fold higher mortality in African individuals compared with European individuals. Factors previously associated with mortality include KS-IRIS, lack of chemotherapy, CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells/μl before ART initiation, and a detectable HHV-8 load. To our knowledge, the association of glucocorticoid use with Kaposi's sarcoma-related mortality has not been evaluated before. Our study has shown four-fold odds of Kaposi's sarcoma-related mortality in individuals receiving glucocorticoids, after controlling for possible confounding factors. Glucocorticoid therapy has also been clinically associated with the development of Kaposi's sarcoma in non-HIV-related diseases such as in transplant recipients, rheumatic disorders, asthma, lung cancer, dermatologic diseases, and atopic dermatitis.

Regarding the medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, specifically with respect to regimens for systemic therapy (first-line), the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend offering the following options for first-line systemic therapy:

- **Preferred regimens**: Liposomal doxorubicin 20 mg/m² IV every 2 to 3 weeks; sirolimus (for transplant Kaposi sarcoma) with a loading dose of 0.15 mg/kg PO followed by 0.04–0.06 mg/kg/day to maintain trough blood levels of 6–10 ng/mL or 2 mg PO daily (adjust to maintain trough levels of 6–10 ng/mL).
- **Other recommended regimens**: Paclitaxel 60 mg/m² IV weekly, 100 mg/m² IV every 2 weeks, 100 mg/m² IV every 3 weeks, or 135 mg/m² IV every 3 weeks.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^11791VKn]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

During the period between January 2008 and August 2014, 169 individuals were diagnosed with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma at our institution. Of those, 24 were deemed ineligible for this study because they were not receiving ART before or at Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosis, and thus, would not be a suitable population for the study of IRIS. We included 145 individuals who started ART during the aforementioned period and had a clinical and histological diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma. Of those, five were women (3.45%).

The median age of individuals at Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosis was 32 years [interquartile range (IQR), 28–39]. Sixty-three had mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (43.4%); nine had visceral Kaposi's sarcoma (6.2%); 73 had visceral and mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (50.3%). Additionally, 102 had a concomitant opportunistic infection (70.3%); 51 received chemotherapy (35.2%); and 60 received glucocorticoids (41.4%). The median CD4+ cell count at Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosis was 90.5 cells/μl (IQR, 34.5–160.7); the median CD8+ cell count was 586.5 cells/μl (IQR, 275.5–1057); and the median HIV load was 60 805 (IQR, 171.7–313,717.7).

IRIS could not be assessed in 10 individuals due to insufficient follow-up, excluding them from the IRIS analysis. Of the remaining 135 individuals, 50 developed KS-IRIS (37%). Among them, 17 had unmasking IRIS (12.6%) and 33 had paradoxical IRIS (24.4%). The median time to KS-IRIS was 60 days (IQR, 30–97.5). Fifty-eight individuals (42.96%) were treated with glucocorticoids.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^113DVAYV]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

We also found that over time both the CD4 cell count and the nadir for CD4 cell count at Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis shifted to higher levels. One explanation for these findings is that the increased medical care accompanying treatment with cART increases the opportunity for symptoms and lesions to be identified and examined at an early stage. Other explanations are that cART may not control human herpesvirus 8, which is considered a necessary cause of Kaposi sarcoma, and the causal relation between human herpesvirus 8 and Kaposi sarcoma development may not be directly mediated through the improvement of the immune system.

Finally, the observed increase in CD4 cell levels at Kaposi sarcoma diagnosis may be due to a change in Kaposi sarcoma site. It has been reported that the decline in Kaposi sarcoma incidence since the introduction of cART has affected Kaposi sarcoma with visceral involvement more strongly than cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma. Among cART-treated patients, Kaposi sarcoma with nonvisceral involvement appears to be diagnosed at higher levels of CD4 cells than visceral Kaposi sarcoma.

### Cat scratch disease and Bartonellaceae: The known, the unknown and the curious [^117LLA2G]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Since the early 1900s, Bartonella species were known only to cause human disease resulting from very restricted geographic (bartonellosis) or environmental influences ("trench fever"). In the 1990s, and in parallel, cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis were definitively linked to Bartonella species. Subsequently, the widespread use of modern diagnostic methods revealed the broad ecological niche of this organism and greatly expanded our knowledge of the epidemiology and clinical presentations associated with this genus.

A large number of reservoirs and vectors involved with Bartonella propagation and transmission to humans have been identified; cats and various arthropods remain the most well-studied at the time of writing. Though not completely understood, it appears that specific immune-modulated interactions between the infecting species and host-related factors play a major role in the observed breadth of human clinical syndromes associated with Bartonellae, the large differences in immunopathologic features of tissue samples among different syndromes, and potentially the varied responses to antimicrobial therapy.

Further, the clinical management for cat scratch disease in particular is quite variable among clinicians, reflecting a poor evidence base. No preventive measures have been developed beyond suggestions to avoid at-risk behavior with known vectors.

### Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-negative men having sex with men [^114xSD3f]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

Four epidemiologic forms of Kaposi's sarcoma have been described, all of which are associated with the human herpesvirus-8. In western countries, human herpesvirus-8 is more prevalent in homosexual men than in the general population, and anecdotal cases of Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-negative homosexual men have been reported.
- **Patients and methods**: We included HIV-negative homosexual and bisexual male patients with histologically proven Kaposi's sarcoma in a retrospective study. Clinical data were collected using a standardized form. Risk factors for human herpesvirus-8 infection and for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma were systematically recorded.
- **Results**: Between 1995 and 2007, 28 men met the defined inclusion criteria. Mean age at first symptoms of Kaposi's sarcoma was 53 years. Clinical presentation resembled classical Kaposi's sarcoma, with limited disease in most patients. No cellular or humoral immunodeficiency was observed. Serologic tests for human herpesvirus-8 (latent immunofluorescence assay) were positive in 88% of patients, and only two patients displayed human herpesvirus-8 viremia at the time of Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosis. Three patients developed lymphoproliferative disorders (Castleman disease, follicular lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma). In this population, alpha-interferon was well tolerated and gave a complete response, but most patients require only local treatment, if any.
- **Conclusion**: Kaposi's sarcoma may develop in homosexual or bisexual men without HIV infection. This type of Kaposi's sarcoma has clinical features in common with classic Kaposi's sarcoma.

### Kaposi's sarcoma following immune suppressive therapy for Wegener's granulomatosis [^116pfPFw]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

The association between Kaposi's sarcoma and infection with human herpesvirus 8 is now well recognized. Immunologic impairment is associated with two forms of Kaposi's sarcoma: epidemic (associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) and iatrogenic (associated with immunosuppressive treatment). Both forms have become more common during the last decade.

We describe an HIV-negative 54-year-old man who developed Kaposi's sarcoma two months after the beginning of immunosuppressive therapy for Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). With tapering of medication, complete remission of Kaposi's sarcoma was achieved in one year. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of iatrogenic Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient with WG.

### Bartonella spp. transmission by ticks not established [^112coFqm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Infections with Bartonella spp. appear to be widespread in many animal species besides cats. Some evidence has been advanced in support of the possibility of tick transmission, which has resulted in diagnostic testing and empiric therapies directed at B. henselae infection that are of dubious value concerning illnesses thought to be caused by deer tick exposure. We critically examined the reported findings regarding tick transmission of Bartonella spp.

Bartonella spp. are common bacterial hemoparasites of mammals. For as long as 100 years, two species have been known to cause infections of public health significance. Trench fever, caused by B. quintana (formerly Rochalimaea quintana) and transmitted by body lice, affected hundreds of thousands of soldiers or displaced persons during World War I and still affects homeless persons to this day. Oroya fever (and its chronic manifestation, verruga peruana), caused by infection with B. bacilliformis and transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies, is a potentially severe febrile disease. Although it is geographically restricted to the high altitudes of the Andes and affects only a relatively small number of persons, the high case-fatality rate brought attention to this apparent anthroponosis as early as the late 1800s.

B. henselae causes cat-scratch disease, the most common Bartonella spp. infection in the United States. The hallmark of cat-scratch disease is enlargement and tenderness of lymph nodes draining the site of inoculation of the microorganism. Additionally, a skin or mucous membrane lesion may be observed at the site of inoculation.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^11545W3j]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

This study had several limitations that should be discussed. First, we did not have information on treatment adherence and, therefore, assumed that patients remained on therapy once it was initiated. If diagnoses of Kaposi sarcoma are largely occurring in individuals who have stopped using combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) or have poor adherence to the treatment regimen, the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma in the cART follow-up group will have been overestimated. To evaluate this possibility, we performed sensitivity analyses considering follow-up time for those in the cART follow-up group whose HIV RNA level remained at less than 1000 copies per milliliter. This analysis had no effect on estimates of the associations of HIV infection duration, age, or CD4 levels with risk of Kaposi sarcoma (data not shown).

Second, in the cART follow-up group, associations between various factors and risk of Kaposi sarcoma were based on only 70 Kaposi sarcoma events and a limited median follow-up of 4.5 years (IQR = 1.9–7.3 years). Thus, because of the small number of events, this analysis may have lacked the power to detect associations between duration of infection, age, or nadir CD4 cell count and risk of Kaposi sarcoma. However, because we did find associations between CD4 cell count and risk of Kaposi sarcoma, we concluded that, if an effect of duration of infection, age, or nadir CD4 cell count exists, it should be smaller than the effect of the level of immunosuppression (as measured by CD4 cell count).

### Classic Kaposi's sarcoma in a Nepalese woman from a purportedly nonendemic area [^113E8rjd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) occurs in four types: classic, endemic, immunosuppression-associated, and AIDS-associated. The presence of KS-associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8) DNA in the tissue samples of 95% of all variants of KS has confirmed its role in the aetiopathogenesis of KS. It is now believed that these clinical variants most likely represent different manifestations of the same pathological process. Our case represents the first case of classic KS from our region.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115wCuxf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend monitoring patients with HIV-related Kaposi sarcoma, especially those with advanced immunosuppression, closely for opportunistic infections, marrow suppression with neutropenic fever, or thrombocytopenic bleeding. Collaborate with an HIV specialist to ensure adequate opportunistic infection prophylaxis appropriate to the CD4+ T-cell count, which may temporarily decrease with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Growth factor support may be needed to facilitate systemic therapy.

### Molecularly targeted therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma in a kidney transplant patient: Case report, "what worked and what did not" [^112uSf7H]. BMC Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Imatinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for which there is limited information regarding its effects on AIDS Kaposi's sarcoma and none in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used for kidney transplants, exhibits antiangiogenic activity related to impaired production of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). Clinical benefit has been reported in Kaposi's sarcoma associated with renal grafts.
- **Case presentation**: We report a case of an 80-year-old male who developed Kaposi's sarcoma nine months after receiving a living, non-related donor kidney transplant at age 74. Three years after treatment with different chemotherapeutic agents for progressive cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma with no visceral involvement, he was prescribed Imatinib (200 mg/day for two weeks followed by 400 mg/day). After four weeks of treatment, he developed anasarca, further progression of KS, and agranulocytosis. Imatinib was discontinued, and significant clinical recovery was observed. One year later, his immunosuppressive therapy was changed to Sirolimus, and regression of the Kaposi's sarcoma occurred.
- **Conclusion**: The lack of benefit and severe toxicity associated with the use of Imatinib in this patient should alert clinicians to potentially adverse consequences of its use in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. On the other hand, the positive response seen in this patient to Sirolimus, even following a long evolution of Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple chemotherapy regimens, and extensive cutaneous disease, further suggests its therapeutic potential.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115627NE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines specifically address antiretroviral therapy. The guidelines recommend initiating systemic Kaposi sarcoma-directed therapy as soon as possible in all patients with HIV who have symptomatic Kaposi sarcoma, such as edema, oral Kaposi sarcoma, or other manifestations that interfere with normal functions or activities.

In patients with limited cutaneous disease, urgent initiation of systemic Kaposi sarcoma therapy should be considered if Kaposi sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is present. Signs of past immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome may also indicate the need for earlier initiation of systemic Kaposi sarcoma therapy. Antiretroviral therapy should not be delayed or discontinued unless life-threatening immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome develops. It is important to recognize that the reconstitution of immune function is crucial for obtaining and maintaining control or remission of Kaposi sarcoma.

### KSHV/HHV8-associated intestinal Kaposi's sarcoma in patient with ulcerative colitis receiving immunosuppressive drugs: Report of a case [^111Cqm34]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), has been identified in all four forms of Kaposi's sarcoma: classic, endemic, HIV-associated, and iatrogenic. We report the rare case of an intestinal (small intestine and rectosigmoid) Kaposi's sarcoma in a 62-year-old HIV-negative man with ulcerative colitis. This patient was receiving immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and azathioprine. At the time of writing, the causative role of KSHV/HHV8 in the pathophysiology of Kaposi's sarcoma associated with ulcerative colitis has only been proven for cutaneous lesions, not for intestinal lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma.

For the first time, we report the expression of HHV8 (using immunohistochemistry) in colonic Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient with an ulcerative colitis-related tumor. The patient underwent a total proctocolectomy. At laparotomy, numerous Kaposi's sarcoma lesions were found in the small intestine, which were left in situ. Forty months after surgery and following withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy, the patient had no evidence of any disease and a normal abdominal and thoracic CT scan.

Cases of colorectal Kaposi's sarcoma complicating inflammatory bowel disease should be managed with a conservative approach and discontinuation of the immunosuppressive treatment. However, discontinuation of the immunosuppression is not always possible; in those cases, chemotherapy may be indicated.

In the medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, specifically regarding the management of advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal Kaposi sarcoma, the 2019 NCCN guidelines recommend considering a biopsy of lesions in cases of progressive, relapsed, or refractory disease. These lesions may be areas of post-inflammatory pigment and/or mimickers of Kaposi sarcoma. Upon confirmation of Kaposi sarcoma, it is important to evaluate for inadequate HIV control as this may contribute to insufficient control of Kaposi sarcoma. Potential changes in antiretroviral therapy should be considered in consultation with an HIV specialist.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend offering systemic therapy to patients with advanced Kaposi sarcoma who are not on antiretroviral therapy at the time of presentation as soon as possible after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy to minimize the risk of severe Kaposi sarcoma-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. It is important to recognize that the risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is higher in patients with baseline low CD4 T-cell counts and high HIV viral loads.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for Kaposi sarcoma according to the NCCN, more specifically with respect to staging, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend using the following staging classification for Kaposi sarcoma:

- **Good risk (all of the following)**: T0. Confined to skin and/or lymph nodes and/or minimal oral disease (non-nodular Kaposi sarcoma confined to palate); I0. CD4+ T-cell count ≥ 150/mcL; S0. No history of opportunistic infection or thrush, no "B" symptoms, Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70.
- **Poor risk (any of the following)**: T1. Tumor-associated edema or ulceration, extensive oral Kaposi sarcoma, gastrointestinal Kaposi sarcoma, or Kaposi sarcoma in organs other than lymph nodes; I1. CD4+ T-cell count < 150/mcL; S1. A history of opportunistic infection or thrush, "B" symptoms (unexplained fever, night sweats, > 10% involuntary weight loss, or diarrhea persisting > 2 weeks), Karnofsky Performance Status < 70, other HIV-related illnesses (e.g. neurologic disease, lymphoma).

### Genotypic and clinicopathological characterization of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection in Japan [^115FQr3r]. Journal of medical virology (2010). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally related to Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and a subset of cases of multicentric Castleman's disease. As the number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients has increased, KSHV-associated diseases have also risen in Japan. Sporadic cases of classic Kaposi's sarcoma have been reported in Japan.

In the present study, the clinicopathological characteristics of 75 samples, comprising 68 cases of Kaposi's sarcoma, 5 cases of primary effusion lymphoma, and 5 cases of multicentric Castleman's disease, were investigated. All of these cases were positive for KSHV by immunohistochemistry or PCR analysis. Out of the fifty-two AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma cases, all were males, whereas 7 of the 13 non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma cases were females. The mean age of patients with AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma or primary effusion lymphoma was 46 years, whereas the mean age of patients with non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma or primary effusion lymphoma was 71.8 and 97.5, respectively.

KSHV genotypes were determined based on the sequence of variable region 1 in the K1 gene. Genotypes A and C of KSHV were detected in both AIDS- and non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Genotype A was detected more frequently in AIDS-associated cases than non-AIDS-associated cases, suggesting that genotype C is broadly distributed in Japan and genotype A spreads among AIDS patients. Genotype D was detected only in non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. These data confirmed the difference between AIDS- and non-AIDS-associated cases.

### Kaposi sarcoma incidence and survival among HIV-infected homosexual men after HIV seroconversion [^117C8zeJ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2010). Low credibility.

The development of Kaposi sarcoma requires infection with human herpesvirus 8, yet not all individuals infected with this virus will develop the disease. There is substantial evidence indicating a strong association between Kaposi sarcoma and immune suppression. The risk of Kaposi sarcoma increases as immune function becomes progressively impaired in HIV-infected individuals. Conversely, HIV-infected individuals with intact immune systems appear to have a relatively low risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma.

This association is further supported by the observation that since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), declines in the risk of Kaposi sarcoma have been reported due to the suppression of HIV viral replication and improved immune function. These declines align with reductions observed in the rate of other AIDS-defining conditions, which include a set of opportunistic infections and malignancies as defined by the European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS. Moreover, studies have documented regression of Kaposi sarcoma following successful suppression of HIV-1 RNA and increases in CD4+ lymphocyte counts after the initiation of cART.

Given previous reports describing Kaposi sarcoma lesions among cART-treated individuals whose HIV RNA is undetectable by assays and who have a high CD4 cell count, the exact role of immunosuppression and determinants of risk for Kaposi sarcoma since the introduction of cART remains unknown. A cluster of Kaposi sarcoma cases among nine seemingly unrelated HIV-infected homosexual men has been described.

### Is pyogenic granuloma associated with Bartonella infection [^113CuYdB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Lobular capillary hemangioma and bacillary angiomatosis due to Bartonella infection share several clinical and histopathologic characteristics. We sought to determine whether lobular capillary hemangioma is caused by the same agent as bacillary angiomatosis. Forty-five pathology specimens with a histologic diagnosis of lobular capillary hemangioma obtained from patients with the same clinical diagnosis were tested by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction for the presence of DNA elements of Bartonella spp. None of the 45 lobular capillary hemangioma specimens tested positive for Bartonella spp. We conclude that lobular capillary hemangioma is not associated with Bartonella spp infection. Further research is required to determine the etiologic agent.

### AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116th93B]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

The medical management of Kaposi sarcoma, as outlined by the NCCN, emphasizes several general principles. The 2019 guidelines highlight the significance of recognizing that Kaposi sarcoma is often complicated by lymphedema, which increases the risk of cellulitis and deep tissue infections in affected limbs. There is an increased risk of severe lymphedema and delayed wound healing following radiation exposure. It is advisable to consult a lymphedema specialist.

In cases of advanced cutaneous disease, radiation should be reserved for situations where systemic therapy is not feasible, with objectives focused on palliation or short-term disease management until systemic therapy can be administered. It is important to note that treatment responses may be delayed in the presence of significant lymphedema.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^114P1wpP]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is associated with the use of glucocorticoids. All variables included in the univariate and multivariate analyses are listed in Table 1. The univariate analysis indicated that glucocorticoid use was more frequent in individuals with KS-IRIS than in those without KS-IRIS (54.9% vs. 36.47%, P = 0.0474). After adjusting for possible confounding variables, glucocorticoid use was still a risk factor for the development of KS-IRIS (unadjusted OR = 2.045, 95% CI = 1.005–4.16, P = 0.0484; adjusted OR = 2.3622, 95% CI = 1.0838–5.149, P = 0.0306). Individuals treated with glucocorticoids had a significantly higher hazard ratio for KS-IRIS than those not treated with glucocorticoids (P = 0.03; Fig. 1a).
- **Association of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality with the use of glucocorticoids**: Table 1 presents this association.

Regarding the medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend considering offering the following subsequent systemic therapy options for patients with relapsed or refractory advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal disease in certain circumstances:

- **Albumin-bound paclitaxel**: Use if paclitaxel intolerant, 100 mg IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
- **Etoposide**: 50 mg/day PO for 7 days of each 14-day cycle. After 2 cycles, escalate the dose to 100 mg/day PO for 7 days of each 14-day cycle in patients without partial or complete response and no toxicity greater than Grade 2. The dose can be further escalated to 150 mg/day based on tolerance and response.
- **Imatinib**: 400 mg/day PO.
- **Nivolumab plus ipilimumab**: 240 mg IV every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks.
- **Nivolumab alone**: 480 mg IV every 4 weeks.
- **Pembrolizumab**: 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for up to 6 months.
- **Sirolimus for transplant-associated Kaposi sarcoma**: Loading dose of 0.15 mg/kg PO followed by 0.04–0.06 mg/kg/day to maintain trough blood levels of 6–10 ng/mL, or 2 mg PO daily (adjust to maintain trough levels of 6–10 ng/mL).
- **Thalidomide for patients with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome**: 200 mg/day PO as a starting dose, titrated to effect and tolerability.

The NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend specific diagnostic investigations for Kaposi sarcoma during initial evaluation. The following workup is suggested for selected patients:

- **Pregnancy testing**: In patients of childbearing potential if chemotherapy or radiation therapy is planned.
- **Evaluation for suspected opportunistic infections**.

- **Stool hemoccult**: In the setting of advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal involvement.
- **Chest X-ray (CXR)**: In the setting of advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal disease, or any pulmonary symptoms.
- **Chest CT with contrast and bronchoscopy**: If unexplained pulmonary symptoms or abnormalities are present on CXR.
- **Abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast or MRI with and without contrast and EGD/colonoscopy**: If gastrointestinal symptoms or positive hemoccult are observed.
- **FDG-PET/CT and/or laboratory workup**: These are recommended if there are concerns for coexisting Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-associated inflammatory cytokine syndrome, multicentric Castleman disease, or Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-positive lymphoma, or other Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-associated diseases. Laboratory workup, including CRP, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus serum viral load, SPEP, IL-6, or IL-10, is useful in patients with clinical features such as fever, dyspnea, effusions that are concerning for Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-associated inflammatory cytokine syndrome or multicentric Castleman disease.
- **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)**: If anthracycline is planned or there is a suspected pericardial effusion.

The guidelines also encourage beginning discussions regarding the potential treatment options and further evaluation for each individual case.

### Looking for the target cell of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [^112BpBGz]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

The level of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) cellular viremia in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma could be related to both the tumor burden and its progression. The origin of the spindle cell, the hallmark cell of Kaposi's sarcoma, is still debated. Two hypotheses may be formulated, favoring a lymphatic endothelial cell or an endothelial-cell precursor evolving into a lymphatic phenotype, both preferentially targeted by KSHV.

### Potential for tick-borne bartonelloses [^116fj249]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Bartonella spp. are gram-negative bacilli or coccobacilli that belong to the α-2 subgroup of Proteobacteria. According to 16S rDNA gene comparisons, they are closely related to the genera Brucella and Agrobacterium. A remarkable feature of the genus Bartonella is the ability of a single species to cause either acute or chronic infection that can result in vascular proliferative lesions or suppurative and granulomatous inflammation. The pathologic response to infection with Bartonella spp. varies substantially with the status of the host's immune system; vasoproliferative lesions are most frequently reported in immunocompromised patients.

At the time of writing, 13 Bartonella species and subspecies have been associated with an increasing spectrum of clinical syndromes in humans, including cat-scratch disease and chronic bacteremia (B. henselae), bacillary angiomatosis (B. henselae, B. quintana), peliosis hepatitis (B. henselae), bacteremia and/or endocarditis (B. henselae, B. quintana, B. elizabethae, B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, B. koehlerae, and B. alsatica), Carrión disease (B. bacilliformis), trench fever (B. quintana), retinitis and uveitis (B. henselae, B. grahamii), myocarditis (B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, B. washoensis), splenomegaly (B. bacilliformis, B. henselae, B. rochalimae), and fever and fatigue (B. henselae, B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, B. tamiae).

### An unusual series of patients with Kaposi sarcoma [^111YQFcb]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an indolent vascular tumor that can manifest in various forms. Although the literature identifies five clinical subtypes, some lesions do not fit neatly into any of these existing categories. In particularly rare instances, where a patient lacks any known risk factors for KS yet presents with suspicious clinical features, it is crucial to include KS in the differential diagnosis. In such cases, a biopsy should be performed to conclusively rule out KS.

### Emflaza [^111wdEWp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Kaposi's sarcoma**: Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi's sarcoma.
- **Risk of serious adverse reactions in infants because of benzyl alcohol preservative**: Emflaza Oral Suspension contains benzyl alcohol and is not approved for use in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. Serious and fatal adverse reactions, including "gasping syndrome", can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Emflaza. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing Emflaza Oral Suspension, consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources, including Emflaza Oral Suspension (which contains 10.45 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL, whereas Emflaza Tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known. At the recommended dose of 0.9 mg/kg/day of Emflaza Oral Suspension, patients would receive approximately 0.4 mg/kg/day of benzyl alcohol [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].
- **Thromboembolic events**: Observational studies have shown an increased risk of thromboembolism, including venous thromboembolism, particularly with higher cumulative doses of corticosteroids. It is unclear if risk differs by daily dose or duration.

### Kshv/hhv-8 associated Kaposi's sarcoma in lymph nodes concurrent with Epstein-Barr virus associated Hodgkin lymphoma [^113tV4Sj]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

The unusual occurrence of a metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in a lymph node affected by Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) was originally reported when knowledge of the specific virological features of these tumours was lacking.
- **Aim**: To re-evaluate this case by assessing whether the simultaneous presence of the two tumours was linked with common aetiopathogenetic factors.
- **Methods**: The presence of EBV was investigated by in situ hybridisation, whereas KS associated herpesvirus (KSHV)/human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) was detected by immunohistochemistry. Both viruses were analysed in the case reported, in 30 lymph nodes from patients with classic HL, and in 22 skin biopsies from patients with KS.
- **Results**: Consistent with the findings in the HL and KS cases analysed, in the case showing features of both HL and KS in the same lymph node, EBV was detectable only in Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells, but not in KS spindle cells, whereas KSHV/HHV-8 was detectable only in KS spindle cells, and not in RS cells.
- **Conclusion**: It is probable that the development of KS and HL was related to two independent aetiological cofactors — KSHV/HHV-8 and EBV, respectively — and that the occurrence of the two malignancies in the same patient was merely fortuitous.

### Early- and late-stage Kaposi's sarcoma-derived cells but not activated endothelial cells can invade de-epidermized dermis [^111nqUWN]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Whether Kaposi's sarcoma is a true neoplasm or a reactive endothelial cell outgrowth triggered by inflammatory cytokines remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the differential invasive properties of activated endothelial cells and Kaposi's sarcoma cells in a model of de-epidermized dermis, supplying the cells with matrix barriers similar to those found in vivo.

Cells derived from early "patch-stage" and late "nodular-stage" Kaposi's sarcoma lesions exhibited similar invasive properties. This indicates that cells with an invasive potential are present in the early stages of tumor development. The slow accumulation of the cells into the extracellular matrix, coupled with a low proliferation index and expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, suggests that the progression of Kaposi's sarcoma may be related to escape from cell death rather than increased proliferation. The Kaposi's sarcoma-Y1 cell line, which is tumorigenic in nude mice, also exhibited invasive properties.

In contrast to the Kaposi's sarcoma-derived spindle cells, which were scattered between the collagen bundles, the Kaposi's sarcoma-Y1 cell population had a higher proliferation index and displayed a multilayer arrangement.

Inflammatory cytokines and Kaposi's sarcoma cell supernatant could activate and stimulate the growth of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells but could not induce their invasion in this model. This shows that activated endothelial cells do not meet all the requirements to traverse the various barriers found in the dermal extracellular matrix.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Kaposi sarcoma [^112tbfkv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common neoplasm among individuals living with HIV today. In Sub-Saharan Africa, KS is one of the most prevalent cancers in men overall. Although KS predominantly affects HIV-positive individuals, any immunocompromised person infected with KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus 8 is at risk, including the elderly, children in KSHV-endemic regions, and transplant recipients. Diagnosis of KS typically involves the detection of the viral protein latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) in biopsy samples. However, not all cases of KS are the same, nor will they respond uniformly to treatment. While standard therapy for KS has remained unchanged for the past 20 years, emerging therapies are on the horizon and will be discussed.

### New approaches to the treatment of human herpesvirus 8-associated disease [^113b5TK1]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus or KSHV) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), as well as many cases of Castleman disease. Despite significant advances in understanding the biology and natural history of these diseases, treatment options have important limitations, and strategies to prevent their development in high-risk individuals are lacking.

This article reviews the scope of HHV-8-associated disease, as well as the efficacy of treatment options. Finally, novel approaches to treatment and prevention are described, including antiviral agents, targeted molecular therapy, and a combination of these modalities.

### Hiv-associated Kaposi sarcoma and related diseases [^116Fm5i9]. AIDS (2017). Low credibility.

The search for the etiologic agent for Kaposi sarcoma led to the discovery of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) in 1994. KSHV, also called human herpesvirus-8, has since been shown to be the etiologic agent for several other tumors and diseases, including primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), an extracavitary variant of PEL, KSHV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a form of multicentric Castleman disease, and KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome. KSHV encodes several genes that interfere with innate and specific immunity, thwart apoptosis, enhance cell proliferation and cytokine production, and promote angiogenesis. These play important roles in disease pathogenesis.

HIV is an important cofactor in Kaposi sarcoma pathogenesis, and widespread use of antiretroviral therapy has reduced Kaposi sarcoma incidence. However, Kaposi sarcoma remains the second most frequent tumor arising in HIV-infected patients in the United States and is particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa. KSHV prevalence varies substantially in different populations, and KSHV is secreted in saliva. Public health measures to reduce its spread may help reduce the incidence of KSHV-associated diseases. Although there have been advances in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma, KSHV-multicentric Castleman disease, and PEL, improved therapies are needed, especially those that are appropriate for Kaposi sarcoma in resource-poor regions.

### HIV/AIDS: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus disease: Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease [^114AMRht]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection is associated with the development of three proliferative diseases: Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. These conditions are also intimately associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and important synergistic interactions between these two viruses have been described. Despite differences in viral gene expression patterns in each condition, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes similar oncogenic proteins that promote the activation of sequential and parallel signaling pathways.

Therapeutic strategies have been implemented to target these unique signaling pathways, and this sort of molecular targeting is the focus of many research efforts. The scope of this review is to present contemporary knowledge about the epidemiology, virology, and immunology of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and to highlight several key oncogene products that may be targets for chemotherapy.

Regarding medical management for Kaposi sarcoma, specifically concerning regimens for systemic therapy (relapsed or refractory), the NCCN 2019 guidelines recommend offering the following subsequent systemic therapy options for patients with relapsed or refractory advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal disease. Patients can continue through all treatment options listed, and treatments can be repeated if tolerated and the response was durable (≥ 3 months). In select cases, best supportive care may be an appropriate option:

- **Bortezomib**: 1.6 mg/m² IV or SC on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
- **Gemcitabine**: 1,000 mg/m² IV every 2 weeks or 1,000 mg/m² IV on days 1 and 8 every 21 days.
- **Lenalidomide**: 25 mg/day PO for 21 days of each 28-day cycle.
- **Pomalidomide**: 4 or 5 mg/day PO for 21 days of each 28-day cycle.
- **Vinorelbine**: 30 mg/m² IV every 2 weeks.

### Kaposi sarcoma in mantled guereza [^117JJVbp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), a member of the genus Rhadinovirus, is the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma, an endothelial neoplasm of the dermis, oral cavity, and intestinal organs. The tumors are highly vascularized and characterized by the proliferation of spindle cells that contain KSHV DNA and antigen. Predisposing factors for Kaposi sarcoma include immunodeficiency, especially infection with HIV. Nevertheless, a major portion of Kaposi sarcoma cases in Africa occurs in HIV-negative persons.

Clinically, Kaposi sarcoma is divided into four forms: classical Kaposi sarcoma, African endemic Kaposi sarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma caused by iatrogenic immunosuppression, and HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma. Lesions of classical Kaposi sarcoma initially occur on the lower extremities, progress slowly, and affect visceral organs at a late stage. In contrast, the remaining Kaposi sarcoma forms affect lymph nodes, mucosa, and visceral organs at early stages, progress rapidly, and encompass symptoms in the hard palate and oral mucosa.

Rhadinoviruses with high similarity to KSHV have been detected in Old World monkeys, including chimpanzees, macaques, and African green monkeys. The rhadinoviruses have split into two lineages, RV1 and RV2, and many Old World monkeys harbor viruses of both lineages. In contrast, humans harbor only KSHV, which belongs to the RV1 lineage. Kaposi sarcoma–like disease has been observed in rhadinovirus-infected nonhuman primates (NHP), but only in the presence of immunodeficiency, induced, for instance, by co-infection with simian immunodeficiency virus.

### Steroids are a risk factor for Kaposi's sarcoma-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and mortality in HIV infection [^113Fyoiq]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by infection with the human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), and disease progression involves a process of viral oncogenesis within a permissive context of deregulated cytokines and immunosuppression. Although the incidence and mortality associated with Kaposi's sarcoma have decreased with the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), Kaposi's sarcoma remains the most common malignancy in the HIV-infected population. Moreover, almost 20% of Kaposi's sarcoma patients in pooled African cohorts and 8.5% in a London cohort developed Kaposi's sarcoma-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (KS-IRIS). In resource-limited settings, this condition is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality.

Multiple case reports indicate that the administration of systemic glucocorticoids to HIV-infected individuals accelerates clinical progression of Kaposi's sarcoma. However, there are no published studies showing the real impact of glucocorticoids on the development or clinical worsening of Kaposi's sarcoma in the HIV-infected population. Our institution is a national referral centre for respiratory diseases, with a large number of HIV-infected individuals requiring the use of glucocorticoids for the treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Consequently, it is an ideal place for assessing the association between Kaposi's sarcoma morbidity and mortality with the use of glucocorticoids in the context of HIV infection. This is the first case-control study reporting the use of glucocorticoids as a risk factor for KS-IRIS and for Kaposi's sarcoma.

In multivariable models including other measures of immunosuppression mediated through CD4 cell count, among the cART follow-up group, the CD4 cell count was more strongly associated with the risk of Kaposi sarcoma than the nadir CD4 cell count or the time-weighted average CD4 count (data not shown). Although there was a borderline statistically significant association between the nadir CD4 cell count at cART initiation and the risk of Kaposi sarcoma (P = .06), after adjusting for CD4 cell count, which appeared to be strongly associated with the risk of Kaposi sarcoma (P < .001), the association disappeared (P = .59), as did that for the time-weighted average CD4 cell count (P = .16).
