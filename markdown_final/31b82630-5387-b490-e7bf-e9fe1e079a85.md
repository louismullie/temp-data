## Question

Medications for pain management in hospital

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medications for pain management in hospital. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of multimodal analgesia and where opioids fit. Then, I should categorize nonopioid pharmacologic options and their roles. Next, I will examine opioid selection, dosing, and safety, including special populations. After that, I need to consider procedure- and setting-specific strategies, including ICU, perioperative, and trauma contexts. Finally, I should integrate systems-level safety practices, discharge planning, and a concise synthesis that aligns with guidelines and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: multimodal analgesia is the standard of care for acute pain in the hospital, aiming to target different pain pathways, reduce opioid requirements, and improve functional outcomes. I should double-check that this is consistently endorsed across high-credibility sources, and yes, ASA, APS/ASRA, and CDC all emphasize multimodal therapy as first-line whenever feasible, reserving opioids for severe pain or when nonopioids are insufficient or contraindicated [^e98f8904] [^4c83bfc8] [^56ee2691].

> Next, I should review nonopioid pharmacologic options and their roles. Acetaminophen is a core agent and should be given around-the-clock unless contraindicated. NSAIDs are similarly foundational but must be individualized to GI, renal, and bleeding risk. Gabapentinoids can reduce opioid consumption and improve analgesia in perioperative settings. Local anesthetics via regional techniques are highly effective opioid-sparing options. And ketamine can be used as an adjunct in select cases, particularly in trauma or when opioid tolerance is present. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for gabapentinoids and ketamine; the ASA cites A1 evidence for gabapentinoids reducing opioid use, while ketamine evidence is more mixed and should be used selectively with monitoring [^e98f8904] [^bf234a12] [^1915a321].

> I will now examine opioid selection and dosing. Immediate-release opioids are preferred when opioids are indicated. Patient-controlled analgesia is favored over intermittent intramuscular dosing for titration and satisfaction. I need to ensure I anchor dosing to patient-specific factors and prior exposure, and I should confirm that equianalgesic tables guide safe rotation. The CDC advises prescribing the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with reassessment within 1–4 weeks if continued, and to avoid extended-release formulations for acute pain. Hold on, I should verify that this applies in-hospital as well; yes, the CDC guidance spans inpatient and outpatient acute pain contexts and supports procedure-specific prescribing ranges for postoperative patients [^e235245a] [^814b119d] [^56ee2691].

> But wait, what if the patient is on chronic opioids or has opioid use disorder? I should confirm best practices here. Continue the patient's baseline opioid or medication for opioid use disorder, anticipate higher analgesic requirements, and consider split dosing or temporary increases in buprenorphine or methadone for pain control. In supervised settings, adding short-acting full agonists can be considered for severe breakthrough pain. I need to ensure I do not inadvertently precipitate withdrawal; consensus statements from SHM and ASAM support concurrent management of pain and OUD with careful coordination and monitoring [^7ec46379] [^4c55c1b3] [^650fe23d].

> Next, I should review procedure- and setting-specific strategies. In the ICU, IV opioids remain first-line for severe nociceptive pain, but multimodal analgesia with acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, and regional techniques should be layered to reduce opioid exposure. I should double-check that routine pain assessment precedes sedation, and yes, SCCM recommends treating pain before sedatives and using validated tools, with neuraxial or peripheral blocks when feasible [^fd837ee3] [^f144f288] [^cab75103]. In the perioperative setting, ERAS protocols operationalize multimodal, opioid-sparing regimens with preoperative education, preemptive analgesia, scheduled nonopioids, and regional anesthesia, which reduce opioid consumption and length of stay. PROSPECT provides procedure-specific recommendations that evolve with new evidence, so I should align local protocols with these updates [^b5dcbb3c] [^1593f94f] [^e795ded0]. In trauma, ketamine is often favored early for its hemodynamic profile, and multimodal analgesia should be initiated as soon as feasible, with attention to rib fractures and long-bone injuries where regional techniques can be transformative [^1ddd3af1] [^89b3ede5].

> I need to ensure systems-level safety practices are explicit. Validated pain assessment at rest and with movement, reassessment within 30–60 minutes after analgesic administration, and documentation of functional goals are essential. Hold on, I should verify reassessment compliance data; studies show markedly low reassessment rates, which jeopardize safety and quality. Barcode medication administration and structured handoffs reduce errors, and Acute Pain Services should be available for complex cases and to standardize protocols [^25e75c6d] [^c8e7b189] [^db6bb617]. I should also confirm that PDMP checks, overdose risk screening, and naloxone co-prescribing are recommended when opioids are used, which they are in CDC and trauma society guidance [^e235245a] [^b6c26709].

> Let me consider discharge planning and tapering. Discharge prescriptions should mirror what controlled the patient's pain in the last 24 hours, separate opioids from nonopioids to enable tapering, and include a written plan with expected duration, weaning strategy, and follow-up. I should double-check that sustained opioid use risk is higher with prior exposure and that education mitigates risk; ACS guidance highlights these risks and recommends individualized, minimal-duration prescriptions with clear return precautions [^67f22edc] [^39eace8a] [^feb8bff6]. For patients on chronic opioids, return to baseline dosing as soon as possible and provide naloxone when risk is elevated, aligning with CDC and trauma best practices [^e235245a] [^b6c26709].

> I should confirm special populations and caveats. In pediatrics, multimodal analgesia is standard and opioids should be used cautiously with weight-based dosing. Codeine and tramadol are contraindicated in children under 12 and in specific post-tonsillectomy contexts. In older adults, start low, go slow, and monitor closely for delirium and respiratory depression. In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, adjust dosing and avoid nephrotoxic NSAIDs when risk outweighs benefit. For neuropathic components, add gabapentinoids or other neuropathic agents in ICU or perioperative settings as indicated [^f7f65a56] [^0996785d] [^cb6b9d2e].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For mild pain, use acetaminophen and NSAIDs when appropriate, plus nonpharmacologic measures. For moderate pain, layer two nonopioids and consider a regional technique if feasible. For severe pain, add a short-acting opioid with careful titration and ongoing reassessment, while continuing multimodal nonopioids. Throughout, individualize to comorbidities, prior opioid exposure, and functional goals, and de-escalate as pain improves to minimize adverse effects and misuse risk. This aligns with ASA, APS/ASRA, CDC, and trauma society guidance and reflects the best available evidence base [^e98f8904] [^4c83bfc8] [^e235245a] [^89b3ede5].

---

In the hospital, **multimodal analgesia** is the cornerstone of pain management, combining nonopioid and opioid medications with regional techniques and nonpharmacologic strategies to optimize pain control while minimizing opioid-related risks [^4c83bfc8] [^e98f8904]. Nonopioid options include **acetaminophen, NSAIDs, gabapentinoids, and ketamine**, selected based on patient-specific risks and contraindications [^4b3e476a] [^1915a321]. Opioids remain essential for moderate-to-severe pain or when nonopioids are insufficient, with preference for short-acting, immediate-release formulations and careful titration to effect [^e235245a] [^0e970236]. Regional anesthesia (nerve blocks, epidurals) is strongly recommended when feasible to reduce opioid requirements and improve functional outcomes [^bff2ede8] [^4c83bfc8]. Pain should be assessed regularly using validated scales, and therapy adjusted dynamically to balance efficacy with safety, including monitoring for adverse effects and opioid misuse [^c8e7b189] [^25e75c6d].

## Nonopioid medications

Nonopioid medications are **first-line** for mild-to-moderate pain and as adjuncts in multimodal regimens:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indications** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen | - Acetaminophen (PO/IV) | - Mild-to-moderate pain <br/> - Adjunct to opioids | - Hepatotoxicity risk at high doses <br/> - Safe in most patients |
| NSAIDs | - Ibuprofen <br/> - Naproxen <br/> - Ketorolac (IV) | - Mild-to-moderate pain <br/> - Inflammatory pain | - GI bleeding <br/> - Renal impairment <br/> - Cardiovascular risk |
| Gabapentinoids | - Gabapentin <br/> - Pregabalin | - Neuropathic pain <br/> - Adjunct to reduce opioid use | - Sedation <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Renal dosing |
| Ketamine | - Ketamine (IV) | - Severe pain <br/> - Opioid-sparing | - Hallucinations <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Monitor closely |

---

## Opioid medications

Opioids are reserved for **moderate-to-severe pain** or when nonopioids are inadequate:

- **Morphine**: gold standard; use PCA for titration.
- **Hydromorphone**: potent alternative; preferred in renal impairment.
- **Fentanyl**: rapid onset, short duration; useful in hemodynamically unstable patients.
- **Methadone**: for opioid-tolerant patients; monitor QT prolongation.

---

## Regional anesthesia techniques

Regional anesthesia provides **targeted analgesia** and reduces systemic opioid requirements:

- **Peripheral nerve blocks**: femoral, sciatic, intercostal, brachial plexus.
- **Neuraxial blocks**: epidural, spinal anesthesia.
- **Local infiltration**: wound infiltration, TAP blocks.

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic strategies enhance analgesia and reduce medication needs:

- **Physical therapy**: early mobilization, positioning.
- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy**: relaxation, mindfulness.
- **Acupuncture**: adjunct in select patients.

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Opioid-tolerant patients**: continue baseline opioids, add multimodal therapy, consider methadone or buprenorphine [^4c55c1b3].
- **Elderly**: start low, go slow; monitor for sedation and falls.
- **Renal/hepatic impairment**: adjust dosing, avoid active metabolites.
- **Pregnancy**: acetaminophen preferred; avoid NSAIDs in third trimester.

---

## Monitoring and safety

- **Pain assessment**: regular use of validated scales (NRS, VAS, BPS).
- **Adverse effects**: monitor for respiratory depression, sedation, nausea, constipation.
- **Opioid misuse**: screen for risk factors, use PDMP, provide naloxone when indicated [^e235245a].

---

## Discharge planning

Discharge planning should include **individualized tapering**, patient education, and follow-up to minimize prolonged opioid use and complications [^21d3b5a5] [^e235245a].

---

Effective hospital pain management relies on **multimodal analgesia**, individualized to patient needs and continuously reassessed to balance analgesia with safety and function.

### Acute pain management in hospitalized adult patients with opioid dependence: a narrative review and guide for clinicians [^6d908ba4]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pain management is a core competency of hospital medicine, and effective acute pain management should be a goal for all hospital medicine providers. The prevalence of opioid use in the United States, both therapeutic and non-medical in origin, has dramatically increased over the past decade. Although nonopioid medications and nondrug treatments are essential components of managing all acute pain, opioids continue to be the mainstay of treatment for severe acute pain in both opioid-naïve and opioid-dependent patients. In this review, we provide an evidence-based approach to appropriate and safe use of opioid analgesics in treating acute pain in hospitalized patients who are opioid-dependent.

### Pain management in the ED [^bfbd27f0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Recent regulatory and legal scrutiny has raised concerns about the over- and undertreatment of pain in the hospital. This debate stems from either the overly aggressive approach to the management of pain with opioids or, alternatively, to the barriers preventing the appropriate prescribing of these medications. The media attention on diversion of controlled substances for illicit purposes has intensified this debate, highlighting the possible overuse of these medications in the treatment of nonmalignant pain. Because pain is a highly common presenting complaint in the ED, EPs are pivotal players in these controversies. Accordingly, they must apprise themselves of pain management skills and continue to help those in need of appropriate medications while thwarting inappropriate prescribing. This review offers a synopsis of the pitfalls associated with ED pain management and provides recommendations for selected conditions.

### The future of pain management in emergency medicine [^97cc42d8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

How have we as a profession, whose number-one goal is to decrease human suffering, made pain control such a poorly discussed issue in training? From day 1 of medical school, pain and suffering need to be discussed. No clinical area should be taught without discussion of this most common and most important symptom. Although we have shown that up to 70% of our patients have pain as a part of their presenting problem, hospitalized patients also have high rates of pain, often unrecognized. Barriers need to be identified and discussed. Alternatives to medications should be as much a part of our armamentarium as caring and compassion. The future of pain control depends on this paradigm shift.

### Safe opioid prescribing for acute noncancer pain in hospitalized adults: a systematic review of existing guidelines [^0e970236]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is common among hospitalized patients. Inpatient prescribing of opioids is not without risk. Acute pain management guidelines could inform safe prescribing of opioids in the hospital and limit associated unintended consequences.

Purpose

To evaluate the quality and content of existing guidelines for acute, noncancer pain management.

Data Sources

The National Guideline Clearinghouse, MEDLINE via PubMed, websites of relevant specialty societies and other organizations, and selected international search engines.

Study Selection

Guidelines published between January 2010 and August 2017 addressing acute, noncancer pain management among adults were considered. Guidelines that focused on chronic pain, specific diseases, and the nonhospital setting were excluded.

Data Extraction

Quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument.

Data Synthesis

Four guidelines met the selection criteria. Most recommendations were based on expert consensus. The guidelines recommended restricting opioids to severe pain or pain that has not responded to nonopioid therapy, using the lowest effective dose of short-acting opioids for the shortest duration possible, and co-prescribing opioids with nonopioid analgesics. The guidelines generally recommended checking the prescription drug monitoring program when prescribing opioids, developing goals for patient recovery, and educating patients regarding the risks and side effects of opioid therapy. Additional recommendations included using an opioid dose conversion guide, avoidance of co-administration of parenteral and oral opioids, and using caution when co-prescribing opioids with other central nervous system depressants.

Conclusions

Guidelines, based largely on expert opinion, recommend judicious prescribing of opioids for severe, acute pain. Future work should assess the implications of these recommendations on hospital-based pain management.

### Structured approaches to pain management in the ICU [^d32bbc75]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Pain in patients who are critically ill remains undertreated despite decades of research, guideline development and distribution, and intense educational efforts. By nature of their complex medical conditions, these patients present unique challenges to the delivery of optimal pain treatment. Outdated clinical practices and faulty systems, such as a formulary that allows dangerous prescriptions, present additional obstacles. A multidisciplinary and patient-centered continuous quality improvement process is essential to identifying barriers and implementing evidence-based solutions to the problem of undertreated pain in hospital ICUs. This article addresses barriers common to the ICU setting and presents a number of structured approaches that have been shown to be successful in improving pain treatment in patients who are critically ill.

### Postoperative pain management in enhanced recovery pathways [^b5dcbb3c]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative pain is a common but often inadequately treated condition, with 80% of surgical patients experiencing postoperative pain but less than 50% of these patients reporting sufficient pain control according to a US Institute of Medicine report. In addition, a national survey suggests that 39% of patients with postoperative pain experience severe to extreme levels of pain. The consequences of suboptimal postoperative pain control include elevated risk for morbidity and persistent postsurgical pain as well as increased length of hospital stay and healthcare costs. Pain management in the postoperative setting presents a challenge as the development and severity of pain after surgery is dependent on various patient and procedural factors. Furthermore, opioid medications, the traditional mainstay of postoperative pain treatment, are associated with significant short- and long-term adverse effects. Over the past two decades, structured perioperative programs known as enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) have been developed in order to standardize care and improve outcomes. These pathways, which are often built around procedure-specific, evidence-based guidelines from organizations such as the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society, Procedure-Specific Postoperative Pain Management (PROSPECT) group, and the American Society for Enhanced Recovery (ASER), are increasingly considered standard of care for patients undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. With regard to postoperative pain management, ERPs apply a multimodal, opioid-sparing approach. In particular, non-opioid medications and regional anesthesia techniques are commonly employed to minimize use of opioid medications. As strategies for postoperative pain treatment continue to evolve rapidly in the context of an increasing focus on enhanced postoperative recovery, we review the current evidence as well as knowledge gaps and controversies pertaining to commonly utilized postoperative pain management modalities in ERPs.

### Perioperative pain management [^d706ae66]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Perioperative pain management requires a multifaceted approach. The local inflammatory injury and the local and centrally mediated responses must be understood and evaluated to be treated appropriately. This article reviews the different classes of medication and where each one fits into a pain management plan. The implementation of multimodal therapy, which combines different techniques, routes of administration, and different drugs, must be managed. Our ultimate goals are to provide safe and effective pain management, reduce adverse outcomes, preserve patients' physical and psychological well-being, and improve the quality of life for patients with acute pain during the perioperative period.

### Postoperative pain management in enhanced recovery pathways [^1593f94f]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Postoperative pain is a common but often inadequately treated condition. Enhanced recovery pathways (ERPs) are increasingly being utilized to standardize perioperative care and improve outcomes. ERPs employ multimodal postoperative pain management strategies that minimize opioid use and promote recovery. While traditional opioid medications continue to play an important role in the treatment of postoperative pain, ERPs also rely on a wide range of non-opioid pharmacologic therapies as well as regional anesthesia techniques to manage pain in the postoperative setting. The evidence for the use of these interventions continues to evolve rapidly given the increasing focus on enhanced postoperative recovery. This article reviews the current evidence and knowledge gaps pertaining to commonly utilized modalities for postoperative pain management in ERPs.

### Practice guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on acute pain management [^be2b35be]. Anesthesiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Perioperative acute pain management — purpose, focus, and application — aims to facilitate the safety and effectiveness of acute pain care, reduce adverse outcomes, maintain patients' functional abilities and well‑being, and enhance quality of life, with a focus on adult (including geriatric) and pediatric patients undergoing inpatient or outpatient surgery. Modalities addressed require a higher level of professional expertise and organizational structure than "as needed" intramuscular or intravenous injections of opioid analgesics, the document is not an exhaustive compendium, and complex interactions in certain populations make it impractical to address their pain management within this document. Although patients undergoing painful procedures may benefit from anxiolytics and sedatives with analgesics and local anesthetics when indicated, these Guidelines do not specifically address the use of anxiolysis or sedation during such procedures. The Guidelines are intended for use by anesthesiologists and individuals who deliver care under anesthesiologist supervision and may also serve as a resource for other physicians and healthcare professionals and may be used by policymakers to promote effective and patient‑centered care.

### Pain management principles in the critically ill [^02181930]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

This article addresses conventional pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of pain in patients in ICUs. For the critically ill patient, opioids have been the mainstay of pain control. The optimal choice of opioid and dosing regimen for a specific patient varies depending on factors such as the pharmacokinetics and physicochemical characteristics of an opioid and the body's handling of the opioid, concomitant sedative regimen, potential or actual adverse drug events, and development of tolerance. The clinician must appreciate that favorable pharmacokinetic properties such as a short-elimination half-life do not necessarily translate into clinical advantages in the ICU setting. A variety of medications have been proposed as alternatives or adjuncts to the opioids for pain control that have unique considerations when contemplated for use in the critically ill patient. Most have been relatively unstudied in the ICU setting, and many have limitations with respect to availability of the GI route of administration in patients with questionable GI absorptive function. Nonpharmacologic, complementary therapies are low cost, easy to provide, and safe, and many clinicians can implement them with little difficulty or resources. However, the evidence base for their effectiveness is limited. At present, insufficient research evidence is available to support a broad implementation of nonpharmacologic therapies in ICUs.

Multimodal techniques for pain management — Whenever possible, anesthesiologists should use multimodal pain management therapy. Unless contraindicated, patients should receive an around-the-clock regimen of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), COXIBs, or acetaminophen; regional blockade with local anesthetics should be considered; dosing regimens should be administered to optimize efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse events; and the choice of medication, dose, route, and duration of therapy should be individualized.

Patient subpopulations — pediatric patients — Aggressive and proactive pain management is necessary to overcome the historic undertreatment of pain in children, and perioperative care for children undergoing painful procedures or surgery requires developmentally appropriate pain assessment and therapy. Analgesic therapy should depend upon age, weight, and comorbidity and, unless contraindicated, should involve a multimodal approach; behavioral techniques should be applied whenever feasible; sedative, analgesic, and local anesthetics are all important components of appropriate analgesic regimens; and because many analgesic medications are synergistic with sedating agents, it is imperative that appropriate monitoring be used during the procedure and recovery.

Preoperative evaluation and preparation — practice guidelines for acute pain management state that a directed pain history, a directed physical examination, and a pain control plan should be included in the anesthetic preoperative evaluation, and describe preparation components including adjustment or continuation of medications whose sudden cessation may provoke a withdrawal syndrome, treatments to reduce preexisting pain and anxiety, premedications as part of a multimodal analgesic pain management program, and patient and family education including behavioral techniques. The guideline notes insufficient literature for preoperative adjustment or continuation of medications to avert an abstinence syndrome and for preoperative initiation of treatment to reduce preexisting pain or as part of a multimodal program (Category D evidence), and reports that RCTs are equivocal regarding the impact of patient and family education on pain, analgesic use, anxiety, and time to discharge (Category C2 evidence). Recommendations specify that patient preparation for perioperative pain management should include appropriate adjustments or continuation of medications to avert an abstinence syndrome, treatment of preexistent pain, or preoperative initiation of therapy for postoperative pain management, and that anesthesiologists offering perioperative analgesic services should provide, in collaboration with others as appropriate, patient and family education including instruction in behavioral modalities for control of pain and anxiety. The guideline further states that patient and family education should address their important roles in achieving comfort, reporting pain, and proper use of recommended methods, that common misconceptions that overestimate the risk of adverse effects and addiction should be dispelled, and that education for optimal use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and other methods might include preanesthetic discussion, brochures and videotapes, and bedside discussion, with instruction in behavioral modalities for control of pain and anxiety.

VI. Patient Subpopulations — some patient groups are at special risk for inadequate pain control and require additional analgesic considerations, including pediatric patients, geriatric patients, and critically ill or cognitively impaired patients, or other patients who may have difficulty communicating; the Task Force believes that genetics and gender modify the pain experience and response to analgesic therapies, and that patient race, ethnicity, culture, gender, and socioeconomic status influence access to treatment as well as pain assessment by healthcare providers.

### Self-reported management of pain in hospitalized patients: link between process and outcome [^0e9ce85b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hospitalized patients commonly experience pain. We investigated the association between patients' reported use of recommended pain management practices and overall pain relief.

Methods

All adult patients discharged during a 1-month period from a Swiss teaching hospital were invited to complete a mailed survey that included the Picker patient experience questionnaire, questions on pain relief during hospitalization, and questions on various procedures that are recommended as standards of pain management.

Results

Of 2156 eligible patients, 1518 (70%) participated. Sixty-nine percent (n = 1050) had experienced pain during their hospital stay, of whom 71% (n = 697/978) reported complete pain relief. After adjustment for sex, age, general health, and hospital department, pain relief was associated independently with availability of physicians (odds ratio [OR] = 11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3 to 36 for excellent vs. poor availability), having received information about pain and its management (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.8 to 4.2), regular pain assessment (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.8), modification of pain treatment when ineffective (OR = 3.0; 95% CI: 1.6 to 5.6), and waiting less than 10 minutes for pain medications (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.9 to 6.6).

Conclusion

Patient reports that recommended pain management procedures had been used were associated with better self-reported pain relief among hospitalized patients.

### Guideline recommendations and guiding principles… [^56ee2691]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 1 Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy. Nonopioid therapies include:

- Nonopioid medications such as acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and selected antidepressants and anticonvulsants
- Nonpharmacologic therapies such as ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization, or exercise as appropriate for the specific condition.

Selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages The appropriate selection of opioids and dosage are important factors when opioid therapy is prescribed as part of a patient's pain management plan. Recommendations 3–5 address opioid selection and dosage. Recommendation 3 When starting opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release and long-acting opioids. Deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up Recommendations 6 and 7 address the duration of opioid therapy and routine patient follow-up. Recommendation 6 When opioids are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids.

Recommendation 7 Clinicians should evaluate benefits and risks with patients within 1–4 weeks of starting opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients. FDA-approved medications indicated for the treatment of opioid use disorder include buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone. Buprenorphine can be prescribed by any clinician with a current, standard DEA registration with Schedule III authority, in any clinical setting. Information about qualifications and the process to prescribe buprenorphine are available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Methadone used to treat those with a confirmed diagnosis of opioid use disorder can only be dispensed through a SAMHSA certified OTP. Naltrexone can be prescribed and administered by any practitioner licensed to prescribe medications.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^108f8fe9]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacologic analgesia in the ICU — parenteral opioids remain the standard of comparison for all medications used for severe, acute nociceptive pain in the ICU, while as in non-ICU settings, multimodal analgesia (MMA) with nonopioid medications and nonpharmacologic interventions are important as opioid-sparing or opioid-replacement therapies; however, many nonopioid analgesics have limitations (e.g., oral administration, concomitant disease state contraindications) that may preclude or complicate their use in the ICU.

### A multisociety organizational consensus process to define guiding principles for acute perioperative pain management [^3cfdd81b]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The US Health and Human Services Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force initiated a public-private partnership which led to the publication of its report in 2019. The report emphasized the need for individualized, multimodal, and multidisciplinary approaches to pain management that decrease the over-reliance on opioids, increase access to care, and promote widespread education on pain and substance use disorders. The Task Force specifically called on specialty organizations to work together to develop evidence-based guidelines. In response to this report's recommendations, a consortium of 14 professional healthcare societies committed to a 2-year project to advance pain management for the surgical patient and improve opioid safety. The modified Delphi process included two rounds of electronic voting and culminated in a live virtual event in February 2021, during which seven common guiding principles were established for acute perioperative pain management. These principles should help to inform local action and future development of clinical practice recommendations.

### Management of opioid use disorder and associated conditions among hospitalized adults: a consensus statement from the Society of Hospital Medicine [^7ec46379]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hospital-based clinicians frequently care for patients with opioid withdrawal or opioid use disorder (OUD) and are well-positioned to identify and initiate treatment for these patients. With rising numbers of hospitalizations related to opioid use and opioid-related overdose, the Society of Hospital Medicine convened a working group to develop a Consensus Statement on the management of OUD and associated conditions among hospitalized adults. The guidance statement is intended for clinicians practicing medicine in the inpatient setting (e.g., hospitalists, primary care physicians, family physicians, advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants) and is intended to apply to hospitalized adults at risk for, or diagnosed with, OUD. To develop the Consensus Statement, the working group conducted a systematic review of relevant guidelines and composed a draft statement based on extracted recommendations. Next, the working group obtained feedback on the draft statement from external experts in addiction medicine, SHM members, professional societies, harm reduction organizations and advocacy groups, and peer reviewers. The iterative development process resulted in a final Consensus Statement consisting of 18 recommendations covering the following topics: (1) identification and treatment of OUD and opioid withdrawal, (2) perioperative and acute pain management in patients with OUD, and (3) methods to optimize care transitions at hospital discharge for patients with OUD. Most recommendations in the Consensus Statement were derived from guidelines based on observational studies and expert consensus. Due to the lack of rigorous evidence supporting key aspects of OUD-related care, the working group identified important issues necessitating future research and exploration.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^06b85ee0]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in the intensive care unit — key points — validated measurement tools to assess pain are an important component of any analgesic program in the ICU. An ICU multimodal analgesia (MMA) protocol is needed to match medications and their doses/titration to the severity of the patient's pain. Use opioids as first-line agents for patients with severe, acute nociceptive pain in the ICU setting as part of an MMA pain management plan. Consider patient comorbidities and medical history (e.g., alcohol or SUD and chronic renal failure) when choosing medications for analgesia and sedation. Transition patients from parenteral to enteral medications prior to transfer from the ICU, when possible.

Preoperative evaluation and preparation — A directed pain history, a directed physical examination, and a pain control plan should be included in the anesthetic preoperative evaluation. Patient preparation for perioperative pain management should include appropriate adjustments or continuation of medications to avert an abstinence syndrome, treatment of preexistent pain, or preoperative initiation of therapy for postoperative pain management. Anesthesiologists should provide patient and family education regarding their important roles, dispel common misconceptions that overestimate the risk of adverse effects and addiction, offer education for optimal use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and related methods with materials and discussion opportunities, and include instruction in behavioral modalities for control of pain and anxiety.

Institutional responsibilities for perioperative pain management — For optimal pain management, ongoing education and training are essential for new personnel, to maintain skills, and whenever therapeutic approaches are modified. Anesthesiologists and other healthcare providers should use standardized, validated instruments to facilitate the regular evaluation and documentation of pain intensity, the effects of pain therapy, and side effects caused by the therapy. Anesthesiologists responsible for perioperative analgesia should be available at all times to consult with ward nurses, surgeons, or other involved physicians, should assist in evaluating patients who are experiencing problems with any aspect of perioperative pain relief, should provide services within the framework of an Acute Pain Service, and should participate in developing standardized institutional policies and procedures.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^814b119d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

When patients are discharged from the hospital after surgery, the course and dosage of any opioid medications administered during hospitalization and before discharge can help predict ongoing pain management needs. For postoperative pain, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of use and refills and on consensus).

Clinicians should generally not prescribe additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected. However, if pain continues longer than expected, some patients might face challenges in successfully navigating the health care system (e.g. clinician and pharmacy contact, transportation, and need for assistance) to obtain additional medication as needed, leading to potential disparities in treatment. Clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. In particular, clinicians, practices, and health systems should ensure all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment as needed to minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills.

Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain. If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy. If patients already receiving long-term opioids require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.

### Improving the safety of opioid use for acute noncancer pain in hospitalized adults: a consensus statement from the Society of Hospital Medicine [^17eeac46]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Hospital-based clinicians frequently treat acute, noncancer pain. Although opioids may be beneficial in this setting, the benefits must be balanced with the risks of adverse events, including inadvertent overdose and prolonged opioid use, physical dependence, or development of opioid use disorder. In an era of epidemic opioid use and related harms, the Society of Hospital Medicine (SHM) convened a working group to develop a consensus statement on opioid use for adults hospitalized with acute, noncancer pain, outside of the palliative, end-of-life, and intensive care settings. The guidance is intended for clinicians practicing medicine in the inpatient setting (eg, hospitalists, primary care physicians, family physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants). To develop the Consensus Statement, the working group conducted a systematic review of relevant guidelines, composed a draft Statement based on extracted recommendations, and obtained feedback from external experts in hospital-based opioid prescribing, SHM members, the SHM Patient-Family Advisory Council, other professional societies, and peer-reviewers. The iterative development process resulted in a final Consensus Statement consisting of 16 recommendations covering 1) whether to use opioids in the hospital, 2) how to improve the safety of opioid use during hospitalization, and 3) how to improve the safety of opioid prescribing at hospital discharge. As most guideline recommendations from which the Consensus Statement was derived were based on expert opinion alone, the working group identified key issues for future research to support evidence-based practice.

American Society of Anesthesiologists acute pain management — multimodal techniques: Whenever possible, anesthesiologists should use multimodal pain management therapy, and the following drugs should be considered as part of a postoperative multimodal pain management regimen: COX-2 selective NSAIDs (COXIBs), nonselective NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and calcium channel α-2-δ antagonists (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin). Unless contraindicated, all patients should receive an around-the-clock regimen of NSAIDs, COXIBs, or acetaminophen, regional blockade with local anesthetics should be considered as part of a multimodal approach for pain management, dosing regimens should be administered to optimize efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse events, and the choice of medication, dose, route, and duration of therapy should be individualized. Panel response distributions include the following examples: dosing regimens should be administered to optimize efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse events (N 264; strongly agree 71.2*, agree 27.3, equivocal 1.1, disagree 0.4, strongly disagree 0.0) and whenever possible, anesthesiologists should use multimodal pain management therapy (N 267; strongly agree 56.2*, agree 28.1, equivocal 12.4, disagree 2.6, strongly disagree 0.7).

### Management of perioperative pain in patients chronically consuming opioids [^80bbdae4]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of licit and illicit opioid use is growing, and a greater percentage of chronically opioid-consuming patients are presenting for surgery. These patients can be expected to experience increased postoperative pain, greater postoperative opioid consumption, and prolonged use of healthcare resources for managing their pain.

Methods

Achieving adequate pain control in these patients can be challenging because commonly used strategies for alleviating postoperative pain may have diminished effectiveness. We explore the prevalence and characteristics of opioid use in the United States and discuss its impact on the perioperative management of pain. We examine mechanistically why adequate perioperative pain control in chronically opioid-consuming patients may be difficult.

Conclusions

We present strategies for providing adequate analgesia to these patients that include the optimal use of opioids, adjuvant medications, and regional anesthetic techniques.

### Present-day challenges and future solutions in postoperative pain management: results from painForum 2014 [^8d932f38]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Pain management has come a long way, but much more needs to be done to provide optimal analgesia for patients dealing with postoperative or other acute pain syndromes. Pain must be assessed regularly, frequently, and with a validated instrument. Clinicians must learn more about pain and share this knowledge with their patients. While many guidelines exist, clinicians need to understand and implement these guidelines better. Hospitals can benefit greatly from APS teams who, in turn, can help develop more recommendations, guidelines, education activities, and research endeavors, to assist us in gathering the evidence we need to reliably fight pain. Finally, we need to advocate strongly for the use of multimodal analgesia as the standard of care for postoperative patients. When patients receive effective postoperative analgesia, it can reduce postoperative morbidity, enhance and accelerate recovery, shorten the hospital stay, and improve patient satisfaction. Considering the relatively low cost of analgesic agents, this type of treatment has a very favorable cost-to-benefit ratio.

### Postoperative pain management in enhanced recovery pathways [^f9e432d1]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Postoperative pain is often suboptimally treated and remains a challenge to manage. ERPs generally utilize a multimodal, opioid-sparing approach in the treatment of postoperative pain. While opioids remain an important treatment option for postoperative pain, ERPs employ a variety of non-opioid systemic medications and regional anesthetic techniques with the goal of minimizing opioid consumption, reducing risk of opioid-related adverse effects, and improving postoperative outcomes. While strong evidence supports this multimodal, opioid-sparing strategy, the data supporting specific modalities commonly utilized in ERPs to manage postoperative pain continues to evolve rapidly and knowledge gaps and controversies remain. As a result, there are numerous opportunities for future research, and the risks and benefits of specific treatment options should always be considered in the context of the individual patient and procedure.

### Sex disparities in opioid prescription and administration on a hospital medicine service [^6a0391fe]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The management of pain in inpatient settings is complex and depends on many factors. Although disease diagnoses, illness severity, and practice patterns can guide decision-making around prescription of opioids, pain is a fundamentally subjective experience. Thus, the treatment of pain often depends on clinician interpretation of nursing assessments and/or patient report, which may be susceptible to biases based on the patient's age, race, ethnicity, language status, and gender. Specifically with regard to gender and sex, studies have shown that clinicians tend to underestimate pain in female patients and that female patients are thought to be more likely to exaggerate pain.

These biases may lead to systemic undertreatment of pain in women. Studies of emergency room, pre-hospital, post-surgical, and outpatient chronic pain settingshave shown that women tend to receive fewer pain medications, including opioids, than men.

However, it is unknown whether prescribing patterns differ by gender and sex on inpatient general medicine hospital services. The purpose of this study was to explore associations between opioid administration/prescription patterns and sex among hospitalized adults on an inpatient general medicine service at a large urban academic center. We hypothesized that female patients would be less likely to receive inpatient and discharge opioids and receive fewer opioids, on average, compared to male patients. We first examined the likelihood of receiving opioids during hospitalization and identified differences in the amount of opioids received. Second, we performed these same analyses, but with opioids prescribed on hospital discharge as the outcome.

Opioid abuse results in poor pain control, poor outcomes, and addiction. Clinical recommendations to manage pain include identifying the problem, considering multimodal anesthesia, avoiding overprescribing, acknowledging that minimizing opioid use is not equivalent to undertreating pain, minimizing preoperative opioid use, managing patient expectations, and continuing to investigate outcomes of pain management while limiting opioid prescriptions or forgoing opioids altogether. Authors are directed to new Recommendations for Pain Management Research to highlight critical research parameters and standardize outcome reporting.

Pain is a common complaint precipitating emergency department (ED) visit, occurring in more than half of patient encounters. While opioids are effective for acute pain management in the Emergency Department (ED), the associated adverse effects, including respiratory and central nervous system depression, nausea, vomiting, and constipation, and physical manifestations of use, including tolerance, dependence and misuse leading to overdose and death, accentuate the need for non-opioid alternatives and/or multi-modal pain control. This review will provide examples of non-opioid pain management strategies and multimodal regimens for treatment of acute pain in the ED.

### Safety in acute pain medicine-pharmacologic considerations and the impact of systems-based gaps [^29b7a425]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

In the setting of an expanding prevalence of acute pain medicine services and the aggressive use of multimodal analgesia, an overview of systems-based safety gaps and safety concerns in the setting of aggressive multimodal analgesia is provided below.

Setting

Expert commentary.

Methods

Recent evidence focused on systems-based gaps in acute pain medicine is discussed. A focused literature review was conducted to assess safety concerns related to commonly used multimodal pharmacologic agents (opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gabapentanoids, ketamine, acetaminophen) in the setting of inpatient acute pain management.

Conclusions

Optimization of systems-based gaps will increase the probability of accurate pain assessment, improve the application of uniform evidence-based multimodal analgesia, and ensure a continuum of pain care. While acute pain medicine strategies should be aggressively applied, multimodal regimens must be strategically utilized to minimize risk to patients and in a comorbidity-specific fashion.

Pain management at hospital discharge — opioid selection and overdose risk mitigation: When an opioid pill is used alone or in combination with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, no difference in efficacy, tolerability, or risk of abuse or misuse was found. To optimize the use of acetaminophen or NSAIDS before opioids, prescribe oral opioids alone to eliminate confusion about the maximum dose of the nonopioid component when used in combination form. For patients believed to require longer prescription duration, consider consultation with a pain management service for delineation of an optimal outpatient pain management regimen. In line with Centers for Disease Control recommendations, consider providing naloxone as a co-prescription for patients felt to be at high risk for opioid overdose.

Implementation Considerations

Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1).
Opioids are sometimes needed for treatment of acute pain (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For many common causes of nontraumatic, nonsurgical pain, when opioids are needed, a few days or less are often sufficient, and shorter courses can minimize the need to taper opioids to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of a course of opioids. However, durations should be individualized to the patient's clinical circumstances.
Clinicians should generally avoid prescribing additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected.
For postoperative pain related to major surgery, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of actual use and refills and on consensus).
To minimize unintended effects on patients, clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills by ensuring all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment, as needed.
Longer durations of opioid therapy are more likely to be needed when the mechanism of injury is expected to result in prolonged severe pain (e.g. severe traumatic injuries).
Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain.
If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy.
If patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.
If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids.
If a taper is needed, taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription (see Supporting Rationale for this recommendation for additional details).
Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before hospital discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

### The treatment of acute pain in the emergency department: a white paper position statement prepared for the American academy of emergency medicine [^c030fe92]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendations — management of acute pain in the emergency department (ED) should be patient centered and pain-syndrome targeted, and should utilize combinations of nonpharmacological and pharmacological analgesic modalities. Emergency Medicine (EM) clinicians and associates who work in an ED should acknowledge and assess a patient's pain in an empathetic manner by expressing an understanding of the patient's suffering and a willingness to alleviate pain using a multimodal analgesic approach, and EM clinicians should communicate to patients that the goal of ED pain management, particularly in patients who are being discharged, includes restoration of functional ability, and is not simply reducing pain. Emergency clinicians are charged with a provision of effective analgesia that is balanced against the potential for some pain medications to cause harm, and EM clinicians should engage patients in shared decision-making by providing patients with details about overall treatment goals and expectations, the natural trajectory of the specific painful condition, and analgesic options including short-term and long-term benefits and risks of adverse effects.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols in orthopaedic surgery: opioids or not opioids? [^4ed14e4d]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The Pain Management Plan Within ERAS Pathways

ERAS aims to enhance patient outcomes and accelerate recovery following surgery. The protocol concentrates on optimizing each stage of the surgical journey, encouraging patients to take an active role in their recovery. The underlying philosophy is that providing comprehensive education before surgery, coupled with an effective anaesthetic and analgesic strategy, enables patients — particularly those undergoing orthopaedic procedures — to mobilize sooner. As a result, these patients can meet physiotherapy objectives more quickly and advance at a faster pace compared to conventional timelines, thereby shortening their hospital stay and minimizing the likelihood of typical hospital-associated complications (ie, acquired infections). The overarching goal is to ensure that all patients, including those with chronic conditions, can achieve a safe and timely discharge without compromising the quality of their outcomes. Thus, it is crucial to understand the role of multimodal analgesia within the ERAS settings. This approach utilizes various pain management strategies that work together to enhance analgesic effects while simultaneously reducing the required doses of individual agents, thereby minimizing the risk of side effects.–The extensive range of adverse effects linked to opioid analgesics — such as nausea, respiratory depression, hyperalgesia, delirium, and tolerance — highlights the need for an opioid-sparing strategy whenever feasible. Given that multiple pathways and mediators are involved in nociception, it is important to target various areas within the central and peripheral nervous systems using different mechanisms of action (ie, blocking receptors or using alternative medications), in addition to traditional therapies, which can improve analgesic efficacy and pain control. The timing and dosage of opioids administered to the patients are essential to produce the desired analgesic effect. A recent multimodal pain management protocol scheduled pre-emptive medications before surgery. This approach, together with preoperative classes, reduced the anxiety of the patients regarding the potential delays between the onset of pain and the administration of medication. Additionally, implementing a comprehensive pre-medication protocol is essential to prevent extreme pain at any stage, which can help avoid central sensitization — a phenomenon known to heighten pain perception. Oral opioids, which act on the μ -receptor to reduce the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, may serve as effective preemptive analgesics. The most frequently used is Oxycontin, for example, the oral administration of OxyContin 10mg has been successfully used as a pre-emptive narcotic in orthopaedics. This is especially crucial within the first 48 hours post-surgery to prevent the development of pain imprinting and sensitization with consequent opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Preoperative opioid abusers, for example, require more PO intravenous rescue narcotics compared to matched controls and are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality after orthopaedic surgery. Conversely, a well-administered protocol for multimodal analgesia aims to prevent pain transduction (local tissue), transmission (peripheral nerves and spinal cord), and perception (central nervous system), nearly eliminating or at least reducing the need for parenteral narcotics (especially opioids) in post-op patients. Already in 2009 there have been reports on the use of pre-emptive analgesia combined with PO pain management to shorten the overall length of stay (LOS) following total knee arthroplasty. More recently, Trasolini et al described how the implementation of preoperative education, medications, and the administration of spinal anaesthesia, and intraoperative wound injections of morphine, ketorolac (Toradol), and ropivacaine have eliminated the necessity for stronger oral pain medications beyond Norco (at a dose of 10mg every 3–4 hours prn). For both hip and knee patients, the same pain medications used in the hospital (eg, Norco, acetaminophen, tramadol) were prescribed for home use. Additionally, each patient was instructed to take 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily for three weeks. Another anaesthetic technique used for hip and knee replacement surgery consisted of morphine 100µg or sufentanil 2.5–5µg in addition to local anaesthetics for patients younger than 80 years; analgesia was started intraoperatively with intravenous paracetamol and ketoprofen, and following the insertion of the implant, tranexamic acid was administered at a dosage of 20mg/kg. After surgery, patients were first taken to the recovery room. Once their pain and PO nausea and vomiting were effectively managed, and in the absence of any active bleeding, they were then transferred to the ward. The PO analgesia protocol consisted of oral administration of paracetamol 1g 3x per day, celecoxib 200mg/die, oxycodone 5–10mg 2x per day (depending on numerical rating scale NRS pain assessment) and 20 oral drops of tramadol 100mg/mL drops as "rescue" medication. This prescription was advised for use not only during hospitalization but also following discharge, ensuring sufficient comfort during rest and physical therapy. This clinical evidence shows that an optimal opioid-induced anaesthesia protocol requires a peak of narcotic as pre-emptive medication or prior to surgery when the receptors are still available and the sensitization to pain did not occur, while postoperatively only milder opiates in combination with different analgesic techniques are required to maintain an adequate level of analgesia during recovery (Table 2). While preventing the occurrence of chronic pain, this model of pain management aims to decrease opiate doses altogether, thereby reducing the potential for side effects from opioid use, which can hinder recovery. Additionally, proactive plans are made with patients and their families for a smooth transition to home care following surgery. The discharge process is closely monitored, particularly during the first week, to significantly minimize the likelihood of emergency room visits.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^1ddd3af1]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in the prehospital setting — Emergency medical services (EMS) pain management protocols need to include several therapeutic options for pain management to allow for individualized patient care, and use of pharmacologic pain interventions in the EMS environment requires both the presence of an advanced-level EMS provider and clinical protocols that permit their use. Analgesic dose ketamine is the ideal primary analgesic because of its limited hemodynamic effects, and when within the EMS providers' scope of practice and clinically appropriate, analgesics should be administered en route, even for short transports. Trauma patients who receive pharmacologic analgesia must receive close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and continuous end-tidal CO2 to detect any deterioration in their condition. Nonpharmacologic pain management techniques commonly used by EMS providers include positioning, splinting, the use of cold or heat therapies, and calming techniques, but insufficient evidence exists currently to either support or oppose use of other nonpharmacologic techniques by EMS. Practical considerations include that due to the small space and storage characteristics of ambulances, the number of pain management medications that can be stocked often limits choices available, and coordination between the trauma service and the EMS medical director is essential for optimal patient care and system integration.

Best practices for postoperative pain control

While some public health officials have argued that pain control is a fundamental human right, there are practical, clinical reasons for effectively controlling postoperative pain. First, there is growing evidence – along with the intuitive sense of most clinicians – that effective analgesia facilitates ambulation and rehabilitation.

The Royal College of Anesthetists has set forth best practice standards for postoperative pain control. For all patients for all surgeries, pain should be < 4 on an 11-point VAS within 30 minutes in the recovery room. Patients should also be pain free at rest. Before patients are discharged, they should be given regular and breakthrough analgesic agents along with dosing instructions and, if necessary, antiemetic therapy. This is more complicated for patients at risk for cardiorespiratory morbidity; they may require more dynamic analgesia to adjust to their condition. If analgesia fails, this failure should be detected within no > 2 hours and managed appropriately to restore analgesic relief.

While these principles seem reasonable and laudable, the challenge for busy real-world clinics is finding practical and efficient ways to implement best practices. That can be done by establishing pain protocols, using multimodal analgesic regimens, and setting up APS.

Other subpopulations — guidance notes that patients who are critically ill, cognitively impaired, or who have communication difficulties present unique challenges; techniques that reduce drug dosages required to provide effective analgesia (e.g., regional analgesia and multimodal analgesia) may be suitable for such patients, whereas behavioral modalities and techniques such as PCA that depend upon self-administration are generally less suitable for the cognitively impaired; the literature is insufficient to evaluate methods specific to these populations (Category D evidence); anesthesiologists should recognize that such patients may require additional interventions and should consider a therapeutic trial of an analgesic in patients with increased blood pressure and heart rate or agitated behavior when causes other than pain have been excluded.

### The treatment of acute pain in the emergency department: a white paper position statement prepared for the American academy of emergency medicine [^219efe8c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is one of the most common reasons patients present to the emergency department (ED). Emergency physicians should be aware of the numerous opioid and nonopioid alternatives available for the treatment of pain.

Objectives

To provide expert consensus guidelines for the safe and effective treatment of acute pain in the ED.

Methods

Multiple independent literature searches using PubMed were performed regarding treatment of acute pain. A multidisciplinary panel of experts in Pharmacology and Emergency Medicine reviewed and discussed the literature to develop consensus guidelines.

Recommendations

The guidelines provide resources for the safe use of opioids in the ED as well as pharmacological and nonpharmacological alternatives to opioid analgesia. Care should be tailored to the patient based on their specific acute painful condition and underlying risk factors and comorbidities.

Conclusions

Analgesia in the ED should be provided in the most safe and judicious manner, with the goals of relieving acute pain while decreasing the risk of complications and opioid dependence.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^9002aacd]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Institutional policies that enhance or hinder appropriate opioid prescribing practices — there is significant institutional variability in analgesic use; for example, a US Northeast study of critically ill infants found that in 2 hospitals, fewer than one-half of infants received an opioid during their hospitalization, but in 3 other hospitals, more than 80% of infants received an opioid, and variability was not fully explained by differences in clinical need; policies at state, local, health-system, and health care system levels influence prescribing, with potential benefits such as limiting initial opioid prescriptions to several days and potential harms including preventing needed longer durations and causing uncontrolled pain and distress, underscoring the need for studies to guide evidence-based policies and quality improvement.

### Development of evidence-based recommendations for procedure-specific pain management: PROSPECT methodology [^e795ded0]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Procedure‐specific recommendations for several surgical procedures have been completed by the PROSPECT collaboration and are accessible on the website 10 and published in the peer‐reviewed literature. The currently available procedures are subject to formal review and updating, within a prescribed time‐frame, usually every 3–5 years, so that they remain valid and clinically relevant. During this period, a literature review is performed every year for all surgical procedures and appropriate studies will be added to a separate section on the website.

Despite the rigour of the PROSPECT methodology, there are some limitations. The strength of the systematic review is based on the quality of published studies. Most RCTs assess a single‐analgesic intervention with a placebo group commonly receiving opioid monotherapy and opioids as a rescue. Also, there is a lack of evidence on analgesic interventions in the setting of some specific surgical procedures as well as lack of accurate dosing and duration data, which makes providing precise recommendations challenging. Another limitation is that there may be interventions, doses or routes of administration in published studies that are no longer appropriate in current practice. Alternatively, some analgesic techniques may be introduced into current clinical practice without being subjected to a rigorous comparative study. Moreover, published literature may lag behind clinical practice, thus decreasing the clinical relevance of the review. Most studies of analgesic interventions do not assess their effects on clinically‐relevant outcomes, such as movement‐related pain scores or surgery‐related physical function 26. Similarly, when determining the benefits of an analgesic intervention, pain scores and/or opioid requirements should not be considered in isolation of clinically‐relevant outcome measures. For example, in patients undergoing abdominal surgery, assessment of analgesic intervention on functional outcomes such as bowel function and consequences on length of hospital stay is critical. Furthermore, there is a lack of high‐quality procedure‐ and patient‐specific evidence with sufficient information on the efficacy and safety of simple basic analgesia integrated into a fully implemented evidence‐based enhanced recovery programme 8.

Progress, however, is surprisingly slow, the result of continued uncertainty by providers as to appropriate opioid use, fear of criminal prosecution, and lack of institutional attention to pain management. Progress, however, is also evident, with accreditors paying more attention to pain management, the implementation of team approaches in some hospitals, and the recognition by physicians and other providers that pain, just as any clinical problem, needs to be treated in an effective manner.

### Current perspectives on the assessment and management of pain in the intensive care unit [^147e21c1]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Critical illness is often painful, both from the underlying source of illness, as well as necessary procedures performed for the monitoring and care of these patients. Pain is often under-recognized in the critically ill, especially among those who cannot self-report, so accurate assessment and management continue to be major consideration in their care. Pain management in the intensive care unit (ICU) is an evolving practice, with a focus on accurate and frequent pain assessment, and targeted pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment methods to maximize analgesia and minimize sedation. In this review, we will evaluate several validated methods of pain assessment in the ICU and present management options. We will review the evidence-based recommendations put forth by the largest critical care societies and several high-quality studies related to both the in-hospital approach to pain, as well as the short- and long-term consequences of untreated pain in ICU patients. We conclude with future directions.

### Development of evidence-based recommendations for procedure-specific pain management: PROSPECT methodology [^114c10c8]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

The recognition of the above‐mentioned limitations of conventional guidelines led to the formation of the procedure‐specific pain management (PROSPECT) initiative, which aims to provide healthcare professionals with practical and evidence‐based recommendations for pain management in common, but potentially painful, operations formulated in a way that facilitates clinical decision making across all stages of the peri‐operative period on a procedure‐specific basis. A well‐defined methodological process includes a procedure‐specific systematic review of available literature as well as critical analyses of the study design of included studies for their relevance to current practice 6. In addition, there is a focus on interventions in the context of multimodal non‐opioid analgesic strategies and consideration of risks and benefits of interventions in the specific surgical setting.

The aim of this manuscript is to provide a detailed description of the current PROSPECT methodology with the intention of providing the rigour and transparency in which the procedure‐specific pain management recommendations are developed.

Opioid use and nonpharmacologic strategies in the emergency department emphasize that patients with a history of chronic opioid use or SUD often have greater analgesic needs than opioid-naïve patients, and providers should not withhold opioids solely due to a history of SUD. Protocols need to include pain assessment and management strategies while accounting for hemodynamic status and prioritizing resuscitation, and prioritize nonpharmacologic techniques for pain management when possible.

### Improving medication safety practice at a community hospital: a focus on bar code medication administration scanning and pain reassessment [^25e75c6d]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Pain reassessments

The Joint Commission developed new pain assessment and management standards designed to improve pain management practices in the areas of assessment, treatment, education and monitoring. Performing pain assessments and reassessments prior to and postpain medication administration is crucial in determining appropriate use of therapy, progress towards pain management goals and monitoring adverse effects to treatment. Pain reassessments postpain medication administration also allow clinicians to assess for advancing sedation and identify high-risk patients who may benefit from frequent monitoring to reduce risk of opioid-related respiratory depression and death. In one outpatient study, pain reassessment compliance within 30 min after pain medication administration was only 38% which leaves a strong possibility of adverse effects occurring unnoticed. Strikingly low pain reassessments (4.4%) after analgesic administration was noted in postoperative pain settings at two surgical settings in a major metropolitan hospital. A review of patients with cancer conducted in five hospitals found that pain intensity was only noted in 57% of outpatients and 53% of inpatients with reassessment after treatment reported in 34% of outpatient and 44% of inpatient charts. Pain reassessments among critically ill patients in two healthcare centres was noted at 66%. Though there are clear deficiencies, literature describing process improvement activities and pain reassessment practices in the hospital setting is minimal.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^4c55c1b3]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — opioid use disorder (OUD) with pain and perioperative management states that alternative treatments including nonopioid medications, behavioral approaches, physical therapy, and procedural approaches (e.g., regional anesthesia) should be considered before prescribing opioid medications for pain. For patients with pain who have an active OUD but are not on MAT, methadone or buprenorphine should be considered, and the patient's OUD and pain should be stabilized and managed concurrently. For patients taking methadone or buprenorphine, temporary increases in the dosing frequency (i.e., split dosing to maximize the analgesic properties of these medications) may be effective for managing pain. For patients taking methadone for OUD with acute pain refractory to other treatments, adding a short acting full agonist opioid to their regular dose of methadone can be considered to manage moderate to severe acute pain. For patients receiving buprenorphine for OUD with moderate to severe acute pain refractory to other treatments, addition of as needed doses of buprenorphine may be beneficial, and the addition of a short acting full agonist is not recommended outside of a supervised hospital setting. Discontinuation of methadone or buprenorphine before surgery is not required, and higher potency intravenous full agonists opioids can be used perioperatively for analgesia.

Transitioning to outpatient care — patient and caregiver education (Recommendation 32) — The panel recommends that clinicians provide education to all patients (adult and children) and primary caregivers on the pain treatment plan including tapering of analgesics after hospital discharge (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Data on the effectiveness of discharge planning and follow-up are scarce and insufficient to provide strong guidance on optimal methods, but anecdotal reports and clinical experience suggest the need for appropriate discharge teaching and coordination of transition to the medical home as part of the postoperative pain management plan. A coordinated approach to discharge instruction is important, including advice from prescribers, nurses, physiotherapists, and pharmacists, and clarity should be established about with whom and when to follow-up for questions and transition of care back to the primary provider. Patients should be counseled on how to take pain medications safely and how to manage side effects to optimize pain control and recovery with return to usual activities.

Care delivery models and scope of questions — the panel noted that care delivery of pain treatment, including site of care and protocol for opioid delivery, is vital to optimal outcomes; the emergency department (ED) is the most common site of care for acute pain treatment, but alternative models such as day hospitals and infusion clinics have emerged, prompting evaluation of their impact on outcomes important to patients and of variability in opioid delivery including time to first dose, individualized dosing, and modes such as basal IV opioid infusion or as part of patient-controlled analgesia during hospitalization. The panel agreed that the guideline needed to address both acute and chronic pain, that final recommendations should be distinct for these sub-classes to reflect variation in manifestations and etiology that may require different treatment approaches, and because optimal pain management is interdisciplinary, it addressed opioid therapy, nonopioid pharmacological therapies, nonpharmacological and integrative therapies, and the role of chronic transfusion therapy; there was panel consensus that it was vital to propose all important questions regardless of potentially available data to drive research if deficiencies in the evidence base were identified. Clearly established a priori definitions of acute and chronic pain for individuals living with SCD were integral to the development of the questions and systematic review of the evidence.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^feb8bff6]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management at hospital discharge — risk factors and patient education: Sustained prior opioid use (i.e., opioid use for at least 6 months) significantly increases the likelihood of long-term opioid use after surgery or admission for trauma, and other patient risk factors include patient age, socioeconomic status, history of psychiatric disorders, and intensity of the surgical intervention. Much less information is available regarding the influence of preoperative and in-hospital opioid type (e.g., hydrocodone vs. oxycodone vs. sustained-release vs. synthetics), and available information is highly confounded by small study samples, single center practice, and selection/ indication bias. A general recommendation is to discharge patients on a type and dose of opioid comparable to that performing adequately in the inpatient environment following a surgery. Educate patients prior to discharge regarding the risk factors associated with sustained prescription use, an anticipated plan for weaning from opioids, and an envisioned timeline for transition to nonnarcotic analgesics. Include discussions about the role of nonpharmacologic pain management modalities, cognitive-behavioral techniques, self-efficacy and optimism, and other nonpharmacologic adjuncts such as ice packs. Have a clear plan for outpatient follow-up and decide if renewal of opioid medications may occur beforehand or only at the time of office reevaluation.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^67f22edc]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management at hospital discharge — The type, amount, and duration of opioids issued at discharge must balance the risks of inadequate pain control against the likelihood of sustained prescription opioid use, misuse, abuse, and SUD. The amount of opioid given in the 24 hours prior to discharge may predict postdischarge opioid requirements, and discharge prescriptions should separate opioids and nonopioid analgesics to more easily taper opioid use. Educate patients prior to discharge regarding individualized risk factors associated with sustained prescription use, an individualized analgesic plan, and an anticipated timeline for weaning. Additionally, prescription opioids not consumed by the patient can influence opioid abuse and addiction in the community through diversion or illicit use by other individuals. Most patients who are sustained prescription opioid users did not initiate sustained opioid use following surgery or an inpatient hospital encounter. The prevalence of sustained prescription opioid use for up to 6 months following surgery is reported to be in the range of < 1–45%, with rates documented at or below 1% among opioid‑naïve patients and much higher — over 10% — among those already exposed to opioids at the time of surgery for traumatic orthopaedic injuries.

Our findings indicated that the quality and outcome of pain management improved greatly after the establishment and implementation of the pain management system. In recent years, paying attention to patients' pain feeling and achieving a pain-free hospital have been widely adopted and promoted by an increasing number of Chinese health professionals. Nevertheless, pain of different intensities is also common after major surgeries, and it is recommended that hospitals popularize and implement perioperative multimodal analgesia strategies to reduce the incidence of postoperative pain.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^f5534341]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in the intensive care unit — rationale and patient factors — the intent of these guidelines is to increase the use of multimodal analgesia (MMA) and to improve pain management for the more than 50% of patients who report inadequate pain relief while in the ICU. MMA decreases opioid requirements in the ICU, and a recent survey of trauma surgeons documented that they were prescribing fewer opioids. It is imperative to account for a patient's past medical history and comorbidities when choosing an analgesic regimen, and patients with SUD prior to admission are often an MMA challenge when attempting to manage alcohol or drug withdrawal and achieve satisfactory levels of analgesia. It is important to recognize that under- and over-treatment of pain contributes to the development of chronic pain syndromes, specifically in the ICU; chronic pain syndromes are common following trauma and surgery, and an increasing number of reports address hyperalgesia in response to opioids and the relation of hyperalgesia to chronic pain syndrome development. The goal is to avoid inadequate pain management while assuring the analgesia provided matches the severity of pain experienced by the patient.

### Managing pain in low resource settings: healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitude and practice regarding pain management in Western Nepal [^a5cb8660]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Practice related to pain management among healthcare professionals revealed that still few doctors, pharmacists, and nurses do not use any assessment tool to assess the patient's pain level, which is consistent with the findings of Shakya et al, 2020 and Nuseir et al, 2016. Limited consultation time of the physician's 5.26 ± 2.31 minutesdue to several contributing factors; higher patient flow, workload and lack of clear protocol on patient assessment could also have impacted the pain assessment. Likewise, inadequate training and inappropriate nurse-to-patient ratios were considered barriers to implementing the nursing process, which could relate to pain assessment as well.

The verbal or graphical rating scale is the most widely used tool to assess pain in the current study, in contrast to the study by Shakya et al, 2020 where the visual analog scale was primarily used almost by 84% of healthcare professionals. However, there is still variation in the choice of pain assessment tool between healthcare professionals. A common practice for pain assessment of outpatients in Nepal is to verbally ask the patient the intensity and types of pain and note the patient's response. This could be due to the lack of implementation of pain management guidelines and knowledge of the available pain assessment tools. However, nurses use different pain assessment tools in the in-patient hospital settings, including the numeric pain rating scaleand The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. These pain assessment tools are available in Nepalese languages, and they can be used in hospital and clinical settings for better practice. Likewise, pain characterization with an appropriate tool like McGill pain questionnaire could help in better pain assessment and management.

Most pharmacists reported that they never or rarely used the pain assessment tool. Clinical pharmacy practice is a recent establishment in Nepalese hospital settings as per the government's directive (2015 hospital pharmacy guidelines). Nepalese hospital pharmacists are primarily involved in dispensing medications and counselling. Their involvement in pain management activities such as pain assessment, pain medication education, and pharmacotherapy review of pain medications are still lacking in Nepalese hospitals. Therefore, pharmacists have less opportunity to deal with the patient's symptoms as they meet the patient only after the assessment is complete. This trend might change if more clinical pharmacists are well trained and involved in multidisciplinary pain management teams involving nurses, physicians, and pharmacists are set up at Nepalese hospitals in the near future. These pharmacists can help with pain management via medication review, pain assessment, discharge counselling, medication reconciliation, and medication education.

### Managing pain in low resource settings: healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitude and practice regarding pain management in Western Nepal [^081a6b62]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Proper pain management needs healthcare professionals to be appropriately trained on pain management, which involves appropriately assessing pain and selecting the right medicines and approaches. Therefore, the knowledge and training of healthcare professionals on pain education form the backbone of improved pain care. Studies carried out among healthcare professionals in several countries have revealed varied responses ranging from sufficient to inadequate level of knowledge, attitude, and practice on pain management. Low scores were obtained on key aspects of pain management, including initial assessment, treatment plan, reassessment, and knowledge of the pharmacology of medications, especially narcotics. Studies have also reported poor knowledge and attitudes regarding pain relief among healthcare professionals, lack of access to medicines and proper pain treatment, financial and socioeconomic factors among patients as the main barriers to effective pain management. These studies highlight the need to assess healthcare providers' knowledge regarding pain management in each country and provide training and support as per the local needs.

In Nepal, patients with acute or chronic pain visit hospitals (both public and private), clinics, and other available healthcare facilities that could provide pain management. For minor ailments, including mild to moderate pain, patients prefer self-medication with the available over-the-counter medications. Many patients visit tertiary care hospitals or hospitals because of the availability of multiple facilities at low cost and the available insurance policy. Some institutions have pain management clinics that provide outpatient services and interventions. A multidisciplinary approach to pain management is gradually emerging in Nepal, especially in the private sector. There are very few specialized pain management clinics in the country, and most of them are localized in the capital city Kathmandu. A study by Shakya et al has reported strict opioid regulation, lack of knowledge among patients about pain management, insufficient staff, and the least priority for pain management services as barriers to pain management in Nepal. Furthermore, Nepal lacks a comprehensive pain management strategy at the national level that deals with procedures, policies, systems, and human resources required to manage chronic pain. There is inadequacy in terms of proper training of healthcare professionals on pain management, availability of therapeutic resources, and dedicated pain management programs in hospitals. Very few studies have been conducted in Nepal regarding the knowledge, attitude, and practice of healthcare professionals on pain management, and the studies focused only on nurses.

General principles regarding multimodal analgesia — The panel recommends that clinicians offer multimodal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with nonpharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). For implementation, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analgesics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain, and because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies, the panel suggests that clinicians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multimodal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients.

### Safely managing acute osteoarthritis in the emergency department: an evidence-based review [^3e81f0b5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Joint pain caused by acute osteoarthritis (OA) is a common finding in the emergency department. Patients with OA often have debilitating pain that limits their function and ability to complete their activities of daily living. In addition, OA has been associated with a high percentage of arthritis-related hospital admissions and an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Safely managing OA symptoms in these patients can present many challenges to the emergency provider.

Objectives

We review the risks and benefits of available treatment options for acute OA-related pain in the emergency department. In addition, evidence-based recommendations will be made for safely managing pain and disability associated with OA in patients with comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Discussion

Commonly used treatments for OA include acetaminophen, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids, each with varying degrees of efficacy and risk depending on the patient's underlying comorbidities. Effective alternative therapies, such as topical preparations, intra-articular corticosteroid injections, bracing, and rehabilitation are likely underused in this setting.

Conclusions

Emergency providers should be aware of the risks and benefits of all treatment options available for acute OA pain, including oral medications, topical preparations, corticosteroid injections, bracing, and physical therapy.

### Nonopioid therapies for pain management… [^a48288aa]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pain Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Many acute pain conditions can often be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications. Noninvasive and nonpharmacologic approaches to acute pain also have the potential to improve pain and function without risk for serious harms. Clinicians can consider using nonopioid therapies to treat common types of acute pain including:

- Low back or neck pain
- Dental pain
- Kidney stone pain
- Pain related to musculoskeletal injuries
- Pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and mild postoperative pain
- Headaches, including episodic migraine. For additional information and examples regarding nonopioid and noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapy approaches for treating acute pain, please refer to Recommendation 1 in the 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline. Nonopioid treatment options for acute pain Nonpharmacologic pain therapies
- Ice
- Heat
- Elevation
- Rest
- Immobilization
- Exercise Nonopioid medications
- Topical or oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
- Acetaminophen
- Triptans, antiemetics, and dihydroergotamine for migraine Refer to Recommendation 1 in the 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for additional information and examples of nonopioid therapies to treat acute pain. Subacute and chronic pain Nonopioid therapies are preferred for subacute and chronic pain.

Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider initiating opioid therapy if expected benefits for pain and function are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient.
- Topical and oral NSAIDs
- Acetaminophen
- Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants
- Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
- Anticonvulsants
- Capsaicin and lidocaine patches.

### Practice guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on acute pain management [^05b52d5f]. Anesthesiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for Pediatric Patients — perioperative pain management emphasizes that aggressive and proactive pain management is necessary to overcome undertreatment in children, with developmentally appropriate pain assessment and therapy, and specifies that analgesic therapy should depend upon age, weight, and comorbidity and should involve a multimodal approach unless contraindicated; behavioral techniques, important for the emotional component of pain, should be applied whenever feasible.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^a40311c2]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Multimodal pain management — key points and patient counseling — emphasizes clear patient expectations, proactive assessment, scheduled nonopioid analgesics, and planned de-escalation. The page states to counsel patients that the goal of pain management is not eradication of all pain and to inform patients that pain is normal after trauma and surgery, medications are meant to alleviate but not remove pain entirely, and pain may increase as mobility increases. Key points include that patient education about expectations for management is a highly effective intervention for pain management, to promptly investigate the cause of increasing pain rather than responding by increasing the analgesic dose or adding new medications, to administer acetaminophen and ibuprofen "around-the-clock" to maintain a constant serum level, and to have a protocol for safe de-escalation of analgesics as quickly as possible. The page defines multimodal analgesia (MMA) as the use of multiple analgesics, regional analgesia, and nonpharmacologic interventions to affect peripheral and/or central nervous system loci in the pain pathway, and notes that the MMA concept may be applied across the care continuum with strategies suited to each phase of care.

### Causes and consequences of inadequate management of acute pain [^3d2304b2]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Intense acute pain afflicts millions of patients each year. Despite the recently increased focus on the importance of pain control, management of acute pain has remained suboptimal.

Objective

The objective of this study was to identify through a review of recent literature the barriers to effective treatment of acute pain and the potential consequences of inadequate pain management.

Design

A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify articles relevant to the management of acute pain. Information regarding the underlying causes of inadequate pain management, as well as the sequelae associated with undermanaged pain was extracted and summarized.

Results

Studies indicate that treatment of acute pain remains suboptimal due to attitudes and educational barriers on the part of both physicians and patients, as well as the intrinsic limitations of available therapies. Inadequate management of acute pain negatively impacts numerous aspects of patient health, and may increase the risk of developing chronic pain. Although opioids are the preferred treatment for most moderate to severe acute pain, their side effects can impede their use, and thus, their clinical effectiveness. Analgesic regimens with an improved efficacy/tolerability balance have the potential to improve acute pain management, and thus reduce the incidence of chronic pain. Studies examining the use of multiple analgesics with different mechanisms of action suggest that multimodal therapies may offer an improved efficacy/tolerability balance over single agent regimens.

Conclusions

There exists a significant need for effective, well-tolerated analgesic therapies to limit the negative consequences of undermanaged acute pain. The use of multimodal therapy has demonstrated increasing promise and is supported by current practice guidelines.

### Acute pain management after trauma: what you need to know [^89b3ede5]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Effective acute pain control is mandatory after injury. Opioids continue to be a pillar acute pain management of strategies despite not being as effective as some nonnarcotic alternatives. An acute pain management strategy after trauma should be thoughtful, effective, and responsible. A thoughtful approach includes managing a patient's expectations for acute pain control and ensuring that interventions purposefully and rationally affect the domain of pain that is uncontrolled. An effective pain management strategy includes a multimodal approach using acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and regional anesthesia. A responsible acute pain management approach includes knowing the relative strengths of the opioids prescribed and standardized approach to opioid prescribing at discharge to minimize diversion. Acute pain management is quite understudied, and future considerations include a reliable objective measurement of pain and the evaluation of nonmedication acute pain interventions.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^f7f65a56]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

This is the first clinical practice guideline (CPG) from the American Academy of Pediatrics outlining evidence-based approaches to safely prescribing opioids for acute pain in outpatient settings. The central goal is to aid clinicians in understanding when opioids may be indicated to treat acute pain in children and adolescents and how to minimize risks (including opioid use disorder, poisoning, and overdose). The document also seeks to alleviate disparate pain treatment of Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native children and adolescents, who receive pain management that is less adequate and less timely than that provided to white individuals. There may also be disparities in pain treatment based on language, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and other factors, which are discussed. The document recommends that clinicians treat acute pain using a multimodal approach that includes the appropriate use of nonpharmacologic therapies, nonopioid medications, and, when needed, opioid medications. Opioids should not be prescribed as monotherapy for children or adolescents who have acute pain. When using opioids for acute pain management, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioid formulations, start with the lowest age- and weight-appropriate doses, and provide an initial supply of 5 or fewer days, unless the pain is related to trauma or surgery with expected duration of pain longer than 5 days. Clinicians should not prescribe codeine or tramadol for patients younger than 12 years; adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, or severe lung disease; to treat postsurgical pain after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy in patients younger than 18 years; or for any breastfeeding patient. The CPG recommends providing opioids when appropriate for treating acutely worsened pain in children and adolescents who have a history of chronic pain; clinicians should partner with other opioid-prescribing clinicians involved in the patient's care and/or a specialist in chronic pain or palliative care to determine an appropriate treatment plan. Caution should be used when treating acute pain in those who are taking sedating medications. The CPG describes potential harms of discontinuing or rapidly tapering opioids in individuals who have been on stable, long-term opioids to treat chronic pain. The guideline also recommends providing naloxone and information on naloxone, safe storage and disposal of opioids, and direct observation of medication administration. Clinicians are encouraged to help caregivers develop a plan for safe disposal. The CPG contains 12 key action statements based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-quality observational studies, and, when studies are lacking or could not feasibly or ethically be conducted, from expert opinion. Each key action statement includes a level of evidence, the benefit-harm relationship, and the strength of recommendation.
