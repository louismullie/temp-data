## Question

Antibiotics that can treat cellulitis and furuncle?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics can treat cellulitis and furuncles, with explicit stepwise thinking and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing cellulitis from furuncles and classifying severity. Then, I should verify likely pathogens and when to cover MRSA. Next, I will review first-line empiric therapy for cellulitis and the role of incision and drainage for furuncles. After that, I need to check duration, route, and when to escalate or broaden therapy. Finally, I should confirm special populations, stewardship considerations, and a concise summary algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and severity framework, because management hinges on this distinction. Cellulitis is a nonpurulent infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, typically spreading and erythematous, whereas a furuncle is a localized purulent abscess centered on a hair follicle; carbuncles are clusters of furuncles and are more extensive, so I need to keep that in mind when planning drainage and antibiotics. I should also classify severity using the IDSA framework: mild without systemic signs, moderate with systemic features but stable, and severe with SIRS or hemodynamic instability, as this drives route and spectrum of therapy.

> Next, I should review likely pathogens and MRSA risk, and I need to ensure I don't overcall MRSA in nonpurulent cellulitis. For typical nonpurulent cellulitis, beta-hemolytic streptococci predominate, with S. aureus less common and MRSA an unusual cause unless specific risk factors are present, so empiric therapy should prioritize streptococcal coverage first [^114qTzei] [^114pSATx]. For purulent furuncles and carbuncles, S. aureus is the usual pathogen and community-associated MRSA prevalence is substantial in many regions, so I should consider MRSA-active therapy when systemic features, immunocompromise, or failure of initial therapy are present [^111eVYNk] [^114Z8V8r] [^116nahUu].

> Now, for nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic signs, I will start with streptococcal-active therapy and avoid unnecessary MRSA coverage. Suitable oral options include penicillin, amoxicillin, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin, with a recommended duration of 5 days, extending only if there is inadequate clinical response by day 5, which balances efficacy and stewardship [^116aZEV3] [^116QtZHg] [^111gsSaf]. Wait, let me verify the MRSA point: adding TMP-SMX to cephalexin did not improve outcomes in uncomplicated cellulitis without abscess, reinforcing that routine MRSA coverage is not beneficial in this scenario [^1148wif9] [^112JMiZb].

> For cellulitis with systemic signs or MRSA risk factors, I should broaden empiric therapy. I need to ensure coverage for both MRSA and streptococci in the presence of penetrating trauma, prior MRSA, injection drug use, SIRS, or failure of beta-lactam therapy, using agents such as vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, or oral options like clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or doxycycline combined with a beta-lactam when dual coverage is desired, while individualizing based on local resistance and severity [^111zAoE9] [^1166kUD4] [^115M76PW]. Hold on, I should verify duration here: severe infections are typically treated for 7–14 days with IV-to-PO step-down once clinically stable, and this approach aligns with IDSA and WSES guidance [^114LP8SG] [^115KeBek].

> Turning to furuncles, I need to emphasize that incision and drainage is the primary therapy for abscesses, large furuncles, and carbuncles, and antibiotics are often unnecessary in simple cases without systemic features or immunocompromise [^115aUj6s] [^111eVYNk]. But wait, what if there is SIRS, impaired host defenses, or failure after drainage? In those situations, I should add antibiotics active against MRSA, such as TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, or linezolid, tailoring to local susceptibility and patient factors [^111eVYNk] [^1166kUD4]. I should double-check that guidelines discourage routine antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils, which supports a drainage-first strategy with selective antibiotic use [^113XQ3Kf] [^116VEGCz].

> I will now examine route and duration, and I need to ensure I'm not defaulting to IV therapy when oral is safe and effective. For most stable patients, oral therapy is appropriate, with IV reserved for severe infection, systemic instability, poor absorption, or failure of oral therapy; importantly, oral therapy has been shown to be comparable to IV in cellulitis, and shorter courses are effective when patients improve clinically [^112gCWiy] [^112JMiZb]. Let me reconsider duration: 5 days is sufficient for many uncomplicated cellulitis cases, with extension to 7–14 days for severe disease or slow response, and this is supported by IDSA and contemporary reviews [^116QtZHg] [^112JMiZb].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts, and I need to check that I adjust therapy accordingly. In children, avoid agents not approved for pediatric use and prefer clindamycin or TMP-SMX when MRSA is suspected; in pregnancy, avoid tetracyclines and TMP-SMX near term; in diabetes-related foot infections, treat for 1–2 weeks with agents active against staphylococci and streptococci, adding gram-negative coverage if severe; and in recurrent cellulitis, address predisposing factors and consider prophylactic penicillin for those with frequent episodes despite risk-factor control [^1149pVqY] [^116Nf3FQ] [^115ssoEa]. Hold on, I should verify the prophylaxis evidence: moderate-certainty data show reduced recurrence during prophylaxis, but benefits wane after stopping, so I must balance risks and patient preferences [^1139Z69g].

> I should confirm stewardship and follow-up elements to minimize overtreatment. Many cellulitis cases are overdiagnosed or overtreated, so I need to reassess the diagnosis at 48–72 hours and de-escalate or stop antibiotics if not improving, obtain cultures in purulent infections or treatment failures, and avoid dual coverage unless clearly indicated, as dual therapy has not improved outcomes in uncomplicated cellulitis [^111CRrQw] [^114GHCWS] [^1148wif9]. Let me double-check that guidelines emphasize treating predisposing skin conditions and elevation to reduce recurrence, which I should reinforce during discharge planning [^114NgcMq] [^117Ntmyk].

> Finally, let me synthesize a concise, clinically usable algorithm and ensure it aligns with the evidence. For nonpurulent cellulitis without systemic signs, use a 5-day oral beta-lactam active against streptococci and extend only if needed; for cellulitis with systemic features or MRSA risks, use MRSA-active therapy with streptococcal coverage and treat 7–14 days with IV-to-PO step-down when stable; for simple furuncles, prioritize incision and drainage without routine antibiotics; for furuncles with systemic features, immunocompromise, or failure, add MRSA-active antibiotics after drainage, all while reassessing at 48–72 hours and tailoring to cultures and clinical response [^114pSATx] [^116QtZHg] [^111eVYNk] [^112JMiZb].

---

Cellulitis is best treated with **beta-lactams** (cephalexin, dicloxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate) for 5–6 days [^111gsSaf]; add **MRSA coverage** (clindamycin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX) if risk factors or no improvement in 48–72 hours [^111zAoE9] [^1152eBNE]. Furuncles require **incision and drainage** [^115aUj6s]; reserve antibiotics for severe cases or MRSA risk, using clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or doxycycline for 7–10 days [^111eVYNk] [^1166kUD4]. Adjust therapy to **local resistance and clinical response** [^114pSATx].

## Antibiotic treatment of cellulitis

### Common pathogens

Common pathogens include **beta-hemolytic streptococci** — most common in nonpurulent cellulitis [^114qTzei] — and Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA, especially in purulent or severe cases [^1122j46K].

---

### First-line antibiotic therapy

First-line therapy is **oral beta-lactams** (cephalexin, dicloxacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate) for 5–6 days [^111gsSaf]; extend if no improvement [^114pSATx].

---

### MRSA coverage

Add **MRSA coverage** with clindamycin, doxycycline, or TMP-SMX when risk factors are present or if there is no improvement in 48–72 hours [^112z7Dvu] [^1152eBNE].

---

### Severe or complicated cellulitis

Use **intravenous therapy** with cefazolin, nafcillin, or vancomycin for severe cases or when oral therapy is not feasible [^112z7Dvu].

---

## Antibiotic treatment of furuncles

### Primary treatment

Incision and drainage (I&D) is **essential** [^1149pVqY]; antibiotics are not routinely required for simple furuncles [^113XQ3Kf].

---

### Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are indicated for **severe infection** — rapid progression, systemic symptoms, immunocompromise, or failure of I&D — and for **MRSA risk**, including prior MRSA, high local prevalence, or failure of initial therapy [^111eVYNk].

---

### Recommended antibiotics for furuncles

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Coverage** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Clindamycin | 300–450 mg orally every 6–8 hours | 7–10 days | MRSA, MSSA |
| TMP-SMX | 1–2 double-strength tablets orally every 12 hours | 7–10 days | MRSA |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally every 12 hours | 7–10 days | MRSA |
| Rifampin (adjunct) | 300 mg orally every 12 hours | 7–10 days | MRSA (with above) |

---

Adjunctive rifampin may be added for **persistent or recurrent MRSA infections** [^notfound].

---

## Clinical considerations and guidelines

- **Local resistance patterns**: Tailor empiric therapy to local antibiograms [^114Ah4NM].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Consider allergies, comorbidities, and severity [^114NgcMq].
- **Follow-up**: Reassess at 48–72 hours; modify therapy based on response and culture results [^1152eBNE].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Infection** | **First-line therapy** | **Mrsa coverage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cellulitis | Beta-lactams (cephalexin, dicloxacillin) | Clindamycin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX | 5–6 days |
| Furuncles | Incision and drainage | Clindamycin, TMP-SMX, doxycycline | 7–10 days (if indicated) |

---

Cellulitis is treated with **beta-lactams**, adding MRSA coverage when indicated [^112z7Dvu]; furuncles require **incision and drainage**, with antibiotics for severe or MRSA-risk cases [^115aUj6s].

### Antibiotic overuse and resistance in dermatology [^111cpRRH]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Antibiotics have a significant role in dermatology, treating a wide range of diseases, including acne, rosacea, inflammatory skin conditions and skin structure infections, such as cellulitis, folliculitis, carbuncles, and furuncles. Because of their consistent use, utility, and availability, antibiotics are susceptible to overuse within the medical practice, and, specific to this discussion, in the dermatologic setting. The issue of continuously increasing risk of antibiotic resistance remains an important concern to the dermatologist. The scope of this review will be to provide an overview of the common antibiotics used in the dermatologic setting with an emphasis on identifying areas of overuse, reported bacterial resistance, and discussion of clinical management aimed at decreasing antibiotic resistance.

### Interventions for bacterial folliculitis and boils (furuncles and carbuncles) [^116RZ7to]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial folliculitis and boils are globally prevalent bacterial infections involving inflammation of the hair follicle and the perifollicular tissue. Some folliculitis may resolve spontaneously, but others may progress to boils without treatment. Boils, also known as furuncles, involve adjacent tissue and may progress to cellulitis or lymphadenitis. A systematic review of the best evidence on the available treatments was needed.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions (such as topical antibiotics, topical antiseptic agents, systemic antibiotics, phototherapy, and incision and drainage) for people with bacterial folliculitis and boils.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2020: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We also searched five trials registers up to June 2020. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed systemic antibiotics; topical antibiotics; topical antiseptics, such as topical benzoyl peroxide; phototherapy; and surgical interventions in participants with bacterial folliculitis or boils. Eligible comparators were active intervention, placebo, or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'clinical cure' and 'severe adverse events leading to withdrawal of treatment'; secondary outcomes were 'quality of life', 'recurrence of folliculitis or boil following completion of treatment', and 'minor adverse events not leading to withdrawal of treatment'. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs (1300 participants). The studies included more males (332) than females (221), although not all studies reported these data. Seventeen trials were conducted in hospitals, and one was conducted in clinics. The participants included both children and adults (0 to 99 years). The studies did not describe severity in detail; of the 232 participants with folliculitis, 36% were chronic. At least 61% of participants had furuncles or boils, of which at least 47% were incised. Duration of oral and topical treatments ranged from 3 days to 6 weeks, with duration of follow-up ranging from 3 days to 6 months. The study sites included Asia, Europe, and America. Only three trials reported funding, with two funded by industry. Ten studies were at high risk of 'performance bias', five at high risk of 'reporting bias', and three at high risk of 'detection bias'. We did not identify any RCTs comparing topical antibiotics against topical antiseptics, topical antibiotics against systemic antibiotics, or phototherapy against sham light. Eleven trials compared different oral antibiotics. We are uncertain as to whether cefadroxil compared to flucloxacillin (17/21 versus 18/20, risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70 to 1.16; 41 participants; 1 study; 10 days of treatment) or azithromycin compared to cefaclor (8/15 versus 10/16, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.40; 31 participants; 2 studies; 7 days of treatment) differed in clinical cure (both very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in clinical cure rate between cefdinir and cefalexin after 17 to 24 days (25/32 versus 32/42, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.38; 74 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), and there probably is little to no difference in clinical cure rate between cefditoren pivoxil and cefaclor after 7 days (24/46 versus 21/47, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.78; 93 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). For risk of severe adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal, there may be little to no difference between cefdinir versus cefalexin after 17 to 24 days (1/191 versus 1/200, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.62; 391 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). There may be an increased risk with cefadroxil compared with flucloxacillin after 10 days (6/327 versus 2/324, RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.60 to 14.62; 651 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) and cefditoren pivoxil compared with cefaclor after 7 days (2/77 versus 0/73, RR 4.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 97.17; 150 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). However, for these three comparisons the 95% CI is very wide and includes the possibility of both increased and reduced risk of events. We are uncertain whether azithromycin affects the risk of severe adverse events leading to withdrawal of treatment compared to cefaclor (274 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence) as no events occurred in either group after seven days. For risk of minor adverse events, there is probably little to no difference between the following comparisons: cefadroxil versus flucloxacillin after 10 days (91/327 versus 116/324, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98; 651 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence) or cefditoren pivoxil versus cefaclor after 7 days (8/77 versus 5/73, RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.52 to 4.42; 150 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of azithromycin versus cefaclor after seven days due to very low-certainty evidence (7/148 versus 4/126, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.17; 274 participants; 2 studies). The study comparing cefdinir versus cefalexin did not report data for total minor adverse events, but both groups experienced diarrhoea, nausea, and vaginal mycosis during 17 to 24 days of treatment. Additional adverse events reported in the other included studies were vomiting, rashes, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as stomach ache, with some events leading to study withdrawal. Three included studies assessed recurrence following completion of treatment, none of which evaluated our key comparisons, and no studies assessed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no RCTs regarding the efficacy and safety of topical antibiotics versus antiseptics, topical versus systemic antibiotics, or phototherapy versus sham light for treating bacterial folliculitis or boils. Comparative trials have not identified important differences in efficacy or safety outcomes between different oral antibiotics for treating bacterial folliculitis or boils. Most of the included studies assessed participants with skin and soft tissue infection which included many disease types, whilst others focused specifically on folliculitis or boils. Antibiotic sensitivity data for causative organisms were often not reported. Future trials should incorporate culture and sensitivity information and consider comparing topical antibiotic with antiseptic, and topical versus systemic antibiotics or phototherapy.

### Route and duration of antibiotic therapy in acute cellulitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness and harms of antibiotic treatment [^112gCWiy]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Compared with guideline recommendations, antibiotic overuse is common in treating cellulitis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses on antibiotic route and duration of treatment for cellulitis in adults and children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registries from inception to Dec 11, 2019 for interventional and observational studies of antibiotic treatment for cellulitis. Exclusions included case series/reports, pre-septal/orbital cellulitis and non-English language articles. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to produce summary relative risk (RR) estimates for our primary outcome of clinical response.

Prospero

CRD42018100602.

Results

We included 47/8423 articles, incorporating data from eleven trials (1855 patients) in two meta-analyses. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Only two trials compared the same antibiotic agent in each group. We found no evidence of difference in clinical response rates for antibiotic route or duration (RR(oral:IV) = 1.12, 95%CI 0.98–1.27, I² = 32% and RR(shorter:longer) = 0.99, 95%CI 0•96–1.03, I² = 0%, respectively). Findings were consistent in observational studies. Follow-up data beyond 30 days were sparse.

Conclusions

The evidence base for antibiotic treatment decisions in cellulitis is flawed by biased comparisons, short follow-up and lack of data around harms of antibiotic overuse. Future research should focus on developing patient-tailored antibiotic prescribing for cellulitis to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^1116bQXs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

How should SSTIs be classified?

The term "skin and soft-tissue infections" describes a wide heterogeneity of clinical conditions. We recommend that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or not purulent), and the clinical condition of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections (recommendation 1C).

SSTIs encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections.

Various classification systems have been used to describe SSTIs including variables such as anatomic location, causative pathogen(s), rate of progression, depth of infection, and severity of clinical presentation.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for their treatment: uncomplicated and complicated. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles and required antibiotics or surgical incision for drainage of abscess alone. In contrast, complicated SSTIs included deep soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing infections, infected ulcers, infected burns, and major abscesses which required significant surgical intervention with drainage and debridement.

Classification

Several systems of classification have been used to describe SSTIs. In 1998 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories - uncomplicated and complicated - for the purpose of clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for the treatment of SSTIs. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles that either require antibiotics alone or in conjunction with surgical incision for drainage of abscess. In contrast, complicated SSTIs involve the deep soft tissues and require significant surgical intervention.

The terms "complicated" and "uncomplicated" skin structure infections is still valid and can be useful in describing SSTIs.

Uncomplicated SSTIs are at low risk for life- or limb-threatening infection unless they are not properly treated. Patients who have uncomplicated SSTIs can be treated with either empiric antibiotic therapy according to likely pathogen and local resistance patterns or simple surgical drainage.

The practice guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections classifies SSTIs into five categories: 1) superficial uncomplicated infection (includes impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis), 2) necrotizing infections, 3) infections associated with bites and animal contact, 4) surgical site infections and 5) infections in the immunocompromised host.

Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions for patients presenting as out-patients to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions for patients with SSTIs. This system is organized into classes of infection:

Class 1: patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.

### Common bacterial skin infections [^113Mk8Jr]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently treat bacterial skin infections in the office and in the hospital. Common skin infections include cellulitis, erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, and furuncles and carbuncles. Cellulitis is an infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue that has poorly demarcated borders and is usually caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species. Erysipelas is a superficial form of cellulitis with sharply demarcated borders and is caused almost exclusively by Streptococcus. Impetigo is also caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus and can lead to lifting of the stratum corneum resulting in the commonly seen bullous effect. Folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicles. When the infection is bacterial rather than mechanical in nature, it is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus. If the infection of the follicle is deeper and involves more follicles, it moves into the furuncle and carbuncle stages and usually requires incision and drainage. All of these infections are typically diagnosed by clinical presentation and treated empirically. If antibiotics are required, one that is active against gram-positive organisms such as penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones should be chosen. Children, patients who have diabetes, or patients who have immunodeficiencies are more susceptible to gram-negative infections and may require treatment with a second- or third-generation cephalosporin.

### Community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft-tissue infections: impact of antimicrobial therapy on outcome [^114iUvWJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Conflicting data exist on the role of antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs).

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of 492 adult patients with 531 independent episodes of community-onset MRSA SSTIs, which consisted of abscesses, furuncles/carbuncles, and cellulitis, at 2 tertiary care medical centers. The purpose of the study was to determine the impact of active antimicrobial therapy (i.e., the use of an agent to which the organism is susceptible) and other potential risk factors on the outcome for patients with uncomplicated community-onset MRSA SSTIs. Treatment failure was the primary outcome of interest and was defined as worsening signs of infection associated with microbiological and/or therapeutic indicators of an unsuccessful outcome. Bivariate analyses and logistic regression analyses were preformed to determine predictors of treatment failure.

Results

An incision and drainage procedure was performed for the majority of patients. Treatment failure occurred in 45 (8%) of 531 episodes of community-onset MRSA SSTI. Therapy was successful for 296 (95%) of 312 patients who received an active antibiotic, compared with 190 (87%) of 219 of those who did not (P = 0.001 in bivariate analysis). Use of an inactive antimicrobial agent was an independent predictor of treatment failure on logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 2.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–6.22; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that certain patients with SSTIs that are likely caused by MRSA would benefit from treatment with an antimicrobial agent with activity against this organism.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Failure of antibiotics in cellulitis trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138M9cS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of the study are to quantify trial-to-trial variability in antibiotic failure rates, in randomized clinical trials of cellulitis treatment and to provide a point estimate for the treatment failure rate across trials.

Methods

We conducted a structured search for clinical trials evaluating antibiotic treatment of cellulitis, indexed in PubMed by August 2015. We included studies published in English and excluded studies conducted wholly outside of developed countries because the pathophysiology of cellulitis is likely to be different in such settings. Two authors reviewed all abstracts identified for possible inclusion. Of studies identified initially, 5% met the selection criteria. Two reviewers extracted data independently, and data were pooled using the Freeman-Tukey transformation under a random-effects model. Our primary outcome was the summary estimate of treatment failure across intent-to-treat and clinically evaluable participants.

Results

We included 19 articles reporting data from 20 studies, for a total of 3935 patients. Treatment failure was reported in 6% to 37% of participants in the 9 trials reporting intent-to-treat results, with a summary point estimate of 18% failing treatment (95% confidence interval, 15%-21%). In the 15 articles evaluating clinically evaluable participants, treatment failure rates ranged from 3% to 42%, and overall, 12% (95% confidence interval, 10%-14%) were designated treatment failures.

Conclusions

Treatment failure rates vary widely across cellulitis trials, from 6% to 37%. This may be due to confusion of cellulitis with its mimics and perhaps problems with construct validity of the diagnosis of cellulitis. Such factors bias trials toward equivalence and, in routine clinical care, impair quality and antibiotic stewardship. Objective diagnostic tools are needed.

### Profile of a novel anionic fluoroquinolone-delafloxacin [^114VRSGT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines on the treatment of ABSSSIs classify them into nonpurulent (necrotizing infections, cellulitis, and erysipelas) and purulent (furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses) and further on the basis of severity (mild, moderate, and severe). A variety of antimicrobial agents are recommended depending upon the type and severity of infection, and if caused by S. aureus, the methicillin susceptibility of the causative strain. As recently reviewed, oxacillin (or another β-lactamase resistant penicillin such as dicloxacillin or nafcillin) or cefazolin (in case of allergy to penicillin) are usually recommended for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), whereas vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, or ceftaroline are most often specifically recommended when the infection is caused by MRSA. Older agents such as clindamycin, doxycycline/minocycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are also used to treat infections caused by MSSA or MRSA. However, all of these drugs are associated with limitations that include local high level of resistance (clindamycin or doxycycline), high cost and toxicity (linezolid), decreased susceptibility (vancomycin; often requiring higher dosing that results in renal toxicity), and heightened risk of Clostridium difficile infection (eg, clindamycin). Although these drugs still form the mainstay of current treatment strategies, recent approvals of agents including dalbavancin, tedizolid, oritavancin, and delafloxacin have provided additional options for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including those caused by MRSA.

An additional concern is the ability of S. aureus to survive in the acidic environment of the skin. Their survival is dependent on expression of an enzyme that confers resistance to polyamines, anti-inflammatory compounds capable of promoting wound healing and tissue regeneration, which are present in the acidic environment of the skin and are toxic to S. aureus. Moreover, S. aureus can adopt specific modes of life (eg, in biofilms or intracellularly after phagocytosis by permissive cells) that play a role in the development of persistent/recurrent infections, including in skin and skin-associated structures. Thus, there is a need for therapeutic agents that are not only effective against resistant pathogens but also retain or even increase their activity at the acid pH prevailing at the surface of the skin, deep in biofilms, or in phagolysosomes.

### Management of common bacterial infections of the skin [^112kEBGe]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bacterial skin infections commonly encountered in the community include impetigo, folliculitis/furunculosis, simple abscesses, erysipelas and other nonnecrotizing cellulitis. The review focuses on recent epidemiological, bacteriological and therapeutic advances.

Recent Findings

Impetigo and erysipelas occur in about 20 and 1 person/1000/year, respectively. Main risk factors for erysipelas are toe-web intertrigo and lymphedema. The true incidence of furunculosis is unknown, whereas outbreaks in small communities are reported worldwide. Staphylococcus aureus is the predominant pathogen for impetigo and furunculosis, and methicillin-resistant strains play a growing role in both diseases. Erysipelas are mainly caused by streptococci, whereas local complications (i.e. abscesses or blisters) may be due to staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains in involved geographic areas. Recent trends for treating impetigo and furunculosis predate community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus. For outbreaks of furunculosis, stringent decolonization measures are showing promise, whereas there is no validated therapeutic regimen for chronic furunculosis. Current trends for erysipelas involve ambulatory treatments and reduced duration of antibiotics.

Summary

Despite better epidemiological or bacteriological knowledge of common bacterial skin infections, the exact role of methicillin-resistant staphylococci needs regular surveys in involved geographic areas. Antibiotic treatment must be active on staphylococci and, to a lesser degree, on streptococci.

14.4 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the U.S. compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin hydrochloride 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures (incision and drainage or debridement) were performed on 17% of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride treated patients and 14% of the comparator treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin hydrochloride.

14.5 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Two randomized, active controlled trials of cSSSI were performed. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential intravenous/oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 14 days to an intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta­-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. A second open-label International study compared moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 21 days to sequential intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55% of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride treated and 53% of the comparator treated patients in these studies and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication. Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 61% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with complicated erysipelas. These rates were similar to those seen with comparator drugs. The overall success rates in the evaluable patients and the clinical success by pathogen are shown in Tables 14 and 15.

SSTIs may be also classified according to the anatomical tissue layers involved. Superficial infections such as erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles are located at the epidermal and dermal layer, while cellulitis is located in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Deep infections extend below the dermis and may involve the subcutaneous tissue, fascial planes, or muscular compartments presenting as complex abscesses, fasciitis, or myonecrosis.

Complicated SSTIs may also be classified as non-necrotizing or necrotizing infections. Necrotizing infections most commonly involve the muscular fascial layers but may also involve the dermal, subcutaneous, and muscle layers and warrant prompt, aggressive surgical debridement.

In 2014, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft-tissue infections. The guidelines divided infections by purulent and non-purulent, severity (mild, moderate, and severe), and tissue necrosis (necrotizing versus non-necrotizing).

Recently, the US FDA has introduced the new definition of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI) to more closely define complicated soft-tissue infection for the purposes of registration trials. ABSSSIs include cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections, and major cutaneous abscesses. Thus, an ABSSSI is defined as a bacterial infection of the skin with a lesion size area of ≥ 75 cm² (lesion size measured by the area of redness, edema, or induration).

In 2015, the WSES published its guidelines for management of SSTIs proposing a new definition dividing SSTIs in three main groups: surgical site infections (SSIs), non-necrotizing SSTIs, and necrotizing SSTIs. SSIs are classified into two subgroups: incisional and organ and organ/space. The incisional SSIs are further divided into superficial (skin and subcutaneous tissue) and deep (deep soft-tissue muscle and fascia). Organ and organ/space infections are not truly soft-tissue infections. Non-necrotizing SSTIs including erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, simple abscess, and complex abscess may be treated by antibiotics or drainage alone.

### Recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections: identifying risk factors and treatment strategies [^116yNvLU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are common infections in both adults and children, both community and hospital acquired. Their incidence varies according with study population, region and definitions applied, but has been increasing in years. Incidence in paediatric patients raised from 23.2 to 62.7/100 000 person years from 2000 to 2006. For adult patients, incidence has been reported from 49.6 to 77.5/1000 person years.

Due to the wide variety of clinical entities included under the term of SSTIs, different classifications were proposed. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed the definition of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI), which includes cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections and major cutaneous abscesses, in order to better distinguish complicated SSTIs (cSSTIs). The 2014 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines proposed a practical classification based on a clinical evaluation (mild/moderate/severe) and distinction between purulent (furuncles, carbuncles, abscesses) and nonpurulent (cellulitis, erysipelas, fasciitis) infections.

According with SSTIs severity, associated morbidity and mortality rates may vary. The rates of mortality in patients with SSTIs are generally low, except for necrotizing infections where they can reach up to 70%. As for morbidity, recurrent SSTIs (RSSTIs) are an increasing reported complication, with rates ranging from 7% up to 45%, probably favoured by ageing and comorbidity prevalence among population.

Definitions for RSSTIs are not fully identified. As defined for other types of infections, we consider a recurrent episode the presence of signs and symptoms of infection after an initial resolution or improvement and after a full course of antibiotic therapy. This entity represents a challenge for the clinicians, indeed, they imply multiple courses of antibiotic therapy with the risk of selecting for antimicrobial resistance, side effects related to chronic antibiotic exposure (i.e. Clostridioides difficile infection, invasive candidiasis, altered renal and/or liver functions), and prolonged in-hospital stay and/or use of healthcare resources with increased costs.

Our purpose is to summarize the most recent data on RSSTIs risk factors and management.

### Update on treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections [^117G3KFZ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Dermatologists treat a variety of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs) such as folliculitis, impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, furuncles, carbuncles, and non-perirectal abscesses. Most uSSSIs are caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The new extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefpodoxime) offer efficacy against most Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Despite recently published guidelines, many physicians do not prescribe cephalosporins for uSSSIs out of concern that these agents will produce a hypersensitivity reaction in patients allergic to penicillin. Although the rate of cephalosporin reaction in penicillin-allergic patients is often quoted as up to 10%, this rate does not take into account the 1% to 3% risk for allergy to cephalosporin alone and the nonspecific increased risk of penicillin-allergic patients to develop hypersensitivity to other drugs. When these additional risks are considered, the likelihood of a reaction in known penicillin-allergic patients, especially to most third-generation and extended spectrum cephalosporins, becomes less than 1%. Cephalosporins with side chains unlike those of penicillin or ampicillin side chains are less likely to result in an allergic reaction in penicillin or ampicillin-allergic patients than cephalosporins with similar side chains. Although both cefdinir and cefpodoxime are considered to carry a very low risk of cross reactivity with penicillin or ampicillin, the former demonstrates better activity against S. aureus. Among the late-generation cephalosporins, cefdinir is the most potent oral agent when tested against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, 4- to 16-fold more active than cefprozil and cephalexin, respectively.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Erysipelas and cellulitis (hereafter referred to as 'cellulitis') are common bacterial skin infections usually affecting the lower extremities. Despite their burden of morbidity, the evidence for different prevention strategies is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to June 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registry databases, and checked reference lists of included studies and reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched two sets of dermatology conference proceedings, and BIOSIS Previews.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out study selection, data extraction, assessment of risks of bias, and analyses. Our primary prespecified outcome was recurrence of cellulitis when on treatment and after treatment. Our secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalisation, quality of life, development of resistance to antibiotics, adverse reactions and mortality.

Main Results

We included six trials, with a total of 573 evaluable participants, who were aged on average between 50 and 70. There were few previous episodes of cellulitis in those recruited to the trials, ranging between one and four episodes per study. Five of the six included trials assessed prevention with antibiotics in participants with cellulitis of the legs, and one assessed selenium in participants with cellulitis of the arms. Among the studies assessing antibiotics, one study evaluated oral erythromycin (n = 32) and four studies assessed penicillin (n = 481). Treatment duration varied from six to 18 months, and two studies continued to follow up participants after discontinuation of prophylaxis, with a follow-up period of up to one and a half to two years. Four studies were single-centre, and two were multicentre; they were conducted in five countries: the UK, Sweden, Tunisia, Israel, and Austria. Based on five trials, antibiotic prophylaxis (at the end of the treatment phase ('on prophylaxis')) decreased the risk of cellulitis recurrence by 69%, compared to no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.72; n = 513; P = 0.007), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) six, (95% CI 5 to 15), and we rated the certainty of evidence for this outcome as moderate. Under prophylactic treatment and compared to no treatment or placebo, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence rate of cellulitis by 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.89; four studies; n = 473; P value = 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence) and significantly decreased the rate until the next episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.78; three studies; n = 437; P = 0.002; moderate-certainty evidence). The protective effects of antibiotic did not last after prophylaxis had been stopped ('post-prophylaxis') for risk of cellulitis recurrence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.31; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.52), incidence rate of cellulitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.36; two studies; n = 287; P = 0.74), and rate until next episode of cellulitis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.56; two studies; n = 287). Evidence was of low certainty. Effects are relevant mainly for people after at least two episodes of leg cellulitis occurring within a period up to three years. We found no significant differences in adverse effects or hospitalisation between antibiotic and no treatment or placebo; for adverse effects: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.30; four studies; n = 469; P = 0.48; for hospitalisation: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.57; three studies; n = 429; P = 0.47, with certainty of evidence rated low for these outcomes. The existing data did not allow us to fully explore its impact on length of hospital stay. The common adverse reactions were gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and diarrhoea; rash (severe cutaneous adverse reactions were not reported); and thrush. Three studies reported adverse effects that led to discontinuation of the assigned therapy. In one study (erythromycin), three participants reported abdominal pain and nausea, so their treatment was changed to penicillin. In another study, two participants treated with penicillin withdrew from treatment due to diarrhoea or nausea. In one study, around 10% of participants stopped treatment due to pain at the injection site (the active treatment group was given intramuscular injections of benzathine penicillin). None of the included studies assessed the development of antimicrobial resistance or quality-of-life measures. With regard to the risks of bias, two included studies were at low risk of bias and we judged three others as being at high risk of bias, mainly due to lack of blinding.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of recurrence, incidence, and time to next episode, antibiotic is probably an effective preventive treatment for recurrent cellulitis of the lower limbs in those under prophylactic treatment, compared with placebo or no treatment (moderate-certainty evidence). However, these preventive effects of antibiotics appear to diminish after they are discontinued (low-certainty evidence). Treatment with antibiotic does not trigger any serious adverse events, and those associated are minor, such as nausea and rash (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is limited to people with at least two past episodes of leg cellulitis within a time frame of up to three years, and none of the studies investigated other common interventions such as lymphoedema reduction methods or proper skin care. Larger, high-quality studies are warranted, including long-term follow-up and other prophylactic measures.

### Clinical response to antibiotic regimens in lower limb cellulitis: a systematic review [^111DTneb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

There is variation in the treatment of lower limb cellulitis (LLC) with no agreement on the most effective antibiotic regimen. Many patients with cellulitis fail to respond to first-line antibiotics. This can negatively affect patient care and result in unnecessary hospital admissions. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the clinical response and safety of antibiotic regimens for the management of LLC. A systematic review for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted using OVID MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in January 2019. Outcomes of interest included the clinical response to antibiotic regimens (type, dose, route, duration) and the safety of antibiotics in LLC. Trial quality was identified using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Four RCTs were included. All included studies showed no significant differences between the clinical response to different antibiotic type, administration route, treatment duration or dose. LLC may be overtreated and shorter courses of oral antibiotics, possibly with lower doses, may be more suitable. There is a lack of published data on the clinical response and safety of antibiotics in LLC. Three studies were high risk for bias overall. Further high-quality studies may help determine whether less intensive antibiotic regimens can effectively treat LLC.

### Current treatment options for community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection [^112wK17c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

During the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in the United States and elsewhere. The most common such infections are those involving the skin and skin structures. Although a number of these lesions (including small furuncles and abscesses) respond well to surgical incision and drainage, oral antimicrobial agents are commonly used to treat these infections in outpatients. Unfortunately, with the exception of linezolid, none of the agents presently being used in this fashion has been subjected to rigorous clinical trial. Thus, current therapy is based largely on anecdotal evidence. For more-serious infections requiring hospitalization, parenteral antimicrobials such as vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline are presently available and have demonstrated effectiveness in randomized, prospective, double-blind trials.

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the U.S. compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures (incision and drainage or debridement) were performed on 17% of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride treated patients and 14% of the comparator treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

14.5 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Two randomized, active controlled trials of cSSSI were performed. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential intravenous/oral moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 14 days to an intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. A second open-label International study compared moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day for 7 to 21 days to sequential intravenous/oral beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55% of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride treated and 53% of the comparator treated patients in these studies and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication. Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 61% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with complicated erysipelas. These rates were similar to those seen with comparator drugs. The overall success rates in the evaluable patients and the clinical success by pathogen are shown in Tables 14 and 15.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

Study Objective

Test the hypotheses that emergency department (ED) visits for skin and soft tissue infections became more frequent during the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and that antibiotics typically active against community-associated MRSA were chosen increasingly.

Methods

From merged National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data for 1993–2005, we identified ED visits with diagnosis of cellulitis, abscess, felon, impetigo, hidradenitis, folliculitis, infective mastitis, nonpurulent mastitis, breast abscess, or carbuncle and furuncle. Main outcomes were change over time in rate of ED visits with such a diagnosis and proportion of antibiotic regimens including an agent typically active against community-associated MRSA. We report national estimates derived from sample weights. We tested trends with least squares linear regression.

Results

In 1993, infections of interest were diagnosed at 1.2 million visits (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 1.5 million) versus 3.4 million in 2005 (95% CI 2.8 to 4.1 million; P for trend < .001). As a proportion of all ED visits, such infections were diagnosed at 1.35% in 1993 (95% CI 1.07% to 1.64%) versus 2.98% in 2005 (95% CI 2.40% to 3.56%; P for trend < .001). When antibiotics were prescribed at such visits, an antibiotic typically active against community-associated MRSA was chosen rarely from 1993 to 2001 but increasingly thereafter, reaching 38% in 2005 (95% CI 30% to 45%; P for trend < .001). In 2005, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used in 51% of regimens active against community-associated MRSA.

Conclusion

US ED visits for skin and soft tissue infections increased markedly from 1993 to 2005, contemporaneously with the emergence of community-associated MRSA. ED clinicians prescribed more antibiotics typically active against community-associated MRSA, especially trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Possible confounders are discussed, such as increasing diabetes or shifts in locus of care.

Cellulitis is a common condition seen by physicians. Over the past decade, skin and soft tissue infections from community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus have become increasingly common. In this article, the definition, etiology, and clinical features of cellulitis are reviewed, and the importance of differentiating cellulitis from necrotizing soft tissue infections is emphasized. Empiric antimicrobial recommendations are suggested, including the most recent recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America.

Classifications

Various classification systems have been used to describe SSTIs, including variables such as anatomic location, causative pathogen(s), rate of progression, depth of infection, and severity of clinical presentation.

In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified SSTIs into two broad categories for clinical trials evaluating new antimicrobials for their treatment: uncomplicated and complicated. Uncomplicated SSTIs included superficial infections such as cellulitis, simple abscesses, impetigo, and furuncles and required antibiotics or surgical incision to drain abscess alone. In contrast, complicated SSTIs included deep soft-tissue infections such as necrotizing infections, infected ulcers, infected burns, and major abscesses, requiring significant surgical intervention with drainage and debridement.

In 2003, Eron et al. classified SSTIs according to the severity of local and systemic signs and the presence or absence of comorbid conditions in patients presenting in the outpatient setting to guide the clinical management, treatment, and admission decisions. In this classification system, SSTIs were divided in four classes:
Class 1 patients with SSTI, but no signs or symptoms of systemic toxicity or co-morbidities.
Class 2 patients are either systemically unwell with stable co-morbidities or systemically well, but with comorbidity (e.g. diabetes, obesity) that may complicate or delay resolution.
Class 3 patients appear toxic and unwell (fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and/or hypotension).
Class 4 patients have sepsis syndrome and life-threatening infection; for example, necrotizing fasciitis.

SSTIs may be classified according to the anatomical tissue layers involved. Superficial infections such as erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles are located at the epidermal and dermal layers, while cellulitis is located in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Deep infections extend below the subcutaneous tissue may involve fascial planes, or muscular compartments presenting as complex abscesses, fasciitis, or myonecrosis. SSTIs may also be classified as non-necrotizing or necrotizing infections.

In 2014, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft-tissue infections. The guidelines divided infections by purulent and non-purulent, severity (mild, moderate, and severe), and tissue necrosis (necrotizing versus non-necrotizing).

14.5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US compared the efficacy of AVELOX 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures (incision and drainage or debridement) were performed on 17% of the AVELOX treated patients and 14% of the comparator treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for AVELOX and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

14.6 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Two randomized, active controlled trials of cSSSI were performed. A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential IV/PO AVELOX 400 mg QD for 7–14 days to an IV/PO beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 617 patients, 335 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. A second open-label International study compared AVELOX 400 mg QD for 7–21 days to sequential IV/PO beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor control in the treatment of patients with cSSSI. This study enrolled 804 patients, 632 of which were valid for the efficacy analysis. Surgical incision and drainage or debridement was performed on 55% of the AVELOX treated and 53% of the comparator treated patients in these studies and formed an integral part of therapy for this indication. Success rates varied with the type of diagnosis ranging from 61% in patients with infected ulcers to 90% in patients with complicated erysipelas. These rates were similar to those seen with comparator drugs. The overall success rates in the evaluable patients and the clinical success by pathogen are shown in Tables 12 and 13.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111eVYNk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

### Interventions for cellulitis and erysipelas [^114KLBse]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis and erysipelas are now usually considered manifestations of the same condition, a skin infection associated with severe pain and systemic symptoms. A range of antibiotic treatments are suggested in guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for non-surgically-acquired cellulitis.

Search Strategy

In May 2010 we searched for randomised controlled trials in the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ongoing trials databases.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials comparing two or more different interventions for cellulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 25 studies with a total of 2488 participants. Our primary outcome 'symptoms rated by participant or medical practitioner or proportion symptom-free' was commonly reported. No two trials examined the same drugs, therefore we grouped similar types of drugs together. Macrolides/streptogramins were found to be more effective than penicillin antibiotics (Risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97). In 3 trials involving 419 people, 2 of these studies used oral macrolide against intravenous (iv) penicillin demonstrating that oral therapies can be more effective than iv therapies (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98). Three studies with a total of 88 people comparing a penicillin with a cephalosporin showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43). Six trials which included 538 people that compared different generations of cephalosporin, showed no difference in treatment effect (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to1.06). We found only small single studies for duration of antibiotic treatment, intramuscular versus intravenous route, the addition of corticosteroid to antibiotic treatment compared with antibiotic alone, and vibration therapy, so there was insufficient evidence to form conclusions. Only two studies investigated treatments for severe cellulitis and these selected different antibiotics for their comparisons, so we cannot make firm conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We cannot define the best treatment for cellulitis and most recommendations are made on single trials. There is a need for trials to evaluate the efficacy of oral antibiotics against intravenous antibiotics in the community setting as there are service implications for cost and comfort.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^111CRrQw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis plays an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

Objective

We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

Discussion

Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

Conclusions

Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### Treatment of MRSA soft tissue infections: an overview [^111mRWsg]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

MRSA is becoming increasingly common worldwide. With the emergence of new highly spreadable strains (community associated or CA-MRSA) novel presentation skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are being seen. Recurrent SSTI, including folliculitis, furunculosis and abscesses account for an increasing proportion of SSTI seen in the emergency department. Empirical antimicrobial management choices can be difficult, but clues to the nature of the MRSA may be gleaned from the history and clinical presentation. More severe SSTI due to necrotising fasciitis and purpura fulminans are emerging and warrant the broadest possible empirical Gram-positive cover, ideally with antimicrobials that stop exotoxin production, and sometimes intravenous immunoglobulin to neutralise exotoxins already produced.

Principles of treatment

Principles of antibiotic therapy

The principal barrier against microbial invasion is the skin. It constantly interacts with the external environment and is colonized with different populations of bacteria. Intact and well vascularized skin is highly resistant to bacterial invasion.

Most SSTIs involving healthy skin are caused by aerobic Gram-positive cocci, specifically S. aureus, and streptococci. Strains of S. aureus and group A streptococci (GAS) can produce a variety of toxins that may both potentiate their virulence and affect the soft tissues and allow invasion of the dermis. Polymicrobial infections occur when aerobic Gram-negative and anaerobes invade soft tissues.

A retrospective population-based study, analyzed 376,262 individuals experienced 471,550 SSTI episodes, of which 23% were cultured. Among episodes with a culture, 54% had a pathogen identified. S. aureus was by far the most common pathogen, isolated in 81% of pathogen-positive index specimens. Among S. aureus isolates, 46% were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Other important pathogens were beta-hemolytic streptococci and Gram-negative bacteria. SSTIs were associated with older age and diabetes. S. aureus infections were associated with younger age, carbuncle and furuncle. MRSA infections were associated with extreme age (older age and age < 5 years), carbuncle and furuncle, cellulitis and abscess.

Considerable variation in the resistance rates of S. aureus to methicillin (or oxacillin) in patients with SSTIs has been noted between continents, with the highest rates in North America (35.9%), followed by Latin America (29.4%) and Europe (22.8%). Although MRSA has been usually acquired during exposure in hospitals and other healthcare facilities, there has been an increase in MRSA infections presenting in the community (CA-MRSA). CA-MRSA is genetically distinct from hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA), being resistant to fewer non-beta-lactam antibiotics, and often producing a cytotoxin, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). Methicillin resistance, due to altered penicillin binding protein (PBP-2a), is encoded by the mecA gene. Fourteen SCC mec sequence types have been reported. Studies showed that CA-MRSA contain SCC mec types IV and V, mostly with the PVL gene, while HA-MRSA carry SCC mec types I, II and III.

14.4 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

In a controlled double-blind study conducted in the US, moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for ten days) were compared with cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily for ten days) for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The trial included 457 patients valid for the efficacy analysis. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) at the 7 to 21 day post-therapy test of cure visit was 90% for moxifloxacin and 89% for cefuroxime.

An additional non-comparative study was conducted to gather bacteriological data and to evaluate microbiological eradication in adult patients treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days. All patients (n = 336) underwent antral puncture in this study. Clinical success rates and eradication/presumed eradication rates at the 21 to 37 day follow-up visit were 97% (29 out of 30) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 83% (15 out of 18) for Moraxella catarrhalis, and 80% (24 out of 30) for Haemophilus influenzae.

14.5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US compared the efficacy of moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days with cephalexin HCl 500 mg three times daily for seven days. The percentage of patients treated for uncomplicated abscesses was 30%, furuncles 8%, cellulitis 16%, impetigo 20%, and other skin infections 26%. Adjunctive procedures (incision and drainage or debridement) were performed on 17% of the moxifloxacin-treated patients and 14% of the comparator treated patients. Clinical success rates in evaluable patients were 89% (108/122) for moxifloxacin and 91% (110/121) for cephalexin HCl.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^117TCaKG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What antibiotics are recommended for empiric treatment of clinically suspected necrotizing infections?

Antibiotic treatment of necrotizing infections should be prompt and aggressive (recommendation 1B).

The initial empirical antibiotic regimen should comprise broad-spectrum drugs including anti-MRSA and anti-Gram-negative coverage (recommendation 1C).

Vancomycin treatment should be avoided in patients with renal impairment and when MRSA isolate shows a MIC for vancomycin ≥ 1.5 mg/mL (recommendation 1B).

Daptomycin or linezolid are drugs of choice for empirical anti-MRSA coverage. Alternatively, ceftaroline, telavancin, tedizolid, and dalbavacin can be used (recommendation 2C).

The choice of anti-Gram-negative treatment should be based on local prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacateriaceae and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) non-fermenters (recommendation 1B).

De-escalation of antibiotic therapy should be based on clinical improvement, cultured pathogens, and results of rapid diagnostic tests where available (recommendation 1C).

Microbiologically, NSTIs have been classified as either type 1 (polymicrobial) or type 2 (mono-microbial) or type 3 (gas gangrene). Occasionally in immunocompromised patients, NSTIs may be also caused by mycotic species.

NSTIs type I is a polymicrobial infection involving aerobic and anaerobic organisms. It is usually seen in the elderly or in those with underlying illnesses. Type I infection is often associated with gas in the tissue and thus is difficult to distinguish from gas gangrene. Non-clostridial anaerobic cellulitis and synergistic necrotizing cellulitis are type I variants. Both occur in patients with diabetes and typically involve the feet, with rapid extension into the leg.

Future directions — In nonpurulent cellulitis, the clinical isolation rate of a pathogen is < 20%, leaving an unconfirmed diagnosis 80% of the time; accordingly, this panel supports continued research into the rapid diagnosis of causes of cellulitis specifically, but SSTIs in general. Resistance patterns are evolving, as resistance of S. aureus to methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and SMX-TMP has dramatically increased, with resistance of streptococci to erythromycin and clindamycin also reported.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1113ge9o]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that people with experience of having cellulitis held diverse beliefs about causation, some of which would not have been uncovered by survey methods alone as they had not previously arisen in the literature, such as the view that cellulitis could be caused by 'unhygienic' environments. Interviewees expressed surprise that they had not been informed of the risk of recurrent cellulitis or potential strategies to prevent recurrence, and only 31% of survey respondents said they were aware of possible strategies to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis. Quantitative and qualitative findings suggest a general willingness to adopt nonantibiotic cellulitis prevention interventions, with a preference for enhanced foot hygiene/care and lifestyle changes over other interventions, as they are perceived as familiar and easy to fit into established routines. There were more mixed views about compression and long‐term oral antibiotics.

In the recent James Lind Alliance PSP on cellulitis, one of the research priorities identified related to which patients are most likely to benefit from low‐dose antibiotics to prevent recurrent cellulitis. 12 Our data would suggest that people who have had only a single episode of cellulitis are less likely to be willing to take long‐term, low‐dose antibiotics than those who have experienced multiple episodes. This is despite randomized controlled trial (RCT) findings suggesting that patients may benefit from 6 months of low‐dose antibiotic prophylaxis following their first episode in order to prevent future recurrence in the longer term. 19

Concerns about 'developing immunity' to antibiotics and the reduced efficacy of antibiotics in treating infections as a result were prevalent in the qualitative data. This reflects a widespread misconception of antibiotic resistance as a property of the human body rather than bacterial cells (i.e. belief that it is the human becoming immune to antibiotics rather than the bacteria becoming resistant). 20, 21

Most community-acquired infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused by S aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Until recently, infections due to such organisms in the United States could safely be treated with an oral antistaphylococcal penicillin or an oral first-generation cephalosporin. However, the emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci as community-acquired pathogens has changed the picture as far as empirical therapy is concerned. Not only do community-acquired MRSA bacteria cause furunculitis and cellulitis, they have also been involved in a variety of more serious and life-threatening infections. Most of these organisms are susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, minocycline, doxycycline, and rifampin, and these agents, along with clindamycin, have been used in the therapy of such infections, even though no clinical trials have proven their efficacy. For more serious, life-threatening infections, linezolid or parenteral agents such as vancomycin or daptomycin should be considered.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cultures and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent; Figure 1), systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients as defined in question 13 (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem/meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infections (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high).

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^1148wif9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for < 1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥ 1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3–74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; p = 0.66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

### Prioritizing emergency department antibiotic stewardship interventions for skin and soft tissue infections using judgment analysis [^114m6Qxr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing often results from diagnostic uncertainty or error. This gap in care quality has been identified as a primary, modifiable contributor to the global increase in antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. In the U.S. alone, 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur each year with 35,000 associated deaths. Thus, there have been multiple "calls to action" related to antibiotic stewardship, including those highlighting the emergency department (ED). –

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) account for approximately two percent of all ED encounters (~3 million annual visits) and available reports indicate frequent suboptimal antibiotic prescribing in this setting. – Specifically, cellulitis is overdiagnosed in 30% of cases in which patients with noninfectious mimics, termed pseudocellulitis, are prescribed antibiotics. Among cases of accurately diagnosed cellulitis, providers often use two antibiotics despite randomized controlled trials demonstrating this does not improve clinical outcomes. – Additionally, uncomplicated abscesses are often treated with one or more antibiotics despite high cure rates being observed with incision and drainage alone across two large RCTs (number needed to treat (NNT) for antibiotics to prevent treatment failure = 14–26). –

Our previous qualitative work characterized drivers of antibiotic decision-making for SSTIs among emergency medicine (EM) physicians which were then mapped to potential interventions. Intervention mapping is a systematic framework used for the development, implementation, and evaluation of clinical interventions through incorporation of evidence-based practices and the social and cognitive determinants of clinical decision-making. As there are limited resources to implement stewardship-focused interventions in the ED, we sought to conduct an experiment to quantitatively assess the potential impact of the developed interventions. In order to capture changes in antibiotic prescribing decisions for SSTIs based on these interventions, we utilized case vignettes that presented brief clinical scenarios with various combinations of the proposed interventions and asked EM physicians if they would treat with antibiotics. Case vignettes have historically been used to study clinical decision-making due to their flexibility in manipulating multiple clinical factors while being cost-effective and overcoming ethical limitations of experimental research with real patients.

There is a clear need to evaluate and prioritize interventions that can optimize antibiotic use in the management of skin and soft tissue conditions evaluated in the ED. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a set of interventions in minimizing inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for presumed SSTIs in the ED using a case vignette survey design to simulate the decision-making process.

### Dilemmas when managing cellulitis [^117NfS13]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is commonly seen in primary care. It is also a common reason for hospital admission accounting, for example, for around 3% of emergency medical consultations at one UK district general hospital. Here, we review the management of cellulitis, and try to resolve some common dilemmas: whether a patient with cellulitis should be treated in hospital; which antibacterial to use; whether it should be given orally or parenterally; and whether patients with recurrent cellulitis should take prophylactic antibacterials.

### Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^114p6CKk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged over the last decade across the United States and the world, becoming a major pathogen in many types of community-acquired infections. Although most commonly associated with minor skin and soft tissue infections, such as furuncles, CA-MRSA also can cause necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, osteoarticular infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. This article discusses the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of these infections from the perspective of the emergency physician.

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^1166SdXy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute, painful and potentially serious bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can have a substantial impact on patients. Pain, feeling very unwell and the need for elevation of the affected limb can result in reduced quality of life and substantial periods of work absence among people with cellulitis. 1 Cellulitis also places a considerable burden on the National Health Service (NHS). Between 2015 and 2016, 123 644 patients were admitted to hospitals in England for cellulitis. 2 While even a single episode of cellulitis can have a substantial impact on quality of life, approximately one‐third of people with cellulitis suffer recurrent episodes. 3, 4 Risk factors for the recurrence of cellulitis include previous episode(s) of cellulitis; lymphoedema; obesity; diabetes and skin disorders producing breaks in the skin (e.g. fungal foot disease, dry skin or insect bites).

The only treatment shown to reduce the risk of recurrence is long‐term, low‐dose antibiotics. 5 This strategy has not been widely implemented, possibly because of growing pressure to reduce antibiotic prescribing amidst fears of antibiotic resistance and possible side‐effects. The risk of further episodes may also be reduced by use of emollients for prevention of dry, cracked skin, checking for and treating tinea pedis, and managing lymphoedema using compression garments. 6

There has been little research into the role of skin care in the prevention of cellulitis, but a role for dry skin has been hypothesized and regular application of emollient has been shown to reduce dryness. 7 Previous research also suggests that there is a high rate of fungal foot disease in patients with recurrent cellulitis as skin breaks caused by fungal infection provide a 'portal of entry' for bacteria. 8, 9 Although fungal foot infection is common, many patients undertreat this as it can be asymptomatic, 10, 11 so it is possible that more active treatment of fungal foot disease may prevent recurrent cellulitis. In a recent James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) for cellulitis, patients and health professionals identified the need to determine the best nonantibiotic intervention for the prevention of cellulitis (e.g. skin care; foot care; moisturizers; antiseptics; lifestyle changes, such as weight loss and exercise; compression garments/bandages; treating athlete's foot; complementary and alternative therapy) as a priority area for future research. 12

### Risk factors for treatment failure in neonates with skin and soft tissue infection: a retrospective cohort study [^1171GTgs]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

We aimed to describe the frequency of treatment failure and associated risk factors for treatment failure amongst neonates with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of neonates 0 to 28 days old with uncomplicated SSTIs presenting to the emergency department of a quaternary care children's hospital from 2009 to 2017. Data were collected via chart review. Skin and soft tissue infections included the following: cellulitis, abscess, mastitis, perirectal SSTI, carbuncle, and furuncle. Of the 202 neonates in the study, most were term, afebrile with mastitis, or perirectal SSTI. Treatment failure occurred in 8% (17/202) of neonates receiving oral antibiotics; 10 of these neonates had perirectal SSTIs and 2 had clindamycin and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Neonates with treatment failure had increased odds of having perirectal SSTIs (odds ratio [OR] = 4.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.46–11.31). Further studies are needed to identify strategies to prevent treatment failure in neonates with perirectal SSTIs.

### Skin and soft tissue infections [^117XRnu9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Primary skin infections (ie, pyodermas) typically are initiated by some breach in the epidermis, resulting in infection by organisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, that normally colonize the skin. Host-associated factors, such as immunosuppression, vasculopathy, neuropathy, or decreased lymphatic drainage, may predispose to skin infection. The clinical syndromes associated with skin infections are often characteristic and are defined most simplistically by anatomic distribution. Although often mild and self-limited, skin infections can be more aggressive and involve deeper structures, including fascia and muscle. This article discusses skin and soft tissue infections, including impetigo, hair follicle-associated infections (ie, folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles) erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, septic bursitis, and tenosynovitis.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage — empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116VEGCz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^113nuWec]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Necrotizing SSTIs (cellulitis, fasciitis, myositis, Fournier's gangrene) require surgical intervention including drainage and debridement of necrotic tissue in addition to antibiotic therapy.

Several authors and organizations have proposed classification schemes for SSTIs based on such variables as anatomic location, rate of progression, depth of extension, and clinical presentation or severity. Each has key limitations both in assisting clinical management and in providing guidance for developing new therapeutic agents.

The consensus concluded that the necrotizing or non-necrotizing character of the infection, the anatomical extension, the characteristics of the infection (purulent or non-purulent), and the clinical conditions of the patient should be always assessed independently to classify patients with soft-tissue infections.

### Predictors of failure of empiric outpatient antibiotic therapy in emergency department patients with uncomplicated cellulitis [^1175UPek]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous (IV) therapy at first presentation of cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

Objectives

The objective was to determine risk factors associated with adult patients presenting to the ED with cellulitis who fail initial antibiotic therapy as outpatients and require a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study of patients 18 years of age or older presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 140,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis before presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to the hospital, or if they had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital).

Results

A total of 598 patients were enrolled, 52 were excluded, and 49 were lost to follow-up. The mean (± standard deviation [SD]) age was 53.1 (± 18.4) years and 56.4% were male. A total of 185 patients (37.2%) were given oral antibiotics, 231 (46.5%) were given IV antibiotics, and 81 patients (16.3%) received both oral and IV antibiotics in the ED. A total of 102 (20.5%, 95% confidence [CI] = 17.2% to 24.2%) patients had treatment failures. Fever (temperature > 38°C) at triage (odds ratio [OR] = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.6 to 11.7), chronic leg ulcers (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.2), chronic edema or lymphedema (OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.5 to 4.2), prior cellulitis in the same area (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.3 to 3.5), and cellulitis at a wound site (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.0) were independently associated with treatment failure.

Conclusions

These risk factors should be considered when initiating empiric antibiotic therapy for ED patients with cellulitis amenable to outpatient treatment.

Periocular inflammation — preseptal and orbital cellulitis require antibiotics that cover Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species, with consideration for anaerobic coverage; treatment of both preseptal and orbital cellulitis should begin with amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg) orally, 2 times daily for 10 d, with oral fluoroquinolones (such as moxifloxacin) as a substitute if not available; if infection is isolated to the preseptal space, evacuation can be nonemergent, but if there is any question of orbital involvement or lack of response, we recommend emergent evacuation, as orbital cellulitis is a true medical emergency and failure to treat quickly can lead to blindness, intracranial infection, and possibly death. Antibiotics: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Emergent evacuation for orbital cellulitis: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Nonemergent evacuation for periorbital cellulitis: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Table 2.
Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

Cellulitis in nondiabetic adults — adjunct anti-inflammatory therapy: Systemic corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 40 mg daily for 7 days) could be considered in nondiabetic adult patients with cellulitis (weak, moderate). Treating the inflammation by combining antimicrobial therapy with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ibuprofen 400 mg 4 times daily (qid) for 5 days) or systemic corticosteroids significantly hastens clinical improvement compared with antimicrobial therapy alone; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 108 adult nondiabetic patients, an 8-day course of oral corticosteroids with antimicrobial therapy led to a significantly more rapid clinical resolution of cellulitis, and long-term follow-up showed no difference in relapse or recurrence.

### Moderate to severe soft tissue diabetic foot infections: a randomized, controlled, pilot trial of post-debridement antibiotic treatment for 10 versus 20 days [^117CGQ5R]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Virtually all infections of the foot in persons with diabetes involve the soft tissues. These soft tissue diabetic foot infections (ST-DFI) usually begin with superficial invasion of an ulcer or wound, but may progress contiguously to cellulitis, phlegmon, abscess, fasciitis, or osteomyelitis. – The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, which is considerably shorter than for diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), is largely based on clinical experience. While there are some data concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy of non-amputated DFO, few studies have investigated the optimal duration for ST-DFI not accompanied by DFO. Many experts in the field recommend administering systemic antibiotic therapy for 1 to 3 weeks, with appropriate tissue debridement as needed. – The most recent recommendations of the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot; state 1–2 weeks is adequate for most ST-DFIs. The recommendations of the 2012 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) are for 2–3 for moderate to severe ST-DFI (point 24 of recommendations), but urge decisions be based on the individual clinical response of therapy. Various reviews report antibiotic regimens for ST-DFI of relatively short (7–14 days)or relatively long durations (14–28 days). The results of our own retrospective study of 463 ST-DFIs did not define an optimal duration antibiotic therapy for ST-DFIs, but suggested that our current practice (median of 18 days for ST-DFI) might be too long. In that retrospective study, we failed to determine any minimal threshold for systemic antibiotics in ST-DFIs. The median duration of antimicrobial administration of 18 days statistically yielded to be too long regarding remission, because treatment durations as short as 7–10 days seemed to be enough, whenever the clinical evolution was favorable. Another study of patients with various types of cellulitis found that clinical remission rates were similar for those treated with 7 days of systemic antibiotic therapy compared to those who received longer treatment durations.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^114TVReZ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy of up to 21 days for VAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was used historically until several prospective studies demonstrated the effectiveness of shorter (7–8 days) therapy with no differences in mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation-free days or organ failure-free days. The 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines and the 2016 IDSA guidelines both recommend 7 days of therapy for HAP/VAP. Ongoing studies are determining if therapy duration could be reduced further.

Bacteremia caused by Enterobacterales has been treated traditionally with 2 weeks of antibiotics. Recent RCTs and meta-analyses investigating shorter (7–8 days) versus longer antibiotic courses (14–15 days) in patients with gram-negative bacteremia (mostly of urinary tract origin) demonstrate non-inferiority. Regarding acute uncomplicated cellulitis, evidence also suggests that prolonged courses may be unnecessary and that 5 days of treatment may be sufficient. IDSA guidelines recommend a 5-day antibiotic therapy duration for uncomplicated cellulitis, but may be extended if the infection has not improved within that time frame.

Generally, in critically ill patients, decisions about antibiotic therapy duration should be individualized, taking into account patient parameters such as severity of illness, the site and type of infection, whether source control has been achieved, whether PK has been optimized, and clinical response. Procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide antibiotic therapy in the ICU. PCT-guided treatment can reduce the duration of therapy and length of hospital stay in adult critically ill patients with sepsis. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest using PCT along with a clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antibiotics in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if PCT is available.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114qTzei]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis and erysipelas (evidence summary) — microbiology and diagnostic yields — are described as diffuse, superficial, spreading skin infections and are not the correct term when pus collections are present; culture-based diagnosis often has low yield and streptococci predominate while Staphylococcus aureus is less frequent. Blood cultures are generally positive in < 5% of cases, cultures of needle aspirations yield 5% to approximately 40%, and punch biopsy cultures yield an organism in 20%–30% of cases with the concentration of bacteria in the tissues usually quite low; combined culture, serology, and tissue methods suggest the vast majority arise from streptococci (often group A but also B, C, F, or G), and Staphylococcus aureus cases are typically linked to an open wound or previous penetrating trauma including bites or illicit drug injection; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an unusual cause of typical cellulitis.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^1152eBNE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Executive summary

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions involving the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue, fascia, or muscle and ranging from simple superficial infections to severe necrotizing infections that may involve the dermal, subcutaneous, fascia, and muscle layers.

SSTIs may affect any part of the body, although the lower extremities, the perineum, and the abdominal wall are the most common sites of involvement. SSTIs are a relatively infrequent clinical problem; however, surgeons are often called upon for their management.

These guidelines focus mainly on necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). The mortality resulting from NSTIs appears to have decreased over the past decade, possibly due to improved recognition and earlier delivery of more effective therapy.

Successful management of NSTIs involves prompt recognition, timely surgical debridement or drainage, aggressive resuscitation and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

A worldwide international panel of experts developed evidenced-based guidelines for management of soft tissue infections. The guidelines outline clinical recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy criteria summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Grading of recommendations from Guyatt and colleagues

Surgical site infections

1) Surgical site infections require prompt and wide opening of the surgical incision. Antimicrobial therapy is recommended for deep incisional surgical site infections if systemic signs of sepsis are present, if source control is incomplete or in immunocompromised patients (Recommendation 1 C).

2) In patients who have had clean operations, antimicrobial therapy should cover gram-positive organisms; in contrast, in patients who have had procedures on the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract antimicrobial therapy should cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (Recommendation 1 C).

Non necrotizing superficial soft tissue infections

3) Erysipelas, and cellulitis are managed by antimicrobial therapy against Gram-positive bacteria (Recommendation 1 C).

4) Lack of clinical response for cellulitis may be due to resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes, such as necrotizing fasciitis or myonecrosis (Recommendation 1 C).

5) Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours (Recommendation 1 C).

6) If a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is suspected, an antiribosomal agent such as clindamycin or linezolid can be used to reduce exotoxin and superantigen production (Recommendation 1 C).

### Patients' understanding of cellulitis and views about how best to prevent recurrent episodes: mixed-methods study in primary and secondary care [^111WuyAf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Some participants spoke about keeping precautionary antibiotics at home that had been prescribed by their GP for immediate use if their cellulitis recurred, which seemed to reduce their anxiety about recurrence.

So when I've got it – it just – it's debilitating, it just knocks you out and you can't do anything and so the best thing is to see a doctor and get an immediate course of antibiotics. So the good thing [is], this last time I saw my GP, I got an emergency pack of antibiotics, flucloxacillin, that I can take in case I get it. So thinking about it happening again fills me with dread almost, but the good thing is I've got this back‐up emergency course of antibiotics that I can take if it happens again

For some participants, the uncertainty around what caused their cellulitis seemed to have created uncertainty about prevention of recurrence. Some participants who had only experienced one episode of cellulitis felt that it was difficult to know how to prevent it from coming back as they were not certain what had caused their first episode of cellulitis.

And I must admit, I didn't know that it was cellulitis till it was all written down; I thought I'd just got Strep A because of – I mean I suppose you won't know, can cellulitis alone do that to you? I mean, it nearly killed me. I'm very lucky to be alive and I certainly don't want it again, but I don't know what to do not to get it again. And no one does, and no one knows how I got it

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal cellulitis… [^112aNEXQ]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Treatment Never delay the initiation of treatment while waiting for culture results. Use culture results, when available, to tailor antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep. Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics and consider intravenous antibiotics for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Oral antibiotics Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there hasn't been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:

- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis. Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.

Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

### About cellulitis | Group A strep… [^112oHYsD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Cellulitis is a common bacterial infection of the deeper layers of the skin.
- It causes redness, swelling, and pain in the infected area.
- If untreated, cellulitis can spread and cause serious health problems.
- Healthcare providers diagnose cellulitis by how it looks and treat it with antibiotics.
- Speak to a healthcare provider if you have concerns about cellulitis. What it is Different bacteria can cause cellulitis, which is an infection of the deeper layers of the skin. This page focuses on one of the most common causes of cellulitis: group A Streptococcus. When to seek immediate medical attention spreads quicklyor you develop a fever or chills.

Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections:

- Bacteremia
- Endocarditis
- Osteomyelitis
- Suppurative arthritis Cellulitis can cause thrombophlebitis. Risk factors Anyone can get cellulitis, but some factors can increase the risk of getting this infection. Infections or injuries that break skin The following risk factors allow bacteria to get through the skin:

- Chickenpox and shingles
- Chronic skin conditions
- Injection drug use
- Injuries that break the skin Injuries that break the skin can include cuts, ulcers, bites, puncture wounds, tattoos, and piercings. For many people who get cellulitis, experts don't know how the bacteria get into the body.

Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers typically diagnose cellulitis by looking at the affected skin during a physical examination. Blood or other lab tests aren't usually needed. Treatment and recovery Healthcare providers treat cellulitis with antibiotics. They can be oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Healthcare providers use oral antibiotics to treat most cellulitis infections. IV antibiotics can be used to treat more serious infections. Keeping the affected limb elevated can help decrease swelling and speed up recovery.

### Antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas… [^112JMiZb]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the most appropriate antibiotic choice, route of administration, and duration of treatment for cellulitis. Findings In this systematic review of 43 studies that included 5999 participants, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another and the use of intravenous over oral antibiotics; short treatment courses appear to be as effective as longer treatment courses. Overall, no evidence was found to support the superiority of any 1 antibiotic over another, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus did not add an advantage. Use of intravenous antibiotics over oral antibiotics and treatment duration of longer than 5 days were not supported by evidence. Conclusions and Relevance. We included studies of adults or children with a cellulitis diagnosis that randomized participants to groups. We used the term cellulitis to include erysipelas, as the 2 conditions cannot be readily distinguished.

The focus of this review was cellulitis requiring acute therapy with antibiotics rather than prophylaxis. We considered a randomized clinical trial if a comparison was made between different treatment regimens, including different antibiotics, routes of administration, and duration of therapy. We found 5 trials that compared vancomycin alone with other antibiotics: daptomycin, 40, 41 ceftobiprole, 42 a new pleuromutilin, 43 and linezolid. 44 We found no evidence of a difference between the 2 treatments. One study52 examined the addition of benzylpenicillin to the regimen of those who receive flucloxacillin. No statistically significant effect on symptoms was found. No adverse effects were reported in either arm of the study.

The 2 studies by Daniel15 compared 5 days of azithromycin with 7 days of either cloxacillin or erythromycin. One study57 compared 5 days of oral levofloxacin with a 10-day regimen. Another study45 compared 6 days of tedizolid with 10 days of linezolid.
