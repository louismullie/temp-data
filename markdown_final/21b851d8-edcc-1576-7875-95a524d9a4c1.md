## Question

A carnival snack booth made $50 selling popcorn each day. It made three times as much selling cotton candy. For a 5-day activity, the booth has to pay $30 rent and $75 for the cost of the ingredients. How much did the booth earn for 5 days after paying the rent and the cost of ingredients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much a carnival snack booth earned over 5 days after paying rent and ingredient costs, given daily popcorn revenue and that cotton candy revenue is three times popcorn revenue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the daily revenue from popcorn and cotton candy. Then, I should calculate total daily revenue. Next, I will multiply by 5 days to get gross revenue. After that, I need to subtract fixed costs (rent and ingredients) to find net earnings. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly.

> Let me first confirm the daily popcorn revenue and the relationship to cotton candy revenue. The booth makes $50 per day from popcorn, and cotton candy brings in three times that amount, so cotton candy revenue is 3 × $50 = $150 per day. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 3 × 50 is indeed 150, so cotton candy revenue is $150 per day.

> Next, I should calculate total daily revenue. Total daily revenue equals popcorn revenue plus cotton candy revenue, which is $50 + $150 = $200 per day. Hold on, I should verify the addition: 50 + 150 is 200, so total daily revenue is $200.

> Now, I will compute gross revenue over 5 days. Gross revenue for 5 days is $200 per day × 5 days = $1,000. I need to ensure the multiplication is correct: 200 × 5 equals 1,000, so gross revenue is $1,000.

> I need to account for fixed costs. Rent is $30 and ingredients cost $75, so total fixed costs are $30 + $75 = $105. Let me double-check the addition: 30 + 75 is 105, so total costs are $105.

> Finally, I will calculate net earnings. Net earnings equal gross revenue minus total costs, so $1,000 − $105 = $895. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the subtraction might yield $905, but that would be incorrect; 1,000 − 105 is 895, not 905. I should correct that and confirm the final answer is $895.

> The booth earned $895 for the 5 days after paying rent and the cost of ingredients.

---

The booth's total earnings for 5 days are **$895**. Here's how: popcorn brings in $50/day, so cotton candy brings in $150/day, for a total of $200/day. Over 5 days, gross revenue is $1,000. Subtract $30 for rent and $75 for ingredients, and the net profit is **$895**.

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Step** | **Description** | **Calculation** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Daily popcorn revenue | Given | $50 |
| 2 | Daily cotton candy revenue | 3 × $50 | $150 |
| 3 | Total daily revenue | $50 + $150 | $200 |
| 4 | Total revenue for 5 days | $200 × 5 | $1,000 |
| 5 | Total expenses (rent + ingredients) | $30 + $75 | $105 |
| 6 | Net profit | $1,000 − $105 | $895 |

---

The booth's net profit after 5 days is **$895**.

School meal reimbursement and costs — Higher quality school meals engender substantial costs; despite an additional $0.06 per meal allocated by the 2010 Child Nutrition Reauthorization, reimbursement for food service over the past 20 years has never kept pace with rising expenses or inflation; the National School Boards Association cited that, even by the USDA's conservative estimates, the recent reimbursement rates (2010) will cover less than one-half the costs of implementing the new nutrition standards over the next 5 years; if prices of nonreimbursed meals increase, more children may bring meals from home, purchase food from other sources, or skip meals altogether, each of which will be detrimental to achieving better diet quality; additional federal and state budget cuts in the near-term threaten many aspects of child nutrition strategy and are an important point of advocacy for the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

Outcome measures

The effects were measured on three dependent variables. First, the primary outcome measure was the proportion of budget spent on vegetables, relative to the "total spending" of each participant every 2 weeks, since the use of vegetables could be directly linked to the use of the recipes. Under vegetables, we considered fresh, frozen, and canned vegetables. Second, there were two secondary outcome measures: (1) the proportion of budget spent on prepackaged meals and (2) the proportion of budget spent on sweet and salty snacks, relative to the "total spending" of each participant every 2 weeks. Under prepackaged meals, we considered ready-to-(h)eat meals such as pizzas, prepared meals, and salads, and under sweet and salty snacks we considered cookies, chips, cakes, etc. In calculating these measurements, we always used the unit price, without the discounts of the intervention, in order to estimate changes in volume before and after enrollment. The proportion of budget spent on these outcome variables was used, because we had information on the price of the products, but not on the exact weights or pieces of the products.

Items sold in competition to school meals: new national standards — Competitive foods sold in vending machines and a la carte lines represent a far less nutritious option than the USDA-sponsored school meals; until 2010, federal law restricted the sale of carbonated drinks, candies, and other "foods of minimal nutritional value" only in the cafeteria during meal service hours, leaving many nutrient-poor products available for sale with lax oversight; access to "empty calories" has been associated with higher daily energy intake and greater BMI and with displacement of more nutrient-rich alternatives; many schools that have taken steps to improve the nutritional quality of competitive foods have not reported subsequent losses in total revenue and in some cases have even increased revenue and school meal participation; in 2004, the AAP published a policy statement ("Soft Drinks in Schools"), and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation published "School Beverage Guidelines" in 2007; a report from the alliance issued in 2010 cited an 88% decrease in total calories shipped to schools, a 95% reduction in the grams of added sugars shipped to schools, and a 65% decline in shipments of full-calorie soft drinks.

Purchasing

There were 11 purchasing studies in real‐world settings.

Bergen 2006 assessed the impact of labelling on drinks purchased from vending machines by measuring the mean number of low‐energy soft drinks sold weekly over a nine‐week period (two‐week baseline period, five‐week intervention period, and two‐week postintervention period).

Balasubramanian 2002 assessed the impact of labelling on 'light' entrées and juices purchased from a grocery store by measuring sales transactions (i.e. the percentage of labelled products bought relative to other products bought) each week over a seven‐year period.

Nine studies assessed the impact of labelling on food or drinks purchased in restaurants, cafeterias or coffee shops. Studies measured the outcome using the mean energy content of items purchased at each meal over a period of time (2 weeks: Ellison 2013; 4 weeks: VanEpps 2016; 41 days: Chu 2009; 2 months: Holmes 2013; 19 weeks: Ellison 2014a), mean weekly energy sales of 45 labelled food items for 12 weeks (Cioffi 2015), the proportion of high‐calorie purchases over a six‐week period (as a percentage of total drinks or snacks sold) (Allan 2015); mean energy of food and drinks bought per sales transaction over 14 months (Bollinger 2011), or the probability of purchasing low‐energy items from three different food categories (vegetables, salads, entrées) during an 18‐week period (Dubbert 1984).

Consumption

Seventeen studies assessed the impact of labelling on food or drink consumed in artificial or laboratory settings. In 14 of these studies, the outcome was mean energy consumed during a snack, a single meal, or across multiple meals (Crockett 2014; Ebneter 2013; Girz 2012 ‐ study 1; Girz 2012 ‐ study 2; Girz ongoing; Hammond 2013; Harnack 2008a; James 2015; Kral 2002; Platkin 2014; Roberto 2010; Temple 2010; Wansink 2006 ‐ study 1; Wansink 2006 ‐ study 3). Of the three remaining studies, two measured mean grams of food consumed (Cavanagh 2014; Roberto 2012), and one measured mean volume of a drink consumed (Vermeer 2011).

Further details of each study are reported in the table of Characteristics of included studies.

### Comparison of sales from vending machines with 4 different food and beverage messages: a randomized trial [^115akPc8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What was the relative effectiveness of 4 food and beverage messages on vending machine sales and calories purchased?

Findings

In this randomized trial of 267 vending machines, machines labeled with physical activity calorie equivalents or traffic lights had significantly lower sales of unhealthy beverages (34% and 30%, respectively) compared with machines with beverage tax posters. Traffic lights compared with physical activity labels significantly decreased total calories purchased among 1065 customers (147 vs 178 kcal).

Meaning

Traffic light and physical activity calorie equivalent labels encouraged healthier beverage, but not snack, purchases compared with a poster about a beverage tax.

### Measuring diet cost at the individual level: a comparison of three methods [^111V9zRB]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Method 1: diet diaries and food expenditures

All foods and beverages reported in each participant's coded 4-day diet diary were linked to corresponding items in the participant's receipts, collected during weeks 1–4 of the study. To compute the expenditure for each food portion of food or beverage consumed, the gram weight consumed was multiplied by the ratio of the purchase price over total grams purchased, correcting for edible portion (EP):

For example, the expenditure associated with a 1 cup portion (109 g) of fresh apple that was purchased for $1.49/pound (454 g) was 109 g × $1.99/(454 g × 0.90) = $0.531. Overall, approximately 80% of all foods and beverages consumed were accounted for in the participants' receipts. For missing receipt data, expenditures were imputed using food prices collected by study staff. The posted price was recorded for the product and matched for details provided by the participant. The key details were product brand, type, package size and the retail outlet from which it was purchased. When product or retail outlet information was not available, the closest match was identified from among three major supermarket chains (described below) and the lowest price was recorded. Expenditures were calculated for each day and were averaged over the 4 days.

Method 2: diet diaries and supermarket prices

Each item in the coded 4-day diet diary was matched with one of the foods in the database of supermarket prices for 384 foods and beverages in 152 categories. The database has been described before and contains lowest, non-sale prices collected from three major supermarket chains in the region as described previously. In brief, prices were collected from May to July 2006 from Safeway, Albertson's and Quality Food Centers (a subsidiary of Kroger), which were selected because of their large market share in the region. Prices were obtained during in-store visits and from supermarket home shopping websites (Safeway and Albertson's), which reported to list the same prices as those available to in-store customers. When no exact match from the 384 products was available, the closest match from among the broader food categories was used. As in Method 1, daily totals were computed and 4-day means were derived.

### Comparison of sales from vending machines with 4 different food and beverage messages: a randomized trial [^111i522D]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This 13-month randomized trial of 267 vending machines demonstrated that traffic light and physical activity calorie equivalent labels encouraged healthier beverage, but not snack, purchases compared with a beverage tax poster by leading customers to buy nothing or choose a healthier alternative. Corporations and governments should consider such labeling approaches to promote healthier beverage choices.

### Health economic evaluation of a nurse-led care model from the nursing home perspective focusing on residents' hospitalisations [^114MVNzg]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

According to our calculation, between 2017–2020 all NHs showed increases in total daily losses per hospitalised resident. The reasons included the increasing daily revenues from nursing services, which are lost during hospitalisations. For most, daily hotel service losses per resident remained unchanged. The only two exceptions involved changes to the NHs' fee schedules. Fixed revenues differed widely depending on the NHs' different approaches described below.

During the residents' hospitalisation, the reimbursements that the NHs normally receives for nursing services from the health insurance and the Canton are lost. But what happens with the revenue from the resident's share of nursing services and hotel services differed between NHs and years. We observed three different regimes in our sample:
The resident's share of nursing services and the whole hotel services' revenue was lost, but a reservation fee from the resident was levied.
Revenue from the resident's share of nursing services was lost, but hotel services' revenue lasted (fixed costs). A resident was receiving "customer credit" or "fee reduction" for not using hotel services.
The revenue from resident's share of nursing services lasted during the first four days of absence. Hotel services' revenue was ongoing, but in case of hospital stay of more than four days, the resident receives back money for snacks and for the housekeeping.

Because of the NH's confidentiality, no data on the individual NHs' level can be presented in this section.

### Snacks, sweetened beverages, added sugars, and schools [^112GohW4]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Smart Snacks in School — food requirements for competitive foods include "foods sold in schools must have a fruit, a vegetable, a dairy product, or a protein food as its first ingredient", or be a whole grain–rich product "(≥ 50% whole grain or have whole grain as first ingredient)", a "combination food" "containing at least one-quarter cup fruit or vegetable", or "contain 10% of the Daily Value of a nutrient of concern"; fat limits are "Total fat must be ≤ 35% of kilocalories, saturated fat must be < 10% of kilocalories, and trans fat must be 0 g", with sodium and energy caps of "Snack items must contain ≤ 200 mg of sodium" and "entrée items… must contain ≤ 480 mg of sodium per portion", plus "Snack items must contain ≤ 200 kcal, and entrée items must contain ≤ 350 kcal per portion"; sugars are constrained as "Total sugar content… is limited to ≤ 35% of weight per portion as sugars".

### Cost effectiveness of a government supported policy strategy to decrease sodium intake: global analysis across 183 nations [^113zYjk9]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Intervention costs

Country specific resource needs and costs were derived using the WHO-CHOICE database, which includes detailed component specific estimates of inputs (ingredients) required for each intervention stage for each country's government and the estimated unit price for each input in that country including for example costs of human resources, training, meetings, supplies, equipment, and mass media (see supplementary eMethods). To facilitate comparisons between countries, we converted all costs to international dollars (I$) (see supplementary eMethods), which account for each nation's currency as well as purchasing power parity. One I$ in any given country can be interpreted as the funds needed to purchase the same amounts of goods or services in that country as one US$ would purchase in the US. For countries with lower incomes than the US, conversion of our findings from I$ to US$ would substantially increase the apparent cost effectiveness (ie, the cost in US$ per disability adjusted life year (DALY) saved would be much lower). We summed costs by year to calculate the total cost of the 10 year intervention for each country, with 3% annual discounting.

We modeled only governmental intervention costs, for several reasons. First, this cost is most relevant to budget constrained governments, since the program cost must be borne directly and immediately. Second, net industry sector costs for product reformulation in each country would be difficult to determine because once the relevant reformulation has been undertaken in any single country, the knowledge of that reformulation can be extended with much less additional cost to other countries. For example, multinational companies transfer improved recipes and reformulation strategies across borders with no cost, as do food scientists moving between firms, and so on. Third, in contrast to recent US models, we did not include estimated healthcare savings or increased productivity from prevented cardiovascular disease events because such savings could, in theory, be partly offset by new downstream health events resulting from enhanced survivaland because comparable healthcare and productivity costing data are available for a minority of countries globally. Because including such cost savings would be optimal according to many cost effectiveness guidelines, our results for overall cost effectiveness should be considered a conservative estimate.

### Real-world nudging, pricing, and mobile physical activity coaching was insufficient to improve lifestyle behaviours and cardiometabolic health: the supreme nudge parallel cluster-randomised controlled supermarket trial [^1157S9sw]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

At the supermarket-level, we explored whether nudging and pricing strategies changed supermarket-level sales trends to account for potential selective trial participation. We used sales data of the intervention period plus 6 months of pre-intervention data. Sales data comprised the number of products and Euros spent on healthy and unhealthy products per supermarket per week, based on 63 product groups which were pre-defined by the supermarket chain. We primarily investigated changes in the total percentage of healthy product sales of all sales in intervention supermarkets compared to control supermarkets during the intervention period, while taking into account the pre-intervention sales trends. We assigned the 63 product groups into 10 overarching food groups and examined the percentage change in sales from: fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts, grain products, milk and yogurt products, cheese, meat products, meat substitutes and eggs, fish, oils, fats and herbs and spices, non-alcoholic beverages, products from all remaining food products (e.g. pre-packaged meals, and baking products), and sweet and savoury snacks of total sales. Lastly, we examined changes in total sales revenue (Euros).

We monitored the implementation fidelity of the nudging and pricing strategies monthly to bi-monthly as the trial progressed. Research staff visited intervention supermarkets and quantitatively scored intervention components separately by their implementation status (none/minimal implementation scored 1, to (almost) optimal implementation scored 5). A summary score of all components was calculated for each supermarket by time point.

Sample size

The trial required 141 participants in each supermarket arm to detect an average change of 5 points in the diet quality score by the end of the intervention period, assuming a 14.1 point standard deviation (SD) of the average change (power = 80%; two-sided alpha = 0.05). The expected 5-point change was based on results from a virtual supermarket experiment which indicated a 4% increase in healthier purchasing following a combination of nudging and salient pricing strategies. We did not use a design factor since baseline data of diet quality among participants from the first eight enrolled supermarkets showed no correlation for observations between study sites (intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.00). To allow for 25% drop out, 176 participants needed to be recruited per arm, resulting in 352 participants.

### Small portion sizes in worksite cafeterias: do they help consumers to reduce their food intake? [^115BaVsf]. International Journal of Obesity (2011). Low credibility.

Consumer panel. Before the study, during lunch and dinner hours visitors to the participating cafeterias were asked to complete a short questionnaire that was meant to recruit participants and to assess whether they were eligible for study participation (that is, eating a hot meal at the worksite cafeteria at least once a week).

A total number of 881 worksite cafeteria visitors met the inclusion criteria and provided a valid email address to indicate study participation (Figure 1). During the study period, four online questionnaires were sent to the 881 participants on the weekday following the day on which they had indicated that they normally eat a hot meal in their worksite cafeteria. Before the start of the intervention, questionnaire 1 was sent to the participants. During the intervention period, the three remaining questionnaires were administered (questionnaires 2, 3 and 4). If the participants did not respond, they were sent a reminder exactly 1 week later. The participants who were included in the data analyses (n = 308) had to have completed questionnaire 1, questionnaire 2 and/or 3, and questionnaire 4. The number of participants that were included in the analysis ranged from 1 to 24 per worksite cafeteria. Table 1 gives an overview of the participants' characteristics. The prevalences of overweight and obesity were lower than in the Dutch population, in which 46.5% of adults are overweight and 11% are obese. Furthermore, compared with norm scores the participants' mean dietary restraint scores were above average.

Measurements. Daily sales figures were collected 1 month before the intervention and during the 3-month intervention period. Worksite cafeterias recorded their sales during 4 consecutive months on a standardized sheet that was provided to them and emailed this to the research team. For the sales data, the main outcome variables were: total sales of hot meals and fried snacks (entire study period, all conditions). In the intervention period, the sales of the small reducible meals were measured in the experimental conditions. To account for differences in the number of customers between the worksite cafeterias, sales were calculated per 50 customers. Further, worksite cafeterias ranged from 1 to 5 days per week on which they offered reducible meals. Therefore, for each week mean daily sales (per 50 customers) were calculated.

Sweet-tasting products — nonnutritive sweeteners may have a role: "Additional improvements in nutrient density of sweet-tasting products could be obtained if nonnutritive sweeteners are used as a tool to replace added sugars and help lower caloric intake". The document notes, "Several nonnutritive sweeteners have been accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration as safe and have shown good safety over time", yet "data are scarce on long-term benefits for weight management in children and adolescents or on the consequences of long-term consumption". It concludes, "Continued research is needed".

### Are food and beverage purchases in households with preschoolers changing? a longitudinal analysis from 2000 to 2011 [^111xh9Xq]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

U.S. dietary studies from 2003 to 2010 show decreases in children's caloric intake. We examined purchases of consumer packaged foods/beverages in the U.S. between 2000 and 2011 among households with children aged 2–5 years.

Purpose

To describe changes in consumer packaged goods (CPG) purchases between 2000 and 2011 after adjusting for economic indicators, and explore differences by race, education, and household income level.

Methods

CPG purchase data were obtained for 42,753 U.S. households with one or more child aged 2–5 years using the Nielsen Homescan Panel. Top sources of purchased calories were grouped, and random effects regression was used to model the relationship between calories purchased from each group and race, female head of household education, and household income. Models adjusted for household composition, market-level unemployment rate, prices, and quarter, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α = 0.05).

Results

Between 2000 and 2011, adjusted total calories purchased from foods (-182 kcal/day) and beverages (-100 kcal/day) declined significantly. Decreases in purchases of milk (-40 kcal); soft drinks (-27 kcal/day); juice and juice drinks (-24 kcal/day); grain-based desserts (-24 kcal/day); savory snacks (-17 kcal/day); and sweet snacks and candy (-13 kcal/day) were among the major changes. Changes in CPG purchases differed significantly by race, female head of household education, and household income.

Conclusions

Trends in CPG purchases suggest that solid fats and added sugars are decreasing in the food supply of U.S. preschoolers. Pronounced differences by race, education, and household income persist.

### What to do about portion sizes? Roundtable discussion at the forefronts in portion size conference [^112WTBhc]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Portion size and values

Portion size and food cost have been strongly linked for consumers. This relationship has emphasized value-priced sizing, which promotes purchasing larger, rather than smaller, sized options. To combat the message of 'get more for your dollar', positive values related to downsized portions need to be developed and promoted. Although the Dietary Guidelines recommend smaller portions, the relationship between portion size, intake, weight status and health may be vague and unclear to many consumers. Thus, messages framed around the relationships between consuming smaller portions and enhanced weight management, which can lead to improved health, reduced health care costs and enhanced quality of life need to be developed. Social marketing could assist with the promotion of these messages, which could positively reframe the value of a smaller portion.

### Opportunities and barriers for smaller portions in food service: lessons from marketing and behavioral economics [^111N2Pj1]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Use temporal landmarks to push small portions

The slow brain is more easily triggered on some days than on others. Dai et al. have found that consumers are more likely to engage in health behaviors on Mondays, on the first day of a month, and immediately after birthdays and national holidays. These days represent breaking points in life and create the experience of a fresh start. The fresh-start experience may trigger the slow brain — on these breakpoint days, Dai et al. observe that consumers are more likely to search for the term 'diet' on Google, attend the gym and enter commitment contracts to achieve various aspirational goals, including saving more money, studying harder and losing weight.

Consumers might also be more open to small-portion messaging on such days. Meatless Mondays have been introduced in various community campaigns. Restaurant chains may find that small-portion promotions (perhaps with discounts) are a good draw for customers on these breakpoint days and may actually generate traffic.

The danger of these promotions is of course the general point that any kind of promotion costs money. It takes marketing dollars to make consumers aware of the promotion, and training dollars to get staff to execute it.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^111Gjaoe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

5.2 Evidence

The average child who participates in the school lunch program consumes one third of the daily recommended caloric intake in school and three fifths if breakfast is also taken in school (Ref. pp 237–284). Of the 58 million schoolchildren in this country, about 28 million take part in the lunch program and 8 million in the breakfast program. Although federal standards require that these meals meet certain nutritional standards, the total fat composition of lunches exceeded the federal nutrition target of no more than 30% of total calories (Ref. pp 237–284). As children move through the school system, fewer students participate in the school lunch program, and they consume a nutritionally poorer lunch obtained through alternative food sources.

The problem largely lies in the availability of alternative food sources (termed "competitive foods") in the school via snack bars, vending machines, or school-sponsored fund-raising sales. School districts have been tackling the issue by banning the sale of nutritionally poor food in their cafeterias, snack bars, and vending machines at school-sponsored events. These efforts have met resistance on the part of children, their parents, and school administrators who feared the loss of an important revenue source if children were to diminish their purchases of "competitive foods". But in a 5-month post-ban study, schools did not suffer any loss in revenues from changed food and beverage sales. In several community studies, the fat content of meals decreased for those students exposed to a ban on junk food sales (Ref. pp 237–284).

5.3 Recommendation

We suggest that clinicians advocate parental participation in the design of school-based dietary or physical activity programs and that schools educate parents about the rationale for these programs to ensure their understanding and cooperation (2 ⊕○○○).

### Improving women's diet quality preconceptionally and during gestation: effects on birth weight and prevalence of low birth weight – a randomized controlled efficacy trial in India (mumbai maternal nutrition project) [^115rShLt]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Intervention

We considered various ways of supplying a daily, freshly prepared, safe, and palatable portion of food that contained green leafy vegetables, fruit, and milk to women who were living across an urban slum area ∼13 × 13 km. The best solution, after development and pilot testing in a different slum community (Shetanchowki, Mumbai), was snacks that resembled local street foods such as samosas and fritters, which could be filled with the key ingredients, cooked, packaged, and easily transported.

Treatment snacks contained fresh and dried green leafy vegetables, milk, and dried fruit (Table 1). Green leafy vegetables included spinach, colocasia, amaranth, fenugreek, coriander, shepu, spring onion stalk, and curry leaves. Initially, we used dried green leafy vegetables with the rationale being to provide more micronutrients per unit volume of green leafy vegetables. These vegetables were commercially produced, air-dried at room temperature, and supplied as powders or flakes. However, as the trial progressed, we increased the proportion of fresh leaves purchased from local markets, which improved the palatability without major changes in the nutrient content (Table 2). Dried fruits included figs, dates, raisins, mango, apple, gooseberry, and guava. Milk was included as commercially bought full-fat milk powder. Control snacks were made from low-micronutrient vegetables such as potato, tapioca, and onion, which were purchased from local markets. To avoid monotony for the women, we created 70 treatment and 40 control recipes from these foods of which 8–14 were in use at any time (see Supplemental Table 1 under "Supplemental data" in the online issue). Snacks were made fresh each day in a dedicated study kitchen at the CSSC. Both treatment and control snacks had similar added spices, bindings, and covering ingredients (wheat, rice, or chickpea flour and semolina) and (except for one recipe in each allocation group) were cooked by deep frying in sunflower oil.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^111uWwZx]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Dietary supplements and nutraceuticals — assessment and recommendation stance notes that the Work Group found "insufficient evidence of benefit to support an evidence-based, positive recommendation for the use of any nutraceutical for clinically meaningful short-term weight loss or long-term weight management". Since these products are not evaluated for safety and effectiveness before U.S. sale, consumer products may vary in purity, consistency, ingredient content, and dosing; they have generally not been studied in conjunction with CLIs, leaving insufficient evidence on whether an active product outperforms placebo alongside CLI, which the Work Group considered being a core component of long-term management. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was low, and additional considerations were cost to the patient, pill burden, and the potential to divert interest and investment away from evidence-based interventions.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^115EuJKQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

5.5 Recommendation

We suggest that clinicians advocate that policymakers provide incentives to ensure that retailers can offer affordable, high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables to all (2 ⊕○○○).

5.5 Evidence

For the poor, food expense represents an important item in a family's budget (Ref. pp 193–221). At least one study showed that a diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein costs more than a diet based on refined grains, added sugars, and fats. But a diet richer in fruits and vegetables can reduce caloric intake and lead to weight control. There are fewer conveniently located supermarkets in poorer neighborhoods but many "convenience stores" selling calorie-dense foods. Urban stores tend to stock fewer of the healthier foods and have less of a variety of foods. Even if supermarket availability were to improve, prices are still lower in the poorer neighborhoods for the higher fat, calorie-dense foods. Some policies (including the federal government farm subsidy program) have encouraged production of high-fructose corn syrup and other commodities used extensively in processed foods. Even when restaurants advertise and make healthy food items available, consumer habits may continue to prefer burgers, fries, and other high-calorie, high-fat items.

### Small portion sizes in worksite cafeterias: do they help consumers to reduce their food intake? [^111K5SRe]. International Journal of Obesity (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

On the basis of both the sales and consumer data, it can be concluded that when offering a smaller meal in addition to the existing size, a percentage of the consumers that is considered reasonable were inclined to replace the larger meal with the smaller meal. Especially, since for practical reasons the smaller portion could not be offered daily, this might have suppressed the consumer demand. As the intervention did not lead to increasing sales of the total number of hot meals, it is likely that consumers who previously bought the large meal replaced this by the small meal.

Second, employing proportional prices for the smaller meal did not have an additional effect. This is in line with another study evaluating the impact of proportional prices of fast-food items on consumer choices. An explanation for the findings of both studies might be that the price differences between the portion sizes were too small. This might especially be the case in worksite cafeterias where prices are generally low.

Third, with respect to compensatory eating behavior, the results are more tentative. The sales figures indicate that consumers did not compensate for their small meal by purchasing fried snacks. However, compensation behavior may have occurred with respect to other foods of which the sales figures were not tracked. Furthermore, based on the consumer data, there are indications that compensatory food intake may have taken place. This corresponds with other studies demonstrating that compensatory food intake may occur. For people with a healthy weight, compensating for a small portion would not necessarily be problematic (especially if this would lead to a more varied consumption pattern). However, although the data with respect to compensatory eating behavior are limited, they could have important implications for people who are overweight or obese, who risk not benefiting from the intervention. So far, no studies assessing the effectiveness of environmental interventions are known that have taken compensatory food intake into account. Further research that addresses compensatory food intake (especially among people who are overweight or obese) is needed.

### Are energy-dense foods really cheaper? Reexamining the relation between food price and energy density [^1118oeie]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The inverse relation between energy density (kcal/g) and energy cost (price/kcal) has been interpreted to suggest that produce (fruit, vegetables) is more expensive than snacks (cookies, chips).

Objective

The objective of this study was to show the methodologic weakness of comparing energy density with energy cost.

Design

The relation between energy density and energy cost was replicated in a random-number data set. Additionally, observational data were collected for produce and snacks from an online supermarket. Variables included total energy (kcal), total weight (g), total number of servings, serving size (g/serving), and energy density (kcal/g). Price measures included energy cost ($/kcal), total price ($), unit price ($/g), and serving price ($/serving). Two-tailed t tests were used to compare price measures by food category. Relations between energy density and price measures within food categories were examined with the use of Spearman rank correlation analysis.

Results

The relation between energy density and energy cost was shown to be driven by the algebraic properties of these variables. Food category was strongly correlated with both energy density and food price measures. Energy cost was higher for produce than for snacks. However, total price and unit price were lower for produce. Serving price and serving size were greater for produce than for snacks. Within food categories, energy density was uncorrelated with most measures of food price, except for a weak positive correlation with serving price within the produce category.

Conclusion

The findings suggest the relation between energy density and food price is confounded by food category and depends on which measure of price is used.

### What to do about portion sizes? Roundtable discussion at the forefronts in portion size conference [^116DJDfr]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This conference highlighted that research conducted on the topic of portion size is in its infancy. Although it is clear that portion sizes have increased and larger portion size enhances consumption, it is not known what degree of portion-size reduction is needed to meaningfully decrease intake, what amount of reduction is feasible to implement or what is the best method(s) to reduce portion size for long-term outcomes. Research that can address these areas is greatly needed.

### Calories purchased by hospital employees after implementation of a cafeteria traffic light-labeling and choice architecture program [^114dsZ2j]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Cafeteria Sales

Sales data from cash registers linked to employee IDs were used to track purchases. A database of cafeteria items, including their traffic light assignment, was used for prior analyses of cafeteria purchases. Items were categorized as beverages, entrees (eg, sandwich, hot meal, or salad), or other foods (eg, snacks, desserts, hot sides, or fruit).

Calories

In 2016, the cafeteria sales database was updated to include calorie information. Calories for all items were manually verified by a registered dietitian (E.D.G.) using a food-service program that provided nutrient data for hospital-generated standardized recipes created by food production managers. This information was taken from nutrition resources, such as the US Department of Agriculture food composition database, as well as from vendor product information when available. Most prepackaged products had nutrition data available in the food-service program or from the nutrition facts labels. All calorie information was provided per portion sold except for items sold in bulk, which were purchased by weight. For most items sold by weight (eg, frozen yogurt), caloric content was calculated by multiplying the weight of the item (included in the sales database) by the calories per ounce. Although salad was sold by weight, the salad bar offered items with varying caloric content, including leafy greens, beans, cheeses, grains, and dressings. To estimate calories in a salad, a pilot study of 127 employees was conducted in 2015 to determine the mean number of calories per ounce. Salads were considered green unless they weighed more than 1 pound, in which case they were labeled yellow. The main measures for the current study were calories per transaction purchased by employees during the baseline quarter (December 1, 2009, to February 28, 2010) and during each quarter during the next 2 years. Other measures included the total number of calories purchased each quarter by the subset of employees who were frequent purchasers (≥ 36 transactions per quarter).

### Experiencing nature leads to healthier food choices [^116VPFNK]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

After the walk, participants had access to a snack buffet for 10 min, which was framed as compensation for their participation in the study. The buffet consisted of four healthy snacks (bananas, apples, dried fruits, and mixed nuts) and four unhealthy snacks (strawberry cookies, apricot cookies, potato chips, and brownies) pre-tested for healthiness, as detailed in Supplementary Note 2. Based on the pre-test evaluations (and homogeneity across nutritional profiles), the strawberry and apricot cookies (same brand and type of cookie) were aggregated during the coding phase, creating 7 overall food choice options in the data, from the 8 original choice options. All of the snacks were laid out visibly on a large table in the experiment room, with numerous quantities of each snack available. Pre-packaged foods were either already portioned and packaged out of the box, or portioned out by the researcher and packaged in small, sealed clear bags based on the portion sizes indicated on the package. In accordance with FDA standards, each individual fruit was considered one serving. Participants were informed that they could have any and as many snacks as they wanted, but that all snacks had to be consumed on site and could not be saved for later. Participants were told to leave their trash in the room, which was cleaned once the experiment ended. The researcher timed each buffet session and returned to the experiment room once the 10 min had passed so that participants could consume their desired snacks without external influence. After participants completed the experiment and were debriefed and escorted from the lab, the researcher took inventory and recorded the snack choices and quantities consumed for each participant.

### Comparison of sales from vending machines with 4 different food and beverage messages: a randomized trial [^111ArJxt]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Point-of-sale food messaging can encourage healthier purchases, but no studies have directly compared multiple interventions in the field.

Objective

To examine which of 4 food and beverage messages would increase healthier vending machine purchases.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized trial assessed 13 months (February 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020) of vending sales data from 267 machines and 1065 customer purchase assessments from vending machines on government property in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Data analysis was performed from March 5, 2020, to November 8, 2022.

Interventions

Study interventions were 4 food and beverage messaging systems: (1) beverage tax posters encouraging healthy choices because of the Philadelphia tax on sweetened drinks; (2) green labels for healthy products; (3) traffic light labels: green (healthy), yellow (moderately healthy), or red (unhealthy); or (4) physical activity equivalent labels (minutes of activity to metabolize product calories).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sales data were analyzed separately for beverages and snacks. The main outcomes analyzed at the transaction level were calories sold and the health status (using traffic light criteria) of each item sold. Additional outcomes were analyzed at the monthly machine level: total units sold, calories sold, and units of each health status sold. The customer purchase assessment outcome was calories purchased per vending trip.

Results

Monthly sales data came from 150 beverage and 117 snack vending machines, whereas 1065 customers (558 [52%] male) contributed purchase assessment data. Traffic light labels led to a 30% decrease in the mean monthly number of unhealthy beverages sold (mean ratio [MR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55–0.88) compared with beverage tax posters. Physical activity labels led to a 34% (MR, 0.66; 95% CI,0.51–0.87) reduction in the number of unhealthy beverages sold at the machine level and 35% (MR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50–0.86) reduction in mean calories sold. Traffic light labels also led to a 30-calorie reduction (b = -30.46; 95% CI, -49.36 to -11.56) per customer trip in the customer purchase analyses compared to physical activity labels. There were very few significant differences for snack machines.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this 13-month randomized trial of 267 vending machines, the traffic light and physical activity labels encouraged healthier beverage purchases, but no change in snack sales, compared with a beverage tax poster. Corporations and governments should consider such labeling approaches to promote healthier beverage choices.

### Wartime food availability in the Gaza strip, October 2023 to August 2024: a retrospective analysis [^115w4Nfc]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Existing private stores

Let I₀ be the mean prewar caloric intake per person-day (see below for its estimation). We assumed that I₀, m, the fraction of I₀ not met through food aid prewar, would have been entirely sourced from private markets stocked from agricultural output within Gaza (see below) and retail food trucked in. By around 18 December 2023, the last of these private stores was reported to have emptied, suggesting that they had held ≤ 72 days of stock. Therefore, we assumed that stores would have been able to supply I 0, m for 72 days based on their baseline stock, but discounted this amount, as above, for the reported decreasing proportion of operational stores in each region over time, which could reflect stockouts as well as military damage; as above, we linearly interpolated sequential data points of store operationality.

Agriculture and livestock production

Prewar, agricultural output fulfilled about 17% of I₀, but remote sensing analysis showed 8% damage to cropland by December 2023,28% by January 2024,43% by Februaryand 57% by May. We thus assumed roughly that the agricultural sector would have fulfilled 14–20% of I₀ at baseline (uniformly distributed), with this proportion declining to 6–9% by May 2024 as a linear interpolation of per cent cropland damage.

Airdrops and boat deliveries

Since late February 2024, countries including the USA, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Germany, France and the UK carried out airdrops, mostly over northern Gaza. We reviewed press releases by each country's armed forces to extract weight and caloric equivalents of each airdrop. Where caloric equivalent was not provided (nine instances), we assumed the same caloric equivalent as the WCK food parcels. Where medical supplies were reported as part of the airdrop (five instances), we assumed food accounted for 70% of total weight. We also included the boat delivery by WCK and partners on 15 March 2024 and all deliveries by the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) maritime corridor set up by the USA, which operated intermittently between 16 May 2024 and 17 July 2024.

### Pricing and availability intervention in vending machines at four bus garages [^1132ix8p]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of lowering prices and increasing availability on sales of healthy foods and beverages from 33 vending machines in 4 bus garages as part of a multicomponent worksite obesity prevention intervention.

Methods

Availability of healthy items was increased to 50% and prices were lowered at least 10% in the vending machines in two metropolitan bus garages for an 18-month period. Two control garages offered vending choices at usual availability and prices. Sales data were collected monthly from each of the vending machines at the four garages.

Results

Increases in availability to 50% and price reductions of an average of 31% resulted in 10% to 42% higher sales of the healthy items. Employees were mostly price responsive for snack purchases.

Conclusions

Greater availability and lower prices on targeted food and beverage items from vending machines was associated with greater purchases of these items over an 18-month period. Efforts to promote healthful food purchases in worksite settings should incorporate these two strategies.

### Conditional recommendations for specific dietary ingredients as an approach to chronic musculoskeletal pain: evidence-based decision aid for health care providers, participants, and policy makers [^113R1Djn]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conditional recommendations were made (37.5% weak, in favor; 62.5% strong, in favor) for the use of capsaicin as a cream or patch for pain and related symptoms.

Current research shows high-quality evidence and certainty that capsaicin will produce a statistically significant reduction in pain (SMD = –0.56) and the patient's global assessment of improvement (risk difference [RD] = –0.21) compared with placebo at time points closest to four weeks (Supplementary Data: Summary Report). These desirable anticipated effects were judged to be moderate overall, and the undesirable anticipated effects, primarily associated with burning, itching, and irritation, were judged to be small to trivial. Most OTC creams contain 0.025–0.075% capsaicin and can be applied three to four times a day to the affected area. The application of higher OTC doses (i.e. 0.25%) is only recommended if the patient can tolerate the increased undesirable effects, an approach that can potentially provide quicker pain relief with less frequent applications.

Because the cost of capsaicin is highly dependent upon its dose and delivery system, it was challenging for members to judge the required resources based on the current evidence. Given the desirable vs undesirable anticipated effects, however, its use likely justifies the resource requirements and out-of-pocket expenses. Members agreed that capsaicin would likely be acceptable to stakeholders and feasible/suitable to implement for use as a cream or patch.

### Comparison of sales from vending machines with 4 different food and beverage messages: a randomized trial [^112bsu6T]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. First, we compared multiple food and beverage messages using a randomized field experiment in a large number of vending machines. Second, these machines were in a diverse range of settings rather than concentrated in a single setting (eg, worksite) as in other studies. Third, we studied our intervention in both beverage and snack machines and for a long period. Fourth, we evaluated objectively measured machine-level sales data and customer purchase assessments.

This study also has several limitations. First, it was conducted in vending machines that were subject to city regulations that made them healthier than average, so results may not generalize to other vending machines or purchasing settings. Second, because the city required that all vending machines have some type of label for healthy items, we were unable to test a pure control group with no labeling intervention. Instead, beverage tax posters provided an interesting comparison group. Our test of tax salience messaging may have been diluted because some beverage tax posters fell off. Only one-quarter of participants reported noticing the tax reminders compared with 58% and 65% noticing the physical activity and traffic light messaging, respectively. There were differences in baseline sales by condition, although we adjusted for these. Still, customers in the physical activity locations (which had lower baseline sales) may have been less frequent vending consumers. Our customer response rate was 67%, which is higher than for studies recruiting outside urban food retailers. Finally, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic prevented us from reaching our target customer sample size.

### Public policies to reduce sugary drink consumption in children and adolescents [^115EdjNH]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Public policies to reduce sugary drink consumption — marketing restrictions for children and adolescents: The federal and state governments should support efforts to decrease sugary drink marketing to children and adolescents, with documented exposure including that in 2009 carbonated beverage companies reported $395 million in youth-directed advertisements, approximately 97% directed at teenagers, and from 2015 to 2016 children's exposure to advertisements increased 19% for carbonated beverages and 38% for juice, fruit drinks, and sports drinks; younger children may only see 1 beverage advertisement per day on children's programs. An online survey of US adolescents ages 12 to 17 years (n = 847) found almost half reported daily sugary drink advertising exposure, with the highest exposure among 14- to 15-year-old African American male adolescents whose parents had a high school education or less. Modeling by the CHOICES study suggests that eliminating the advertising subsidy for nutritionally poor foods and beverages marketed to children would prevent approximately 129 000 cases of obesity over a decade at a cost $0.66 for each unit of BMI reduced and would generate approximately $80 million annually in tax revenue; the US Congress should consider this and other allowable measures. State governments should implement the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) local school wellness policy Final rule under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which requires that only foods and beverages meeting the Smart Snacks standards may be marketed on school campuses during the school day, and should also consider additional strategies such as prohibitions on coupons, sales, and advertising in and around schools and on school buses as well as sugary drink-branded sponsorship of youth sporting events.

### Effects of two weeks' mandatory snack consumption on energy intake and energy balance [^115jS1FS]. Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Our goal was to compare the effects of mandatory consumption of commercial snack products (CSPs) on energy intakes and energy balance in free-living adults and to assess the interaction between habitual level of CSP consumption and the interventions.

Research Methods and Procedures

Four groups of 18 subjects (lean and overweight, males and females) were studied using a crossover design. Subjects consumed one type of CSP (high-carbohydrate, high-fat, or mixed composition) at three manipulations of energy 0 MJ (control), 1.5 MJ (low-energy), and 3.0 MJ (high-energy) each day during three 14-day interventions. The study design was parallel for type of CSP (macronutrient composition) and within-subjects for energy level. Subjects self-recorded food intakes between Days 8 and 14, and body weights were investigator-recorded on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each intervention period. Daily energy expenditure was estimated by heart rate monitoring.

Results

Daily energy intakes increased from 10.4 MJ (control) to 11.1 MJ (low-energy) and 11.5 MJ (high-energy) (p < 0.001), resulting in a trend (not significant) for body weight gain. Energy balance was more positive when subjects were not recording their food intakes than when they were (p < 0.001). There was a trend (not significant) for greater increases in energy intake with increasing fat content, and energy density, of the interventions. Frequent CSP consumers compensated more for the interventions than did infrequent CSP consumers (R² = 0.125, p = 0.003).

Discussion

Subjects partially compensated for energy when supplemented with CSPs over 14-day periods, although this was insufficient to prevent some increase in energy balance. The level of compensation correlated with habitual energy intake from CSPs.

### Effect of financial incentives and default options on food choices of adults with low income in online retail settings: a randomized clinical trial [^115dJqCz]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Despite recent growth in online redemption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, no previous work has tested the impact of economic and behavioral economic strategies on food purchasing behaviors in an online grocery retail setting among adults with low income.

Objective

To examine the extent to which financial incentives and default shopping cart options influence fruit and vegetable purchases.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial used an experimental online grocery store for adults who currently or have ever received SNAP benefits. From October 7 to December 2, 2021, participants were instructed to shop for a week's worth of groceries for their household, with a budget tailored to household size; no payment was taken.

Interventions

Random assignment to 1 of 4 conditions: no intervention, 50% discount on eligible fruits and vegetables, prefilled shopping carts with tailored fruit and vegetable items (ie, default options), or a combination of the discount and default options.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the percentage of nondiscounted dollars spent on eligible fruit and vegetables per basket.

Results

Of 2744 participants, mean (SD) age was 46.7 (16.0) years, and 1447 (52.7%) identified as women. A total of 1842 participants (67.1%) reported currently receiving SNAP benefits and 1492 (54.4%) reported shopping online for groceries in the previous 12 months. Participants spent a mean (SD) 20.5% (23.5%) of total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables. Compared with no intervention, those in the discount condition spent 4.7% (98.3% CI, 1.7%-7.7%) of more total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables; those in the default condition, 7.8% (98.3% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) more; and those in the combination condition, 13.0% (98.3% CI, 10.0%-16.0%) more (P < .001 for all). There was no difference between the discount and the default conditions (P = 0.06), but the effect in the combination condition was significantly larger than both discount and default conditions (P < .001). Default shopping cart items were purchased by 679 participants (93.4%) in the default condition and 655 (95.5%) in the combination condition, whereas 297 (45.8%) in the control and 361 (52.9%) in the discount conditions purchased those items (P < .001). No variation was observed by age, sex, or race and ethnicity, and results were similar when those who reported never shopping online for groceries were excluded.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, financial incentives for fruits and vegetables and default options, especially in combination, led to meaningful increases in online fruit and vegetable purchases among adults with low income.

### Appetitive, dietary and health effects of almonds consumed with meals or as snacks: a randomized, controlled trial [^115GLdCx]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) document changes in US consumer eating patterns over the past 3 decades. In 2006, almost all adults (97%) reported consuming at least one snack per daycompared with 71% in 1977. Snacking was self-defined by the survey respondents and most likely referred to eating events that occurred between self-described main meals. Not only has snacking become more prevalent, the number of snacks consumed per day has also increased. One daily snacking event was included by the population in 1977 and that increased to about 2.2 snacks per day in 2006. In conjunction with increased snacking frequency, snack size has increased from 165 to 264 kcal/day over the same period of time.

Higher eating frequency is associated with greater energy intake, especially after correcting for under-reporting. Population studies report that body weight is positively associated with eating frequency in both children, and adults. Because the number of meals has remained relatively stable over the last few decades, an increase in eating frequency is likely due to more frequent snacking. Findings indicate that compensation for snacking or eating events occurring several hours before meals lead to poor dietary compensation. Increased portion size has also been implicated in weight gain, but no significant increase in portion sizes of main meals are reported in the NHANES 1977–2006 data, and supplemental energy provided with meals can lead to precise compensation. This suggests that eating frequency may be particularly problematic for weight gain, especially when there is no reduction in portion sizes as eating frequency increases. However, there are several fundamental issues that require clarification to confirm this hypothesis. One major issue is the lack of consensus for the definition of a snack. Snacks are variously defined by the timing of their ingestion, their nutrient profile or energy content with possible variable implications for their association with health outcomes. However, there are foods and drinks that are commonly consumed with a meal or alone as snacks (for example, potato chips and soda), making the classification of snacks based on energy or nutrient profile questionable. With respect to overall health concerns with snacking, nutrient profiles of snack foods must be considered. Some foods/beverages may be nutrient poor, whereas others are good sources of essential nutrients and may be healthful dietary components. Thus, balancing the effects of snacking on energy versus nutrient intake is vital for assessing an items role in a healthful diet.

### Pathway decisions for reuse and recycling of retired lithium-ion batteries considering economic and environmental functions [^115qEV41]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Economic performance measures the profitability of an operation or investment. It encompasses metrics such as total profit, which assesses the entire profit earned during the operation period; unit battery profit, which gauges the profit per kWh battery; and average daily profit, which tracks the daily operational profitability. The configuration and operation of the system considering battery degradation across various scenarios are determined by optimizing the total profit (for the ESS and CBS) and daily average profit (for the LSV) in the use stage. Figure 2b, c shows the results of the total profit, the profit per kWh battery, and the daily average profit for the NMC and LFP batteries. The total profit is calculated according to Eq. (2). The unit profit is the ratio of the total profit to the battery system capacity. The daily average profit is calculated by dividing the total profit by the number of operating days. LFP batteries generally perform better than NMC batteries due to their longer lifespan – and higher efficiency. Both the ESS and CBS scenarios are profitable, with the former outperforming the latter due to having larger photovoltaic (PV) systems. In the ESS, the light industry scenario with more renewable energy is the most profitable, while in the CBS, total profit is linked to load size. The unit battery profit shows that the ESS is losing its edge over the CBS. In the ESS, the unit battery profit aligns with the total profit, whereas in the CBS, it decreases from the rural, railway, and commercial scenarios to the urban scenario. Batteries with higher SOHs yield better unit battery profit in the ESS and CBS because of their longer lifespans. However, in some cases, such as in the ESS-Gov and ESS-Com scenarios, using a 70% SOH LFP battery can be more profitable daily than using an 80% SOH battery due to lower purchase costs and increased profits of $0.13/day and $0.32/day, respectively. In the LSV-Sig scenarios, both NMC and LFP SLBs have negative total profit, unit battery profit, and average daily profit due to the lack of renewable energy integration and reliance on grid electricity. Decision-making for the reuse pathway should prioritize the ESS and CBS, with surplus batteries allocated to the LSV.

### Estimated costs of production and potential prices for the WHO essential medicines list [^114CRTvr]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Conversion costs

A number of sources were used to inform an assumed per-unit cost for converting raw API and excipients into an FPP ('conversion cost'). We reviewed reports of capital and operating costs for pharmaceutical tablet formulating plants and contacted large generic manufacturers for confidential estimates. In addition, we identified the product with the lowest price in the UK, South Africa and India: with API cost and profit margins approaching zero for the cheapest products, the total per-unit cost can be seen as a high estimate of the conversion cost. Estimated conversion costs per tablet extracted from these sources are summarised in table 1, with details and full references available in the online supplementary appendix.

Table 1
Per-unit cost component values available from published sources in the last 10 years

Per-unit conversion costs reported in analyses in the last 10 years (operating cost including depreciated capital cost) ranged from US$0.0002 to US$0.013 per tablet. The estimate of conversion cost by Chaudhuri and West (US$0.01 per tablet) included costs of environmental protection and compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) standards. The costs attributed to cGMP compliance are similar to costs estimated in an Indian government white paper (see online supplementary appendix). We therefore used a conversion cost of US$0.01 per tablet in this study.

Tax and profit margin

The average profit margin for the pharmaceutical industry in India was 8.8% in 1995 and 15.4% in 2005. We assumed a profit margin of 10%. Tax rates in India range from 18.5% to 34.6%; we assumed a midpoint value of 26.6% tax charged on net profits. The final price estimation algorithm is shown in figure 1. References are mentioned in the online supplementary appendix.

### What is the role of portion control in weight management? [^112g1SHk]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Early studies

The first known study linking portion size and intake came from Siegelin 1957 who found that people have a 'completion compulsion' or tendency to eat entire servings or units of food. In that brief report, few data were presented and there were no statistics, but there were memorable observations such as: 'In cookie consumption, compulsion is marked enough to stimulate a chuckle. On only one occasion was a fraction of a cookie left behind'. Over the next 30 years, attempts to establish a significant link between portion size and consumption were disappointing. In one study, normal-weight subjects, offered either one sandwich at a time (with more available in a refrigerator) or three sandwiches together, ate an average of two sandwiches in both conditions. In 1986, Edelman et al. tested the effect of varying the portion of lasagna available in a cafeteria at the military facility in Natick, Massachusetts. Although the portion offered varied significantly (255 vs 426 g), no effect of portion size was found. It is not clear why portion size failed to affect intake in these studies, but it may have been that participants could have more helpings than were initially served. Ten years later, Wansinkshowed that the package or container size of a variety of foods (spaghetti, chicken and chocolate candies) affected the amount people took, but intake was not assessed. In a later relatively uncontrolled study conducted in a movie theater, consumers were found to eat more from a large bucket of popcorn than from one half the size. Thus, until recently, there was little experimental evidence showing a direct effect of portion size on intake.

Meanwhile, data were accumulating that portion sizes of many foods and beverages had increased substantially. Furthermore, nationally representative survey data from the United States indicated that as portions increased in size, people reported that they had been consuming larger portions. Between 1977 and 1996, the amount consumed at an eating occasion increased for a wide range of foods. In a seminal paper published in 2002 with the title 'The contribution of expanding portion sizes to the US obesity epidemic', Young and Nestledrew a parallel between the increases in portion sizes of restaurant foods, grocery products and recipes in cookbooks and the rise in the prevalence of obesity. Although the overlap in the rise in portion size and obesity prevalence was compelling, more direct evidence that portion size affects intake was needed.

### Association of a sweetened beverage tax with purchases of beverages and high-sugar foods at independent stores in Philadelphia [^116H5CL5]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The relationship between a sweetened beverage tax and changes in the prices and purchases of beverages and high-sugar food is understudied in the long term and in small independent food retail stores where sugar-sweetened beverages are among the most commonly purchased items.

Objective

To examine whether a 1.5 cent-per-fluid-ounce excise tax on sugar- and artificially sweetened beverages Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was associated with sustained changes in beverage prices and purchases, as well as calories purchased from beverages and high-sugar foods, over 2 years at small independent stores.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used a difference-in-differences approach to compare changes in beverage prices and purchases of beverages and high-sugar foods (candy, sweet snacks) at independent stores in Philadelphia and Baltimore, Maryland (a nontaxed control) before and 2 years after tax implementation, which occurred on January 1, 2017. Price comparisons were also made to independent stores in Philadelphia's neighboring counties.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Changes in mean price (measured in cents per fluid ounce) of taxed and nontaxed beverages, mean fluid ounces purchased of taxed and nontaxed beverages, and mean total calories purchased from beverages and high-sugar foods.

Results

Compared with Baltimore independent stores, taxed beverage prices in Philadelphia increased 2.06 cents per fluid ounce (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.38 cents per fluid ounce; P < .001), with 137% of the tax passed through to prices 2 years after tax implementation, while nontaxed beverage prices had no statistically significant change. A total of 116 independent stores and 4738 customer purchases (1950 [41.2%] women; 4351 [91.8%] age 18 years or older; 1006 [21.2%] White customers, 3185 [67.2%] Black customers) at independent stores were assessed for price and purchase comparisons. Purchases of taxed beverages declined by 6.1 fl oz (95% CI, -9.9 to -2.4 fl oz; P < .001), corresponding to a 42% decline in Philadelphia compared with Baltimore; there were no significant changes in purchases of nontaxed beverages. Although there was no significant moderation by neighborhood income or customer education level, exploratory stratified analyses revealed that declines in taxed beverage purchases were larger among customers shopping in low-income neighborhoods (-7.1 fl oz; 95% CI, -13.0 to -1.1 fl oz; P = 0.001) and individuals with lower education levels (-6.9 fl oz; 95% CI, -12.5 to -1.3 fl oz; P = 0.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study found that a tax on sweetened beverages was associated with increases in price and decreases in purchasing. Beverage excise taxes may be an effective policy to sustainably decrease purchases of sweetened drinks and calories from sugar in independent stores, with large reductions in lower-income areas and among customers with lower levels of education.

### Significant increase in young adults' snacking between 1977–1978 and 1994–1996 represents a cause for concern! [^1147bXvR]. Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Studies on children and adolescents suggest a large increase in the role of snacking; however, little is know about changes in the snacking behavior of young adults.

Methods

USDA's nationally representative surveys from 1977–1978 to 1994–1996 are used to study snacking trends among 8,493 persons 19–29 years old.

Results

Snacking prevalence increased from 77 to 84% between 1977–1978 and 1994–1996. The nutritional contribution of snacks to total daily energy intake went from 20 to 23%, primarily because energy consumed per snacking occasion increased by 26% and the number of snacks per day increased 14%. The mean daily caloric density (calorie per gram of food) of snacks increased from 1.05 to 1.32 calories. The energy contribution of high-fat desserts to the total calories from snacking decreased (22 to 14%), however, this food group remained the most important source of energy. The energy contribution of high-fat salty snacks doubled. Sweetened and alcoholic beverages remained important energy contributors.

Conclusion

This large increase in total energy and energy density of snacks among young adults in the United States may be contributing to our obesity epidemic.

### Estimated minimum prices and lowest available national prices for antiobesity medications: improving affordability and access to treatment [^117AqBbn]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Novel antiobesity treatments are highly effective in recent clinical trials. Access to these medications is needed to supplement lifestyle and surgical interventions for millions living with obesity worldwide, but high prices are limiting. This study aimed to review current treatment costs and calculate potential estimated minimum prices (EMPs).

Methods

The authors searched national drug price databases across various countries for orlistat, naltrexone-bupropion, topiramate-phentermine, liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. EMPs for antiobesity medications were calculated using established methodology, using active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from the Panjiva database. EMPs were calculated per 30-day course and include costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, formulation, taxation, and 10% profit margin.

Results

National prices of antiobesity medications were significantly higher than calculated EMPs. Semaglutide 30-day course prices ranged from $804 (United States) to $95 (Turkey) while the EMP was $40. Liraglutide prices ranged from $1418 (United States) to $252 (Norway) while the EMP was $50. Some oral treatments could be generically manufactured at very low costs per course ($7 for orlistat; $5 for phentermine/topiramate combination tablets), while naltrexone/bupropion was more expensive ($54).

Conclusions

This study shows that certain weight loss treatments can be manufactured and sold profitably at low costs, but prices currently range widely between countries, limiting access for those in need.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^112QdAoc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

School competitive foods and beverages — availability trends and caloric impact — show declines in access across states and quantify daily intake differences. During 2006–2008 across 35 states, the median percentage of schools allowing student purchases from vending machines or similar venues decreased for chocolate candy (from 39% to 21%), other kinds of candy (from 43% to 24%), salty snacks not low in fat (47% to 34%), soda pop (from 62% to 38%), and sports drinks (from 72% to 57%). Offering competitive foods in vending machines at schools is associated with significantly higher body mass index (BMI) among middle-school students. In the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study, sugar-sweetened beverages obtained at school contributed an additional 29 kcal per school day for middle school students and 46 kcal per school day for high school students, while low-nutrient, energy-dense foods obtained and consumed at school contributed 86 kcal per school day for middle school students and 111 kcal per school day for high school students; attending schools without stores or snack bars that sell foods or beverages is estimated to be associated with reduced sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 22 kcal per school day for middle school students and 28 kcal per school day for high school students, and restricting access to snack foods is associated with more frequent fruit and vegetable consumption.

### Testing the effect of a dynamic descriptive social norm message on meat-free food selection in worksite cafeterias: a randomized controlled trial [^116TQPm3]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Meal sales

The catering company provided the research team with sales data that were recorded via electronic point-of-sale tills throughout the trial. Hot main meals, wraps, salads, soups, sandwiches, savory snacks, starters, and jacket potatoes were coded as either meat-based or meat-free depending on their ingredients using a series of keywords (e.g. "chicken", "fish", "lamb" or "Quorn", "plant-based", vegan"). Food items that do not constitute a meal such as sides, confectionery, desserts, beverages, and condiments were excluded from the data. All products were individually checked by a member of the research team for potential errors in coding (e.g. coding a meat-including item as meat-free). Clarifications were asked from catering managers if the contents of a dish were not clear from its name. Following coding, the total number of meals sold every day and every week at each site were calculated, for both the 8-week period that preceded the trial which constituted the baseline, and the eight-week period of the trial itself. The total number of meals was used as a proxy to understand whether there were changes in footfall and overall meal selection in cafeterias during the intervention period. The proportion of meat-free dish sales was calculated for each day and each week for all participating worksite cafeterias for baseline and trial periods, which was the main outcome of interest.

Baseline meal sales

The catering company provided the research team with sales data for the 8-week period that preceded the intervention. Baseline meal sales were entered into all regression models as a control variable.

Worksite type

This was used as a proxy to estimate the socioeconomic status of the cafeteria customers, with offices assessed as having a larger concentration of higher SES customers and factories/manufacturing sites as having a larger concentration of lower SES customers. Worksites were classified as an office site if their main activities included financial, accounting, and customer services and telecommunications, and as a manufacturing site if they focused on production, processing, distribution, and storage of various goods.

### Powdered baby formula sold in north America: assessing the environmental impact [^111iZNW5]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 3.
Percent Composition of Each Major Nutrient Ingredient in North American Powder Formula Blends in Order of Percent Composition, Proportional CO₂ eq./kg and Total

We found that Special powdered formula was calculated to have the lowest amount of GHG emissions at 5.38 CO₂ eq./kg due to the composition of this formulation and the percentage of soy protein isolate. In Special formula, soy protein isolate and protein hydrolysates together are only 17.1% of the total recipe at an ingredient cost of 20.2 CO₂ eq./kg and 30 CO₂ eq./kg and with an ingredient environmental cost of 3.28 CO₂ eq./kg of the total 5.38 CO₂ eq./kg.

The formulations that have milk powder as a high percentage of the recipe constituents, in comparison, have a much higher environmental cost. In the Follow-On formula recipe, for example, skimmed milk powder is 73.4% of the composition at an ingredient cost of 12.64 CO₂ eq./kg resulting in that ingredient alone contributing 9.28 CO₂ eq./kg to the 9.56 total. Growing-Up powdered formula is similar, with skimmed milk powder of 74% as the total ingredient composition. The calculated cost to the environment of this one ingredient, 9.35 CO₂ eq./kg, is most of the 10.12 CO₂ eq./kg recipe total.

### Portion size can be used strategically to increase intake of vegetables and fruits in young children over multiple days: a cluster-randomized crossover trial [^116Qu9oU]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although dietary guidelines recommend that vegetables and fruits make up half the diet, it is unclear whether serving vegetables and fruits in larger portions will have sustained effects on children's intake over multiple days.

Objectives

This study tested the effects on children's intake of 2 strategies for increasing the proportion of vegetables and fruits: either adding or substituting extra portions as side dishes at meals and snacks over 5 d.

Methods

In a cluster-randomized crossover design with 3 periods, we provided all meals and snacks for 5 d to 53 children aged 3–5 y in classrooms in their childcare centers. In the Control condition, we served typical portions for all food groups. In the Addition condition we increased portions of low-energy-dense vegetables and fruits by 50%, and in the Substitution condition we increased portions of vegetables and fruits by 50% and also reduced portions of other foods by an equivalent weight.

Results

For vegetables, the Addition strategy increased daily intake compared with Control by 24% (mean ± SEM = 12 ± 3 g/d; P = 0.0002), and the Substitution strategy increased intake compared with Control by 41% (22 ± 3 g/d; P < 0.0001). For fruits, consumption increased by similar amounts: Addition by 33% (60 ± 6 g/d) and Substitution by 38% (69 ± 8 g/d; both P < 0.0001). Both strategies increased vegetable and fruit intakes compared with Control across all 5 days (all P < 0.004), although the increase in fruit consumption with Addition declined over time (P < 0.0001). Daily energy intake compared with Control increased by 5% with Addition (57 ± 17 kcal; P = 0.001) but decreased by 6% with Substitution (-64 ± 21 kcal; P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Both the Addition and Substitution strategies promoted increases in vegetable and fruit intake over 5 d in preschool children. When excess energy intake is a concern, substituting vegetables and fruits for other foods is a better option than simply serving more. This trial was registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03242863 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03242863), where the protocol is available.

### Will a programmatic framework integrating food is medicine achieve value on investment? [^114PsXjU]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Diet-related chronic diseases account for seven out of the ten leading causes of death in the USA. Food is Medicine (FIM) interventions can be effective adjuncts to standard medical care to address this cost burden. While the Food is Medicine Pyramid recommends some culinary skill development when integrating FIM into healthcare, the emphasis is on medically tailored meals and food provision. Hence, there is a practice gap to ensure patients develop the necessary skills to apply nutrition recommendations into improved food behaviors to achieve positive long-term health outcomes. This paper presents a theoretical framework for optimizing existing clinical services to provide FIM interventions, tracking associated improvements in patient outcomes, and identifying healthcare cost saving/revenue generation that can lead to a net value on investment. It describes how these interventions can and have been used in a clinical setting as adjuncts to clinical care. While there is published evidence for each modality individually, the literature lacks evidence of the value of an integrated approach. The framework therefore provides a roadmap to both identify best practices and evaluate outcomes that will inform viable financial models.

### A social return on investment analysis of a free meal program to support rural cancer patients and caregivers travelling for treatment [^113cKwGV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Meal acquisition behaviours prior to the free meal program

During the 8-week Baseline phase prior to the free meal program, surveys were completed by 178 (52%) of 344 lodge guests, including 105 cancer patients and 64 caregivers (n = 9 unknown). As shown in Online Resource 2, most guests (62%) purchased their first meal after arrival, with 23% bringing a meal from home, and 14% purchasing their meal during transit to the lodge. One guest received a free meal on arrival from another lodge guest. Of the 134 guests who purchased their meal during transit to the lodge or after arrival, meals were mostly sourced from casual dining establishments (35%), grocery stores (26%), fast food chains (18%), and nearby hospitals (14%). For those who purchased their meal after arrival (n = 109), meals were obtained via car (37%), Uber (13%), and taxi (13%) or delivered to the lodge (19%).

Uptake of the free meal program

During the 8-week Intervention phase, 222 (65%) of 344 lodge guests used their prepaid meal card, with an additional 88 meals purchased. The most popular meals selected from the vending machine were lasagna (21%), slow cooked lamb with vegetables (21%), beef brisket with vegetables (13%), spaghetti Bolognese (10%), green chicken curry (9%), and butter chicken (9%). Almost half of the guests who used their prepaid meal card completed an Intervention survey (n = 106; 48%), including 62 cancer patients and 36 caregivers (n = 8 unknown).

### Recent trends in energy and nutrient content of take-home food and beverage purchases in great britain: an analysis of 225 million food and beverage purchases over 6 years [^111KmdoH]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2019). High credibility.

Saturated fat

Although trends for fat and saturated fat are most likely to be affected by the exclusion of products such as desserts, bacon and sausages, we observed slight increases in purchases of saturated fat in both healthier and less healthy food groups. Despite a general decrease in energy and fat purchased from less healthy food groups, saturated fat content of purchases increased, which is mainly attributable to increases in purchases of cheese, chocolate and confectionery. The increase in saturated fat content of purchases from healthier food groups is mainly driven by red meat, and ready meals and convenience food. Noteworthy decrease in purchases of saturated fat from fat and oil products is also observed.

Other nutrients with fewer changes

Fat, sodium and fibre purchases displayed less clear time trends and changed modestly between 2012 and 2017 (figure 1). Heterogeneous changes across food groups were nonetheless observed for these nutrients so that some within food group changes were greater than the total changes (table 3). For the most part, the changes observed followed changes in energy purchased. Fat purchased mainly increased from fat and oil, and mainly decreased from cheese and savoury snacks; sodium mainly increased from bread products and fat and oil, and decreased from less healthy processed fish and meat, and cheese. Fibre content mainly decreased from bread products and increased from vegetables.

### Financial outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in California hospitals [^115yKUoB]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Our results focus on 2 forms of profitability: net operating income and net income. Net operating income is a component of net income and represents profit after total operating expense is deducted from total revenue, but before nonoperating income and expense is considered. Thus, we calculated net operating income as the total of inpatient, outpatient, and other operating revenue less expenses from patient care. After calculating net operating income, nonoperating revenues less expenses were subtracted to reach net income. These nonoperating revenues less nonoperating expenses included revenue from real estate rental income, rental and medical building expenses, unrestricted donations, governmental appropriations, housing expenses, retail operations expenses, and investment income. The data did not break out categories of this variable separately, but other research found that the largest category of nonoperating income less nonoperating expenses was investment income. For each hospital, we calculate operating margin by dividing net operating income by total revenue, and profit margin by dividing net income by total revenue.

Next, we subset our sample of 348 hospitals into 247 non-SNHs and 101 SNHs and analyzed the financial performance of them. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has traditionally used the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital index to define SNHs. Furthermore, the eligibility criteria for the PRF Safety Net Hospitals Targeted Distribution required hospitals to have a Medicare Disproportionate Patient Percentage of 20.2% or higher. We followed this definition and hospitals were classified as an SNH if Medicaid and indigent discharges as a percentage of total discharges were within the top quartile in 2019.

The first detected COVID-19 case in the US was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 21, 2020, and COVID-19 was declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020. Therefore, the 4 quarters of 2019 were considered pre–COVID-19 periods and all subsequent quarters were COVID-19 periods.

We calculated sample means and 95% CIs to compare groups. For primary analysis, statistical significance was not assessed. All dollar values were deflated to first quarter 2019 prices using the hospital price index. When statistical tests were performed, statistical significance was set at 2-sided P < .05. Data analyses were performed using Stata version 15.0 (Stata Corp).

### Opportunities and barriers for smaller portions in food service: lessons from marketing and behavioral economics [^1147Q8NC]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Elongate packages and servings of energy-dense items

If smaller default portions are used, they can be packaged and presented in such a way as to limit the extent to which they are noticed. Research by Chandon and Ordabayevahas shown that people are much more likely to notice downsizes when a package changes in only one dimension. In one experiment, the researchers first showed consumers a small serving of movie popcorn in a cube-shaped 24 oz bucket. When the bucket was enlarged in all three dimensions into a 110-oz cube, consumers estimated the volume to be only 54 oz. When, instead, the bucket was enlarged in only one dimension, into an elongated 110-oz box, consumers still underestimated the volume, but they were much closer, with an average estimate of 81 oz. Chandon and Ordabayeva conclude that less healthy products should be served in 'elongated' packages to give the perception of large size, without actually serving such large quantities. This is a fast-brain strategy because customers do not have to stop and reflect on a choice to take a smaller portion — fast and automatic brain processes lead them to perceive a smaller portion as being large enough. Accordingly, it can be effective with both eager and reluctant consumers.

This packaging change is a real opportunity, but it is not without revenue and cost barriers. In some cases, especially for take-out food, the elongating of the package may not preserve heat as well, or it may fit differently into bags, or visually customers may not be used to it. Research and development efforts could test these issues, but such efforts will not be costless.

For in-store dining, this elongation approach could work with smaller defaults. If Applebee's, for example, reduced its standard French fry portion, fewer people would presumably notice if they managed to plate the French fries in an elongated manner, thus reducing the possible revenue risk. Servers would have to be trained to serve fries in this manner, and they may need to be careful about how this is explained to guests, if guests ever asked. For operations where value erosion is a major concern in reducing portions, the costs of changing packaging or plating may be worth absorbing.

### What is the role of portion control in weight management? [^115NYxXf]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Does it matter when or how often PPFs are consumed or what they contain?

The European Food Safety Authority gives specific advice for the use of meal replacements and PPFs. Such products may contain a maximum of 250 kcal, and for weight loss two meals a day should be replaced while for weight loss maintenance one meal a day should be replaced. Such recommendations are based on the totality of the evidence rather than on studies designed to specifically optimize the effectiveness of portion-controlled meals. In particular, for PPFs it is not clear whether there is an optimal energy content or the number or type of meals that should be replaced.

Some commercial weight-loss programs start clients with PPFs across the entire day with the option of eating additional nutrient-rich, low-energy-dense foods, such as fruits and vegetables. Over time, clients transition to less frequent use, but they can continue to substitute PPFs for meals or snacks as desired. Although there are no known studies directly comparing different daily frequencies of consumption, PPFs have been shown to provide a useful tool if consumed twice a day or just at one meal. When PPFs consisting of frozen entrées were used twice a day, at lunch and dinner, they facilitated weight loss over 8 weeks. In another study, consumption of portion-controlled ready-to-eat breakfast cereal for breakfast and one other meal each day for 2 weeks was associated with reduced energy intake and improved weight loss compared with a group receiving no intervention. During an 8-week behavioral weight-loss intervention, the provision of a variety of portion-controlled foods just at breakfast reduced daily energy intake compared with non-portioned packages of the same foods but did not lead to greater weight loss. When subjects in a lab-based study chose a PPF for lunch, they ate around 250 kcal less each day than when they ate lunch from a buffet. This reduction was sustained over the 2-week intervention and led to greater weight loss. Thus substitution of one or two meals a day with PPFs can help people manage their energy intake. Although the ready availability, variety and convenience of PPFs makes them a useful tool to help consumers avoid the overconsumption associated with large portions, studies are needed to ascertain how to best incorporate them into diets to optimize their effectiveness.

### Estimating the potential of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages to reduce consumption and generate revenue [^111HHQ3N]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity. Our paper offers a method for estimating revenues from an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages that governments of various levels could direct towards obesity prevention.

Model

We construct a model projecting beverage consumption and tax revenues based on best available data on regional beverage consumption, historic trends and recent estimates of the price elasticity of sugar-sweetened beverage demand.

Results

The public health impact of beverage taxes could be substantial. An estimated 24% reduction in sugar-sweetened beverage consumption from a penny-per-ounce sugar-sweetened beverage tax could reduce daily per capita caloric intake from sugar-sweetened beverages from the current 190–200 cal to 145–150 cal, if there is no substitution to other caloric beverages or food. A national penny-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages could generate new tax revenue of $79 billion over 2010–2015.

Conclusion

A modest tax on sugar-sweetened beverages could both raise significant revenues and improve public health by reducing obesity. To the extent that at least some of the tax revenues get invested in obesity prevention programs, the public health benefits could be even more pronounced.

Pediatric obesity — dietary intake and snacking guidance emphasizes reducing snacking and overall calories, as the committee placed a high value on decreasing snacking and decreasing overall caloric intake to reduce weight gain among children and adolescents; frequent snacking is associated with a high intake of fat, sugar, and calories and with overweight, and measuring out single snack portions from multiserving packages and placing them in single-serving containers can significantly change the amount consumed. A meta-analysis suggests improved weight can be achieved regardless of macronutrient composition, and the WHO recommended that adults, children, and adolescents limit sugar to < 5% to 10% of total daily energy intake. Calorie reduction for weight loss or maintenance should be supervised by a dietician familiar with the energy needs of growing children and adolescents, and unbalanced hypocaloric diets may be deficient in essential vitamins and minerals.

Change default to smaller portion of less-healthy foods and add healthier ones

Another way to reduce the default sizes of less-healthy foods is to serve them with additional portions of complementary healthy items. For example, some restaurants offer customers French fries, salad, or half-and-half. Half-and-half could be made the new default at places like Applebee's. McDonald's has experimented with something similar in its Happy Meals, replacing its traditional small French fries with a small serving of French fries (100 calories) plus apple slices.

The advantages of this approach are that it allows customers to satisfy their craving for French fries while reducing energy intake, and not undermining value perception (because the smaller portion of fries is made up with something else). Still, risks remain.

If consumers do not like the virtue item (salad or apples) they may throw it out, not only leading to unnecessary waste, but also leading the customer to perceive a value loss. Even if they eat the virtue item, many consumers may not enjoy it very much, at least compared to the French fries, leading to reduced satisfaction. This tradeoff is one that many 'eager' health customers will like, but reluctant customers will be more resistant to. So the opportunity is biggest with chains that have a large eager segment.

The approach will not work for all menu categories. For example, it will not work straightforwardly for things that cannot be mixed or put on the same plate, like beverages. Still, beverages can be served in separate glasses or bottles. In addition, some blends may work better than previously thought. The Mushroom Council is now working with food operators to market a blended burger that is 60% beef and 40% mushroom. If something like that became the default, higher-calorie beef portions would effectively be reduced.

The main cost barrier in most of these mixed offerings is that in most cases it adds to product and operational costs. Generally, the operator will need more of the healthier items, which tend to be more expensive (although perhaps not in the case of beef versus mushrooms), and adding two items to a side dish instead of one involves operational costs in cooking, serving and communicating.

Still this is one of the best opportunities because it limits the major threat of value erosion. And operational innovation can reduce the cost of most complicated processes. The question is will any operators invest the research and development dollars to make this happen?

Financial risk protection

We used two measures of FRP. First, we used the catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) metric with disease-related expenditures exceeding 10% of total annual household expenditures and estimated the number of T2DM-related CHE cases avoided, with SSB tax introduction. Second, we used the number of poverty cases averted by estimating the number of cases avoiding their annual household income from dropping below the food poverty line (FPL) of ZAR321 or US$21 per capita per month (see online supplementary appendix table A3 for definition of the three SA poverty line measures and their values).

Change in additional tax revenues

We used own price elasticity estimates and SSB consumption at baseline to obtain the post-tax SSB consumption by income quintile. This new SSB consumption was then multiplied by the tax rate per litre to derive the additional tax revenue collected from each income quintile.

Indirect costs

Following the human capital approach, we estimated indirect costs capturing the loss of income due to morbidity associated with T2DM, due to absenteeism (working days lost due to illness) and presenteeism (reduced productivity at work due to illness). Absenteeism was calculated by multiplying the number of excess sick days in a year (about 8.6 days), by the number of diabetics in the labour force and the average daily wage by income quintile. Presenteeism was calculated by multiplying the productivity shortfall (0.6%)by the number of diabetics in the labour force and by the average annual wage.

Baseline characteristics and data sources

We obtained population estimates by age from Statistics South Africa. We calculated the share of each age population in each income quintile using wave 4 of the NIDS survey. We obtained age- and sex-specific population BMI and average height from the NIDS. SSB consumption was obtained from the All Media and Products Survey for 2013. The mean annual salary and labour force participation rates (LFPR) were estimated from the 2015 General Household Survey (GHS). The healthcare utilisation measure was constructed using the 2015 GHS.

### Recent trends in energy and nutrient content of take-home food and beverage purchases in great britain: an analysis of 225 million food and beverage purchases over 6 years [^1113vks6]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2019). High credibility.

Most of the increase in protein appears to be animal based, a type of protein associated with premature mortality. Whereas we observed a stable level of protein obtained from red meat, we did find an increase in the purchase of processed fish and meat (both from healthier and less healthy products), which are known cancer risk factors, a finding that goes against WHO recommendations of reducing processed meat consumption.

Reducing sugar consumption has been a strong policy focus since 2015. Excess sugar consumption, which is considered as a particular concern for children, led to introduction of media campaigns to make 'Sugar Swaps', a Soft Drinks Industry Levy, a voluntary reformulation programme for the industry and other initiatives of the Childhood Obesity Strategy. While the purpose of the paper is not to evaluate the effect of each of these initiatives, the trends observed do suggest that the concurrent, continuous drop in sugar purchases could, at least partly, be attributable to these efforts. The main sources of sugar from which we observe a decline as of 2015 were caloric sweeteners (including table sugar) (−18%), juices (−23%) and other less healthy drinks (−15%). One important source of energy and sugar where no change was observed was chocolate and confectionery. Reformulation of those products, therefore, appears to be a particularly important policy to further reduce sugar and energy consumption.

Impact of COVID-19 on U.S. coal plant retirements

We analyze the expected profitability from March 2020 to December 2022 of the 845 coal-fired electricity generation units operating in the seven unbundled power market regions in the United States. Ninety of the 845 coal-fired generation units, representing only 2.8 GW or 1.9% of coal generation capacity in the seven power market regions, were expected to be profitable prior to COVID-19 but are no longer expected to be profitable due to COVID-19-related reductions in electricity prices. We consider those 90 units to be at risk of early retirement due to COVID-19. The mean age and operating capacity of those 90 units are 59.1 years and 31.1 MW, respectively. The newest units were operational in November 2012 and the oldest unit was operational in July 1954. A single at-risk unit resides in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) market region, while the remaining units reside in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) market regions: 79 units in MISO Zone 6, nine units in MISO Zone 4, and one unit in MISO Zone 9.

Estimates of the impacts of COVID-19 on the monthly profitability of coal-fired electricity generation units in aggregate are illustrated in Fig. 4. Figure 4 a shows estimates in a counterfactual scenario in which COVID-19 had not occurred, and Fig. 4 b shows estimates in a scenario that reflects our current expectations. Squares represent monthly revenues, diamonds represent monthly costs, and the shaded areas represent monthly profits or losses. Coal generation units in total are $6.5 billion less profitable in the current expectations scenario relative to the counterfactual scenario over the entire period, in present value terms. Of that amount, coal generation units earn $4.5 billion less profit in the current expectations scenario in March through December 2020.

Working group 4: sustainability considerations postendoscopic procedures

Food and catering are responsible for approximately 6% of total emissions within the NHS. Approximately 2 million endoscopic procedures are performed in the UK per year, and most of these patients will be provided with a postendoscopy drink, generally served in a plastic or polystyrene cup, and a snack of biscuits or toast.

Single-use cups have similar environmental impacts regardless of the material from which they are made. If single-use cups are to be used, then paper has the lowest associated carbon footprint, and recycling halves the environmental impact by a further 40% to approximately 10 g CO₂ equivalent per cup. However, if 1 million paper cups were used by endoscopy units in the UK (a conservative estimate), this would still contribute 10 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in emissions.

While some analyses suggest that reusable cups are associated with a threefold reduction in GHG emissions compared with disposable, the comparative environmental impact benefit of institutional adoption of reusable cups over single use is dependent on a number of site-specific variables, including: energy mix, waste management strategy end-of-life technology used, recycling infrastructure and the efficiency of washing machines. However, if patients already own a reusable drinks bottle or cup, they could be encouraged to bring their own. This could be communicated in the patient information leaflet prior to the appointment. Some hospitals in the UK have already used this approach; it has not led to any complaints and, anecdotally, has allowed the endoscopy unit to run more efficiently.

The JAG advises that all patients undergoing endoscopic procedures are given written information explaining aftercare and follow-up arrangements in addition to a copy of the endoscopy report. Many will also be provided with relevant written information if they are given a new diagnosis. Patients usually leave the endoscopy unit with two pieces of A4 paper in addition to their report. Although paper consumption alone accounts for a relatively small proportion of the overall environmental impact of the healthcare system, a unit carrying out 12 000 procedures per year would use 24 000 sheets of paper for this purpose alone, which equates to 109 kg CO 2 equivalent. Digitising paper information leaflets would reduce endoscopy's environmental impact, reduce the need for storage space and may also be preferred by patients. The operational efficiency advantages of digitisation in this context have not been formally evaluated, nor is it yet clear which mode of digital information delivery has the highest level of acceptability with patients.

Conclusion

These findings provide new evidence of a positive association between the number of daily snacking occasions and OW/OB among US children aged 1 to 5 years, with most consistent associations seen among children < 2 years of age and when defining snacking based on all foods and beverages consumed between meals. These analyses are the first, to our knowledge, to specifically focus on children < 2 years of age for whom evidence‐based dietary guidance is critically needed (16). Additional research is needed to consider other facets of snacking that may influence OW/OB among young children, including the quality, timing, and portion sizes of snacks offered.

Educational Costs

Twelve studies, (32%) reported costs associated with implementing CPD interventions. For each study, we extracted 12 possible cost ingredients, (Table 2). The ingredients reported varied widely across studies. Three studies (5 interventions) reported only the total estimated educational cost without any mention of specific ingredients, and another 3 studies (4 interventions) reported some or all costs as a lump sum while delineating the ingredients that counted in that sum. The most commonly reported ingredient was the cost of course faculty (7 studies), whereas 6 counted postage and 5 included the cost of educational materials. Four studies reported specific costs for 5 ingredients or more, and 6 studies reported costs for 3 ingredients or more. No studies itemized costs for equipment. Data sources for educational costs were reported infrequently, with 3 studies, (25%) reporting details of ingredient quantification and 5 studies, (42%) reporting details of pricing.

Table 2.
Educational Costs of Physician Continuous Professional Development

Abbreviation: NA, not available (ingredient not mentioned in the study).

The mean ingredient cost per intervention varied widely, ranging from $58 897 for learner attendance (ie, compensated hourly or daily wage or estimated lost revenue; mean of 3 interventions) (all costs reported in 2021 US dollars) to $1022 for catering (mean of 2 interventions). The total reported educational cost likewise varied widely, ranging from $281 (a studythat analyzed only postage and paper and reached 36 physicians) to $183 554 (a studythat analyzed 6 ingredients, training 127 physicians), with a mean (SD) of $32 676 ($51 215) (median, $15 664; IQR, $5080-$29 290).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Alport syndrome, more specifically with respect to genetic testing, ERA/ERN ERKNet/ESPN 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that no targeted gene panel is 100% sensitive for the different types of genetic changes that can cause Alport syndrome, with well-designed gene panels achieving a sensitivity of over 85% for COL4A3/4/5 gene analysis in detecting pathogenic variants.
