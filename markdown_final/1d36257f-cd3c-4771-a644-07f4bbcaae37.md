## Question

Vitamin e and bone health

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) supplementation helps or harms bone health and how to counsel patients accordingly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic evidence in animals and cells. Then, I should review observational human data linking vitamin E intake or status with bone outcomes. Next, I will examine human biomarker studies for bone turnover. After that, I need to check for randomized or quasi-experimental interventional data. Finally, I will weigh potential benefits versus harms, consider guideline positions, and formulate a practical clinical recommendation with monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic signal, because that often clarifies biological plausibility before I infer from epidemiology. The most definitive preclinical evidence shows that alpha-tocopherol can stimulate osteoclast fusion via p38/MITF/DC-STAMP, increasing bone resorption; in mice, α-tocopherol supplementation reduced bone mass, whereas genetic α-tocopherol deficiency increased bone mass by decreasing resorption, establishing a causal link in that model [^113RFTFz]. Wait, let me verify whether this is antioxidant-dependent or not — the data indicate it is not, with signaling directly promoting osteoclast fusion independent of antioxidant activity, which matters for clinical translation [^113RFTFz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; newer work suggests a context-dependent effect. A recent high-credibility study shows vitamin E can mitigate ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice by inhibiting phospholipid peroxidation in osteoblasts, while the same dose slightly reduces BMD in normal mice, indicating dualistic effects in osteoporotic versus physiologic conditions, likely reflecting differential actions on osteoblasts and osteoclasts under stress versus homeostasis [^111ggsUS]. I should also note additional animal data where palm vitamin E or α-tocopherol improved bone parameters in ovariectomy or metabolic syndrome models, again suggesting potential benefit in pathological states, though species and model differences limit direct extrapolation to humans [^117KXDbr].

> Next, I should review observational human data. Several large cohorts associate lower α-tocopherol intake or serum levels with higher fracture risk, implying that deficiency may be detrimental, not that supplementation necessarily helps; the Swedish Mammography Cohort and ULSAM found higher hip and any-fracture rates with lower α-tocopherol intake or serum levels, and α-tocopherol–containing supplement use associated with fewer fractures, though this is vulnerable to confounding and reverse causation [^115TtnFW]. Let me double-check for contradictory signals; indeed, WHI did not find independent associations between antioxidant intake (including vitamin E) and BMD, underscoring the inconsistency of observational nutrition findings and the need for caution in inferring causality from diet–BMD links [^111WS1Eh]. But wait, what if I am overlooking something about dose or form? I need to ensure we distinguish dietary adequacy from pharmacologic supplementation when interpreting these associations [^112vnZwt].

> I will now examine human biomarker data to see if there is a consistent signal on bone turnover. NHANES analyses in postmenopausal women suggest higher serum γ-tocopherol is associated with higher bone formation marker BAP, whereas α-tocopherol supplementation suppresses γ-tocopherol and may uncouple turnover, raising a concern that α-tocopherol–only pills could blunt anabolic cues from γ-tocopherol without reducing resorption, which could theoretically worsen bone balance [^notfound]. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication — they explicitly hypothesize that γ-tocopherol may favor net formation over resorption, while α-tocopherol supplements could have negative effects on formation via suppression of γ-tocopherol, so the isomer ratio matters here [^117SycQh].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any randomized or quasi-experimental trials in humans directly test vitamin E for bone outcomes. I do not see robust RCTs of vitamin E supplementation with fracture or BMD endpoints; the available interventional signals are weak, indirect, or from mixed antioxidant regimens, and a systematic review of antioxidants in osteoarthritis found no meaningful benefit of vitamin E on pain or function, which, while not bone per se, tempers enthusiasm for supplementation claims [^1124P6vS]. Hmm, wait a minute, could I be missing a fracture RCT? Let me reconsider — none of the provided sources establish fracture or BMD benefits from vitamin E RCTs in humans, reinforcing that evidence is insufficient for recommending supplementation for bone health [^notfound].

> I need to balance potential benefits against harms and guideline positions. High-dose vitamin E supplements have been repeatedly discouraged for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and a meta-analysis linked higher-dose vitamin E with increased all-cause mortality, raising a general safety concern even outside bone endpoints, which further cautions against routine high-dose use without a clear indication [^1125rGJ4] [^116TDzWb] [^1128mA5B]. But wait, what about specific bone harms? The USPSTF notes a nonsignificant increased risk of hip fracture with vitamin A, and in observational analyses high retinol and vitamin E intakes correlated with greater femoral neck bone loss during the menopausal transition, although confounding by fatty acids is possible; nonetheless, this aligns with the mechanistic concern that excess α-tocopherol could stimulate resorption [^117Bq4m5] [^113iELfG]. I should confirm osteoporosis guideline stances — major guidelines do not recommend vitamin E for osteoporosis prevention or treatment, emphasizing calcium, vitamin D, exercise, and pharmacologic therapy when indicated, which indirectly supports a stance of no routine vitamin E supplementation for bone health [^115Wgg4G] [^115yaYpm].

> Let me synthesize a clinical interpretation, and I will double-check it against the totality of evidence. Mechanistically, α-tocopherol can promote osteoclast fusion and bone resorption, and in normal mice it lowers bone mass, while in osteoporotic models it may mitigate oxidative stress–driven bone loss, suggesting a dualistic, context-dependent effect that likely depends on baseline bone turnover, estrogen status, and oxidative stress milieu [^113RFTFz] [^111ggsUS]. In humans, deficiency of α-tocopherol associates with higher fracture risk, but there are no convincing RCTs showing that supplementation improves BMD or prevents fractures, and high-dose α-tocopherol may suppress γ-tocopherol and uncouple bone turnover unfavorably, so causality for benefit remains unproven while potential harms at pharmacologic doses exist [^115TtnFW] [^117SycQh] [^1128mA5B]. I should confirm consistency with broader supplement science — like many isolated antioxidants, vitamin E has not shown clear chronic disease benefits in well-nourished adults, reinforcing a food-first approach rather than pills for bone health [^111yF7Gk].

> Now, I will translate this into practical clinical counseling, but I need to ensure I do not overstate. For patients with normal vitamin E status, routine α-tocopherol supplementation should not be recommended for bone health; instead, emphasize dietary adequacy via nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, and green leafy vegetables, and correct identifiable deficiencies if present, especially in conditions of fat malabsorption or specific diseases where vitamin E deficiency is prevalent, such as cholestatic liver disease or after certain bariatric procedures [^114Mui9q] [^114BDogT]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating different bariatric procedures — yes, screening and targeted replacement are emphasized particularly for malabsorptive states and those with symptoms or high risk, rather than blanket supplementation for all [^114BDogT]. For patients with established osteoporosis, focus on evidence-based therapy (calcium, vitamin D to achieve sufficiency, weight-bearing and resistance exercise, fall-risk reduction, and pharmacologic treatment when indicated), and avoid high-dose α-tocopherol supplements that could theoretically stimulate resorption or suppress γ-tocopherol, pending stronger human data [^115Wgg4G] [^115yaYpm] [^117SycQh].

> I should double-check special populations and monitoring. In disorders with fat-soluble vitamin malabsorption (e.g., cystic fibrosis, PSC, post-bariatric states), vitamin E deficiency is more common and supplementation is appropriate when deficiency is documented, ideally under clinical supervision with attention to the broader bone-health regimen and potential interactions with other fat-soluble vitamins [^1169NJTc] [^114Mui9q] [^114BDogT]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline endorses vitamin E for bone outcomes — none do, reinforcing that replacement is for correction of deficiency, not for bone-specific benefit, and that routine high-dose use should be avoided absent a clear indication [^115Wgg4G] [^115yaYpm].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. The totality of evidence indicates that while vitamin E deficiency may be associated with higher fracture risk, there is no convincing evidence that α-tocopherol supplementation improves bone outcomes in humans, and mechanistic and translational data raise plausible concerns that pharmacologic α-tocopherol could promote bone resorption or unfavorably alter bone turnover, particularly in nondeficient individuals; therefore, prioritize dietary intake, correct deficiency when present, and avoid high-dose α-tocopherol supplements for the purpose of improving bone health until robust, dose-specific human trials demonstrate benefit and safety [^115TtnFW] [^113RFTFz] [^111ggsUS] [^1125rGJ4] [^115Wgg4G].

Vitamin E shows a **mixed and context-dependent** relationship with bone health. High-dose α-tocopherol supplements may increase fracture risk and reduce BMD by stimulating osteoclast fusion and bone resorption [^113RFTFz], whereas γ-tocopherol may promote bone formation and reduce resorption [^117SycQh]. Observational data link low vitamin E status to higher fracture risk [^115TtnFW], but **RCTs are lacking** to confirm benefit or harm. Routine vitamin E supplementation is not recommended for bone health; intake should remain within dietary guidelines, with caution regarding high-dose α-tocopherol, especially in older adults or those at fracture risk.

## Biological mechanisms of vitamin E in bone metabolism

Vitamin E comprises tocopherols and tocotrienols, with α- and γ-tocopherol most relevant to bone. α-Tocopherol is the **primary supplement form**, whereas γ-tocopherol is more abundant in the diet.

- **Antioxidant effects**: Vitamin E reduces oxidative stress, which can otherwise stimulate osteoclasts and increase bone resorption [^111ggsUS].

- **Osteoclast regulation**: α-Tocopherol can stimulate osteoclast fusion and activity via p38/MITF/DC-STAMP, increasing resorption [^113RFTFz].

- **Osteoblast effects**: γ-Tocopherol may enhance osteoblast differentiation and reduce resorption, suggesting an anabolic role [^notfound].

- **Inflammation modulation**: Vitamin E may reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) that promote bone loss [^116U6Cp1].

## Evidence from animal studies

Animal studies provide mechanistic insights but **translate cautiously** to humans.

| **Study** | **Model** | **Intervention** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fujita et al. (2012) | Mice | α-Tocopherol supplementation | Increased osteoclast fusion and bone loss [^113RFTFz] |
| Norazlina et al. (2007) | Ovariectomized rats | Palm vitamin E (γ-tocopherol) | Increased bone calcium and BMD [^notfound] |
| Wong et al. (2018) | Metabolic syndrome rats | Palm vitamin E | Improved bone density and reduced resorption [^117KXDbr] |

---

These data indicate α-tocopherol may harm bone, whereas γ-tocopherol may benefit it; however, **human confirmation is needed**.

---

## Evidence from human studies

Human data are observational and limited; **RCTs are lacking**.

- **Fracture risk**: Low α-tocopherol intake is associated with higher fracture risk in older adults [^115TtnFW].

- **Bone turnover**: Supplemental vitamin E may reduce bone resorption markers in postmenopausal women [^113qcYT2].

- **BMD**: No consistent association between vitamin E and BMD in large cohorts [^notfound].

- **Mendelian randomization**: Suggests nominal positive associations between vitamin E and heel BMD, but causality remains uncertain [^114KksqP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend** vitamin E supplementation for bone health. General advice is to meet intake from food and avoid high-dose supplements unless treating deficiency.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

High-dose α-tocopherol may increase fracture risk and all-cause mortality; it can also suppress γ-tocopherol, potentially offsetting anabolic effects [^1128mA5B] [^117SycQh]. Individuals on anticoagulants have an increased bleeding risk, and those with fat malabsorption may develop deficiency requiring monitored supplementation [^114BDogT].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Vitamin E has a **context-dependent** role: α-tocopherol may harm bone at high doses, whereas γ-tocopherol may benefit it. Given the absence of RCTs, routine supplementation for bone health is not advised; intake should remain within dietary guidelines, with caution regarding high-dose α-tocopherol, especially in older adults or those at fracture risk.

### Lack of a relation between vitamin and mineral antioxidants and bone mineral density: results from the women's health initiative [^111WS1Eh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Antioxidant defenses are one possible mechanism for decreasing oxidative damage and its potentially negative effects on age-related bone mass.

Objective

This study cross-sectionally examined whether higher dietary intakes, total intakes, and serum concentrations of antioxidants may be associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD).

Design

Total hip (and subregions), spine, and total-body BMDs were measured in 11,068 women aged 50–79 y enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study and Clinical Trial at 3 clinics. Antioxidant intakes from diet (vitamin A, retinol, beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium) were estimated by using a self-reported food-frequency questionnaire. Antioxidants from supplements were estimated with an interviewer-administered questionnaire. A random subset (n = 379) had serum concentrations of retinol, carotenoids, and tocopherols measured.

Results

After adjustment for important BMD-related covariates, increasing intakes of antioxidants were not independently associated with BMD. A significant interaction effect was observed between intake of total vitamin C (lower three-fourths compared with highest one-fourth) and use of hormone therapy (HT) (P < 0.01). The beneficial effect of current HT use on femoral neck BMD appeared to be greater in women with higher concentrations of total vitamin C. This interaction was also significant for total-body (P < 0.045), spine (P = 0.03), and total-hip BMDs (P = 0.029).

Conclusions

Our results do not support independent associations between dietary intake, total intake, or serum concentrations of antioxidants and BMD in women participating in the Women's Health Initiative. The extent to which HT use may interact with vitamin C intake and BMD warrants further exploration.

### Antioxidant vitamin supplements and markers of bone turnover in a community sample of nonsmoking women [^113qcYT2]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Whereas several epidemiological studies suggest that low dietary intake of vitamins C and E is linked to increased hip fracture in smokers and antioxidants (dietary and endogenous) are reduced in elderly osteoporotic women, none has demonstrated an effect of supplemental antioxidants on bone turnover.

Methods

In an observational study of 533 randomly selected women, we investigated the associations among the use of antioxidant supplements, vitamins C and E, serum levels of biochemical markers of bone turnover (C-telopeptide [CTx] and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BSAP]), and whole body bone mineral density (BMD).

Results

Twenty-two women were identified as current users of supplemental vitamin C or E. Duration of antioxidant supplement use was negatively associated with age-adjusted and weight-adjusted serum CTx, such that mean CTx levels (natural log transformed) were 0.022 units lower for each year of exposure. No significant differences were detected for adjusted serum BSAP or whole body BMD.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that antioxidant vitamin E or C supplements may suppress bone resorption in nonsmoking postmenopausal women. Coupling of bone formation and resorption may explain the absence of an effect on bone formation markers, given evidence of enhanced effects of antioxidants on osteoblast differentiation; this warrants further investigation. This work adds to the growing body of evidence that antioxidants may play a role in preventing osteoporosis.

### Effects of vitamin E on bone turnover markers among US postmenopausal women [^117SycQh]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2012). Low credibility.

Increased oxidative stress and inflammation resulting from aging and declining estrogen levels can lead to increased bone loss in postmenopausal women. Alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol, the two predominant isomers of vitamin E, have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, but their effects on bone metabolism have not been well studied in humans. We examined the associations between dietary and total (diet and supplements) alpha-tocopherol intake, serum alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol levels and their ratio, and bone turnover markers (BTMs) among postmenopausal women aged ≥ 45 years. We used cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2002. Multiple regression models with adjustments for relevant confounders were used to examine the associations between intake and serum levels of tocopherols, and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), a biomarker of bone formation, and urinary N-telopeptides/creatinine (uNTx/Cr), a biomarker of bone resorption. The study sample included 497 postmenopausal women who were not taking estrogen, steroids, or osteoporosis medications, were free from kidney and liver disease, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis, and were fasting > 9 hours prior to examination. Participants had a mean age of 65.5 ± 0.6 years and over 45% used vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) supplements in the past month. Vitamin E supplement users had significantly lower serum gamma-tocopherol, higher serum alpha-tocopherol levels, and higher ratio of serum alpha-tocopherol to gamma-tocopherol than nonusers. High serum gamma-tocopherol levels and low ratio of serum alpha-tocopherol to gamma-tocopherol were associated with increased BAP levels (p < 0.01 for both). There were no associations between any of the vitamin E variables and uNTx/Cr. In conclusion, we hypothesize that gamma-tocopherol may uncouple bone turnover, resulting in more bone formation than resorption. Vitamin E supplements in the form of alpha-tocopherol suppress serum gamma-tocopherol levels and may have negative effects on bone formation. Further research is needed to investigate the potential anabolic effect of gamma-tocopherol from food sources on bone.

### What is the evidence for a role for diet and nutrition in osteoarthritis? [^116GzZT7]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Antioxidants and OA

A plausible rationale exists for a role of antioxidants in OA; reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species may be involved in the pathophysiology of OA, and therefore suppressing these with antioxidants might delay its onset and progression. The antioxidant vitamins, A, C and E have received the most attention in this context with vitamin C being particularly relevant owing to its requirement for collagen formation.

Human studies on antioxidants and OA

Trials so far have primarily focused on the effects of vitamin E in OA. A systematic review of trials has investigated all three nutrients, although seven of the nine studies included were vitamin E trials. Findings were conflicting, with only two short-term trials suggesting a beneficial effect of vitamin E. Though vitamin C supplementation appeared to reduce OA pain, that effect has not been reproduced in other trials. A later trial of vitamin E supplementation (200 mg/day) in knee OA found a significant benefit on pain and significantly increased levels of circulating antioxidant enzymes. No study to date has solely investigated vitamin A supplementation in OA, though when combined (as β-carotene) with vitamins C, E and selenium, no effect was seen. Unfortunately, most of these studies were of poor quality with variations in duration, sample size, measurement outcomes, supplement dosage and form.

Conclusions on antioxidant vitamins

At present, there are insufficient data to show benefit from antioxidant supplementation in OA. However, for general health, patients should be encouraged to eat a healthy diet that includes adequate amounts of dietary antioxidants (see recommendations in Table 3).

Vitamin D and OA

Although vitamin D has many biological roles, its primary function is thought to be the regulation of bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis. The majority of its activity occurs via the vitamin D receptors (VDRs), a subfamily of nuclear receptors that regulate gene expression, to which it binds with high affinity.

Postulated role of vitamin D in OA

Acting through the VDR, vitamin D has a major role in the regulation of mineral homeostasis and bone metabolism. Thus, inadequate vitamin D status is thought to impair the ability of bone to respond to the pathophysiological process of OA and influence disease progression. Vitamin D is also believed to have effects on inflammation and cytokine synthesis. Furthermore, a number of trials have shown that vitamin D supplementation has positive effects on muscle strength; this may be beneficial in OA, which is often associated with marked weakness of the quadriceps muscles.

### Relationship between serum nutritional factors and bone mineral density: a mendelian randomization study [^114KksqP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Multiple risk factors have been implicated in the development of osteoporosis. This study examined potential associations between serum nutritional factors and bone mineral density (BMD).

Methods

Six nutritional factors were selected as exposures. Outcomes included total body BMD (n = 66 945); BMD at the forearm (FA), femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) (n = 8143, n = 32 735, and n = 28 498, respectively); estimated heel BMD (HL eBMD) (n = 394 929); and HL eBMD stratified by sex (n = 206 496). A 2-sample Mendelian randomization approach was adopted to estimate the association between serum nutritional factors and BMD. The threshold for adjusted P value was 1.39×10⁻³.

Results

Serum calcium levels were inversely associated with LS BMD (effect = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.86 to -0.24; P = 0.001), whereas serum selenium levels were positively correlated with HL eBMD (effect = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.33; P = 1.70×10⁻⁴). Regarding nominal significance, there was a positive association between serum selenium levels and FA BMD. Nominally significant results were also obtained for serum retinol as well as vitamin E levels and HL eBMD. Moreover, sex-specific effects of serum retinol and vitamin E levels on BMD were observed in men.

Conclusion

Serum calcium and selenium levels influence BMD at specific skeletal sites. This implies that these nutritional factors play crucial roles in bone metabolism.

### Is vitamin supplementation appropriate in the healthy old? [^115KzJbf]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vitamin supplements are used by large numbers of older adults. Although vitamins serve several functions in the body, the benefits or harm of routine supplementation are far from clear. Data from studies over the last decade are reviewed to enable an understanding.

Recent Findings

Summarized data from studies conducted over the last few years, pertinent to the use of vitamins, as multivitamin combinations and as individual vitamins specifically A, D, E, C, and the B group, are presented. This review targets the benefits and harm of multivitamins when used to lower the risk of cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, visual disorders (e.g., cataracts and age-related macular degeneration), and bone disease. The effects of vitamins on total mortality are discussed. In addition, isolated or multiple vitamin deficiencies, their predisposing settings and manifestations from mild-to-life-threatening illness are discussed.

Summary

Data from studies demonstrate considerable variations, most confirming little to no benefit following supplementation in healthy adults. However, clear roles exist for vitamin supplementation in states of deficiency and in subgroups of older adults at high risk for deficiency of specific or multiple vitamins. In these settings, vitamin supplements help prevent or correct deficiency and related manifestations.

### Vitamin C epigenetically controls osteogenesis and bone mineralization [^112sCtru]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Bone fractures due to low bone mass are a serious health concern and pose a significant burden on health care systems. In the United States, almost half (43.1%) of all adults aged 50+ years suffered from low bone mass at the femur neck, lumbar spine or both in 2017–2018. This translates to an estimated 10.2 million people aged 50 and over that were affected by the bone degenerative disease osteoporosis and ∼43.3 million additional people with low bone density (osteopenia) in 2010. These individuals are at risk for bone fractures. While this interconnection of low bone mass and successive fracture risks has been well-established, the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in 50+ year-olds did not improve since 2007/2008 in the United States. Comprehensively understanding bone homeostasis and its deterioration on a physiological and molecular-mechanistic level will be critical to help sustain bone health and counteract bone-debilitating conditions.

### Foods and new foods: the role of nutrition in skeletal health [^1153cDex]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Goals

The objective of this paper was to present nutrients for bone health along with traditional foods and new foods that can provide the adequate amount of such nutrients.

Background

Although bone mass and density are certainly determined by various concurrent factors such as genetics, hormones, physical activity, and nutrition, and although the genetic program has a critical role in growth and in bone peak development, for their realization an adequate nutritional intake of nutrients is always necessary and may represent a way to prevent bone diseases.

Methods

The authors collected scientific data about new possible foods containing potential nutrients for bone health besides milk, dairy products, and supplementation in tablets.

Results

There is much scientific evidence that calcium-rich mineral water, functional foods, soy products derived phytoestrogens, fortified foods, and vitamins K and E may play a important nutritional role in skeletal health.

Conclusion

Currently, it is possible to provide required bone nutrient intake for bone health in population subgroups intolerant or allergic to lactose and in those individuals who need a controlled intake of calories.

### Vitamin E decreases bone mass by stimulating osteoclast fusion [^113RFTFz]. Nature Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Bone homeostasis is maintained by the balance between osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells that are formed by mononuclear preosteoclast fusion. Fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin D are pivotal in maintaining skeletal integrity. However, the role of vitamin E in bone remodeling is unknown. Here, we show that mice deficient in α-tocopherol transfer protein (Ttpa(-/-) mice), a mouse model of genetic vitamin E deficiency, have high bone mass as a result of a decrease in bone resorption. Cell-based assays indicated that α-tocopherol stimulated osteoclast fusion, independent of its antioxidant capacity, by inducing the expression of dendritic-cell-specific transmembrane protein, an essential molecule for osteoclast fusion, through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (p38) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, as well as its direct recruitment to the Tm7sf4 (a gene encoding DC-STAMP) promoter. Indeed, the bone abnormality seen in Ttpa(-/-) mice was rescued by a Tm7sf4 transgene. Moreover, wild-type mice or rats fed an α-tocopherol-supplemented diet, which contains a comparable amount of α-tocopherol to supplements consumed by many people, lost bone mass. These results show that serum vitamin E is a determinant of bone mass through its regulation of osteoclast fusion.

### Vitamin K1 intake is associated with higher bone mineral density and reduced bone resorption in early postmenopausal Scottish women: no evidence of gene-nutrient interaction with apolipoprotein E polymorphisms [^111AiBf4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene are associated with fracture risk, and a potential mechanism is through vitamin K transport.

Objective

We investigated the relation between dietary vitamin K(1) intake, APOE polymorphisms, and markers of bone health.

Design

We measured bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) in a cohort of Scottish women aged 49–54 y in 1990–1994 (baseline) and in 1997–2000 (visit 2). At visit 2, bone markers (urinary pyridinoline crosslinks and serum N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen) were measured, 3199 women completed a food-frequency questionnaire, and 2721 women were genotyped for APOE.

Results

Compared with quartile 3 (Q3) of energy-adjusted vitamin K(1) intake (mean: 116 microg/d), women in the lowest quartile (mean: 59 microg/d) had lower BMD (analysis of variance; FN, Q1: 0.831 ± 0.122 g/cm²; Q3: 0.850 ± 0.126 g/cm²; P < 0.001; LS, Q1: 1.000 ± 0.170 g/cm²; Q3: 1.020 ± 0.172 g/cm²; P = 0.009), remaining significant at the FN after adjustment for age, weight, height, menopausal status or use of hormone replacement therapy, socioeconomic status, and physical activity (P = 0.04). Vitamin K(1) intake was associated with reduced concentrations of pyridinoline crosslinks (Q1: 5.4 ± 2.0 nmol/mmol; Q4: 5.1 ± 1.9 nmol/mmol; P = 0.003). Carriers of the E2 allele had greater LS BMD at visit 2 and lost less BMD than did carriers of the E4 allele (E2: -0.50 ± 1.22%/y; E4: -0.71 ± 1.17%/y; P = 0.05). After adjustment for confounders, the P value for BMD loss (0.03 for LS and 0.04 for FN) did not reach the level of significance required for multiple testing (P = 0.012). No interaction was observed between dietary vitamin K and APOE on BMD.

Conclusions

Vitamin K(1) intake was associated with markers of bone health, but no interaction was observed with APOE alleles on BMD or markers of bone turnover.

### Effect of vitamin A on fracture risk [^117Pahbj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe current data evaluating the effect of vitamin A intake on fracture risk.

Data Sources

A literature search using MEDLINE (1966-March 2005) was conducted using the search terms bone density, fractures, osteoporosis, retinol, and vitamin A to identify published studies evaluating the effects of vitamin A on bone.

Data Synthesis

Studies evaluating vitamin A consumption and fracture risk were reviewed. Current data suggest a potential inverse relationship between excess vitamin A consumption and bone mineral density leading to an increased risk for fracture.

Conclusions

Although current data are limited, consumption of large amounts of vitamin A may be associated with decreased bone mineral density and increased fracture risk. Until further information is available, patients should be made aware of the potential risks of consuming vitamin A in amounts that exceed the recommended dietary allowance. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between vitamin A and fracture risk.

### Association of high intakes of vitamins B6 and B12 from food and supplements with risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women in the nurses' health study [^1123rkNz]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Implications

The RDAs are established to meet the nutritional requirements of almost the entire population. Despite that, use of high-dose vitamin supplementation far exceeding the RDAs is common, often without any definite indication and in the absence of clear evidence of benefit.

Our results are in line with several reports suggesting that unexpected adverse effects can occur with high-dose vitamin supplementation. For example, high-dose beta-carotene supplementation increased the risk of lung cancer in smokers, and high-dose vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause mortality. Higher risk of fracture was reported in 2 RCTs, after treatment with annual megadoses of vitamin D, and possible adverse effects of homocysteine-lowering treatment with B vitamins have been observed, including a potentially increased risk of cancer. Although we acknowledge the limitations of our cohort design, the findings herein add to the body of literature that suggests caution should be used in vitamin supplementation when there is no apparent deficiency.

### Association between dietary intake of antioxidants and prevalence of femoral head cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions in community-based adults [^111ipMbL]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Although there is evidence for a beneficial effect of dietary antioxidants on knee joint health, the data are sparse for the hip. Our aim was to examine the relationship between dietary antioxidants and early hip structural abnormalities in community-based adults.

Methods

The study included 214 participants without diagnosed hip osteoarthritis (OA) who underwent hip magnetic resonance imaging in 2009–2010. The prevalence of femoral head cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions (BML) was assessed. Intakes of antioxidant vitamins and their food sources were estimated from a food frequency questionnaire during 1990–1994.

Results

Higher intakes of Vitamin E (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41–0.96), lutein/zeaxanthin (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34–0.99), and lycopene (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44–0.95) were associated with a reduced prevalence of femoral head cartilage defects. Higher intakes of α-carotene (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19–0.94), β-carotene (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13–0.78), and lutein/zeaxanthin (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18–0.98) were associated with a reduced prevalence of femoral head BML. Higher vegetable consumption was associated with a reduced prevalence of femoral head cartilage defects (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46–0.91) and BML (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37–0.97).

Conclusion

Higher carotenoids intake and vegetable consumption were associated with reduced risk of hip cartilage defects and BML, and higher Vitamin E intake was associated with reduced risk of hip cartilage defects. These findings suggest a beneficial effect of dietary antioxidants on hip joint health. Although our findings need to be confirmed in other longitudinal studies, they suggest that the modification of dietary antioxidant intake may be a strategy for the prevention of hip OA.

### Skeletal health of children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease [^117WmBdq]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Medium credibility.

Gaps in knowledge — Key unanswered questions include whether there is a relation between bone health and vitamin D status in children with IBD, what vitamin D level benefits bone health based on large clinical trials, whether exclusive enteral nutrition and enteral supplementation benefit bone health, which exercise regimen(s) would prevent compromise and improve bone health, whether changing the therapeutic approach (e.g., early introduction of biologics vs conventional therapy vs enteral nutrition or supplementation) would be beneficial and which approach would be most beneficial, and whether "bone-active" medications such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates have a role and who would benefit.

### Vitamin a metabolism, action, and role in skeletal homeostasis [^111PYMBX]. Endocrine Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin A (retinol) is ingested as either retinyl esters or carotenoids and metabolized to active compounds such as 11-cis-retinal, which is important for vision, and all-trans-retinoic acid, which is the primary mediator of biological actions of vitamin A. All-trans-retinoic acid binds to retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which heterodimerize with retinoid X receptors. RAR-retinoid X receptor heterodimers function as transcription factors, binding RAR-responsive elements in promoters of different genes. Numerous cellular functions, including bone cell functions, are mediated by vitamin A; however, it has long been recognized that increased levels of vitamin A can have deleterious effects on bone, resulting in increased skeletal fragility. Bone mass is dependent on the balance between bone resorption and bone formation. A decrease in bone mass may be caused by either an excess of resorption or decreased bone formation. Early studies indicated that the primary skeletal effect of vitamin A was to increase bone resorption, but later studies have shown that vitamin A can not only stimulate the formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts but also inhibit their formation. Effects of vitamin A on bone formation have not been studied in as great a detail and are not as well characterized as effects on bone resorption. Several epidemiological studies have shown an association between vitamin A, decreased bone mass, and osteoporotic fractures, but the data are not conclusive because other studies have found no associations, and some studies have suggested that vitamin A primarily promotes skeletal health. In this presentation, we have summarized how vitamin A is absorbed and metabolized and how it functions intracellularly. Vitamin A deficiency and excess are introduced, and detailed descriptions of clinical and preclinical studies of the effects of vitamin A on the skeleton are presented.

### Comparison of three weight maintenance programs on cardiovascular risk, bone and vitamins in sedentary older adults [^115QSDkU]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Obese patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) are encouraged to lose weight to obtain symptomatic relief. Risk of vascular events is higher in people with OA compared to people without arthritis. Our aim in this randomized trial was to compare changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk-factors, nutritional health, and body composition after 1-year weight-loss maintenance achieved by [D]diet, [E]knee-exercise, or [C]control, following weight loss by low-energy-diet.

Design and Methods

Obese individuals (n = 192, > 50 years) with knee OA, 63 years (SD 6), weight 103.2 kg (15.0), body-mass index 37.3 kg/m² (4.8), were enrolled into a 68-week weight-loss trial.

Results

Mean changes in weight, in D, E, and C were -11.0, -6.3, and -8.3 kg (P = 0.002). Reduction in waist circumference in D, E, and C were -8.4, -4.6, and -7.0 cm (P = 0.007). D reduced waist circumference significantly more than E: -3.8 cm (95%CI -6.2 to -1.4; P = 0.0024). There was no difference between the groups in changes in CVD risk factors; blood pressure, triglycerides, and cholesterol. Nutritional health was improved in all groups. For markers of bone, no statistical difference was found between the groups.

Conclusions

Dietary support, or control, maintained improvements in cardiovascular risk factors to the same extent and none of the interventions had a detrimental effect on bone.

### Does higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels will harm bone mineral density? a cross-sectional study [^115unkJk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D is integral to maintaining bone health and calcium homeostasis. Vitamin D, in its active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in various tissues, facilitating calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestines and promoting bone mineralization. It also regulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, essential for calcium balance. Insufficiency of vitamin D results in diminished calcium absorption, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and heightened bone resorption, potentially leading to compromised bone integrity and an increased susceptibility to osteoporosis and fractures. Bone mineral density (BMD) is recognized as the most important predictor of osteoporosis, and fracture is the ultimate manifestation. Epidemiologic studies have shown that a 10% increase in PBM at the population level reduces the risk of fracture later in life by 50%.

However, observational studies have yielded varying conclusions regarding the relationship between vitamin D levels and bone mineral density (BMD). Some studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent fractures or falls nor has a clinically meaningful effect on bone mineral density. The discussion persists regarding the optimal levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D necessary for achieving the highest possible skeletal health outcomes. Indeed, there does not appear to be a causal relationship between higher 25(OH)D concentrations and higher BMD in the general healthy population. Furthermore, a weak relationship between serum 25(OH)D and bone microarchitecture was observed in a population with a mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level as high as 137 nmol/L.

This inconsistency in findings highlights the complexity of the relationship between vitamin D and bone health. It suggests the possibility of a U-shaped association, where both low and high levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be associated with adverse bone health outcomes. Such a pattern would imply an optimal range for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, within which bone mineral density is maximized, and deviations on either side could lead to reduced bone health. This study aims to clarify these relationships by examining a large, nationally representative sample of adults in the US, using data from NHANES collected between 2011 and 2018.

### Nitrogen-bisphosphonate therapy is linked to compromised coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E status in postmenopausal women [^113sakwG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nitrogen-bisphosphonates (N-BPs) are the most widely used drugs for bone fragility disorders. Long-term or high-dose N-BP use is associated with unusual serious side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, musculoskeletal pain, and atypical fractures of long bones. It has escaped notice that the pathway N-BPs block is central for the endogenous synthesis of coenzyme Q10, an integral enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and an important lipid-soluble antioxidant. Our objective was to assess the coenzyme Q10 and antioxidant status in relation to N-BP exposure in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Methods

Seventy-one postmenopausal women (age, 73.5 ± 5.5 y) with osteoporosis and no other malignancy were included in this cross-sectional study. Seventeen were treatment naive, 27 were on oral N-BP, and 27 were on i.v. N-BP.

Results

Vitamin E γ-tocopherol levels (μmol/mL) were significantly reduced in N-BP users [oral, H(2) = 18.5, P = 0.02; i.v. H(2) = 25.2, P < .001; mean rank comparisons after Kruskal-Wallis test). Length of time (days) of N-BP exposure, but not age, was inversely associated with the coenzyme Q10/cholesterol ratio (μmol/mol) (β = -0.27; p = 0.025), which was particularly low for those on i.v. N-BP (mean difference = -35.0 ± 16.9; 95% confidence interval, -65.2 to -4.9; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

The degree of N-BP exposure appears related to compromised coenzyme Q10 status and vitamin E γ-tocopherol levels in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. This phenomenon may link to certain adverse N-BP-associated effects. Confirmation of this would suggest that therapeutic supplementation could prevent or reverse certain complications of long-term N-BP therapy for at-risk individuals.

### Vitamin C epigenetically controls osteogenesis and bone mineralization [^111XjJYn]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

One vital component for maintaining bone health is a sustained and adequate dietary intake of micronutrients including vitamins A, C, and D3 (retinoic acid, ascorbate/L-hexuronic acid, and 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, respectively) –. Vitamin C (VitC) is produced from glucose via the enzyme L-gulono-lactone oxidase (GULO) in mice and other mammals. However, the human GULOP gene is non-functional and human health depends on dietary VitC supply. Severe VitC deficiency leads to scurvy, a serious disease characterized by critical deterioration of connective tissues accompanied by dermal, vascular and skeletal symptoms including tooth loss, skeletal fragility and bone fractures –. Although scurvy is at present considered a relatively rare nutritional disorder, clinically confirmed cases continue to be reported globally including in Western countries –. Further, VitC deficiency remains clinically relevant in many diverse, global settings including pediatric health care, in individuals who are institutionalized (e.g. boarding school children, elderly people, priests or prisoners). exposed to environmental pollution or tobacco smoke –, or are part of socio-economic groups with unbalanced food diets. Of note, patients with increased bone fracture risk suffer from VitC deficiency. In turn, lower VitC intake correlates with increased risk for hip and osteoporotic fractures. Also, higher dietary VitC uptake positively correlates with bone mineral density (BMD) and reduced fracture risk –. Importantly, post-menopausal women on estrogen replacement therapy who received VitC supplementation had augmented BMD compared to estrogen only recepients, suggesting that VitC elicits pro-osteogenic functions that are distinct from the actions of estrogen during bone loss conditions.

### Nutritional associations with bone loss during the menopausal transition: evidence of a beneficial effect of calcium, alcohol, and fruit and vegetable nutrients and of a detrimental effect of fatty acids [^113iELfG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The menopausal transition is characterized by rapid bone loss. Few data exist on the role of nutrition.

Objective

The objective of the study was to ascertain which dietary factors influence perimenopausal skeletal loss.

Design

A longitudinal study was conducted of 891 women aged 45–55 y at baseline and 50–59 y at follow-up 5–7 y later. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN). Nutrient intakes were assessed after the baseline visit and 5 y later, by using the same food-frequency questionnaire.

Results

After adjustment for energy intake and other confounders, higher intakes of calcium were correlated with change in FN BMD (ie, reduced loss) (r = 0.073, P < 0.05), and the intake of modest amounts of alcohol was associated with less lumbar spine bone loss (P < 0.01 for quartile of alcohol intake). Greater FN BMD loss was associated with increased intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = -0.110, P < 0.01), monounsaturated fatty acids (r = -0.069, P < 0.05), retinol (r = -0.067; P < 0.05), and vitamin E (r = -0.110; P < 0.01). The latter 2 nutrients were highly correlated with polyunsaturated fatty acids. For premenopausal women, calcium and nutrients found in fruit and vegetables (vitamin C, magnesium, and potassium) were associated with FN BMD, and calcium, vitamin C, and magnesium were associated with change in FN BMD.

Conclusions

Although menopausal status and hormone replacement therapy use dominate women's bone health, diet may influence early postmenopausal bone loss. Fruit and vegetable intake may protect against premenopausal bone loss.

### Vitamin A intake and osteoporosis: a clinical review [^112T3ZK9]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Background

If osteoporosis is linked with vitamin A (Vit A) A consumption, millions of people could be affected.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed with keywords retinol, beta-carotene, and osteoporosis.

Results

Of 20 clinical studies, 3 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 14 were observational studies, and 3 were case reports. Most (8) observational studies were cross-sectional. Oral retinoyl palmitate (RP) in high doses induces fractures and radiographic osteoporosis in animals. Retinol intake from diet or supplements is negatively associated with lumbar, femoral neck, and trochanter bone mineral density (BMD). There is a graded increase in relative risk of hip fracture with increasing retinol intake, attributable primarily to retinol (either from diet or supplements) but not beta-carotene intake. Higher serum retinol levels are associated with higher risk of any fracture and with higher risk of hip fracture, whereas there is no evidence of harm associated with beta-carotene intake. The few RCTs involve serum markers of bone metabolism, not bone density or fracture outcomes. Observational studies are generally consistent in finding harm from either dietary or supplemental retinol intake on BMD and hip fracture risk. Total Vit A intake is more important than source in determining harm. Adverse effects may occur at a level of retinol intake that is only about twice the current recommendation for adult females.

Conclusions

It is not yet possible to set a specific level of retinol intake above which bone health is compromised. Pending further investigation, Vit A supplements should not be used with the express goal of improving bone health.

### The health benefits of vitamin K [^114vjB96]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin K and bone health

Osteoporosis is a leading contributor of fractures worldwide, causing more than 8.9 million fractures annually. Moreover, Osteoporosis affects an estimated 200 million women worldwide (approximately 1/10th of women aged 60, 1/5th of women aged 70, 2/5ths of women aged 80, and 2/3rds of women aged 90). One in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over 50 will experience an osteoporotic fracture. Additionally, 61% of all osteoporotic fractures occur in women. It has been predicted that the incidence of hip fracture is expected to increase by 310% in men and 240% in women by 2050; thus, the economic toll of osteoporosis is expected to significantly increase. Indeed, it has been estimated that there is a 40% lifetime risk for fractures affecting the hip, forearm and vertebrae (similar to the risk for cardiovascular disease), with nearly 75% of these types of fractures occurring in patients aged 65 years age and above. Osteoporosis has been shown to account for more days spent in the hospital than diabetes, heart attacks or breast cancer. It is also a major cause of disability, which has been shown to be greater than that caused by cancer (except lung cancer) and comparable to or greater than disability from rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and high blood pressure related heart disease. The overall mortality within the first 12 months after a hip fracture is approximately 20%, being higher in men than women. Moreover, men make up 20–25% of all hip fractures, and have an estimated 30% lifetime risk of experiencing an osteoporotic fracture when over 50, similar to the lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer. Fragility fractures are the primary cause of hospitalisation and/or death for US adults ≥ age 65 and above. Furthermore, 44% of nursing home admissions are due to fractures. It is obvious that osteoporosis is extremely common and this condition leads to disability, costs and even death. Thus, preventing and treating this disease is of utmost importance. However, the recently updated USA Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recently stated that there is insufficient evidence that calcium and vitamin D prevent a fracture in premenopausal women or in men who have not experienced a fracture and now recommends against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D3 and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in non-institutionalised postmenopausal women. Thus, unless you are an institutionalised postmenopausal woman or you have already experienced a fracture, the USPSTF does not recommend calcium and vitamin D for preventing a first-time fracture, as there is a lack of evidence. The USPSTF also states that "Daily supplementation with ≤ 400 IU of vitamin D3 and ≤ 1000 mg of calcium has no net benefit for the primary prevention of fractures" and that "Evidence is lacking regarding the benefit of daily supplementation with > 400 IU of vitamin D3 and > 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined". Thus, what else can a clinician prescribe to help to prevent osteoporosis and its consequences? A broad amount of data seems to indicate substantial potential for supplementary vitamin K. However, currently few guidelines recommend vitamin K therapy for prevention or treatment of osteoporosis.

### Marked decrease in plasma antioxidants in aged osteoporotic women: results of a cross-sectional study [^111wn6uD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Although recent epidemiological studies found a positive correlation between dietary vitamin C intake and bone mineral density, data on plasma levels of vitamin C or other antioxidants in osteoporotic subjects are scanty. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether antioxidant defenses are decreased in elderly osteoporotic women and, if this is the case, to understand whether osteoporosis is a condition characterized by increased oxidative stress. To answer these questions, plasma vitamins C, E, and A; uric acid; and the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase in plasma and erythrocytes and of glutathione peroxidase in plasma were measured in 75 subjects with osteoporosis and 75 controls. Dietary and endogenous antioxidants were consistently lower in osteoporotic than in control subjects. On the other hand, plasma levels of malondialdehyde, a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, did not differ between groups. Our results reveal that antioxidant defenses are markedly decreased in osteoporotic women. The mechanisms underlying antioxidant depletion and its relevance to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis deserve further investigation.

### Exploring the unique association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and vitamin D deficiency in adults aged 20–59: findings based on the NHANES database [^112cTDfT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the relationship between HDL-C and vitamin D could yield novel insights into their collective impact on public health, particularly in preventing cardiovascular diseases and promoting bone health. Additionally, gender differences may play a significant role in this relationship. Differences in hormone levels, metabolic characteristics, and lifestyle between men and women may influence the interplay between HDL-C and vitamin D. Therefore, this study specifically focuses on how gender moderates the relationship between HDL-C and 25(OH)D. This study utilizes data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2018 to explore the association between serum HDL-C levels and 25(OH)D. By addressing these gaps, the study aims to contribute valuable knowledge that could inform strategies for enhancing cardiovascular and bone health outcomes.

### Oxidative stress and osteoporosis [^111YEwZj]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2021). Medium credibility.

➤

Oxidative stress has been implicated as a causative factor in many disease states, possibly including the diminished bone mineral density in osteoporosis.

➤

Understanding the effects of oxidative stress on the development of osteoporosis may lead to further research improving preventative and therapeutic measures that can combat this important contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide.

➤

A diet rich in whole plant foods with high antioxidant content along with antioxidant-preserving lifestyle changes may improve bone mineral density and reduce the risk of fragility-related fractures. While it is not explicitly clear if antioxidant activity is the effector of this change, the current evidence supports this possibility.

➤

Supplementation with isolated antioxidants may also provide some osteoprotective benefits, but whole plant food-derived antioxidants potentially have more overall benefits. Larger-scale clinical trials are needed to give credence to definitive clinical recommendations.

### Bone health [^1179PqC9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Much evidence indicates that both calcium and vitamin D are efficacious in protecting the skeleton, particularly when these 2 nutrients are used in combination. Each nutrient is necessary for the full expression of the effect of the other, and where their actions are independent, their effects on skeletal health are complementary. Nutrient status for both tends to be deficient in the adult population of the industrialized nations. Hence, supplementation or food fortification with both nutrients is appropriate and, given contemporary diets and sun exposure, probably necessary. Various meta-analyses, systematic evidence reviews, and controlled trials evaluating these 2 nutrients will be defective if they fail 1) to take into consideration the nearly universal need to augment the status of both nutrients in the populations studied rather than just one or the other, 2) to consider the threshold characteristics of both nutrients, and 3) to use the achieved serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration as the independent variable for vitamin D effects (instead of oral vitamin D intake). Problems with adherence to a regimen of taking supplements daily make an appropriate fortification strategy the preferred option for improving the status of both nutrients.

### Associations between late pregnancy dietary inflammatory index (DII) and offspring bone mass: a meta-analysis of the southampton women's survey (SWS) and the avon longitudinal study of parents and children (ALSPAC) [^113M2V9X]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Although causality cannot be inferred from our results because of the observational nature of this study, several mechanisms have been proposed by which systemic inflammation during pregnancy may detrimentally affect fetal growth and, by extension, offspring bone health. Raised levels of inflammatory cytokines may directly transfer across the placenta to the fetus and subsequently impair fetal development. Maternal inflammation may also lead to local inflammation of the placenta, impairing its ability to facilitate maternal‐fetal nutrient transfer. Although the mother–offspring associations were partly attenuated through adjustment for offspring height, consistent with the much‐attenuated associations with BMC for BA, it was apparent that the relationship was not entirely explained through linear growth. Adjustment for child's body weight largely removed the associations, and given that both lean and fat mass tend to be positively related to bone measures, this raises the possibility that the bone relationships might be secondary to differences in lean or fat mass. A further possibility that arises from the inverse association between pro‐inflammatory diets and other measures of a healthy diet (discussed in more detail below) relates to the greater calcium intake associated with a healthy diet. Greater calcium intake did not appear to be pro‐inflammatory in the studies underpinning the genesis of the E‐DII, but a less pro‐inflammatory diet might be associated with better bone health via greater calcium intake through the inverse association between E‐DII and healthy dietary patterns. However, the evidence linking maternal calcium intake during pregnancy and offspring bone development is limited, and indeed even calcium intake during childhood is inconsistently associated with bone mineral density. Given that vitamin D intake is part of the E‐DII, it is difficult to disaggregate its effect as part of the score from any other potential contribution to the associations.

### A mediterranean-like dietary pattern with vitamin D3 (10 mcg / D) supplements reduced the rate of bone loss in older Europeans with osteoporosis at baseline: results of a 1-y randomized controlled trial [^115Pudf1]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Although osteoporosis is a widely accepted risk factor for bone fracture, the evidence for a protective effect of the MD on the risk of fracture is conflicting. Post hoc analysis of longitudinal data (median follow-up of 15.9 y) from the US Women's Health Initiative reported a lower risk of hip (but not total) fractures with higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet in women aged 50–79 y. Conversely, a smaller population-based study of shorter duration (8 y) in France found that greater adherence to the MD was not associated with a decreased risk of fractures in men and women aged 67 y on recruitment. In a prospective study in European men and women [European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)] with a mean age of 48.6 y, followed for a median of 9 y, increased adherence to an MD protected against hip fracture occurrence, particularly among men. In the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) trial, an observational cohort study nested in the main trial found that a higher consumption of extra-virgin olive oil was associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis-related fractures in Mediterranean men and women, aged 55–80 y, at high cardiovascular risk. As with the cross-sectional studies cited above, the effect of the MD appears to be mediated through particular dietary components, such as virgin olive oil.

### Intake and serum concentrations of α-tocopherol in relation to fractures in elderly women and men: 2 cohort studies [^115TtnFW]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A reduction in the formation of free radicals and oxidative stress might reduce the rate of bone loss and muscle wasting.

Objective

The objective was to determine whether α-tocopherol intake or serum concentrations are associated with fracture risk in older women and men.

Design

Two cohort studies, the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC; n = 61,433 women) and the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM; n = 1138 men), were used.

Results

During 19 y of follow-up, 14,738 women in the SMC experienced a first fracture at any site (3871 hip fractures). A higher hip fracture rate was observed with lower intakes of α-tocopherol. Compared with the highest quintile of intake, the lowest quintile had a multivariable-adjusted HR of 1.86 (95% CI: 1.67, 2.06). The HR of any fracture was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.28). α-Tocopherol-containing supplement use was associated with a reduced rate of hip fracture (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.93) and any fracture (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.94). Compared with the highest quintile of α-tocopherol intake in ULSAM (follow-up: 12 y), lower intakes (quintiles 1–4) were associated with a higher rate of hip fracture (HR: 3.33; 95% CI: 1.43, 7.76) and any fracture (HR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.88). The HR for hip fracture in men for each 1-SD decrease in serum α-tocopherol was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.13, 2.22) and for any fracture was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.48).

Conclusion

Low intakes and low serum concentrations of α-tocopherol are associated with an increased rate of fracture in elderly women and men.

### Vitamin D and health in the 21st century: bone and beyond. executive summary [^11437sGW]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is unique, in terms of its metabolism and physiologic features and the human reliance on both endogenous production (activation through exposure to ultraviolet light) and exogenous sources (diet, primarily fortified foods) to meet biological requirements. Recent evidence has indicated a reemergence of vitamin D-deficient rickets and an alarming prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (ie, low circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) in particular segments of the US population. Furthermore, evidence has emerged implicating vitamin D status in a range of adverse health conditions, including cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. Therefore, a conference organized by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements was held to explore current knowledge and to develop a research agenda to address the range of issues associated with vitamin D and health during the life cycle. These proceedings contain presentations about 1) existing data on vitamin D status in the United States and internationally, 2) the current state of knowledge regarding the biological functions of vitamin D, 3) the strength of evidence supporting reconsideration of current policies regarding vitamin D intake, 4) gaps in understanding of the factors affecting and current options for improving vitamin D status in the United States and internationally, and 5) research needs to address gaps in knowledge regarding vitamin D assessment, biological features, and requirements. This executive summary provides an overview of the conference and its conclusions.

### Association between fat-soluble vitamins and metabolic syndromes in US adults: a cross-section study from NHANES database [^111rsioE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Fat-soluble vitamins (FSVs) comprise a group of essential micronutrients that are soluble in lipids or fat solvents but not in water. These vitamins play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including metabolism, growth, and development. The FSV family includes vitamin A (VA), vitamin D (VD), vitamin E (VE), and vitamin K (VK), each with distinct biological functions. Deficiency in VA, VD, VE, and VK can lead to specific health issues, i.e. night blindness, bone disease, nerve damage, and spontaneous bleeding. Accumulating evidence suggested a potential association between FSVs and MetS. A cross-sectional study in China demonstrated a dose-dependent positive association between serum VA levels and MetS, with similar findings reported in a Korean population study. Waniek et al. conducted a study in Northern German, concluding that elevated α-tocopherol levels were associated with hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and increased odds of MetS. Furthermore, a significant association between VD and MetS odds has been reported. However, the existing evidence presented some inconsistencies regarding these associations. Furthermore, dietary diversity inherently exposes individuals to multiple vitamins simultaneously, and interactions among FSVs can occur at the intestinal level, influencing absorption and metabolism. Consequently, exploring the association between co-exposure to multiple FSVs and health outcomes is more valuable and may provide a more comprehensive understanding of their associations. While Pei et al. investigated the association between co-exposure to multiple water-soluble vitamins and MetS risk, evidence on the association between multiple FSVs co-exposure and MetS odds was still limited.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-sectional study. Data from the NHANESs 2003–2006 and 2017–2018 was used. Our objective was to investigate the associations of exposure to serum FSVs (i.e. VA, VD, VE) with MetS odds and each MetS component in a representative sample of American adults. Additionally, we also explored potential dose–response relationships among them.

### Regulation of enzymatic lipid peroxidation in osteoblasts protects against postmenopausal osteoporosis [^111ggsUS]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Another significant finding in this study pertains to the differential effects of vitamin E on bone mass in normal mice versus OVX mice. Initially, we investigated vitamin E as a pharmacological inhibitor of phospholipid peroxidation, inspired by previous studies –. As anticipated, the inhibition of phospholipid peroxidation by vitamin E effectively mitigated OVX-induced bone loss. Previous researches have consistently demonstrated the beneficial effects of vitamin E in osteoporotic animal models, and epidemiological studies –, primarily attributing its anti-osteoporotic properties to its antioxidative function. In contrast to OVX mice, the same dosage of vitamin E slightly reduced BMD in normal mice, with statistically significant differences observed. Our findings are consistent with those of Fujita et al. who reported notable effects of vitamin E in normal animals. Their study indicated that vitamin E promotes osteoclast fusion through the p38 α /Mitf/Tm7sf4 pathway rather than through its antioxidative activity. The divergent effect of vitamin E on bone mass in normal and osteoporotic conditions may be attributed to its distinct performances on osteoclasts and osteoblasts, which operate differently under physiological and pathological conditions. While originally intended as a tool to explore phospholipid peroxidation in bone formation dysfunction, our unexpected findings underscore the dualistic effect of vitamin E on bone metabolism. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of vitamin E in osteoporosis, but cautioning against indiscriminate use in healthy individuals.

In conclusion, this study provides robust evidence that GPX4 deficiency exacerbates bone loss and disrupts bone formation, ultimately contributing to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, as summarized in Fig. 8. Furthermore, the findings highlight the critical role of phospholipid peroxidation in the underlying mechanisms of osteoporosis. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting the modulation of GPX4 activity and the prevention of phospholipid peroxidation hold significant potential for the treatment of osteoporosis.

The role of lipid peroxidation and its key regulator, GPX4, in osteoblasts-mediated bone formation.

Phospholipid peroxidation in osteoblasts plays a pivotal role in postmenopausal osteoporosis, driven by diminished estrogen-regulated GPX4 expression. The lipid peroxidation byproduct 4-HNE disrupts RUNX2 signaling through the degradation of ILK. While the natural GPX4 activators 6- and 8-Gingerols promote osteoblastogenesis and demonstrate significant anti-osteoporotic effects.

### Vitamins for chronic disease prevention in adults: clinical applications [^1151yggf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Vitamin deficiency syndromes such as scurvy and beriberi are uncommon in Western societies. However, suboptimal intake of some vitamins, above levels causing classic vitamin deficiency, is a risk factor for chronic diseases and common in the general population, especially the elderly. Suboptimal folic acid levels, along with suboptimal levels of vitamins B(6) and B(12), are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects, and colon and breast cancer; low levels of vitamin D contribute to osteopenia and fractures; and low levels of the antioxidant vitamins (vitamins A, E, and C) may increase risk for several chronic diseases. Most people do not consume an optimal amount of all vitamins by diet alone. Pending strong evidence of effectiveness from randomized trials, it appears prudent for all adults to take vitamin supplements. The evidence base for tailoring the contents of multivitamins to specific characteristics of patients such as age, sex, and physical activity and for testing vitamin levels to guide specific supplementation practices is limited. Physicians should make specific efforts to learn about their patients' use of vitamins to ensure that they are taking vitamins they should, such as folate supplementation for women in the childbearing years, and avoiding dangerous practices such as high doses of vitamin A during pregnancy or massive doses of fat-soluble vitamins at any age.

### Cystic fibrosis-related bone disease: an update on screening, diagnosis, and treatment [^1169NJTc]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Malnutrition

Undernutrition, a major sequela of CF, is a known risk factor for poor bone health. Increased energy expenditure from inflammation and infection, decreased intake, PI, decreased bile acid secretion, and alterations in intestinal pH and gut motility lead to malabsorption of nutrients. Low body mass index (BMI), a surrogate for poor nutritional status, has long been recognized as a risk factor for low bone density in PwCF.– Grey et al. examined BMD and body composition in adults with CF as compared to non-CF controls and found BMI correlated positively with total body BMD. Mean total body BMD was lower in the CF group versus healthy controls (−10.5%) as well as at the lumbar spine (−12.5%) and femoral neck (−11.1%). Sheikh et al.found a significant correlation between BMI and low weight with low BMD Z -scores in both adults and adolescents with CF. Frangolias et al.also found similar findings with low BMI associated with decreased BMD in adults with CF. Overall, malnutrition has a strong association with low bone density.

Pancreatic insufficiency

Approximately 85% of PwCF are diagnosed with PI. Both exocrine and endocrine PI can influence bone health. Exocrine PI causes malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Vitamin D plays an important role in calcium absorption and bone homeostasis. Vitamin K is also needed at multiple points in the bone metabolic pathway, serving as a coenzyme for molecular pathways and regulating osteoblast and osteoclast formation, modulating both bone formation and bone resorption.

### Association of physical activity, vitamin E levels, and total antioxidant capacity with academic performance and executive functions of adolescents [^112o2tq2]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Physical activity (PA) has been shown to have various positive effects on bone strength, muscle health, and predisposition to obesity, to name a few. Furthermore, high levels of PA have also been shown to improve cognitive performance, such as memory and learning, for individuals of all ages. However, with the advancement of technology, the time spent by children pursuing physical activities has been overtaken by sedentary activities involving television, computer devices and other screen-based technologies.

Regular PA has been shown to augment the antioxidant system and reduce lipid peroxidation. Antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, selenium, and so on play important roles in protecting the cell membrane from oxidative damage, and supplementation with antioxidants has been shown to enhance physical performance and general health. Vitamin E has also been shown to have a role in reducing inflammation and muscle soreness, and recent research has suggested that increased intake can help to preserve brain function and protect against nerve cell degeneration. A study in the United States of America (USA) has revealed that a significant number of adults are deficient in vitamin E.

Men have been reported to have greater risk of vitamin E deficiency as compared to women in both developed and developing countries. A recent study has reported that at least 31% of the United States population is at risk of having at least one vitamin deficiency or anemia, and further shows that it is linked to socio-demographic, life-stage, use of dietary supplement, and dietary adequacy categories. Studies have shown inadequate vitamin E in diets of toddlers aged 18–30 months in Mexico, Kenya, and Egypt. Depletion of vitamin E among children, adolescence, and older populations in developing countries has been related to limited sources of food containing vitamin E and high prevalence of malaria and human immunodeficiency virus in the region. Deficiency of vitamin E has also been associated with low levels of vitamin C, β-carotene and other antioxidants in blood circulation. This supports the theory that deficiency of vitamin E is associated with poor intake and greater oxidative stress. Other factors that have been attributed to vitamin E deficiency include low fat diet, limited inclusion of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into the diet, and increased consumption of processed food. However, whilst vitamin E deficiency can be deleterious, uncontrolled supplementary intake may lead to toxic effects.

### Does higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels will harm bone mineral density? a cross-sectional study [^113HQpuG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study of 11,375 adults using NHANES data found a U-shaped relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and bone mineral density (BMD), with the highest BMD observed at a serum concentration of 81.1 nmol/L. This relationship remained significant after adjusting for various covariates, highlighting the complex impact of vitamin D on bone health. Our findings offer valuable insights into the optimal vitamin D levels for maintaining bone health and can inform dietary and supplementation guidelines for both genders.

Our study had some limitations. Firstly, it was a cross-sectional study of disease prevalence rather than incidence, so there is uncertainty about whether exposure preceded the observed outcomes. Secondly, the NHANES database only assessed total bone mineral density in participants aged 8–59 years, leaving the impact of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D on older individuals inconclusive. Thirdly, although we tried to adjust for numerous confounding factors, there is still a possibility of unmeasured confounders. Additionally, some important covariates, such as alcohol consumption frequency, physical activity, and sedentary activity, were based on participant questionnaire surveys. NHANES also does not provide explicit data on the season during which serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured, which could introduce potential bias as vitamin D levels fluctuate with seasonal sun exposure. The lack of occupational data further limits our ability to directly analyze the impact of seasonality and indoor versus outdoor work on vitamin D levels and bone health.

Micronutrient supplementation — chronic disease prevention and older adults: Evidence reviews concluded in 2014 that the current evidence is insufficient for multivitamins/single- or paired-micronutrient supplements and recommended against beta carotene or vitamin E for prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer; the American Geriatrics Society advises clinicians to recommend vitamin D supplementation at least 1,000 IU/day and calcium for community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older, with the most commonly prescribed calcium amount 1,000 to 1,200 mg; in 2012, the USPSTF recommended vitamin D supplementation (median 800 IU) to help prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years of age or older who are at increased fall risk, whereas in 2018 the USPSTF recommended against daily supplementation of 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1,000 mg or less of calcium for primary prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women and found evidence insufficient for higher amounts or for community-dwelling men and premenopausal women.

### Association between prenatal vitamin D supplementation and respiratory diseases in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116kM48B]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Childhood respiratory and allergy conditions, affects approximately 30% of children in the worldwide. Respiratory and allergy conditions such as respiratory tract infection (RTI), asthma, wheezing, eczema, allergy positivity and immunoglobulin E (IgE) pose a global challenge. The very rapid upward trend requires effective strategies in early childhood. Evidence highlights the importance of the intrauterine period in the development of respiratory and immune systems. Accordingly, prenatal nutrition as a modifiable factor seems to have critical role in predicting health outcomes. In this context, vitamin D has emerged as a nutrient of particular scientific interest.

In the past, vitamin D had been known for its beneficial role in the calcium balance and bone health. While, now it is known to have a broad range of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Previous studies indicate that vitamin D may have immunomodulatory properties in the development of lungs too. Vitamin D insufficiency seems to be implicated in the immune reaction.

Children born to mothers with vitamin D deficiency are more susceptible to developing respiratory infections, wheezing, allergic sensitization. However, the exact causal relationship between respiratory disorders and vitamin D are unknown. To this end several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted to determine the efficacy of prenatal vitamin D to improve respiratory and allergy-associated outcomes. Accordingly, several studies with various population, supplementation dosage, and duration make difficult to interpret the results. Likewise, some studies address favorable effects for vitamin D, while some reported null-effects, and it is difficult to determine the exact direction of the prenatal vitamin D in this regard.

The conflicting results led us to adopt a more robust methodological approach to investigate the sources of heterogeneity. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is therefore to provide a comprehensive and robust evaluation of the available evidence to determine whether prenatal vitamin D supplementation has a beneficial effect on respiratory and allergy outcomes in children.

### A long journey into aging, brain aging, and Alzheimer's disease following the oxidative stress tracks [^111tVqZP]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

In old-age subjects, a pro-oxidant status was also observed in a common disease such as osteoporosis. In fact, in a population of postmenopausal women, living independently, in good health and nutritional status, and affected by mild or no disability, those who suffered from osteoporosis had consistently lower plasma levels of vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin A, and uric acid compared to controls. Despite this, none of the subjects belonging to the two groups had levels below the normal vitamin C and vitamin E ranges. The activities of antioxidant enzymes in plasma (SOD and GPX) and erythrocytes were significantly lower in osteoporotic than in controls. The study showed the negative effect of low levels of antioxidants in bone mass and fracture risk, as demonstrated in epidemiological studies. Of note, vitamin C is a cofactor in the maturation of collagen. We explained these observations supposing an inadequate antioxidant intake that can affect osteoclastogenesis.

### Bone density and hyperlipidemia: the T-lymphocyte connection [^116U6Cp1]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

An additional aspect of our study that is highly relevant to the human population is the fact that as early as 6 months of age the high-fat mice failed to show the usual increase in BMC (Fig. 1 B). Studies aimed at elucidating the impact of body fat on bone density have suggested that subcutaneous fat is beneficial to peak bone mass, whereas visceral fat has negative effects on bone in both healthy and HIV + individuals. Moreover, Lac and colleagues showed that during the early growth period (ie, 35 days), rats fed a high-fat diet had lower bone BMC and BMD along with a negative correlation between visceral fat and BMD. These findings are relevant to human health, where high-cholesterol diets are becoming more prevalent even in children, and evidence suggests that hyperlipidemic youth are more likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease when they reach adulthood. Furthermore, based on our own findings and reports by others, oxidized lipids not only can induce osteoclastic differentiation but also can inhibit the differentiation of osteoblasts. Moreover, Hirasawa and colleagues showed that 5-week-old ApoE −/− mice (the same background strain as in this study) given a high-fat diet for 12 weeks had a greater number of osteoclasts in the trabecular bone, as well as increased osteoclast activity in the cortical endosteum, compared with control mice. Therefore, hyperlipidemia and the subsequent effects of increased oxidized lipid levels not only may affect bone loss during aging but also may interfere with proper bone development early in life.

Based on our findings, we propose that T-lymphocytes may be one of the missing links in the documented lipid-mediated bone loss. There is increasing evidence that nutritional interventions may modulate oxidative stress, which can affect the generation of oxidized lipids. For example, the antioxidant cocoa polyphenol was reported to increase HDL, decrease LDL, and also decrease the oxidant susceptibility of LDL in both human and rodents. Treatment with vitamin E has been shown to reduce inflammation-induced cytokine production in vitro not only by immune cells but also by skeletal and cardiac muscle. Furthermore, changes to diet and/or lifestyle that can decrease excess amount of visceral fat also can be beneficial. The results of this study suggest that these treatments may function, at least in part, by reducing the T-lymphocyte exposure to oxidized lipids.

Vitamins

In total, three meta-analyses, three systematic reviews, eight RCTsand three prospective cohort studieswere identified studying vitamin supplementation for OA. RCTs testing multi-vitamins, vitamin B3and vitamin B12reported small non-significant effects on pain. One prospective cohort study reported that self-reported vitamin C supplementation was not associated with lower risk of radiographic progression. One RCT compared vitamin E+C versus placebo and reported a small effect on pain after 8 weeks. Three meta-analyses, three systematic reviews, four RCTsand one prospective cohort studywere identified that studied the effect of vitamin D. The meta-analyses reported small effects on pain and function as a result of vitamin D (pain: SMD −0.19, 95% CI −0.31 to –0.06; SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.63 to –0.02, mean difference in The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) −1.65, 95% CI −2.16 to –1.14; function: SMD −0.36, 95% CI −0.61 to –0.11, mean difference WOMAC −1.87, 95% CI –2.58 to –1.17). The systematic reviews reported no effect on pain, but a small effect on function. Three out of six observational studies included in a systematic review reported an inverse relationship between vitamin D and radiographic progression. The latest RCT not included in the meta-analyses reported no difference in pain between high and low doses of vitamin D after participants underwent total knee replacement. One meta-analysisand one systematic reviewstudied vitamin E. Both reported no effect of vitamin E on pain (SMD 0.01, 95% CI −0.44 to 0.45) and the meta-analysis reported no effect of vitamin E on function (SMD −0.10, 95% CI −0.55 to 0.35) (online supplemental tables 54–62).

Summary

There were only relatively few studies for most dietary exposures in OA, meaning that the evidence for these exposures was graded as low or very low (table 1). For diets that had moderate evidence (fish oil, chondroitin, glucosamine, vitamin D, ASU), the effect sizes for outcomes were generally small and therefore not clinically relevant.

### Vitamin D binding protein polymorphisms significantly impact vitamin D status in children [^112JN8Hx]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The meanings of vitD "sufficiency" or "deficiency" are still controversial. If referring solely to circulating 25-D concentrations associated with the endocrine role of vitD, then serum calcium and PTH concentration, bone density, and growth are likely good clinical correlates of deficiency. Even most current studies addressing the relationship of free or bioavailable vitD metabolites to VDBP genetic diversity are solely focused on this endocrine role of vitD (e.g. are African-Americans truly vitD deficient with low circulating 25-D if they have high bone density?). However, a large body of research over the past few decades has now elucidated hundreds of other genes and physiologic processes affected by vitD, many of which are associated with subtle, homeostatic regulation that could potentially influence life-long health, and are much more difficult to correlate to simple clinical/pathological measurements. This accumulated research is what primarily led the Endocrine Society to distinguish between deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency in circulating 25-D. Although the official recommendation of sufficiency in that report was for circulating 25-D of ≥ 75 nmol/L, even a range of 100–150 nmol/L (40–60 ng/ml) was considered safe and would likely guarantee full sufficiency in most children and adults.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^113yWeUT]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

However, MR studies provide mixed evidence for a causal relationship. A small study (8417 German adults) confirmed an association between measured low serum 25OHD concentrations and mortality, but it did not find an effect of genetically lower serum 25OHD concentrations, based on only two SNPs, on mortality. The authors realized that this result may well be due to underpowering of the study. Another small-scale German study (3316 participants) also found no significant link between predicted serum 25OHD and mortality. However, a much larger Danish study (n = 95,766 and 9 to 19 years of follow-up) found an increased all-cause [RR, 1.3; confidence limit (CL), 1.05 to 1.61] and cancer (RR, 1.43; CL, 1.02 to 1.99) mortality with lower genetically predicted serum 25OHD. This effect was not much different from the excess mortality observed in a subgroup of this study using measured serum 25OHD concentrations (RR for overall mortality, 1.19; CL, 1.14 to 1.25).

Numerous RCTs designed to look at a variety of endpoints (mostly fractures or falls) also evaluated mortality risks as part of overall safety analysis. Three recent meta-analyses of such vitamin D supplementation studies generated similar conclusions: based on data of 22 RCTs on > 30,000 participants (56 to 85 years of age with a median baseline serum 25OHD of 37.5 nmol/L) and 0.4 to 6.8 years of follow-up, vitamin D 3 supplementation reduced all-cause mortality by 11%. A Cochrane analysis, including even more studies and > 95,000 participants, came to a similar conclusion: vitamin D 3 supplementation (most commonly used dosage of 800 IU/d) decreased the mortality rate by 6% [RR, 0.94 (0.91 to 0.98)], whereas vitamin D 2 supplementation did not affect mortality, independently from calcium intake or baseline serum 25OHD. All-cause mortality is a hard and highly relevant endpoint and is easy to understand for the lay public. In view of the numerous large-scale ongoing intervention studies, this may well become a major endpoint to define the optimal vitamin D status and the associated recommended intake to achieve this status.

### Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation in critical illness-the known knowns and known unknowns [^115w2Hgj]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The known unknowns

The optimum range for vitamin D and what level to aim for?

In 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a report based on examination of data by a group of experts. They estimated that a vitamin D level of 50 nmol/L or higher was adequate for good bone health, and a level < 50 was considered a vitamin D deficiency.

In 2011, the Endocrine Society issued a report urging a much higher minimum blood level of vitamin D. The society's clinical practice guideline was developed by experts in the field assigned to a Vitamin D Task Force, and based on all the evidence they recommended a minimum vitamin D level of 75 nmol/L and, because of the vagaries of some of the assays, levels between 100 and 150 nmol/L to guarantee sufficiency for both children and adults. These reference ranges are determined by levels of vitamin D that achieve maximal parathyroid hormone suppression. However, this method for identifying the optimal level of vitamin D remains controversial; the relationship between serum 25 hydroxy-D and parathyroid hormone is inconsistent, and no clear threshold defining "sufficiency" has been established.

These recommendations from the Endocrine Society pertain to patients at risk of complications related to vitamin D deficiency, while those from the IOM on the other hand relate to healthy individuals.

Interestingly, although low levels of vitamin D have been associated with higher mortality and poor health outcomes, high levels may not be beneficial and could even be harmful. The first reports of a U-shaped or reverse J-shaped relationship were for prostate cancer. Subsequently, this has been shown in other groups including with all-cause mortality.

Importantly, based on level of risk there is unlikely to be one single optimum level. For patients at high risk of poor bone health or colorectal cancer, accepting the potential risks of higher 25 hydroxy-D levels may be warranted to gain maximum possible benefits. In addition to variation in the optimum level between individuals, the optimum level for different cellular functions and target actions within the same individual may be different; for example the bone health target may differ from that required for immune function.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^1146dLP9]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

A decrease in BMD with age is well documented, with osteoporosis developing when negative bone balance exists, distinguishable by an imbalance in the coupling of bone formation and resorption by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Regardless of treatment allocation, BMD at all three sites declined by approximately 1% (ranging from −0.7% to −1.4%) over the 2‐year intervention. Our observations are comparable with rates of BMD decline observed in other studies. Through the use of an active placebo, with vitamin D administered to both treatment arms, all participants likely benefited from the current intervention given that vitamin D, combined with calcium, has a well‐documented role in bone health, with evidence that higher serum 25(OH)D is associated with greater BMD in older adults. Given that both groups received vitamin D, it can be assumed that any effect of B‐vitamin intervention on BMD decline was independent of vitamin D.

### Meta-analysis: high-dosage vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause mortality [^1128mA5B]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Experimental models and observational studies suggest that vitamin E supplementation may prevent cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, several trials of high-dosage vitamin E supplementation showed non-statistically significant increases in total mortality.

Purpose

To perform a meta-analysis of the dose-response relationship between vitamin E supplementation and total mortality by using data from randomized, controlled trials.

Patients

135,967 participants in 19 clinical trials. Of these trials, 9 tested vitamin E alone and 10 tested vitamin E combined with other vitamins or minerals. The dosages of vitamin E ranged from 16.5 to 2000 IU/d (median, 400 IU/d).

Data Sources

PubMed search from 1966 through August 2004, complemented by a search of the Cochrane Clinical Trials Database and review of citations of published reviews and meta-analyses. No language restrictions were applied.

Data Extraction

3 investigators independently abstracted study reports. The investigators of the original publications were contacted if required information was not available.

Data Synthesis

9 of 11 trials testing high-dosage vitamin E (≥ 400 IU/d) showed increased risk (risk difference > 0) for all-cause mortality in comparisons of vitamin E versus control. The pooled all-cause mortality risk difference in high-dosage vitamin E trials was 39 per 10,000 persons (95% CI, 3 to 74 per 10,000 persons; P = 0.035). For low-dosage vitamin E trials, the risk difference was -16 per 10,000 persons (CI, -41 to 10 per 10,000 persons; P > 0.2). A dose-response analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between vitamin E dosage and all-cause mortality, with increased risk of dosages greater than 150 IU/d.

Limitations

High-dosage (≥ 400 IU/d) trials were often small and were performed in patients with chronic diseases. The generalizability of the findings to healthy adults is uncertain. Precise estimation of the threshold at which risk increases is difficult.

Conclusion

High-dosage (≥ 400 IU/d) vitamin E supplements may increase all-cause mortality and should be avoided.

Nutrition and mineral bone disease in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — patients with early PSC have reported deficiencies of vitamins A, D, and E at rates of 40%, 14%, and 2%, respectively; among those with advanced disease the rates were 82%, 57%, and 43%, respectively, and vitamins A, D, and E should be measured and supplemented as needed. In a 2011 single-center longitudinal cohort of 237 patients with PSC, osteoporosis was identified in 15%, with a 2.3- to 8-fold increased risk compared to population controls; multivariate analysis identified age ≥ 54, body mass index < 24 kg/m^2, and IBD for ≥ 19 years correlating with osteoporosis. In contrast, a recent study of 238 patients with PSC found no correlation between osteoporosis and age, disease duration, or severity of disease but rather a correlation between bone mineral density and bone resorption and T helper 17–cell frequency. All patients with PSC should be screened for metabolic bone disease by bone density measurement at diagnosis and then every 2–3 years in those with normal bone mineral density.

Bone cells and lipid metabolism

Lipids affect the function and differentiation of bone cells. Lipid species such as cholesterols and fatty acids are circulating and are present in the bone marrow sera. The oxidation of dietary lipids is a critical source of ATP for many cells and fuels bone remodeling. Cholesterols are delivered to the tissues by LDL through LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis. The levels of LDL-cholesterol in the circulation have a strong inverse correlation with bone mineral density (BMD). Skeletal fatty acid utilization contributes to whole-body lipid homeostasis (Fig. 3). Dyslipidemia, a condition characterized by abnormal levels of lipids in the blood, can lead to an excessive accumulation of fat and adversely affect the skeletal system. Additionally, dyslipidemia indirectly affects bone loss by increasing parathyroid hormone, homocysteine, and lipid oxidation products, or by affecting estrogen, vitamin D, and K levels. Among fatty acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced in the gut by microbial fermentation of dietary fiber and provide a beneficial effect on bone homeostasis –. It is important to note that bone marrow is an important site for fat storage, and marrow adipose tissues occupy over 70% of bone marrow space. Bone mass shows an inverse correlation with marrow fat. Emerging evidence indicates the contribution of lipid species from membrane phospholipids, including sphingosine-1-phosphate, to skeletal health. Further studies are required to understand the local action of lipids in the bone environment and the underlying mechanism of lipid-mediated regulation of bone cells.

Fatty Acids regulate bone cells.

Fatty acids are classified according to the presence and number of double bonds in their carbon chain: saturated fatty acids (SFA) contain no double bonds, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) contain one, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contain more than one double bond. There are numerous types of SFA according to the length of their chain (containing 4–16 carbon atoms). PUFAs, such as alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid), are called essential fatty acids because they are precursors to vitamins, cofactors, and derivatives, but our body cannot synthesize them. Fatty acids have both positive and negative effects on the regulation of osteoclasts (green cells and lines) and osteoblasts (orange cells and lines).

### What diseases are causally linked to vitamin D deficiency? [^114JzkK3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The classical clinical consequence of vitamin D deficiency is osteomalacia, presenting as rickets in children. This remains a common problem in parts of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, and occurs when serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are < 25nmol/L. Osteomalacia remains the only problem that is unequivocally a consequence of vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are observed in a wide range of conditions, but consistent trial evidence of amelioration of these conditions with vitamin D is lacking. Monotherapy with vitamin D has not been found to be effective in meta-analyses of trials assessing its effects on bone density, fractures or falls. At present, supplements should be advised for individuals at risk of having serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the 25–40nmol/L range, or below, with a view to prevention of osteomalacia.

### Vitamin D and bone health in postmenopausal women [^111z9NC4]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, a disease of increased skeletal fragility, is becoming increasingly common as the U.S. population ages. Adequate vitamin D and calcium intake is the cornerstone of osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Age-related changes in vitamin D and calcium metabolism increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although longitudinal data have suggested a role of vitamin D intake in modulating bone loss in perimenopausal women, studies of vitamin D and calcium supplementation have failed to support a significant effect of vitamin D and calcium during early menopause. There is a clearer benefit in vitamin D and calcium supplementation in older postmenopausal women. Vitamin D intake between 500 and 800 IU daily, with or without calcium supplementation, has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in women with a mean age of approximately 63 years. In women older than 65, there is even more benefit with vitamin D intakes of between 800 and 900 IU daily and 1200–1300 mg of calcium daily, with increased bone density, decreased bone turnover, and decreased nonvertebral fractures. The decreases in nonvertebral fractures may also be influenced by vitamin D-mediated decreases in body sway and fall risk. There are insufficient available data supporting a benefit from vitamin D supplementation alone, without calcium, to prevent osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women.

Bariatric surgery micronutrient screening — vitamins D, A, E, and K — includes routine testing for vitamin D and calcium and symptom-driven evaluation for vitamins E and K. For vitamin D and calcium, routine screening is recommended for all patients and 25(OH)D is the preferred biochemical assay, with elevated PTH levels and increased bone formation/resorption markers also considered; prevalence is reported as up to 100% of patients. For vitamin A, prevalence is up to 70% of patients within 4 years post-surgery, screening is recommended within the first postoperative year, particularly for those who underwent BPD/DS, regardless of symptoms, and screening is recommended in patients who have undergone RYGB and BPD/DS, particularly in those with evidence of protein-calorie malnutrition. For vitamins E and K, deficiency is uncommon and screening is recommended in patients who are symptomatic.

### Evaluating agreement between bodies of evidence from randomised controlled trials and cohort studies in nutrition research: meta-epidemiological study [^112vnZwt]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Heterogeneity was present when considering low fat dietary approaches. Focusing on dietary fatty acids only (n-3, n-6, and polyunsaturated fatty acids), we observed no heterogeneity (supplementary fig 10). Moreover, the comparisons between dietary supplements in randomised controlled trials versus dietary intake in cohort studies showed similar estimates but substantial heterogeneity and a wide prediction interval (ratio of risk ratios 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.21); I² = 74%; τ 2 = 0.049; 95% prediction interval 0.65 to 1.75). By excluding pregnancy outcomes (because all other comparisons focused on non-communicable diseases), and β carotene and vitamin A comparisons (for the outcome of mortality), which are known to increase mortality at higher doses in randomised controlled trials, heterogeneity disappeared (supplementary fig 11). The comparisons of dietary supplements versus nutrient status was judged to have the lowest similarity degree for intervention or exposure and also showed substantial differences between randomised controlled trials and cohort studies (1.29 (1.17 to 1.42); I² = 54%; τ 2 = 0.018; 0.94 to 1.77). Heterogeneity was driven by vitamin D comparisons (supplementary fig 9). After stratifying the analysis by outcome type, we observed differences for overall mortality (1.17 (1.11 to 1.23); I² = 75%; τ 2 = 0.006; 0.99 to 1.39), bone health (1.46 (1.16 to 1.84); I² = 67%; τ 2 = 0.019; 1.02 to 2.08), and eye disease (1.14 (1.03 to 1.26); I² = 36%; τ 2 = 0.003; 0.44 to 2.96; supplementary fig 12).

The findings of the subgroup analyses are supported by sensitivity analyses excluding outcomes that are likely to be highly correlated (supplementary figs 13–17), and when BoE from cohort studies with a risk ratio < 1 were analysed separately (supplementary figs 18–22). The subgroup analyses for BoE from cohort studies with a RR ≥ 1, need to be interpreted with caution due to the very small number of comparisons (n = 7) (supplementary figs 23–27).

### Obesity, bariatric surgery, and bone [^116YnhXH]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A greater number of morbidly obese individuals are undergoing bariatric surgery, expanding the postbariatric surgery population. Both obesity and bariatric surgery are accompanied by a variety of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, with some affecting bone health. Currently, there is no consensus regarding bone health evaluation and its management in obese and postbariatric population.

Recent Findings

This review will focus on nutritional deficiencies in obese and postbariatric surgical patients, with a special focus on bone health. The latest findings on the complicated relationship between adipose tissue and bone will be discussed. And the presumed protective effect of obesity on osteoporosis will be evaluated.

Summary

Nutritional deficiencies in postbariatric patients already exist prior to the surgery. Therefore, a comprehensive nutritional evaluation prior to bariatric surgery is imperative, to prevent further decline of the already deficient nutrients. Nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D have an effect on bone health. Therefore, monitoring their level is important in preventing bone loss. Taking a multivitamin with minerals postbariatric surgery is a standard of practice.

### Periodontal disease and incidence of hypertension in the health professionals follow-up study [^111KrTpE]. American Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies suggest a possible association between periodontal disease and hypertension; however, prospective evidence is limited.

Methods

The study population consisted of 31,543 participants of the Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study (HPFS) prospective cohort who were 40–75 years old at baseline, had no prior hypertension history and had complete baseline information on oral health. Information on periodontal disease, hypertension and potential confounders was updated biennially. We used Cox proportional hazards models to study the relation between periodontal disease at baseline, during follow-up, periodontal bone loss severity, baseline number of teeth, and tooth loss during follow-up, and the risk of developing hypertension. Multivariate models included age, calendar time, race, comprehensive smoking index (CSI), diabetes, alcohol consumption, family history of hypertension, dental profession, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, multivitamin use, calcium, vitamin D and vitamin E intake.

Results

We identified 10,828 cases of incident hypertension over 20 years of follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, we did not observe significant associations between incident hypertension and periodontal disease at baseline (relative risk (RR) = 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98–1.10), periodontitis during follow-up (RR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.96–1.05), tooth loss during follow-up (RR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.98–1.09), or when comparing men with 0–10 teeth to men with ≥ 25 teeth at baseline (RR = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.91–1.21). Participants reporting severe periodontal bone loss had a RR for incident hypertension of 1.02 compared to those without bone loss (95% CI: 0.77–1.35).

Conclusions

We did not observe an association between periodontal disease measures and incident hypertension in this cohort of middle-aged men.

When examining the subgroup of participants diagnosed with osteoporosis at baseline (n = 54), there was a 0.9% difference between the groups in the change in femoral neck BMD (Table 2); BMD increased in the intervention group (0.008 g/cm²; 95% CI: −0.001, 0.018 g/cm²) and decreased in the control group (−0.009 g/cm²; 95% CI: −0.018, −0.001 g/cm²) (P = 0.04). No effect of study center was observed (P = 0.415). The intervention had no effect on BMD measured at the lumbar spine or the whole body.

We observed no change in compliance to the diet measured at baseline and follow-up in the control group (1.9 points; 95% CI: −0.4, 4.2 points) but an increase of 23.3 points (95% CI: 21.0, 25.6 points) in the intervention group (P < 0.001) (data not shown). With regard to changes in specific dietary components associated with bone health, we observed a significant increase in intakes of olive oil, low-fat dairy, and calcium in the intervention group relative to controls (Figure 1).

### Calcium and vitamin D [^113iovz5]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone maintenance and for treatment-induced bone augmentation. Deficiencies of both nutrients are very common in the age group most afflicted by osteoporosis. Calcium enhancement of estrogen's effects now have been clearly demonstrated. Additionally, all currently approved bone active agents have been tested only in the presence of extra calcium, and newer anabolic agents create a skeletal need for mineral that will require even higher levels of calcium repletion. Prudent nutritional support for osteoporosis prevention and treatment consists of 30 to 40 mmol Ca/d together with sufficient vitamin D to maintain serum 25(OH)D levels above 80 nmol/L (i.e., approximately 25 microg vitamin D/d).

### Effect of race and genetics on vitamin D metabolism, bone and vascular health [^113e5uHq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder accounts for an inverse relationship between bone mineralization and vascular calcification in progressive nephropathy. Inverse associations between bone mineral density (BMD) and calcified atherosclerotic plaque are also observed in individuals of European and African ancestry without nephropathy, suggesting a mechanistic link between these processes that is independent of kidney disease. Despite lower dietary calcium intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations, African Americans have higher BMD and develop osteoporosis less frequently than do European Americans. Moreover, despite having more risk factors for cardiovascular disease, African Americans have a lower incidence and severity of calcified atherosclerotic plaque formation than do European Americans. Strikingly, evidence is now revealing that serum 25(OH)D and/or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels associate positively with atherosclerosis but negatively with BMD in African Americans; by contrast, vitamin D levels associate negatively with atherosclerosis and positively with BMD in individuals of European ancestry. Biologic phenomena, therefore, seem to contribute to population-specific differences in vitamin D metabolism, bone and vascular health. Genetic and mechanistic approaches used to explore these differences should further our understanding of bone-blood vessel relationships and explain how African ancestry protects from osteoporosis and calcified atherosclerotic plaque, provided that access of African Americans to health care is equivalent to individuals of European ethnic origin. Ultimately, in our opinion, a new mechanistic understanding of the relationships between bone mineralization and vascular calcification will produce novel approaches for disease prevention in aging populations.

### Vegetarian diets and bone status [^113VfQtT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common chronic condition associated with progressive loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and compromised bone strength, with increasing risk of fracture over time. Vegetarian diets have been shown to contain lower amounts of calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B-12, protein, and n-3 (ω-3) fatty acids, all of which have important roles in maintaining bone health. Although zinc intakes are not necessarily lower quantitatively, they are considerably less bioavailable in vegetarian diets, which suggests the need for even higher intakes to maintain adequate status. At the same time, healthy vegetarian diets tend to contain more of several protective nutrients, including magnesium, potassium, vitamin K, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients. On balance, there is evidence that vegetarians, and particularly vegans, may be at greater risk of lower BMD and fracture. Attention to potential shortfall nutrients through the careful selection of foods or fortified foods or the use of supplements can help ensure healthy bone status to reduce fracture risk in individuals who adhere to vegetarian diets.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1143e3eh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, more specifically with respect to neonatal and pediatric patients, vitamin D, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to ensure vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day in 0–1 year old infants and children, and at least 600 IU/day in ≥ 1 year old children, to maximize bone health. Insufficient evidence of whether 400 and 600 IU/day in 0–1 and 1–18 years old children, respectively, are enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D to maximize bone health and muscle function. Recognize that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Dietary supplements and disease prevention-a global overview [^112F9rXS]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Dietary supplements are widely used and offer the potential to improve health if appropriately targeted to those in need. Inadequate nutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent conditions that adversely affect global health. Although improvements in diet quality are essential to address these issues, dietary supplements and/or food fortification could help meet requirements for individuals at risk of deficiencies. For example, supplementation with vitamin A and iron in developing countries, where women of reproductive age, infants and children often have deficiencies; with folic acid among women of reproductive age and during pregnancy; with vitamin D among infants and children; and with calcium and vitamin D to ensure bone health among adults aged ≥ 65 years. Intense debate surrounds the benefits of individual high-dose micronutrient supplementation among well-nourished individuals because the alleged beneficial effects on chronic diseases are not consistently supported. Daily low-dose multivitamin supplementation has been linked to reductions in the incidence of cancer and cataracts, especially among men. Baseline nutrition is an important consideration in supplementation that is likely to modify its effects. Here, we provide a detailed summary of dietary supplements and health outcomes in both developing and developed countries to help guide decisions about dietary supplement recommendations.

### Assessment of vitamin status; A, E and D in Egyptian neonates with IUGR: a cross sectional study [^115CbuZh]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, the passage of vitamin E through the placenta is restricted. Hence, neonates are predisposed to be deficient in vitamin E which could lead to its decrease in blood and tissues at birth. Vitamin E deficiency may lead to restriction of fetal growth. This was hypothesized considering the fact that vitamin E is able to raise the production of prostaglandins I2 and E2, both lead to vasodilatation and may increase fetal blood supply. Accordingly, reduced levels of vitamin E can subsequently affect the nutrients transfer to the fetus, decreasing its growth. Nevertheless, although vitamin E was supposed to have a potential effect on fetal growth, yet, there are limited researches to assess this association taking weight and age of gestation into consideration.

Moreover, conferring to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there are no data on deficiency of vitamin E in Africa. To the best of our knowledge, few studies were conducted evaluating Vitamin E condition in Egyptian pregnant women and their infants to assist adjust nutrition intervention in perinatal period and improve pregnancy outcomes in mothers and neonates. It is well documented that vitamin E concentrations, especially α-tocopherol, are linked with pregnancy outcomes, like fetal growth. Thus, investigating the relation between levels of vitamin E in blood with certain pregnancy outcomes like gestational duration, growth of fetus, and other maternal and fetal aspects would explore the necessity of dietary interferences to improve outcomes of pregnancy.

Another important vitamin which has a crucial role in fetal growth is vitamin D. However, different studies performed to associate the deficiency of vitamin D with Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR) have revealed variable findings. Pérez-López et al. and Maugeri et al. suggested that IUGR may be attributed to the point that vitamin D in adequate levels is needed to keep sufficient levels of calcium and phosphate. Consequently, it permits the crucial mechanisms of bone mineralization and growth throughout fetal intrauterine period. The current study aimed to assess vitamin A (Retinol), E (alpha- tocopherol) and D (25 (OH) D) levels in the umbilical cord blood in newborns with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and compare them with those in neonates with appropriate weight for gestational age (AGA), evaluating the nutrition of the two cohorts regarding these vitamins which can be adjusted variables impacting neonatal outcomes. As far as we know, the present study is the first one evaluating the vitamin status involving three vitamins; A, E and D in Egyptian neonates with IUGR.

### Vitamin D deficiency associations with metabolic, bone turnover and adverse general health markers in community free living adults [^116CcsN3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D an active hormone is essential for both bone and muscle health. There is also mounting evidence that vitamin D can convey other health benefits because of the discovery that most cells and tissues in the human body contain vitamin D receptors. Indeed, many observational studies have linked vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency to increased risk of cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune and infectious diseases. There is also some evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased inflammation present in obesity and related chronic diseases. Humans get vitamin D from exposure to sunlight, from diet, and from dietary supplements. Other factors such as age, skin pigmentation, smoking and adiposity are known to affect vitamin D levels. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is considered the best indicator for vitamin D status and a predictor of bone health and also independent predictor of risk of a number of other chronic diseases. A 25(OH)D concentration of 32 ng/mL (80 nmol/L) is proposed to be optimal for health based on variables of bone health. Several studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiency is common in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent and appears largely to be due to inadequate sun exposure. However most of these studies so far were of small size. Furthermore, other causes and more importantly the health Implications of low vitamin D status are not clearly defined. Indeed, many studies on the relationship between low vitamin D status and bone health in south Asian population have yielded conflicting results. Furthermore, some cross-sectional studies comparing Caucasian and South Asian postmenopausal women point to altered metabolism of vitamin D in the Asian women that may protect their skeleton from bone loss. Alternatively, ethnic and/or genetic difference may influence the capacity to synthesize vitamin D. Although some studies have reported a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among UAE citizens, however the clinical benefit of optimizing vitamin D levels is still lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, determinants and whether there is measurable increase in markers of bone turnover and adverse health outcomes in 25(OH)D deficient UAE subjects.

### Health effects of vitamin and mineral supplements [^116FLEB6]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Osteoporosis

Recent evidence regarding the effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation is inconsistent. A meta-analysis of trials in community living older adults found that vitamin D or calcium supplementation did not reduce the risk of hip fracture or total fracture, whereas another meta-analysis reported that while vitamin D alone did not reduce fracture risk, combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation decreased the relative risk of hip fracture (16%) and all fractures (6%) among older adults. Ongoing research is assessing the effect of high dose vitamin D supplements on several health outcomes, including fractures, but a recent three year trial of 400, 4000, or 10 000 IU/day reported that the higher doses reduced volumetric bone density, suggesting potential for harm. In the absence of clear evidence on supplementation, it is prudent to ensure that dietary recommendations on calcium and vitamin D intakes are met through food and supplementation.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^116VnVxH]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Mortality

If low vitamin D status has such broad-ranging effects on so many (extraskeletal) tissues as described above, it would certainly increase the risk of a variety of diseases and thus ultimately increase mortality risks. No preclinical data exist on the relationship between longevity and vitamin D status. Many observational studies, as described above, associate a poor vitamin D status with nearly all major human diseases, and therefore it would not be surprising that a poor vitamin D status would be associated with increased mortality risk. Indeed, most observational studies found higher mortality rates in persons with the lowest vitamin D quartiles or quintiles in European and US populations, with the highest mortality rates found in subjects with serum 25OHD < 50 to 60 nmol/L. These very large studies also raised concerns about a U-shaped mortality curve, which suggests a slightly increased mortality rate in participants with the higher serum 25OHD levels. However, subsequent recalibration of serum 25OHD determinations decreased the number of NHANES participants with high serum 25OHD [> 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL)], so that the apparent increased mortality in the two high serum 25OHD groups disappeared. A meta-analysis of eight prospective studies on > 2600 participants (50 to 79 years of age) demonstrated a consistently higher overall mortality rate in participants with the lowest serum 25OHD concentrations (usually well below 50 nmol/L). This observation included subjects living in different areas of the world (United States, Europe, and Japan). Surprisingly, the Leiden longevity study found that the offspring of nonagenarians (age > 90 years) with at least one other nonagenarian in the family had lower (not higher as expected) serum 25OHD levels.

### Vitamin D, calcium homeostasis, and skeleton accretion in children [^114EjUye]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Overt vitamin D deficiency early in life has classically been associated with the etiology of rickets. Recent interest has focused on vitamin D insufficiency and calcium homeostasis and bone health. A review of the literature suggests that the relationship between vitamin D status and calcium utilization has some important differences with life stage and race. In contrast to adults, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, but not serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, predicts calcium absorption in growing children. PTH suppression with increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D varies with race in adolescents. A limitation of our understanding of vitamin D status on calcium homeostasis in children relates to the cross-sectional nature of the evidence and interventions that typically use too little vitamin D supplementation to affect status. Vitamin D status has predicted changes in BMD during growth, and higher doses have been associated with increased bone area and BMC of the hip in pubertal girls with low baseline vitamin D status. Bone accretion is related to calcium status, sexual maturity, race, and genetics. Current cross-sectional studies in children suggest that vitamin D status is less important for bone accrual than for bone health in adults. Intervention studies are needed to identify responsive groups.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH)₂D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

### The role of vitamin E in thermal burn injuries, infection, and sepsis: a review [^117KXDbr]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Work by Wong et al evaluated palm vitamin E (PVE) as a potential agent to prevent bone loss. Twelve-week-old male Wistar rats were given standard rat chow or a high-carbohydrate high-fat (HCHF) diet to induce metabolic syndrome, HCHF fed rats were then either treated with tocopherol-stripped corn oil as a vehicle control group, 60 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg PVE. At the end of the study, rats were evaluated for bone density. Wong noted increased osteoblast surface, osteoid surface, bone volume, and trabecular thickness, as well as decreases eroded surface. The improvements in bone characteristics were suggested to be correlated with decreased leptin levels in the 60 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg PVE supplemented rats (2050.00 ± 246.92 and 530.36 ± 74.14 pg/ml, respectively) compared to the HCHF fed rats (3425.55 ± 377.31 pg/ml). Leptin also acts as a potent inhibitor for bone formation through the central nervous system. Norazlina et alinduced osteoporosis in female Sparague-Dawley rats via ovariectomy, prior to feed treatments. Rats were fed standard feed, palm vitamin E at 30 mg/kg rat weight, palm vitamin E at 60 mg/kg rat weight, or α-tocopherol at 30 mg/kg rat weight, for 10 months postprocedure. Bone mineral density was lower in ovariectomied rats compared to intact rats and Norazlina noted there were significant (P < .05) increases in bone calcium content in the femoral and vertebral bones in intact rats supplemented with palm vitamin E at 60 mg/kg rat weight and 30 mg/kg rat weight α-tocopherol (173.9 ± 15.6, 182.3 ± 10.3 mg Femoral; 47.2 ± 2.0, 50.3 ± 1.7 mg Lumbar) compared to rats supplemented with 30 mg/kg palm vitamin E (134 ± 4.1 Femoral; 40.8 ± 1.5 mg Lumbar). It should be noted that the metabolic syndrome model and osteoporosis model employed by Wong and Norzalina, respectively, display distinct differences than that of a true burn injury. They do, however, carry similarities such as metabolic syndrome leading to hyperglycemia, similar to burn injuries, or a lack of antioxidant estrogen following postovariectomy leading to increased lipid peroxidation and free radical formation.

### Calcium and vitamin D in osteoporosis [^113j9Tqk]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Calcium and vitamin D are useful adjunctive therapies in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Peak BMD is optimally achieved with sustained optimal calcium and vitamin D intakes. Calcium and vitamin D intakes continue to be important after the third decade and into senescence. Although calcium and vitamin D are not therapies to be used alone to prevent early postmenopausal bone loss, they assume more prominent roles in late menopause and in the elderly to preserve bone health with advancing age. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is an important adjunctive therapy to use together with antiresorptive therapies.

### Vitamins for epilepsy [^115nBFZi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamins have been reported to be effective in controlling certain types of seizures and to prevent some of the harmful effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). In this review we will summarize evidence from randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To assess if vitamins improve seizure control, reduce adverse effects of AEDs or improve the quality of life in people with epilepsy.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to 2004, the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trials register (December 2004), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register) (TheCochraneLibrary Issue 4, 2004), and cross-references from identified studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized studies investigating the effects of one or more vitamins given alone or in addition to AEDs to people of any age with any type of epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Outcomes assessed included seizure frequency, gingival hyperplasia, neuropathy, changes in bone mineral content, serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, hemogram, serum levels of AEDs, neuropsychological and quality of life outcomes. Primary analyses were by intention to treat.

Main Results

Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria and were of poor methodological quality. None described randomization methods and most enrolled small numbers of participants. Nine studies (331 participants) investigated folic acid. Two studies (75 participants) found no effect for the outcome 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.32 to 2.29). Also, no evidence was found for an effect on gingival health, intelligence, behavior, mental health or personality, or measures of red blood volume and hemoglobin content. Folic acid was not associated with any consistent changes in serum phenytoin or phenobarbitone levels or improvement in the mean motor conduction velocities of peripheral nerves. One small study (72 participants) found that thiamine improves neuropsychological functions related to psychomotor speed, visuospatial abilities, selective attention and verbal abstracting ability. One study (226 participants) found a significantly higher bone mineral content (BMC) among patients with epilepsy taking AEDs with vitamin D supplementation compared to controls who were not given supplementation (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.48 to 4.72; p < 0.00001). The studies found no significant effects on serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase or general well-being. One small study (24 participants) found a significant decrease in seizure frequency in those treated with vitamin E compared to placebo (p = 0.00005; Peto OR 26.73; 95% CI 5.46 to 130.92).

Authors' Conclusions

In view of methodological deficiencies and limited number of individual studies, we have found no reliable evidence to support the routine use of vitamins in patients with epilepsy. Further trials are needed, especially to assess the utility of vitamin D supplementation to prevent osteomalacia and the role of vitamin E on seizures and thiamine in improving cognitive functions.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1177F4iF]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Risk assessment and preventive medication — determinants and evidence summary: Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk factors for incident osteoporotic fractures, and absolute fracture risk is very low in premenopausal women compared with postmenopausal women. The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low doses provides no benefit, while evidence on the effect of supplementation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting; if future evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that benefit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms caused by supplementation (kidney stones).

### Osteoporosis prevention, diagnosis, and therapy [^111Yb22R]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To clarify the factors associated with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis, and to present the most recent information available in these areas.

Participants

From March 27–29, 2000, a nonfederal, nonadvocate, 13-member panel was convened, representing the fields of internal medicine, family and community medicine, endocrinology, epidemiology, orthopedic surgery, gerontology, rheumatology, obstetrics and gynecology, preventive medicine, and cell biology. Thirty-two experts from these fields presented data to the panel and an audience of 699. Primary sponsors were the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institutes of Health Office of Medical Applications of Research.

Evidence

MEDLINE was searched for January 1995 through December 1999, and a bibliography of 2449 references provided to the panel. Experts prepared abstracts for presentations with relevant literature citations. Scientific evidence was given precedence over anecdotal experience.

Consensus Process

The panel, answering predefined questions, developed conclusions based on evidence presented in open forum and the literature. The panel composed a draft statement, which was read and circulated to the experts and the audience for public discussion. The panel resolved conflicts and released a revised statement at the end of the conference. The draft statement was posted on the Web on March 30, 2000, and updated with the panel's final revisions within a few weeks.

Conclusions

Though prevalent in white postmenopausal women, osteoporosis occurs in all populations and at all ages and has significant physical, psychosocial, and financial consequences. Risks for osteoporosis (reflected by low bone mineral density [BMD]) and for fracture overlap but are not identical. More attention should be paid to skeletal health in persons with conditions associated with secondary osteoporosis. Clinical risk factors have an important but poorly validated role in determining who should have BMD measurement, in assessing fracture risk, and in determining who should be treated. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is crucial to develop optimal peak bone mass and to preserve bone mass throughout life. Supplementation with these 2 nutrients may be necessary in persons not achieving recommended dietary intake. Gonadal steroids are important determinants of peak and lifetime bone mass in men, women, and children. Regular exercise, especially resistance and high-impact activities, contributes to development of high peak bone mass and may reduce risk of falls in older persons. Assessment of bone mass, identification of fracture risk, and determination of who should be treated are the optimal goals when evaluating patients for osteoporosis. Fracture prevention is the primary treatment goal for patients with osteoporosis. Several treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures, including those that enhance bone mass and reduce the risk or consequences of falls. Adults with vertebral, rib, hip, or distal forearm fractures should be evaluated for osteoporosis and given appropriate therapy.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^111SH2XV]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. The major cause of vitamin D deficiency has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by health agencies. There is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. To increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults. In general, there is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake.

### Osteoporosis in nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: a cross-sectional study [^112fbm6o]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study revealed that chronic PA infection was associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis in addition to previously described factors such as age, sex, lower BMI, and lower serum E 2 levels. Chronic PA infection has been associated with increased disease severity in adult bronchiectasis patients and MAC-PD. Our study showed that the osteoporosis group had a higher modified Reiff score, number of affected lobes, and lower lung function and 6MWD, all of which imply that this group contains has severe NTM-PD, causing immobilization. Thus, chronic PA might be associated with osteoporosis. Another possible cause is a negative pathophysiological effect of PA infection on osteoporosis. Basic studies have suggested that various proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which are released during infection, may promote the development and activity of osteoclasts. A study on cystic fibrosis patients primarily colonized with PA showed that infective exacerbation induced an increased production of potential osteoclast precursors in the peripheral blood, which may increase bone resorption, contributing to BMD loss. Although the direct effect of PA infection is still unclear, we should consider screening patients with severe NTM-PD, especially those complicated with chronic PA infection, for osteoporosis.

About 70% patients with NTM-PD showed vitamin D deficiency (< 20 ng/mL), which is similar to the results of a previous Korean study. The lower serum 25OHD was independently associated with osteoporosis in NTM-PD. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and can work importantly as an immunomodulator. Specifically, for mycobacterial infection, vitamin D deficiency was associated with tuberculosis progression. The osteoporosis group had higher severity of NTM-PD, which can induce immobilization and reduced exposure to sunlight can lower serum 25OHD; another possibility is that patients with low serum 25OHD might show disease progression as well as osteoporosis. Although, the causal relationship between serum vitamin D and NTM-PD is unclear, serum 25OHD may aid diagnosis with osteoporosis as well as vitamin D supplementation.

### The potential effect of the local administration of vitamins C and E on orthodontic treatment: a randomized clinical trial… [^117RhJcy]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

The Potential Effect of the Local Administration of Vitamins C and E on Orthodontic Treatment: a Randomized Clinical TrialClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Brief Summary of the Study This study investigates the effects of locally administered vitamins C and E on orthodontic tooth movement during the initial stage of treatment. Orthodontic tooth movement relies on bone remodeling, which can be influenced by antioxidants like vitamins C and E. Vitamin C promotes collagen formation and osteoblast activity, while vitamin E has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may impact bone metabolism. The study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in multiple clinics, where patients will be divided into three groups:

- Control group
- receives a saline injection.
- Vitamin C group
- receives a local injection of vitamin C.
- Vitamin E group
- receives a local injection of vitamin E.

Injections will be administered every two weeks for six months, while patients undergo orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. Researchers will evaluate the rate of tooth movement, root resorption, pain perception, and patient experience. Additionally, biomarkers related to bone remodeling will be measured in gingival crevicular fluid at different time points. Study Rationale Orthodontic tooth movement involves a complex biological process mediated by bone remodeling, which is regulated by mechanical forces and biochemical mediators. Oxidative stress and inflammatory responses play a significant role in the remodeling process. Vitamin C and vitamin E are known for their antioxidant properties and potential effects on bone metabolism, tissue healing, and inflammation modulation.

This study aims to determine whether locally administered vitamins C and E can enhance orthodontic tooth movement, reduce adverse effects such as root resorption, and improve patient experience during treatment. Injections are repeated biweekly for a total of six months. Orthodontic Treatment Protocol All participants undergo standardized orthodontic treatment using MBT brackets. The leveling and alignment phase follows a sequential archwire progression with heat-activated nickel-titanium archwires in the following sequence: This trial may provide valuable insights into the role of antioxidant therapy in orthodontic treatment. If vitamins C and E positively influence tooth movement and root integrity, their use could enhance treatment efficiency while minimizing complications. Findings may also contribute to a better understanding of bone remodeling mechanisms in response to mechanical forces.

### NAMS updates recommendations on diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women… [^116kiFYb]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is required throughout life for a woman to achieve her genetically determined peak bone mass and to maintain optimal bone mass and strength. Low intake of vitamin D is associated with reduced muscle strength, increased rates of bone loss, and increased risk of falls and fractures. Low dietary calcium intake is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture in older postmenopausal women. BISPHOSPHONATES Bisphosphonates inhibit the activity of osteoclasts and shorten their life span, thereby reducing bone resorption. Bisphosphonates significantly increase BMD at the spine and hip in a dose-dependent manner. In women with osteoporosis, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of vertebral fractures by 40 to 50 percent and reduce the risk of nonvertebral fractures by approximately one half this amount. RALOXIFENE Raloxifene is the only selective estrogen receptor modulator approved for the treatment of osteoporosis.

It has beneficial effects on BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck and decreases bone turnover as assessed by biochemical markers. Raloxifene also has been proven to reduce osteoporotic vertebral fracture risk, although no effect has been reported on the risk of hip or other nonvertebral fractures. Bone loss often resumes when raloxifene therapy is stopped. Randomized controlled trials have shown that daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide stimulate bone formation and improve bone density in postmenopausal women, regardless of whether they are receiving estrogen therapy. In postmenopausal women with previous vertebral fracture, treatment with teriparatide for 19 months significantly increased BMD in the spine and femoral neck and reduced the incidence of new vertebral and nonvertebral fragility fractures. Adverse effects associated with teriparatide include muscle cramps and infrequent hypercalcemia, nausea, and dizziness.

Significant increases in spinal BMD were found in a small study of intranasal calcitonin in postmenopausal women. The use of intranasal calcitonin for five years significantly reduces the risk of new vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. After five years of therapy, significant increases in spinal BMD are associated only with higher dosages of calcitonin.
