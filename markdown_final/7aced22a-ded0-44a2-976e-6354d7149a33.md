## Question

adrenal insuff testing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to test for adrenal insufficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and when to treat before testing. Then, I should confirm the initial screening strategy with 8–9 AM serum cortisol and how to interpret cutoffs. Next, I will review dynamic testing with ACTH stimulation, including timing, cutoffs, and pediatric dosing. After that, I need to determine how to distinguish primary from secondary causes and outline etiologic workup. Then, I should consider special populations such as glucocorticoid-induced AI, critical illness, opioids, cirrhosis, and pediatrics. I will also examine ancillary tests like metyrapone, salivary cortisol, and DHEAS. Finally, I will synthesize this into a concise clinical algorithm and confirm key management steps and safety education, making sure I verify each claim against high-credibility guidelines as I go.

> Let me first confirm when to suspect and when to treat immediately. If adrenal crisis is suspected (hypotension, shock, severe volume depletion, acute abdomen, vomiting), I should not delay therapy for testing; I need to give 100 mg hydrocortisone IV/IM immediately plus rapid isotonic saline, then continue stress dosing until stabilized, because waiting for labs risks mortality; I should obtain blood for cortisol/ACTH if feasible but not delay treatment [^117EArrH] [^116CBZ8p] [^117KL5Q6]. I need to remember that acutely ill patients with otherwise unexplained hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, fever, abdominal pain, or hyperpigmentation especially warrant urgent evaluation for primary AI, but stabilization takes priority if crisis is likely [^112uCFEs].

> Next, I should review the initial screening test. An 8–9 AM serum cortisol is the first-line screen when the patient is stable; I need to ensure glucocorticoids are held for at least 24 hours (dexamethasone is acceptable because it does not interfere with most cortisol assays), and interpret results in clinical context [^117JUADt]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: different assays and clinical states can shift cutoffs, but as a rule, a morning cortisol > 500 nmol/L (> 18 μg/dL) makes AI unlikely, whereas < 140 nmol/L (< 5 μg/dL), especially with elevated ACTH if available, strongly suggests AI if an ACTH test is not immediately feasible [^1152153f] [^115YL4Q1].

> I should double-check special contexts that shift morning cortisol interpretation. In patients tapering or discontinuing glucocorticoids, morning cortisol can often obviate dynamic testing; values around 310–354 nmol/L (11–12.8 μg/dL) have high negative predictive value for clinically meaningful glucocorticoid-induced AI, and ≥ 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) often indicates recovery of HPA function during follow-up, though assay variability matters [^1162vUxs] [^111hsJH7] [^115YWoqk]. But wait, what if the patient has chronic opioid exposure? Let me verify: lower thresholds perform better; in opioid-exposed cohorts, ~348 nmol/L (12.6 μg/dL) achieved very high sensitivity, and using the traditional 500 nmol/L cutoff may overcall AI; a cutoff of ~405 nmol/L (14.7 μg/dL) markedly reduced false positives for opioid-induced AI [^113n8MFe].

> Now, I will examine dynamic testing with cosyntropin when morning cortisol is indeterminate or suspicion remains high. The standard 250 μg ACTH (1–24) test is first-line; I should measure cortisol at baseline, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes, and consider AI confirmed if the peak is < 500 nmol/L (< 18–18.1 μg/dL) depending on assay; I need to remember most patients peak at 60 minutes and some who "fail" at 30 minutes will "pass" at 60, so capturing both times avoids false positives [^1152153f] [^111CpFsb] [^1125j4vm]. I should confirm pediatric dosing: ≥ 2 years get 250 μg, infants about 15 μg/kg, and children < 2 years 125 μg, making sure I adapt by age and body size [^1152153f].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of the low-dose (1 μg) ACTH test. Evidence suggests it may be more sensitive for secondary AI in non-critically ill settings, but standardization is problematic; I should reserve it for equivocal cases or when secondary AI is strongly suspected and I understand local assay performance, rather than using it routinely for primary AI, and I must acknowledge that guidelines prioritize the standard 250 μg test except in supply shortages [^1138iNPT] [^117LRMPg] [^116r7AXW].

> After biochemical confirmation of cortisol deficiency, I need to determine etiology. Let me first confirm plasma ACTH: values > 2× ULN indicate primary AI, while low/inappropriately normal ACTH suggests central (secondary/tertiary) AI; importantly, ACTH should be interpreted only after confirming low cortisol to avoid misclassification [^1178vPcg]. In suspected primary AI, I should assess mineralocorticoid status with plasma renin and aldosterone, and evaluate etiology with 21-hydroxylase antibodies, VLCFA in males when autoimmune markers are negative, and adrenal CT if the cause remains unclear; for central AI, I should assess other pituitary axes and obtain pituitary MRI [^115TXjkC] [^11469Efd] [^113AsZ6c].

> Next, I should review ancillary tests and when they help. The overnight metyrapone test can assess the integrity of the entire HPA axis and is FDA-recognized for AI diagnosis, but I need to check safety: it can precipitate acute AI and should be done in hospital with close monitoring; availability of 11-deoxycortisol assays is limited, which constrains routine use [^111sbwED] [^116xHAND]. Salivary cortisol may aid interpretation when binding proteins are altered (estrogen therapy, cirrhosis, critical illness) or as an adjunct during ACTH testing, especially since in cirrhosis low CBG/albumin confounds total cortisol [^1174L1xv] [^113GoRva] [^114w2RAM]. Let me also consider DHEAS pragmatically: in indeterminate morning cortisol ranges, higher DHEAS levels can lower the probability of AI, whereas very low DHEAS with very low cortisol increases it; I should confirm that recent glucocorticoid use reduces DHEAS diagnostic performance before relying on it [^116RrjWS].

> I need to ensure I cover glucocorticoid-induced AI specifically. Wait, I almost said dynamic testing should be routine during tapering; let me reconsider: guidelines recommend against routine dynamic testing in this setting; instead, assess recovery with morning cortisol once tapered to a physiologic dose (e.g., prednisone 4–6 mg or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/day), repeating every few weeks until recovery, and only consider dynamic testing if cortisol remains in an indeterminate range and results would change management [^1174L1xv] [^115YWoqk] [^117JUADt]. I should also remember good practice points on tapering pace and patient education about withdrawal symptoms and stress dosing during the transition [^115NiiPm] [^1142FRtj].

> For critically ill patients, I should confirm that traditional outpatient cutoffs may not apply. The concept of critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency remains controversial; however, in vasopressor-refractory shock, empiric hydrocortisone is reasonable while laboratory interpretation is nuanced and assay-dependent; delta cortisol thresholds and random cortisol cutoffs vary by guideline and context, with EASL suggesting delta cortisol < 248 nmol/L (9 μg/dL) or random < 276 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) in cirrhosis, underscoring the need for clinical judgment first, testing second [^1177twrz] [^112m9DDh] [^117JtdCE]. I should double-check that sepsis cohorts show high prevalence of abnormal testing by metyrapone criteria, but translating this to treatment decisions still demands caution [^1112hXHb].

> I will now examine pediatric considerations. I should confirm age-appropriate ACTH dosing as above, and in suspected or confirmed primary AI, I need to consider congenital etiologies; after ACTH stimulation, elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone supports 21-hydroxylase deficiency; genotyping may help when biochemical profiles are equivocal or corticosteroids confound testing [^1152153f] [^1169sewq]. In pediatric cancer survivors after cranial radiation, low-dose ACTH testing may detect central AI more sensitively than morning cortisol, so I should maintain a lower threshold for dynamic testing in that subgroup while integrating other pituitary deficits [^11462qvu].

> Let me synthesize the decision flow to ensure no step is missing. Start with clinical suspicion; if crisis is suspected, treat immediately with hydrocortisone and fluids before testing. In stable patients, obtain an 8–9 AM cortisol; if > 500 nmol/L, AI is unlikely; if < 140 nmol/L, AI is very likely and I should proceed to confirm with ACTH stimulation and measure ACTH; if 140–500 nmol/L, perform a standard 250 μg ACTH test with 30- and 60-minute cortisol sampling. A peak < 500 nmol/L confirms AI; then ACTH distinguishes primary (high) from central (low or inappropriately normal), guiding mineralocorticoid testing, autoimmune markers, VLCFA/adrenal imaging for primary AI versus pituitary imaging and other pituitary axes for central AI [^1152153f] [^1178vPcg] [^1174L1xv].

> I need to ensure management steps are explicit once AI is confirmed. For primary AI, initiate physiologic glucocorticoid replacement with hydrocortisone 15–25 mg/day in divided doses and add fludrocortisone when mineralocorticoid deficiency is present; for secondary AI, glucocorticoid replacement alone is appropriate because mineralocorticoid secretion is preserved; for glucocorticoid-induced AI, continue physiologic replacement and taper slowly, with clear stress-dosing instructions and emergency hydrocortisone availability [^115DHpmT] [^1152153f] [^116CBZ8p]. I should confirm that all patients receive education on sick-day rules and medical alert identification to prevent adrenal crisis during intercurrent illness [^116CBZ8p].

> Finally, I should double-check key takeaways and guard against over-interpretation. Morning cortisol remains the cornerstone screen, with dynamic testing by standard ACTH stimulation as the confirmation test; measuring both 30- and 60-minute cortisol values improves accuracy; ACTH level classifies primary versus central etiologies; and in glucocorticoid-induced AI, morning cortisol during tapering is preferred over routine dynamic tests, with clinical judgment paramount across critical illness scenarios [^1152153f] [^111CpFsb] [^1174L1xv] [^111QFfsb].

Adrenal insufficiency evaluation begins with **8 am cortisol and ACTH** [^1178vPcg] to screen for primary versus secondary disease, followed by the **250 mcg ACTH stimulation test** [^1152153f] to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish primary from secondary/tertiary causes. In critically ill patients, interpret random cortisol or delta cortisol [^1112hXHb] with caution because ACTH testing is less reliable [^112m9DDh]. For glucocorticoid-induced AI, morning cortisol is the first step [^112UURi9]; dynamic testing is reserved for indeterminate cases [^1174L1xv]. Always interpret results in clinical context and **treat suspected adrenal crisis immediately** [^116CBZ8p] without waiting for tests [^117EArrH].

---

## Indications for testing

Testing is indicated in patients with clinical features of adrenal insufficiency, including:

- Fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, hyperpigmentation, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal symptoms [^112uCFEs] [^116teUgf].

- Acutely ill patients with unexplained hypotension, volume depletion, or electrolyte disturbances [^111Ncj1V] [^112uCFEs].

- Patients with a history of chronic glucocorticoid use [^112UURi9] or recent glucocorticoid withdrawal [^112pzZu6].

## Initial screening tests

### Morning serum cortisol and ACTH

Morning serum cortisol **< 140 nmol/L (5 mcg/dL)** strongly suggests adrenal insufficiency [^115YL4Q1], whereas > 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) generally excludes it [^113n8MFe]. Plasma ACTH > 2 times the upper limit of normal [^1178vPcg] in the setting of low cortisol indicates primary adrenal insufficiency; low or inappropriately normal ACTH suggests secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency.

---

## Confirmatory dynamic tests

| **Attribute** | **Standard-dose ACTH stimulation test** | **Low-dose ACTH stimulation test** | **Insulin tolerance test (ITT)** | **Metyrapone test** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Procedure | Administer 250 mcg synthetic ACTH intravenously or intramuscularly; measure serum cortisol at baseline, 30, and 60 minutes [^1152153f] | Administer 1 mcg ACTH intravenously; measure cortisol at baseline, 30, and 60 minutes [^1138iNPT] | Administer insulin to induce hypoglycemia (< 2.2 mmol/L); measure cortisol response [^114TdFiY] | Administer metyrapone to inhibit cortisol synthesis; measure 11-deoxycortisol accumulation [^1115iPa1] |
| Interpretation | Peak cortisol < 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicates adrenal insufficiency [^1152153f] | Peak cortisol < 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) indicates adrenal insufficiency [^1138iNPT] | Peak cortisol < 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) indicates adrenal insufficiency [^114TdFiY] | Inadequate rise in 11-deoxycortisol indicates adrenal insufficiency [^111sbwED] |
| Utility | Highly sensitive and specific for primary adrenal insufficiency; less sensitive for recent-onset secondary adrenal insufficiency [^112LBu1Z] | More sensitive for secondary adrenal insufficiency but less standardized and more technically demanding [^117LRMPg] | Gold standard for secondary adrenal insufficiency but contraindicated in patients with seizures, cardiovascular disease, or elderly patients [^114TdFiY] | Useful when ACTH tests are inconclusive or unavailable; requires close monitoring [^116xHAND] |

## Special considerations

### Critically ill patients

Random cortisol **< 10 mcg/dL** suggests adrenal insufficiency [^1112hXHb], whereas > 34 mcg/dL generally excludes it [^1177twrz]. A delta cortisol < 9 mcg/dL [^1112hXHb] after ACTH stimulation also suggests adrenal insufficiency. ACTH stimulation tests may be less reliable due to altered cortisol metabolism and binding proteins in critical illness [^112m9DDh].

---

### Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency

Morning cortisol is the **initial test** [^1174L1xv]; levels < 5 mcg/dL suggest adrenal insufficiency, while > 10 mcg/dL generally exclude it [^1162vUxs]. Dynamic testing is reserved for indeterminate cases with cortisol 5–10 mcg/dL [^111hsJH7] [^1174L1xv].

---

## Additional laboratory tests

- **Plasma renin and aldosterone**: Assess mineralocorticoid deficiency in primary adrenal insufficiency [^115TXjkC].

- **21-hydroxylase antibodies**: Identify autoimmune adrenalitis [^11469Efd].

- **Plasma VLCFAs**: Screen for adrenoleukodystrophy in males [^11469Efd].

- **Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone**: Evaluate congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^1169sewq] [^11469Efd].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging includes an **adrenal CT scan** to assess for infiltrative processes, metastases, or hemorrhage [^11469Efd]. Pituitary MRI is used to evaluate pituitary or hypothalamic lesions in secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency [^113AsZ6c].

---

## Limitations and pitfalls

- **Assay variability**: Different cortisol assays may yield varying results; interpret within clinical context [^113n8MFe].

- **Critical illness**: Altered cortisol metabolism and binding proteins may affect test accuracy [^114WCf4X].

- **Glucocorticoid use**: Recent or ongoing glucocorticoid therapy can suppress the HPA axis, leading to false-positive results [^112UURi9].

---

## Clinical management implications

In suspected adrenal crisis, **initiate stress-dose intravenous hydrocortisone** and fluid resuscitation without delay [^117EArrH] [^116CBZ8p]. Patients should be educated on stress dosing and emergency management to prevent adrenal crises [^1174L1xv] [^115nwdEw].

---

Adrenal insufficiency testing involves a **stepwise approach**, starting with morning cortisol and ACTH, followed by dynamic tests such as the ACTH stimulation test, ITT, or metyrapone test. Interpretation must consider clinical context, assay variability, and patient-specific factors, and suspected adrenal crisis requires immediate treatment [^112LBu1Z].

### Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in severe sepsis and septic shock [^1112hXHb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients has relied on random or cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol levels, and has not been corroborated by a more accurate diagnostic standard.

- **Objective**: We used the overnight metyrapone stimulation test to investigate the diagnostic value of the standard cosyntropin stimulation test and the prevalence of sepsis-associated adrenal insufficiency.

- **Methods**: This was an inception cohort study.

- **Measurements and results**: In two consecutive septic cohorts (n = 61 and n = 40), in 44 patients without sepsis, and in 32 healthy volunteers, we measured (1) serum cortisol before and after cosyntropin stimulation, albumin, and corticosteroid-binding globulin levels, and (2) serum corticotropin, cortisol, and 11beta-deoxycortisol levels before and after an overnight metyrapone stimulation. Adrenal insufficiency was defined by postmetyrapone serum 11beta-deoxycortisol levels below 7 microg/dl. More patients with sepsis (31/61 [59% of the original cohort with sepsis] and 24/40 [60% of the validation cohort with sepsis]) met criteria for adrenal insufficiency than patients without sepsis (3/44; 7%) (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Baseline cortisol (< 10 microg/dl), Delta cortisol (< 9 microg/dl), and free cortisol (< 2 microg/dl) had a positive likelihood ratio equal to infinity, 8.46 (95% confidence interval, 1.19–60.25), and 9.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.05–9.54), respectively. The best predictor of adrenal insufficiency (as defined by metyrapone testing) was baseline cortisol of 10 microg/dl or less or Delta cortisol of less.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1152153f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically with respect to the corticotropin stimulation test, the ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering the standard dose test over other existing tests. This includes 250 mcg for adults and children aged 2 years and older, 15 mcg/kg for infants, and 125 mcg for other children under 2 years of age. Peak cortisol levels below 500 nmol/L (18 mcg/dL) at 30 or 60 minutes indicate adrenal insufficiency.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^117EArrH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of primary adrenal insufficiency, specifically the management of adrenal crisis, the 2016 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend initiating immediate therapy with stress-dose intravenous hydrocortisone in patients presenting with symptoms of severe adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis, prior to obtaining results from diagnostic tests.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1174L1xv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We recommend against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. Morning cortisol measurement can serve as a simple approach to HPA axis assessment, eliminating the need for other tests in many patients [see recommendation 2.7].

However, if cortisol remains indeterminate, dynamic testing can be considered. The decision to carry out dynamic testing should take into account availability, feasibility, costs, and regional accessibility. There is no evidence that a specific test in the context of glucocorticoid treatment is superior.

- **Dynamic testing options**: Include 250 µg ACTH (1–24) and, less commonly, overnight metyrapone and insulin tolerance tests.
	- The 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test only examines the direct response of the adrenal gland to supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on the assay, at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative of adrenal insufficiency. As suppression of the HPA axis subsequently results in adrenocortical atrophy with impaired cortisol response, the test may yield less results that are reliable in patients on shorter durations of glucocorticoid therapy.
	- The overnight metyrapone stimulation test and insulin tolerance test are more labor-intensive and can be associated with significant adverse effects. They assess the entire HPA axis, but there are no head-to-head studies comparing different dynamic tests in this patient population.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1178vPcg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). High credibility.

The ES 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining a measurement of plasma ACTH for diagnosing primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI). In patients with confirmed cortisol deficiency, a plasma ACTH level exceeding two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) is indicative of PAI.

### Utility of salivary cortisol measurements in Cushing's syndrome and adrenal insufficiency [^114w2RAM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

The measurement of cortisol in saliva is a simple, reproducible, and reliable test to evaluate the normal and disordered control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. There are a variety of simple methods to obtain saliva samples without stress, making this a robust test applicable to many different experimental and clinical situations.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Ovid Medline and PubMed from 1950 to present were searched using specific strategies. The bibliographies of all relevant citations were evaluated for any additional appropriate citations.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Measurement of an elevated late-night (2300 to 2400 h) salivary cortisol has a greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. Late-night salivary cortisol measurements are also useful to monitor patients for remission and/or recurrence after pituitary surgery for Cushing's disease. Because it is a surrogate for plasma free cortisol, the measurement of salivary cortisol may be useful during an ACTH stimulation test in patients with increased plasma binding protein concentrations due to increased estrogen, or decreased plasma binding protein concentrations during critical illness. Most reference laboratories now offer salivary cortisol testing.

- **Conclusions**: It is expected that the use of the measurement of salivary cortisol will continue to grow in clinical importance.

### Performance of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and baseline cortisol in assessing adrenal insufficiency [^116RrjWS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Diagnosing adrenal insufficiency (AI) often requires complex testing, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is a promising marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function; however, its diagnostic performance has not yet been evaluated in a large-scale study.

- **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of DHEAS and baseline cortisol in assessing AI.

- **Design**: Single-center retrospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Referral center.

- **Patients**: Adults who underwent cosyntropin stimulation testing (CST) between 2005–2023 and had DHEAS measured within 3 months prior to CST.

- **Main outcome measures**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for DHEAS and baseline cortisol. Prevalence of AI based on various DHEAS and baseline cortisol concentrations.

Among 1135 patients, 195 (17.2%) had AI. Both baseline cortisol and DHEAS independently exhibited good diagnostic performance, with AUROC 0.81 (95% CI 0.77–0.84) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.78–0.85), respectively. The time of CST performance had no significant effect on the diagnostic accuracy of baseline cortisol, while recent glucocorticoid use decreased the diagnostic performance of DHEAS (AUROC 0.72 vs. 0.83). Only 1.2% of patients with baseline cortisol ≥ 10 mcg/dL had AI based on CST. Among patients with baseline cortisol between 5–9.9 mcg/dL, only 1.3% had AI if DHEAS was ≥ 60 mcg/dL. Conversely, the majority (72.2%) of patients with both baseline cortisol < 5 mcg/dL and DHEAS < 25 mcg/dL were found to have AI.

DHEAS has good diagnostic performance in assessing AI.

### ACTH Stimulation Tests for the Diagnosis of Adrenal Insufficiency: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis [^1138iNPT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is clinically challenging and often requires ACTH stimulation tests.

- **Objective**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the high- (250 mcg) and low- (1 mcg) dose ACTH stimulation tests in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

- **Methods**: We searched six databases through February 2014. Pairs of independent reviewers selected studies and appraised the risk of bias. Diagnostic association measures were pooled across studies using a bivariate model.

- **Data synthesis**: For secondary adrenal insufficiency, we included 30 studies enrolling 1209 adults and 228 children. High- and low-dose ACTH stimulation tests had similar diagnostic accuracy in adults and children using different peak serum cortisol cutoffs. In general, both tests had low sensitivity and high specificity, resulting in reasonable likelihood ratios for a positive test (adults: high dose, 9.1; low dose, 5.9; children: high dose, 43.5; low dose, 7.7), but a fairly suboptimal likelihood ratio for a negative test (adults: high dose, 0.39; low dose, 0.19; children: high dose, 0.65; low dose, 0.34). For primary adrenal insufficiency, we included five studies enrolling 100 patients. Data were only available to estimate the sensitivity of high-dose ACTH stimulation test (92%; 95% confidence interval, 81–97%).

- **Conclusion**: Both high- and low-dose ACTH stimulation tests had similar diagnostic accuracy. Both tests are adequate to rule in, but not rule out, secondary adrenal insufficiency. Our confidence in these estimates is low to moderate because of the likely risk of bias and heterogeneity in the included studies.

### The biochemical diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency with modern cortisol assays: Reappraisal in the setting of opioid exposure and hospitalization [^113n8MFe]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

The objective of this study was twofold: to examine the diagnosis of opioid-induced adrenal insufficiency and to investigate the diagnostic value of a morning cortisol level 30 days after exposure. The study included two cohorts. Cohort 2 consisted of 854 adults, with or without opioid exposure, who had a morning cortisol level measured on the same day as stimulation testing.

- **Measurements**: Peak cortisol was assessed during cosyntropin stimulation testing. The sensitivity and specificity of morning serum cortisol for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency were evaluated.

- **Results**: The prevalence of adrenal insufficiency in patients with chronic opioid exposure who underwent cosyntropin stimulation testing was 4.0% using a cortisol cutoff of < 405 nmol/L (14.7 µg/dl), compared to 19% using the traditional cutoff of < 500 nmol/L (18.1 µg/dl). For hospitalized patients with and without opioid exposure, 14 out of 22 (64%) patients with morning cortisol levels of < 83 nmol/L (3 µg/dl) passed cosyntropin stimulation testing. A morning cortisol level of < 348 nmol/L (12.6 µg/dl) demonstrated 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval: 84.5%-100%) for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency.

- **Conclusion**: Opioid-induced adrenal insufficiency is rare when applying a cortisol cutoff of < 405 nmol/L (14.7 µg/dl). Nearly 1 out of 6 patients would be reclassified as having adrenal insufficiency using the guideline-recommended cutoff of < 500 nmol/L (18.1 µg/dl).

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112ik7E1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Participants**: The Task Force included a chair selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society, eight additional clinicians experienced with the disease, a methodologist, and a medical writer. Members of the co-sponsoring associations, the European Society of Endocrinology and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, also participated. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration in connection with this review.

- **Evidence**: This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to determine the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

- **Consensus process**: The evidence used to formulate recommendations was derived from two commissioned systematic reviews, as well as other published systematic reviews and studies identified by the Task Force. The guideline was reviewed and approved sequentially by the Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and the Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

- **Conclusions**: We recommend diagnostic tests for the exclusion of primary adrenal insufficiency in all patients with indicative clinical symptoms or signs. In particular, we suggest a low diagnostic (and therapeutic) threshold in acutely ill patients, as well as in patients with predisposition.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^111132b8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The choice of test used to interrogate the HPA axis should be individualized for each patient, and the results should be interpreted within the clinical context and with an understanding of the potential pitfalls of the test used. An alternative test should be performed if the result is borderline and clinical suspicion is high. Clinical vigilance is required, and patients should be made aware of the symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency so that assessment can be repeated if necessary. The results should be interpreted rationally, and those with apparent borderline normal/abnormal results or values suggestive of partial ACTH deficiency could be treated with short courses of stress doses of glucocorticoids during illness only.

### Presentation of primary adrenal insufficiency in childhood [^113TvWc1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is typically diagnosed in infancy or adulthood, and cases presenting in childhood have not been systematically reviewed. Our objective was to determine etiologies, signs, and symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency presenting in childhood. We conducted a retrospective chart review at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital.

Patients involved were children with corticoadrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid deficiency, or mineralocorticoid deficiency. Seventy-seven cases were identified between 1999–2010. Out of these, 35 had congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and were not reviewed further. Forty-two patients, of whom 20 were diagnosed at our institution, had primary adrenal insufficiency. Their etiologies were as follows: autoimmune (18), autoimmune polyendocrinopathy syndrome (an additional five), ACTH resistance (four), adrenoleukodystrophy (three), adrenal hypoplasia congenita (two), adrenal hemorrhage (two), IMAGe syndrome (one), and idiopathic (two).

Regarding the 20 patients diagnosed at our institution, two were being monitored when adrenal insufficiency developed and were not included in the analysis of presenting signs and symptoms. Of the 18 patients, 13 were hypotensive, and 12 had documented hyperpigmentation. Hyponatremia (5.0 mEq/liter) was noted in only nine cases. Hypoglycemia and ketosis were documented in four of 15 and four of six patients in whom it was sought, respectively. Fifteen patients underwent cosyntropin stimulation testing with median baseline and stimulation values.

**Proposed algorithm for endocrine screening and monitoring**: In immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, a baseline and/or post-ICI therapy ACTH stimulation test may be considered in cases of equivocal 8 AM serum cortisol levels. Caution must be used when interpreting the results of the post-ICI therapy ACTH stimulation test, as it may be falsely normal in the setting of acute ACTH and cortisol deficiencies. Additionally, it may be performed at the clinician's discretion, depending on whether the patient reports symptoms of excessive thirst, polydipsia, and hypotonic polyuria.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency [^113FmDe1]. The Lancet. Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency continues to be a challenge for patients, their physicians, and researchers. During the past decade, long-term studies have shown increased mortality and morbidity and impaired quality of life in patients with adrenal insufficiency. These findings might, at least partially, be due to the failure of glucocorticoid replacement therapy to closely resemble physiological diurnal secretion of cortisol. The potential effect of newly developed glucocorticoid drugs is a focus of research, as are the mechanisms potentially underlying increased morbidity and mortality. Adrenal crisis remains a threat to lives, and awareness and preventative measures now receive increasing attention. Awareness should be raised in medical teams and patients about adrenal insufficiency and the management of adrenal crisis to improve clinical outcomes.

### Biochemical diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency: The added value of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate measurements [^1135iuNx]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

To review the biochemical tests used in establishing the challenging diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, we examined relevant literature, including our own data, on various biochemical tests used to determine adrenal function. The advantages and limitations of each approach are discussed.

Baseline measurements of serum cortisol are valuable only when they are very low (≤ 5 μg/dL) or clearly elevated, whereas baseline plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone levels are useful only when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Measurements of baseline serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels are particularly valuable in patients suspected of having adrenal insufficiency. Although low serum DHEA-S levels indicate primary or central adrenal insufficiency, a low level alone is not sufficient for establishing the diagnosis. By contrast, a normal age- and sex-adjusted serum DHEA-S level practically rules out the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Many patients require dynamic biochemical studies, such as the 1-μg cosyntropin test, to assess adrenal function.

In establishing the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency, we recommend measuring baseline serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels. Furthermore, the determination of plasma levels of aldosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and renin activity is necessary when primary adrenal insufficiency is suspected. With a random serum cortisol level of ≥ 12 μg/dL in the ambulatory setting or a normal age- and sex-adjusted DHEA-S level (or both), the diagnosis can be approached with greater confidence.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^113ADgBo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hypopituitarism is a deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones, with adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) deficiency being the most serious and potentially life-threatening condition. It may occur in isolation or, more commonly, as part of widespread pituitary failure. Diagnosis requires demonstrating a subnormal cortisol rise in response to stimulation with hypoglycemia, glucagon, ACTH(1–24), or in the setting of acute illness.

The choice of diagnostic test should be individualized for the patient and clinical scenario. A random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in diagnosing an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis, such as pituitary apoplexy. Often, however, a dynamic assessment of cortisol reserve is needed. The cortisol response is both stimulus and assay-dependent, so normative values should be derived locally. Results must be interpreted within the clinical context and with an understanding of the potential pitfalls of the test used.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically concerning the confirmation of recovery, the ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining morning serum cortisol testing if confirmation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery is desired. It is important to recognize that the value of morning serum cortisol represents a continuum, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis recovery.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111eLqtG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

At least 1% of the population use chronic glucocorticoid therapy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. Virtually every discipline of medicine applies glucocorticoids via multiple modes of administration, including oral, inhaled, intranasal, intra-articular, topical, and intravenous, frequently for a prolonged duration. Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is an inevitable effect of chronic exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly among individuals. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency necessitates careful education and management, and in the rare cases of adrenal crisis, prompt diagnosis and therapy are critical.

Considering the widespread use of glucocorticoids and the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, the present clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid endocrinology specialists, as well as general practitioners and other specialists involved in the care of these patients.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^113AsZ6c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). High credibility.

ACTH deficiency can be congenital or acquired due to structural or functional diseases of the pituitary or hypothalamus. It can occur in isolation or as part of more widespread pituitary failure. The most common cause of ACTH deficiency is ACTH suppression and subsequent adrenal atrophy due to chronic glucocorticoid use.

- **Causes of central hypoadrenalism**: Interrogation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis may be required acutely or in a more routine setting. The clinical scenario can mandate which test is performed. For example, a random cortisol and ACTH level may be adequate in making a diagnosis in an acutely ill patient with a suspected adrenal crisis, such as pituitary apoplexy. In other situations, a low morning cortisol level in an at-risk patient may also be sufficient in diagnosing ACTH/cortisol deficiency. Often, however, dynamic assessment of cortisol reserves is needed.

In hypopituitarism, there is generally a specific sequential failure of pituitary hormones with GH being the most common pituitary hormone affected, followed by gonadotrophins and culminating in the loss of ACTH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). ACTH, however, can be the first or only pituitary hormone affected in certain situations, such as lymphocytic hypophysitis or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by exogenous glucocorticoids.

Detection and treatment of central hypoadrenalism are important, as it has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116CBZ8p]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

- **Adrenal crisis diagnosis**: Adrenal crisis is a clinical diagnosis and should be suspected in patients with recent use of any glucocorticoid formulation who present with hypotension, collapse, or acute abdominal symptoms. Hyponatremia may also be associated. A high degree of clinical suspicion is paramount, as patients may not have been tested for suspected glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency prior to the acute event, and adrenal crisis may be the first manifestation of the disease. Treatment must not be delayed by laboratory or imaging investigations.

- **Treatment protocol**: If an established or impending adrenal crisis is suspected, the patient should immediately receive an injection of 100 mg of hydrocortisone intravenously or intramuscularly, followed by rapid volume resuscitation with 0.9% saline solution (or equivalent) administered intravenously. Patients with confirmed adrenal crisis should be maintained on hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg per 24 hours, preferably by continuous intravenous infusion, or alternatively by intravenous or intramuscular injection of 50 mg every 6 hours, until clinical recovery and further guidance by an endocrinology specialist.

- **Considerations for high body weight**: In patients with very high body weight, higher doses might be considered. Some centers use equivalent parenteral doses of other glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone; however, head-to-head comparison data of different treatment strategies for adrenal crisis are lacking. Identifiable potential triggers should be managed accordingly.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients: Consensus statements from an international task force by the American College of Critical Care Medicine [^1177twrz]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

To develop consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of corticosteroid insufficiency in critically ill adult patients, a multidisciplinary and multispecialty task force of experts in critical care medicine was convened. Members were drawn from the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Additionally, international experts in endocrinology were invited to participate.

The task force members reviewed published literature and provided expert opinion from which the consensus was derived. The consensus statements were developed using a modified Delphi methodology. The strength of each recommendation was quantified using the Modified GRADE system, classifying recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2) and the quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C). These classifications were based on factors such as study design, consistency of results, and directness of evidence.

The task force coined the term "critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency" to describe the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during critical illness. This condition is caused by adrenal insufficiency combined with tissue corticosteroid resistance and is characterized by an exaggerated and protracted proinflammatory response. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency should be suspected in hypotensive patients who have responded poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents.

### Adrenal insufficiency [^116teUgf]. Lancet (2014). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is the clinical manifestation of deficient production or action of glucocorticoids, with or without deficiency in mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens. It is a life-threatening disorder that can result from primary adrenal failure or secondary adrenal disease due to impairment of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Prompt diagnosis and management are essential.

The clinical manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency result from the deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones and can also include signs of other autoimmune conditions. In secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency, the clinical picture results primarily from glucocorticoid deficiency, but manifestations of the primary pathological disorder can also be present.

The diagnostic investigation, although well-established, can be challenging, especially in patients with secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency. We summarize the current knowledge on the epidemiology, causal mechanisms, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of this disorder.

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: A review [^111cmN7E]. JAMA (2025). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency is a syndrome of cortisol deficiency categorized as primary, secondary, or glucocorticoid-induced. Although primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency are rare, affecting fewer than 279 per 1 million individuals, glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is common.

- **Observations**: Primary adrenal insufficiency involves a deficiency of all adrenocortical hormones and is caused by autoimmune destruction, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pharmacological inhibition (e.g. high doses of azole antifungal therapy), infection (e.g. tuberculosis, fungal infections), or surgical removal of adrenal cortical tissue. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by disorders affecting the pituitary gland, such as tumors, hemorrhage, inflammatory or infiltrative conditions (e.g. hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis), surgery, radiation therapy, or medications that suppress corticotropin production, such as opioids. Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is caused by the administration of supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids. Patients with adrenal insufficiency typically present with nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue (50%-95%), nausea and vomiting (20%-62%), and anorexia and weight loss (43%-73%). Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should be suspected in patients who have recently tapered or discontinued a supraphysiological dose of glucocorticoids. Early-morning (approximately 8 a.m.) measurements of serum cortisol, corticotropin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency.

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

- **General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education**:
	- R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on, or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist.
	- R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy (good clinical practice).
	- R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy (good clinical practice).

- **Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome**:

### The low-dose ACTH stimulation test: Is 30 minutes long enough [^1125j4vm]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Controversy persists regarding the use of the low-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test (LDST) for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) and optimal test result interpretation. Many centers are now using the LDST to assess cortisol secretion adequacy, with some relying solely on a 30-minute cortisol level to determine adrenal sufficiency or AI. This study examined both 30- and 60-minute cortisol levels to assess whether the interpretation of the test was affected when both cortisol levels were taken into consideration.

Data were obtained by retrospective chart review from a single pediatric endocrinology unit over a 7-year period. We identified 82 patients who completed the LDST. Their mean age was 11.7 years, and 37% were female. Cortisol levels were evaluated at baseline and 30 and 60 minutes after cosyntropin administration. A cutoff value ≥ 18 μg/dL was used to define adrenal sufficiency.

We found that 54% of patients reached peak cortisol levels at 60 minutes, and 11 patients who did not pass the test at 30 minutes did so at 60 minutes. The only predictive characteristic was weight status; overweight and obese individuals tended to peak at 30 minutes, while normal and underweight individuals tended to peak at 60 minutes.

Although further studies are necessary to confirm our findings, it appears that measuring cortisol both 30 and 60 minutes following synthetic ACTH administration may be necessary to avoid overdiagnosing AI.

### Diagnosing adrenal insufficiency: which test is best — the 1-microg or the 250-microg cosyntropin stimulation test [^117LRMPg]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To review the available literature on the low-dose cosyntropin stimulation test (CST) for the diagnosis of primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency in both nonstressed and acutely ill patients, we performed a MEDLINE search of all English-language literature, published between 1965 and 2007, in which the 1-microg and the 250-microg CSTs were compared in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.

The majority of published evidence suggests that the 1-microg CST is more sensitive than the 250-microg CST for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency in nonstressed patients. In patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, the low-dose CST is unlikely to add any diagnostic sensitivity to the high-dose CST. In critically ill patients, the 1-microg test is also likely to be more sensitive than the 250-microg test when an appropriate cutoff value is used (25 microg/dL).

The 1-microg CST, with a cortisol level determined at 30 minutes after stimulation and using a cutoff level of 18 to 20 microg/dL in nonstressed patients and less than 25 microg/dL or an increment of less than 9 microg/dL from baseline in critically ill patients, is the best test currently available for establishing the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Clinical Question III: What Is the Diagnostic Accuracy of a Morning Cortisol Value vs 250 μg ACTH (1–24) Test in Diagnosing Glucocorticoid-Induced Adrenal Insufficiency?

Three studies were included. The GRADE evidence table is shown in Supplementary Table S7, and details of the studies are presented in Supplementary Table S8 (see section on Supplementary material). All studies assessed the diagnostic performance of a morning serum cortisol value versus a 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test.

Of note, in the studies by Sagar et al. and Sbardella et al, ACTH (1–24) was administered intramuscularly or intravenously, and results could not be stratified for intravenous ACTH (1–24) only. Both studies measured cortisol by immunoassay. In the study by Sagar et al, 100% of patients with morning cortisol 350 nmol/L (> 12.6 μg/dL) passed the ACTH (1–24) test (see Supplementary Table S8 for cut-off values for ACTH (1–24) testing in included studies).

The results of the study by Sbardella et al. showed that morning cortisol ≥ 336 nmol/L (≥ 12.1 μg/dL) had a specificity of 100% for predicting a normal ACTH (1–24) test, and morning cortisol ≤ 124 nmol/L (≤ 4.5 μg/dL) was 100% sensitive for predicting failure. Positive and negative predictive values were not reported.

Debono et al. found that a baseline serum cortisol > 310 nmol/L (> 11.2 μg/dL) measured by immunoassay excluded glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency with a sensitivity of 98% and a negative predictive value of 97% (data retrieved after contacting the authors).

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1142FRtj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoids used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration are more likely to experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients exhibiting features of exogenous Cushing's syndrome are more likely to face challenges during a glucocorticoid taper due to glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

A slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, the baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal. Symptoms worsened once the total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (e.g. 7.5 mg prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess. This scoring may also be applied to patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids, assisting in decisions on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper — a slower taper for those with a high clinical severity score and a more rapid taper for those with a lower score. In patients experiencing severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower glucocorticoid taper, temporarily increasing the glucocorticoid dose may be considered.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111hsJH7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

In patients with higher serum cortisol levels but below 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), HPA axis recovery is possible. In such cases, we suggest that the most cost-effective and practical strategy is for these patients to continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement and have morning serum cortisol re-checked every few weeks until recovery occurs. If cortisol levels remain between 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL) and 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL), dynamic testing can be considered.

In a study of patients with suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, morning cortisol ≥ 354 nmol/L (12.8 μg/dL) predicted normal adrenal function with 100% sensitivity. One might also extrapolate some cut-off values from experiences with therapy of endogenous Cushing syndrome. In patients recovering from endogenous hypercortisolism, morning cortisol ≥ 276 nmol/L (10.0 μg/dL) was associated with no reported symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome or instances of adrenal crisis. Given these considerations, and the fact that there is substantial variability in the calibration between different cortisol assays, we consider cortisol values greater than 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) to be a reasonable threshold to indicate recovery of HPA function following glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111CpFsb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The results of the systematic reviews were structured around clinical questions, eligibility criteria, and the definition of endpoints. At the start of the guideline process, the working group formulated clinical questions regarding the evaluation of adrenal function and the treatment of patients after long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid exposure. These clinical questions, which formed the basis for the systematic reviews, are summarized in Supplementary Table S2 (see section on Supplementary Material).

Eligible articles were required to present data on adult patients (≥ 18 years). Articles that presented data on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency based on biochemical testing were included based on the use of the high-dose (250 μg) short ACTH (1–24) test (also referred to by brand names such as Synacthen or cosyntropin test), as these tests are widely used in clinical practice. During this test, 250 μg of synthetic ACTH (ACTH (1–24), or another corticotropic agent) is administered intravenously. To determine adrenal response to synthetic ACTH, serum cortisol levels are measured 30 and 60 minutes after administration. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, peak cortisol levels < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on the assay, are indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Since the population under study was assessed for glucocorticoid insufficiency, the definition of a positive test was based on cutoff values provided in the individual articles.

Summary and interpretation of evidence from the systematic reviews:

- **Clinical question I**: What is the incidence of recovery of HPA axis function in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency?

Broersen et al. performed a meta-analysis on eleven out of seventeen studies re-testing patients for biochemical adrenal insufficiency. The results were categorized into short-term (defined as less than 4 weeks) high-dose glucocorticoid therapy re-testing after 4 weeks (six studies), and long-term (> 1 year) medium-dose glucocorticoid therapy re-testing after 6 months (five studies).

Included articles had to use a cutoff value for serum cortisol of ≤ 500 nmol/L (18 μg/dL) or higher (e.g. ≤ 550 nmol/L or 19.8 μg/dL) or 11-deoxycortisol of ≤ 200 nmol/L (7.2 μg/dL) after the metyrapone test to diagnose adrenal insufficiency. Pooled analysis of studies in the first group (141 patients) demonstrated a decrease in adrenal insufficiency from 38.7% after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy to 14.9% after 4 weeks. Pooled analysis of studies in the second group (174 patients) indicated a decrease in adrenal insufficiency from 56.4% at baseline to 25.3% after 6 months.

### "Relative" adrenal insufficiency in critical illness [^112Dwsum]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

To present a recommended approach to the problem of "relative" adrenal insufficiency (RAI) in the intensive care unit (ICU), we examine historical data that support the traditional concepts of adrenal insufficiency. The increase in cortisol secretion during stress is needed to survive the stress. The controversial use of treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) in patients with sepsis and septic shock in the ICU is briefly discussed for its potential survival benefit.

During the past decade, the concept of RAI as the failure of cortisol secretion to respond effectively during stress has gained prominence. In some studies, it has been suggested that as many as 75% of patients in an ICU setting have RAI. Experimental support for the concept is not possible because there is no clinically useful laboratory measure of GC action. Therefore, diagnosis is generally based on interpretation of the cosyntropin stimulation test.

The best clinical judgment should always guide the interpretation of test results, and sharp categorization of patients based on a single cutoff criterion should be avoided. Overall, the concept of RAI has no clinical utility. In these cases, the administration of GCs adds cost without benefit and with increased risk.

### Consensus statement on the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with primary adrenal insufficiency [^115nwdEw]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI), or Addison's disease, is a rare, potentially deadly, but treatable condition. Most cases of PAI are caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortex. Consequently, patients with PAI are at a higher risk of developing other autoimmune diseases. The diagnosis of PAI is often delayed by many months, and most patients present with symptoms of acute adrenal insufficiency. Because PAI is rare, even medical specialists in this therapeutic area rarely manage more than a few patients.

Currently, the procedures for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of this rare disease vary greatly within Europe. The common autoimmune form of PAI is characterized by the presence of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies; other causes should be sought if no autoantibodies are detected. Acute adrenal crisis is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. Standard replacement therapy consists of multiple daily doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate combined with fludrocortisone.

Annual follow-up by an endocrinologist is recommended with a focus on the optimization of replacement therapy and detection of new autoimmune diseases. Patient education to enable self-adjustment of dosages of replacement therapy and crisis prevention is particularly important in this disease.

The authors of this document have collaborated within an EU project (Euadrenal) to study the pathogenesis, describe the natural course, and improve the treatment for Addison's disease. Based on a synthesis of this research, the available literature, and the views and experiences of the community, guidelines have been developed.

### The approach to the adult with newly diagnosed adrenal insufficiency [^1151VFKR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency, primarily presenting as an adrenal crisis, is a life-threatening emergency and requires prompt therapeutic management, including fluid resuscitation and stress dose hydrocortisone administration. Primary adrenal insufficiency is most frequently caused by autoimmune adrenalitis, while hypothalamic-pituitary tumors represent the most frequent cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency. The exact underlying diagnosis needs to be confirmed by a stepwise diagnostic approach, with an open eye for other differential diagnostic possibilities.

Chronic replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and, in primary adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoids requires careful monitoring. However, replacement strategies still require optimization, as evidenced by recent studies demonstrating significantly impaired subjective health status and increased mortality in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Future studies will have to explore the potential of dehydroepiandrosterone replacement and modified delayed-release hydrocortisone to improve the prospects of patients with adrenal insufficiency.

### Adrenal function testing in pediatric cancer survivors [^11462qvu]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Central adrenal insufficiency is observed after cranial radiation therapy for cancer. Screening at-risk patients is recommended, but the best screening strategy is unknown.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of pediatric cancer survivors who underwent hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal axis testing was conducted. Data included cancer diagnosis, radiotherapy dose, other endocrinopathies, and adrenal function testing. Adrenal testing included sequential low-dose corticotropin test (LDCT) and standard-dose corticotropin test (SDCT). 8 a.m. serum cortisol levels were compared to LDCT results. LDCT results were compared by radiotherapy dose and according to the presence of endocrine comorbidities.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight subjects (56% male, mean age at diagnosis 6.5 years) underwent testing. 67.9% had been treated with radiotherapy to the hypothalamus/pituitary. Mean time to diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was 6.8 years after cancer diagnosis. Adequate adrenal function was found in 65% of patients by LDCT and 89% by SDCT. Only 21% of patients had basal serum cortisols collected at 8 a.m. Agreement between 8 a.m. baseline cortisol and LDCT was fair. Agreement between random baseline cortisol and LDCT was poor. Prevalence of central adrenal insufficiency diagnosed by LDCT increased with radiotherapy dose (8% for 10–19.9 Gy; 83% for ≥ 40 Gy) and the number of endocrine comorbidities.

- **Conclusions**: In pediatric cancer survivors, central adrenal insufficiency was common even in patients receiving < 40 Gy to the hypothalamus/pituitary. We recommend use of LDCT, not 8 a.m. cortisol levels, for screening.

### Clinical utility of stimulation tests in infants with suspected adrenal insufficiency (AI) [^11295UQQ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in infants can be difficult. While a low random cortisol level can signal AI, confirmatory tests are often required when clinical suspicion is strong but cortisol levels are equivocal. Several studies have demonstrated that in sick preterm infants, there is relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI), defined as inadequate cortisol production relative to the degree of stress or illness. This condition can last for several weeks, whereas in term infants, the adrenal axis is mature at birth. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation tests have been validated in infants in several studies.

In light of recent reports of false-negative results from stimulation tests, it is imperative to highlight the pitfalls associated with these tests. The purpose of this communication is to bring attention to the accuracy and timing of these tests in infants.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117LZC7D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Evidence for the majority of the above recommendations regarding glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is low or very low. Therefore, future epidemiology research needs to define the true risk of clinical adrenal crisis and adrenal insufficiency. Additional data regarding morbidity and mortality of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is required to understand the associated health risk, which will ultimately define the approach to care for patients tapering long-term glucocorticoid therapy. There is a need for further definition of risk factors contributing to the development and susceptibility of adrenal insufficiency, such as genetic predisposition, environmental influences, concomitant medication, and underlying disease for which glucocorticoid therapy is initiated.

Biomedical and psychosocial research into the understanding of glucocorticoid withdrawal is warranted, ideally providing clinical scoring systems or biomarkers to better differentiate glucocorticoid withdrawal from glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Established dynamic tests for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency identify a relatively large proportion of patients with biochemical HPA axis insufficiency following glucocorticoid therapy. Yet, there is only a very low reported number of patients that develop clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency, and only an exceedingly low number of patients develop adrenal crisis. Therefore, more specific and predictive tests and follow-up parameters (including salivary cortisol and potentially continuous monitoring) are necessary.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Due to the ease and convenience of testing, coupled with experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after withholding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of the HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy. The test should be conducted only after achieving a physiologic equivalent daily dose, such as prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose. Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, overnight metyrapone test, and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited. Importantly, test results are rarely related to clinically relevant outcomes.

- **Timing of assessment**: Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids, excluding dexamethasone. It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of the HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency. Yet, even among those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. Despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency, the prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency is low.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for liver cirrhosis, especially in the evaluation of relative adrenal insufficiency, the EASL 2018 guidelines recommend considering salivary cortisol determination. This is because serum free cortisol concentration can be influenced by the reduced serum levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin and albumin, which are frequently seen in patients with cirrhosis.

### Adrenal function testing in dialysis patients - a review of the literature [^113CKSd9]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate a systematic review and meta-analysis on the validity of adrenal function testing in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy.

- **Adrenal function during HD**: We found limited data available regarding tests of adrenal function during hemodialysis (HD). All published studies have performed the tests before or in between HD sessions. Only Deck et al. addressed the clearance of cortisol during HD, demonstrating lower cortisol levels during HD compared to after HD. This effect is most likely explained by the dialyzation of free cortisol, as compared to protein-bound cortisol. There is evidence that this decrease in plasma cortisol leads to counter-regulatory adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, resulting in an increase in cortisol production during the next four hours.

- **ACTH testing before HD**: Limited data exists on ACTH testing before HD or on a non-HD day. ACTH-stimulated cortisol significantly increased in most studies. However, there was a trend towards blunted and delayed cortisol responses after low-dose (1 μg) ACTH testing in HD patients.

- **Basal cortisol levels**: All sixteen studies reported basal cortisol levels, but only some also measured basal ACTH. Basal cortisol was more frequently used for evaluating an intact hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients on renal replacement therapy, despite its inherent limitations for interpretation.

The meta-analysis of baseline serum cortisol levels revealed no significant difference between cases and controls regarding basal serum cortisol, indicating that basal cortisol values are comparable to reference values in patients.

### Metopirone [^116xHAND]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: The use of Metopirone can lead to important health considerations.

	- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Metopirone may induce acute adrenal insufficiency, especially in patients with reduced adrenal secretory capacity or global pituitary insufficiency. Before using Metopirone as a test, the ability of the adrenals to respond to exogenous ACTH should be demonstrated. The test must be performed in a hospital with close monitoring if adrenal insufficiency is suspected. In the presence of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, the response to the Metopirone test may be subnormal. If the adrenocortical or anterior pituitary function is more severely compromised than what the test results indicate, Metopirone may trigger adrenal insufficiency. This can be managed by administering appropriate doses of corticosteroids.

	- **Dizziness and sedation**: Metopirone may cause dizziness and sedation, advising patients not to drive or operate machinery until these effects have subsided.

### How should we interrogate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in patients with suspected hypopituitarism [^111sbwED]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The CRF test has been proposed for the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency and for distinguishing between secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency. CRF (100 mcg) is injected intravenously, and ACTH and cortisol are measured every 15 minutes for 90 minutes. Patients with secondary adrenal failure have low ACTH levels that fail to respond to CRF, while patients with tertiary (hypothalamic) failure show a prolonged and exaggerated rise in ACTH levels following CRF. The CRF test is not widely used to assess the HPA axis due to its unacceptably low sensitivity.

- **Overnight metyrapone test**: The overnight metyrapone test assesses the negative feedback rather than stress-related cortisol responses by utilizing the capacity of metyrapone to inhibit 11β-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for converting 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, thereby stimulating ACTH production and consequently increasing 11-deoxycortisol levels. Some studies have reported the metyrapone test to be reliable; however, other authors have raised concerns about its sensitivity and specificity when using the traditional post-metyrapone 11-deoxycortisol level > 200 nmol/L to define normality. The diagnostic accuracy of the metyrapone test can be improved by integrating cortisol and ACTH levels with 11-deoxycortisol measurements. Nevertheless, the assay for 11-deoxycortisol is a manual assay and is not available in most laboratories, which limits the use of this test, particularly as a first-line assessment of the HPA axis.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117KL5Q6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We suggest that in patients with recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose. Patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation.

- **Management guidelines**: Figure 3 illustrates the management of patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, especially in the presence of suspected adrenal crisis or during exposure to stress.

- **Regimen suggestions**: Table 8 provides suggested glucocorticoid regimens for patients at risk of or with diagnosed glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency during exposure to stress.

- **Rationale**: Adrenal crisis, also known as acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis, can occur in patients taking oral supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids if drug availability suddenly decreases, such as with missed doses or gastroenteritis. It is a life-threatening emergency that must be promptly recognized and treated. Thus, timely therapy is essential and takes precedence over evaluating other causes of symptoms consistent with adrenal crisis. Adrenal crisis is characterized by the inability of the adrenal cortex to produce enough cortisol in response to stressors such as infections, trauma, and surgery. The pathophysiology of adrenal crisis is complex and not fully understood, but it is invariably characterized by these insufficiencies.

### The utility of the corticotropin test to diagnose adrenal insufficiency in critical illness: an update [^112m9DDh]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

One of the most common dynamic testing procedures for assessing adrenocortical function is the standard corticotropin or cosyntropin test. The aim of this review was to examine the evidence base underlying the corticotropin test in the management of critically ill patients.

- **Data synthesis**: The principle behind the corticotropin test is the demonstration of an inappropriately low cortisol production in response to exogenous ACTH, a situation analogous to physiological stress. The corticotropin test was originally described in nonstressed subjects, and its applicability and interpretation in the setting of critical illness continue to generate controversy. Determining the prevalence of an abnormal corticotropin test in critical illness is complicated by the use of different endpoints and populations. Moreover, the test result is also influenced by the assay used for measurement of plasma cortisol. Trials assessing the relationship between corticotropin response, severity of stress, and organ dysfunction have produced divergent results, which may reflect differences in the methodology and the association being measured. Furthermore, controversy exists with respect to the methodology and interpretation regarding the dose of corticotropin, endpoints for assessment of total or free cortisol, effect of plasma cortisol variability, adrenal blood flow, and its equivalence with other tests of adrenocortical function.

- **Conclusions**: The corticotropin test is widely used in the evaluation of adrenocortical function in critically ill patients.

### Evaluation and management of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients: Disease state review [^114WCf4X]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The definition of normal adrenal function in critically ill patients remains controversial despite a large body of literature. This paper reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of adrenal insufficiency in critically ill patients and discusses the authors' personal approach to patient management.

- **Methods**: Extensive literature review, guidelines from professional societies, and personal experience.

- **Results**: A decrease in cortisol breakdown rather than an increase in cortisol production has been suggested as the main contributor to elevated cortisol levels in critically ill patients. The concept of relative adrenal insufficiency has multiple pathophysiologic flaws and is not supported by evidence. Patients with septic shock who are pressor-dependent or refractory to fluid resuscitation may receive a short course of hydrocortisone regardless of their serum cortisol levels or their response to a cosyntropin stimulation test (CST). Patients without septic shock who are suspected to have adrenal insufficiency should have their random cortisol levels measured. In patients with low and near-normal cortisol-binding proteins, a serum cortisol of 1.8 μg/dL has been noted, although further studies are needed to define a normal range in critically ill patients based on both severity and duration of illness.

### Diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis in the emergency department [^111Ncj1V]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency can result in significant patient morbidity and mortality, but due to the range of symptoms and variable clinical course and etiologies, it can be a challenging condition to diagnose and manage.

- **Objective**: This narrative review discusses the evaluation of an adult patient at risk for a new diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and the management of a patient with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency.

- **Discussion**: A new presentation of adrenal insufficiency can range from nonspecific, minor symptoms, including fatigue, to a life-threatening adrenal crisis with hemodynamic instability. Due to the variety of signs and symptoms, the diagnosis is often missed. Those with known adrenal insufficiency are at risk for adrenal crisis, which may occur due to a variety of triggers. Initial evaluation includes assessment for the underlying etiology or concomitant condition, laboratory analysis, and imaging when clinically indicated. Although not necessary for evaluation in the emergency department setting, the diagnosis is confirmed by specific testing such as the cosyntropin stimulation test. The mainstay of treatment in adrenal crisis is hydrocortisone, intravenous fluid, glucose repletion, and treatment of the underlying acute trigger.

- **Conclusions**: Emergency clinicians must be prepared to recognize, evaluate, and manage those with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis.

### Secondary adrenal insufficiency: Recent updates and new directions for diagnosis and management [^111QFfsb]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency is the most common subtype of adrenal insufficiency. It is caused by certain medications and pituitary destruction, such as pituitary masses, inflammation, or infiltration, and is rarely associated with specific germline variants. In this review, we discuss the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical presentation of secondary adrenal insufficiency while focusing on the diagnostic and management challenges. We also review the management of selected special populations of patients and discuss patient-important outcomes associated with secondary adrenal insufficiency.

### Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency [^112LBu1Z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The cosyntropin stimulation test is the initial endocrine evaluation of suspected primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

- **Purpose**: To critically review the utility of the cosyntropin stimulation test for evaluating adrenal insufficiency.

- **Data sources**: The MEDLINE database was searched from 1966 to 2002 for all English-language papers related to the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.

- **Study selection**: Studies with fewer than 5 persons with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency or with fewer than 10 persons as normal controls were excluded. For secondary adrenal insufficiency, only studies that stratified participants by integrated tests of adrenal function were included.

- **Data extraction**: Summary receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated from all studies that provided sensitivity and specificity data for 250-microg and 1-microg cosyntropin tests; these curves were then compared using area under the curve (AUC) methods. All estimated values are given with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Data synthesis**: At a specificity of 95%, sensitivities were 97%, 57%, and 61% for summary ROC curves in tests for primary adrenal insufficiency (250-microg cosyntropin test), secondary adrenal insufficiency (250-microg cosyntropin test), and secondary adrenal insufficiency (1-microg cosyntropin test), respectively. The area under the curve for primary adrenal insufficiency was significantly greater than the AUC for secondary adrenal insufficiency for the high-dose cosyntropin test (P < 0.001), but AUCs for the 250-microg and 1-microg cosyntropin tests did not differ significantly.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117VUNJE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The methods used for guideline development have been described in detail previously. In short, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used as a methodological basis. The first step was to define the clinical questions followed by systematic literature searches. We estimated an average effect for specific outcomes where possible and rated the quality of the evidence behind the recommendations as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), or strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Not all recommendations were formally graded.

Considered for the recommendations were the quality of the evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, and individual values and preferences such as patient preferences, goals for health, costs, management inconvenience, and feasibility of implementation. The recommendations are worded as "recommend" for a strong recommendation or "suggest" for a weak recommendation. The meaning of a strong recommendation is that all reasonably informed persons (clinicians, policymakers, and patients) would want the management in accordance with the recommendation, while for a weak recommendation, most persons would still act in accordance with the guideline, but a substantial number would not. Formal evidence syntheses were performed and graded only for recommendations addressing our initial clinical questions. Recommendations based on good clinical practice and experience were considered but not formally graded.

### A comparison of low-dose ACTH, glucagon stimulation and insulin tolerance test in patients with pituitary disorders [^114TdFiY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency and GH deficiency requires evaluation by dynamic stimulation tests in most cases. Although the insulin tolerance test (ITT) is accepted as the gold-standard test for evaluating both the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and GH-IGF-1 axes, the test is cumbersome. In clinical practice, a low-dose adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is a sensitive, safe, and easily applicable alternative to ITT. Despite taking more time, the glucagon stimulation test (GST) is also a good alternative to ITT and can evaluate both axes.

- **Objective**: The primary aim of this study was to compare the ITT, low-dose ACTH, and GSTs in evaluating HPA and GH-IGF-1 axes in patients with pituitary disorders and to evaluate the repeatability of all three tests.

- **Design**: ITT, low-dose ACTH, and GSTs were performed in all 129 patients, and the tests were repeated in 66 of these patients.

- **Setting**: Erciyes University Medical School, Department of Endocrinology.

- **Participants**: One hundred and twenty-nine adult patients (76 women, 53 men) with pituitary disorder were included in the study.

- **Main outcome measure(s)**: The cortisol and GH responses of patients to dynamic tests.

Results indicated that peak cortisol levels obtained during ITT were significantly lower than the values obtained during both low-dose ACTH and GSTs. Furthermore, peak cortisol levels obtained during the GST were lower than those found during the low-dose ACTH stimulation test. Peak GH responses were found to be higher in GST than in ITT. All three tests demonstrated good reproducibility.
