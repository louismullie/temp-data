## Question

cardiac resynchronization therapy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach decision-making for cardiac resynchronization therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanism and rationale for CRT and its evidence base. Then, I should verify patient selection criteria, including QRS thresholds and morphology, and reconcile any discrepancies. Next, I will evaluate device selection between CRT-P and CRT-D with outcomes, complications, and cost-effectiveness in mind. After that, I need to examine special subgroups such as atrial fibrillation, the elderly, and by sex. I should also assess non-response drivers and optimization or alternative pacing strategies. Finally, I will consider implementation issues like upgrades, timing, underuse, and synthesize a practical clinical algorithm with explicit uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental rationale and mechanism before proceeding to indications, because if I misstate the therapeutic target, the selection logic will falter; CRT resynchronizes ventricular activation in patients with systolic HF and electrical dyssynchrony, improving pump function and reducing HF hospitalizations and mortality, with contemporary guidance anchoring indications in reduced LVEF and prolonged QRS consistent with LBBB physiology [^11192AsQ] [^111C8iMU] [^116xFKRE] [^113Cdxcw].

> Wait, I should verify patient-selection thresholds so I don't conflate older criteria with current ones; guideline-directed CRT is indicated when LVEF is 35% or less with QRS duration typically 130–150 ms or greater, with the most robust benefit at QRS 150 ms or greater and LBBB morphology, and importantly CRT is not recommended when QRS is less than 130 ms in the absence of pacing indications for high-grade AV block [^11192AsQ] [^111C8iMU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptom class; I need to check the gradient of benefit across NYHA classes, and the patient-level meta-analyses support benefit in NYHA III and even ambulatory NYHA IV for composite outcomes, while in milder symptoms the benefit signal is driven by HF events as seen in MADIT-CRT, with mortality benefits less pronounced in early disease stages [^114myLZv] [^115fPaW8] [^114GVogC].

> Let me consider QRS morphology more carefully because it modulates effect size; benefit is consistently stronger in LBBB versus non-LBBB, and several contemporary trials and algorithms preferentially enroll LBBB or assume intact intrinsic RV conduction to leverage fusion, underscoring why morphology matters in the 130–149 ms range [^11192AsQ] [^112uN95A].

> I should confirm the relative benefits and trade-offs of CRT-P versus CRT-D rather than assume defibrillator back-up is always superior; pooled observational and meta-analytic data suggest CRT-D associates with lower mortality overall, but this advantage attenuates after adjustment and appears concentrated in ischemic cardiomyopathy, with cause-of-death analyses showing excess non-sudden deaths in CRT-P cohorts selected to be older and sicker, complicating causal inference [^112g49xh] [^1114NoDm] [^112b6jSp].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I need to double-check the complication burden and costs because they influence shared decision-making; CRT-D carries higher late device-related complication rates and substantially higher cost, which may counterbalance incremental survival benefit in non-ischemic or very elderly patients with high non-arrhythmic competing risk [^114K6nkg] [^113DvpnK].

> Let me synthesize device selection with a risk-tailored lens, but I should state the caveat that prospective head-to-head randomized data are sparse; CRT-D is most compelling for ischemic cardiomyopathy, younger age, and anticipated survival greater than one year, whereas CRT-P is reasonable in advanced age, multiple comorbidities, non-ischemic etiologies with lower SCD risk, and when patients prioritize avoiding ICD-related shocks and complications [^112g49xh] [^113DvpnK].

> I will now examine atrial fibrillation because response hinges on delivered biventricular pacing; in permanent AF, randomized data show no mortality benefit versus ICD alone but a trend toward fewer HF hospitalizations, and effective CRT generally requires strategies to secure near-100% biventricular capture, often via AV node ablation in uncontrolled AF [^114yryFQ] [^116nUGe3].

> Let me verify upgrade indications so I don't omit an important avenue to improve outcomes; guidelines support upgrading patients with worsening HF, LVEF 35% or less, and a high RV pacing burden to CRT, and a contemporary randomized upgrade trial demonstrated improved outcomes with CRT-D upgrade compared to ICD upgrade in high RV-paced, reduced EF patients [^11192AsQ] [^112KUvGv].

> I should review the magnitude and drivers of non-response before proposing optimization steps; about 20–40% do not show clinical or reverse-remodeling benefit, with predictors including non-LBBB or narrower QRS, lateral wall scar, and suboptimal LV lead position, whereas echocardiographic dyssynchrony indices such as in PROSPECT have not reliably predicted response [^111qnSPH] [^113K1RNf] [^114zKnM3].

> Next, I should review optimization and alternative pacing paradigms, but I need to be careful not to overstate long-term benefits; AV/VV optimization can yield acute hemodynamic gains yet lacks consistent durable outcome improvements, adaptive CRT did not beat standard CRT for major outcomes in large contemporary cohorts, and LV-only or fusion pacing strategies can be noninferior or comparable in selected patients with intact AV conduction, though patient selection and algorithms are key [^115Fy5qx] [^115Xn4nY] [^112Ckb9k] [^112uN95A] [^116aQU1V].

> Let me consider the elderly specifically because age often biases device choice; observational cohorts show preserved symptomatic and echocardiographic response across age strata with higher absolute mortality due to competing risks, and complication rates are not necessarily higher, supporting CRT candidacy while individualizing CRT-P versus CRT-D based on life expectancy and cause-of-death risk profile [^1152fyxG] [^114VVwJE] [^116B6G8p].

> I should confirm sex differences because they can meaningfully shift expected benefit; women, especially with LBBB, appear to derive greater benefit from CRT than men in large registries and analyses, though mechanisms may include smaller LV size and higher conduction disease prevalence rather than scar, and confounding is possible [^111VvXbe] [^117SBUtX].

> Hold on, I should verify utilization and appropriateness, as gaps here may outweigh incremental technical optimizations; underuse of CRT persists among eligible patients, CRT-D is often the default in the US, and contemporary AUC mapping shows high rates of appropriate ICD and CRT-D implants but persistent pockets of rarely appropriate use, underscoring the need for adherence to selection criteria [^114k1zsh] [^111ByKNb] [^112CAfqg].

> I need to check whether timing of implantation affects outcomes so I don't miss an actionable lever; registry-linked analyses suggest that implanting CRT during HF hospitalization is associated with lower mortality and HF re-hospitalization versus waiting, though confounding cannot be excluded and randomized timing trials are needed [^115ckCU7] [^1175o7XZ].

> But wait, what about the future trajectory of CRT and how it interfaces with modern HF therapy; contemporary consensus notes that with optimized guideline-directed medical therapy, absolute event rates have fallen and adaptive CRT did not improve hard outcomes over standard CRT, while conduction system pacing is rapidly emerging as a physiologic alternative that may reshape indications pending ongoing randomized trials [^115Xn4nY].

> Let me reconsider and explicitly correct a potential misconception I almost carried forward: I initially thought CRT might be reasonable in QRS durations below 130 ms if dyssynchrony was present on imaging, but the current guideline stance is not to perform CRT in QRS less than 130 ms without pacing indications, and small trials exploring narrow QRS with mechanical dyssynchrony should not override this Class III recommendation in routine practice [^111C8iMU] [^1153Pr55].

> I should now synthesize a practical clinical algorithm while acknowledging uncertainties; prioritize CRT for LVEF 35% or less with QRS 150 ms or greater and LBBB in NYHA II–III (and ambulatory IV) for the strongest mortality and HF hospitalization reduction, consider CRT for QRS 130–149 ms primarily when LBBB is present, tailor CRT-D to ischemic etiology and younger, lower-comorbidity patients with meaningful life expectancy, reserve CRT-P for older, multimorbid, non-ischemic profiles or when patient preferences favor avoiding ICD therapy, secure high biventricular pacing in AF often via AV node ablation, upgrade high RV-paced, reduced-EF patients, and mitigate non-response by targeting lateral or latest-activation LV lead positions and avoiding scar while recognizing that routine echo-dyssynchrony indices do not predict benefit [^11192AsQ] [^111C8iMU] [^114myLZv] [^112g49xh] [^114yryFQ] [^112KUvGv] [^114zKnM3] [^113K1RNf].

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a device-based therapy for **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction** and electrical dyssynchrony, delivered via biventricular pacing to improve ventricular synchrony and function. CRT is indicated for patients with **LVEF ≤ 35%**, **NYHA class II–IV symptoms** despite optimal medical therapy, and **QRS ≥ 130 ms** (especially LBBB) [^114GVogC] [^11192AsQ], but is not recommended when QRS < 130 ms without a pacing indication [^111C8iMU]. CRT **reduces mortality** and **heart failure hospitalizations** [^115Xn4nY], and improves quality of life [^11192AsQ], with the greatest benefit in LBBB and QRS ≥ 150 ms [^114GVogC]; however, about 30% do not respond [^113K1RNf], often due to suboptimal selection or lead placement [^111qnSPH]. CRT-D is preferred in **ischemic cardiomyopathy** or higher **arrhythmic risk** [^112g49xh] [^1114NoDm], whereas CRT-P may be chosen in **nonischemic disease**, older age, or high comorbidity burden [^111oB4Vi]. Emerging alternatives, such as conduction system pacing [^111qnSPH] and wireless LV stimulation [^113K1RNf], are under study for nonresponders or challenging anatomy.

---

## Mechanism of action

CRT works by **synchronizing ventricular contraction** via biventricular pacing, improving cardiac output, reducing mitral regurgitation, and promoting reverse remodeling [^11192AsQ]; collectively, these effects enhance symptoms, reduce hospitalizations [^111qnSPH], and improve survival [^116xFKRE].

---

## Indications and patient selection

According to the **2021 ESC guidelines**, CRT is indicated for patients with:

- **LVEF ≤ 35%** and NYHA class II–IV symptoms despite optimal medical therapy [^11192AsQ].
- **QRS duration ≥ 130 ms**, particularly with LBBB morphology [^114GVogC] [^11192AsQ].
- **Upgrade from pacemaker/ICD**: Consider if LVEF ≤ 35%, worsening HF despite optimal therapy, and significant RV pacing burden [^11192AsQ] [^112KUvGv].

CRT is not recommended for patients with **QRS duration < 130 ms** without a pacing indication [^111C8iMU].

---

## Clinical benefits

CRT provides **significant clinical benefits**, including:

- **Reduced mortality**: 23% reduction in all-cause mortality [^115Xn4nY].
- **Reduced hospitalizations**: 41% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations [^115Xn4nY] [^114GVogC].
- **Improved quality of life**: Enhanced functional status and quality of life [^11192AsQ].

The **greatest benefits** are observed in patients with **LBBB morphology and QRS duration ≥ 150 ms** [^114GVogC].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its benefits, CRT has **limitations**:

- **Nonresponse rate**: Approximately 30% of patients do not respond clinically [^113K1RNf].
- **Patient selection**: Suboptimal selection and characterization of conduction disease [^111qnSPH] [^114zKnM3].
- **Procedural constraints**: Technical difficulties in lead placement and device programming [^113Cdxcw].
- **Complications**: Lead dislodgement, infection, and device-related complications [^114K6nkg] [^113d7cao].

---

## CRT-P vs. CRT-D

CRT can be delivered as a **pacemaker (CRT-P)** or with **defibrillator backup (CRT-D)**. CRT-D is preferred in patients with **ischemic cardiomyopathy** or higher **arrhythmic risk**, providing additional protection against **sudden cardiac death** [^1114NoDm] [^112g49xh], whereas CRT-P is considered in patients with **nonischemic cardiomyopathy**, older age, or significant comorbidities where arrhythmic risk is lower [^111oB4Vi].

---

## Emerging technologies and future directions

Emerging technologies aim to improve CRT outcomes with **conduction system pacing** (His-bundle and left bundle branch area pacing), a physiological alternative to traditional biventricular pacing [^111qnSPH], and with wireless LV stimulation designed to overcome anatomical and technical limitations [^113K1RNf]. Advanced imaging seeks to improve patient selection and optimize lead placement strategies [^111qnSPH].

---

CRT is an effective therapy for selected heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction and electrical dyssynchrony, **improving survival and reducing hospitalizations** [^115Xn4nY]. Ongoing research and emerging technologies aim to address nonresponse and optimize outcomes [^111qnSPH].

### Alternative left ventricular pacing approaches for optimal cardiac resynchronization therapy [^113K1RNf]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves mortality, morbidity, and quality of life in selected heart failure patients with severe left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction impairment. However, between 20% and 40% of device recipients do not benefit clinically from CRT. Some anatomical and technical difficulties are related to the coronary venous implantation site via the coronary sinus (CS). Additionally, electrical constraints have been described, and the CS does not always correspond to the optimal LV lead position.

In the last decade, engineers and physicians have worked together to overcome the challenging LV lead implantation, and various biventricular pacing alternatives have been developed to improve CRT response. In this review, we discuss the evolution from CS pacing to wireless LV stimulation and His-bundle pacing.

CRT‐P recipients are older and have more advanced heart failure and comorbidity than those receiving CRT‐D. These differences notwithstanding, the addition of the ICD associates with a relative reduction in the risk of all‐cause mortality in CRT patients, especially in the context of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The benefit of CRT‐D compared with CRT‐P in those with non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy is less clear.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy using a pacemaker or a defibrillator: Patient selection and evidence to support it [^111oB4Vi]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment for patients with heart failure (HF), myocardial dysfunction, and prolonged ventricular depolarization on a surface electrocardiogram. CRT can be delivered by a pacemaker (CRT-P) or a combined pacemaker-defibrillator (CRT-D). Although these two types of devices vary significantly in size, function, and cost, published guidelines do not distinguish between them. This leaves the choice of which device to implant to the treating physician and the informed patient.

In this paper, we review the published CRT clinical trial literature, focusing on the outcomes of HF patients treated with CRT-P versus CRT-D. We also attempt to provide guidance regarding the appropriate choice of CRT device type, in the absence of randomized prospective trials specifically designed to answer this question.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^11192AsQ]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for heart failure, specifically concerning cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), the ESC 2021 guidelines recommend considering an 'upgrade' to CRT in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%. This recommendation applies to those who have received a conventional pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), subsequently experiencing worsening heart failure despite optimal medical therapy, and having a significant proportion of right ventricular pacing.

### Evolving indications, challenges, and advances in cardiac resynchronization therapy for heart failure [^111qnSPH]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) via biventricular pacing has markedly improved heart failure outcomes over the past two decades. However, some patients show no clinical improvement or evidence of reverse remodeling following device implantation. Challenges include suboptimal patient selection, limitations in the characterization of conduction disease (especially nonspecific interventricular conduction delays), procedural constraints, inappropriate device programming, and delayed referral. Moreover, there remains no formal consensus on evaluating and characterizing CRT efficacy.

Underuse persists among women and minoritized racial and ethnic groups. Targeted research addressing unmet needs has led to evolving guideline indications. Novel electrocardiographic and imaging techniques are continually being developed to improve patient selection, and alternative pacing strategies have emerged. Conduction system pacing may allow for a more physiological approach to CRT. Observational studies and small clinical trials have shown comparable or superior efficacy of conduction system pacing over traditional biventricular pacing; however, more studies are needed.

### 2021 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure [^111C8iMU]. European Heart Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for heart failure, specifically concerning cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), the ESC 2021 guidelines recommend not performing CRT in patients with a QRS duration of less than 130 ms if there is no indication for pacing due to high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy in congestive heart failure: Ready for prime time [^113Cdxcw]. Heart Rhythm (2004). High credibility.

The aim of this article is to critically review the data accumulated at the time of writing on the application of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) via biventricular pacing techniques to manage patients with advanced heart failure. The data from studies evaluating the effects of long-term right ventricular (RV) pacing are also briefly reviewed.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE and selective journal searches of English-language reports and a search of references of relevant papers were conducted.

- **Results**: Cardiac dyssynchrony, as reflected by a prolonged QRS complex often in the form of left bundle branch block, is encountered in about 30% of patients with moderate-to-advanced heart failure. Among these patients, 10% to 15% are candidates for CRT via biventricular pacing. Accumulated evidence from randomized controlled studies over the last few years has indicated significant hemodynamic and clinical improvement conferred by CRT to class III or IV heart failure patients with idiopathic or ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy having a low left ventricular ejection fraction (≥ 120–150 ms). Newer data suggest a significant reduction in overall mortality and heart failure hospitalization, particularly when CRT is combined with automatic defibrillator backup. Technical advances with percutaneous methods accessing the tributaries of the cardiac veins have raised the success rate of implantation of left ventricular leads to > 90%. Further confirmation from ongoing trials is awaited, and more data from cost-effectiveness studies are needed before CRT is implemented widely.

### Predictors of clinical outcomes after cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients ≥ 75 years of age: a retrospective cohort study [^1152fyxG]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to benefit selected patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Older patients have been underrepresented in randomized trials. This study was conducted to determine whether predictive factors for cardiac resynchronization therapy outcomes differ in patients older and younger than 75 years of age.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients who received a cardiac resynchronization therapy device between 2013 and 2016 in our center were retrospectively included in this cohort study. The primary endpoint was cardiac resynchronization therapy effectiveness, defined as survival for one year with both no heart failure hospitalization and improvement by one or more NYHA class. The secondary endpoints were mortality, complications, and device therapies.

- **Results**: Among the 243 patients included, 102 were ≥ 75 years old. Cardiac resynchronization therapy effectiveness was observed in 70 patients (50%) < 75 years old and in 48 patients (47%) ≥ 75 years old (p = 0.69). NYHA class ≥ III (OR = 6.02; CI95% [1.33–18.77], p = 0.002) was a predictive factor for cardiac resynchronization therapy effectiveness only in the ≥ 75-year-old group, while atrial fibrillation was independently negatively associated with the primary endpoint in the < 75-year-old group (OR = 0.28; CI95% [0.13–0.62], p = 0.001). The one-year mortality rate was 14%, with no difference between age groups. Rescue cardiac resynchronization therapy and atrial fibrillation were independent predictive factors for mortality in both age groups.

### Outcomes following cardiac resynchronisation therapy in older people [^114VVwJE]. Age and Ageing (2023). Low credibility.

**Key points**: Symptomatic or echocardiographic improvements following implantation with cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) were consistent in older (≥ 80 years) people. At baseline, older people had worse symptomatic status and were more likely to have co-morbidities. On an individual level, the absence of improvement following cardiac resynchronisation therapy does not always represent a lack of treatment effect.

### Clinical effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy versus medical therapy alone among patients with heart failure: Analysis of the ICD registry and ADHERE [^114pCpWP]. Circulation. Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) can improve functional status, morbidity, and survival in select populations of patients with heart failure, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), and QRS prolongation. Accordingly, clinical guidelines recommend CRT-D in patients with symptomatic heart failure, left ventricular EF ≤ 35%, and a wide QRS complex. However, the extent to which the efficacy of CRT-D in randomized clinical trials translates into effectiveness in clinical practice is unknown.

Clinical trials in heart failure enroll selected participants with idealized care compared with what is seen in real-world practice. This is particularly true for CRT-D, for which the landmark randomized trials included relatively young, predominantly male populations with few comorbid conditions. In the Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure (COMPANION), the first randomized trial to demonstrate the efficacy of CRT-D, the median age was 66 years and 67% of participants were men.

Given the differences in demographic characteristics and coexisting illnesses often seen in patients with heart failure in clinical practice, it is unclear whether the benefits and safety of CRT-D demonstrated in clinical trials reflect outcomes in a broader population of older patients, women, patients in minority racial or ethnic groups, and patients with moderate prolongation of QRS duration. We examined associations between CRT-D and mortality and readmission among patients with heart failure who received CRT-D.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy or atrio-biventricular pacing-what should it be called [^116RGZiS]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Reduced cardiac efficiency caused by suboptimal synchronization of the heart's normal contraction might contribute to the development of or exacerbate heart failure. Conceptually and in practice, cardiac dyssynchrony is complex. Recent studies have shown that atrio-biventricular pacing can improve cardiac synchrony in many patients, enhance cardiac function, alleviate symptoms, increase exercise capacity, and substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.

Randomized controlled trials, however, indicate that the severity of cardiac dyssynchrony, as conventionally measured, is a poor guide to treatment benefit, and that correction of dyssynchrony accounts for only part of the benefit of atrio-biventricular pacing. Although some benefits of atrio-biventricular pacing might be mediated by cardiac resynchronization, much of the benefit could be mediated by mechanisms that are as yet unknown. Withholding atrio-biventricular pacing in patients who do not exhibit cardiac dyssynchrony on imaging but otherwise fulfill the entry criteria used in randomized controlled trials of this therapy could be unwise. Here, we examine the evidence that cardiac resynchronization is indeed the mechanism by which atrio-biventricular pacing exerts its effects.

### How should we optimize cardiac resynchronization therapy [^115Fy5qx]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Optimization of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is increasingly performed, with numerous methods having been proposed, many of which are echocardiographic. Both the technique and the timing of optimization are contentious. It remains unknown whether acute hemodynamic benefits translate into long-term improvements in remodeling, symptoms, or prognosis. Recent guidelines from the American Society of Echocardiography advocate routine optimization.

Here, we objectively review the principles, methods, timing, and evidence supporting optimization. Despite limited validation, optimization was included in landmark clinical trials and is inherent in evidence-based practice. Randomized controlled trials comparing methods are needed, with long-term clinical endpoints. For now, optimization should be performed using the iterative method, according to the CARE-HF protocol.

### A randomized double-blind comparison of biventricular versus left ventricular stimulation for cardiac resynchronization therapy: the Biventricular versus Left Univentricular Pacing with ICD Back-up in Heart Failure Patients (B-LEFT HF) trial [^112Ckb9k]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Biventricular (BiV) stimulation is the preferred means of delivering cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), although left ventricular (LV)-only stimulation might be as safe and effective. B-LEFT HF is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study aimed to examine whether LV-only is noninferior to BiV pacing regarding clinical and echocardiographic responses.

- **Methods**: B-LEFT HF randomly assigned 176 CRT-D recipients, in New York Heart Association class III or IV, with an LV ejection fraction of less than or equal to 130 milliseconds, to a BiV (n = 90) versus LV (n = 86) stimulation group. Clinical status and echocardiograms were analyzed at baseline and six months after CRT-D implant to test the noninferiority of LV-only compared with BiV stimulation.

- **Results**: The proportion of responders was in line with literature on CRT, with improvement in heart failure composite score in 76.2% and 74.7% of patients in BiV and LV groups, respectively. Comparing LV versus BiV pacing, the small differences in response rates and corresponding 95% CI indicated that LV pacing was noninferior to BiV pacing for a series of response criteria (combination of improvement in New York Heart Association and reverse remodeling, improvement in heart failure composite score, reduction in LV end-systolic volume of at least 10%), both at intention-to-treat and at per-protocol analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Left ventricular-only pacing is noninferior to BiV pacing in a six-month follow-up with regard to clinical and echocardiographic responses. Left ventricular pacing may be considered an effective alternative for certain patient groups.

### Lessons learned from the multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial-cardiac resynchronization therapy (MADIT-CRT) [^114CLyFb]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has evolved as a Class I treatment indication with Level of Evidence A in patients with mild heart failure, depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, and wide QRS. In this review article, we will discuss the major findings of sub-studies published from the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT).

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without defibrillation in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YUrLF]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

The comprehensive study investigates the efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with or without the addition of defibrillation in patients diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis, recent advancements and clinical outcomes are evaluated to determine the practicality and benefits of integrating defibrillation with CRT in such clinical scenarios.

- **Methodology**: A meticulous procedure was employed to collate data from numerous clinical trials and studies, ensuring the validity and reliability of the results.
- **Results**: The findings indicate nuanced differences in patient outcomes based on the inclusion of defibrillation with CRT.
- **Conclusion**: This analysis provides critical insights into patient management strategies, offering valuable guidance for clinicians managing nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

This assessment raises important considerations for enhancing patient care and could influence future guidelines in cardiology practices.

### Outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy by New York Heart Association class: A patient-level meta-analysis [^114myLZv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

In this meta‐analysis of patient‐level data from randomized controlled trials, CRT appeared to be beneficial in improving the time to all‐cause mortality or HFH, as well as all‐cause mortality alone, in patients in NYHA class III as well as those in NYHA class IV. However, given the relatively small number of patients in NYHA class IV, these results highlight the need for further studies on patients in NYHA class IV that are reflective of contemporaneous CRT devices, implantation techniques, and medical therapy for advanced HF.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112g49xh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). High credibility.

A total of 272 entries were retrieved for analysis of titles and abstracts. Of these, 259 were excluded as they were either duplicates or deemed unsuitable for the purpose of our meta-analysis — case reports, editorials, letters, reviews, meta-analyses, or original papers with no comparison between CRT-D and CRT-P. The remaining 13 entries were considered adequate for inclusion in our meta-analysis. A careful review of their reference list provided 2 more entries that were selected after revision of the full text, and 1 additional entry was retrieved after reviewing the reference lists of these 2 studies. Manual searches also provided 2 entries: 2 abstracts. Experts in the field suggested the inclusion of a further article. There was complete agreement between investigators on the inclusion of the selected studies.

The design of selected trials and baseline data are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The final population for this meta-analysis included 12,378 patients (7,030 receiving CRT-D and 5,348 receiving CRT-P) and 29,799 patient-years of follow-up. One study was a randomized controlled trial, while 2 were sub-analyses of randomized controlled trials. The remaining studies were observational and/or registries. Eight studies were multi-center. Quality assessment of the included studies is shown in Table 3. All randomized controlled studies had < 6 Delphi criteria and only 2 cohort studies had a Newcastle-Ottawa score of ≥ 7.

### Patient selection for cardiac resynchronization therapy: From the Council on Clinical Cardiology Subcommittee on Electrocardiography and Arrhythmias and the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Interdisciplinary Working Group, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society [^112wYUgU]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a relatively new therapy for patients with symptomatic heart failure resulting from systolic dysfunction. CRT is achieved by simultaneously pacing both the left and right ventricles. This biventricular pacing resynchronizes the timing of global left ventricular depolarization and improves mechanical contractility and mitral regurgitation. Published clinical trials have demonstrated that CRT results in improved clinical status and lower mortality rates when selected patients with systolic ventricular dysfunction and heart failure are treated with CRT. This advisory identifies appropriate candidates for CRT based on the inclusion criteria and results from the published clinical trials.

### Cardiac rhythm devices in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction - role, timing, and optimal use in contemporary practice. European Journal of Heart Failure expert consensus document [^115Xn4nY]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). High credibility.

In a patient-level meta-analysis of 6,264 patients from eight pivotal CRT trials, CRT was associated with a 23% reduction in all-cause death. In terms of number needed to treat (NNT) for 3-year all-cause mortality, the benefits of CRT when given on top of optimal medical therapy are comparable with those of HF medications such as beta-blockers and MRA, with NNTs of 8 for CRT when given in addition to medical treatment, 9 for beta-blockers, and 6 for MRA.

A recently completed trial highlights the valuable research still being conducted in this therapeutic arena. With over 3,600 patients randomized in 27 countries, AdaptResponse is the largest global RCT of CRT conducted at the time of writing. It compared standard CRT and adaptive CRT with timed left ventricular stimulation in patients with HF, LBBB, and intact atrioventricular conduction, a population expected to achieve significant disease modification after CRT. At the 5-year follow-up, adaptive CRT did not significantly reduce the incidence of all-cause death or interventions for HF decompensation compared with standard CRT, but the overall mortality (16.5% over 5 years) was much lower than reported in previous CRT trials and remained low during follow-up, reflecting a high percentage of optimized HF and the relatively young mean age of the trial participants. Higher mortality rates reported in previous CRT trials may thus not indicate a lack of disease modification but rather reflect different patient populations and medical treatments.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113C2pzC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Study selection**: We performed searches on MEDLINE (via PubMED), EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov, and COCHRANE databases (from inception to May 31, 2015) using the following search string: "cardiac resynchronization therapy" AND "implantable cardioverter-defibrillator"; "CRT" AND "ICD"; "CRT-D" AND "CRT-P"; "CRT" AND "CRT-D"; "biventricular pacemaker" AND "defibrillator". Reference lists of all accessed full-text articles were searched for sources of potentially relevant information, and experts in the field were contacted about further potentially eligible studies. Authors of full-text papers and congress abstract authors were also contacted by email to retrieve additional information.

Only longitudinal studies performed in humans and written in English were considered for inclusion. The population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) approach was used. The population of interest included patients with guideline indication for CRT, and the intervention was CRT implant with or without a defibrillator. Comparisons were performed between patients receiving CRT-D versus CRT-P. The primary outcome was total all-cause mortality, evaluated at the longest follow-up available. In studies with significantly different follow-up durations between device groups, the primary outcome was assessed at the longest follow-up available for both groups simultaneously.

In order to be eligible, studies should present a minimum follow-up duration of 6 months. Registries, observational studies, and randomized trials were considered eligible for analysis.

### Sex-specific differences in survival and heart failure hospitalization after cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without defibrillation [^117SBUtX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a standard treatment for selected patients with heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) function, and a wide QRS complex. Sex-specific differences in the outcome of CRT were first shown by the MIRACLE (Multicenter InSync Randomized Clinical Evaluation) study, in which CRT was associated with higher survival free of HF hospitalization in women than in men, compared with optimum pharmacologic therapy. A substudy of MADIT-CRT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial With Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) showed that survival and survival free of HF hospitalization from CRT-defibrillation (CRT-D), compared with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy, was higher in women.

Data from the US National Cardiovascular Data Registry also showed that among patients with a left bundle branch block, the benefit from CRT-D over ICD was greater in women than in men. Better outcomes in women have also been reported by other observational studies and meta-analyses. In contrast, sex-specific differences in survival were not observed in COMPANION (Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing and Defibrillation in Heart Failure) or CARE-HF (Cardiac Resynchronization Heart Failure).

Randomized controlled trials are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. However, randomized controlled trials tend to comprise a small number of highly selected patients and a relatively short follow-up. On the other hand, studies using large administrative data sets have the advantage of large numbers.

### Indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy: 2011 update from the Heart Failure Society of America guideline committee [^1175fkHf]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves survival, symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, and cardiac structure and function in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or ambulatory class IV heart failure (HF) with a wide QRS complex. The totality of evidence supports the use of CRT in patients with less severe HF symptoms. CRT is recommended for patients in sinus rhythm with a widened QRS interval (≥ 150 ms) not due to right bundle branch block (RBBB) who have severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and persistent NYHA functional class II-III symptoms despite optimal medical therapy (strength of evidence A).

CRT may be considered for several other patient groups for whom evidence of benefit is clinically significant but less substantial, including patients with a QRS interval of ≥ 120 to < 150 ms and severe LV systolic dysfunction who have persistent mild to severe HF despite optimal medical therapy (strength of evidence B), some patients with atrial fibrillation, and some with ambulatory class IV HF. Several evidence gaps remain that need to be addressed, including the ideal threshold for QRS duration, QRS morphology, lead placement, degree of myocardial scarring, and the modality for evaluating dyssynchrony. Recommendations will evolve over time as additional data emerge from completed and ongoing clinical trials.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of older cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients using a pacemaker versus a defibrillator [^111nfhSh]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is commonly used to manage heart failure, yet published guidelines do not distinguish between recommendations for pacemakers (CRT-P) and defibrillators (CRT-D) despite significant differences in size, longevity, and cost between these devices. The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes between elderly recipients of CRT-P and CRT-D.

- **Methods and results**: Data from 512 patients (405 CRT-D, 107 CRT-P) aged ≥ 75 years with LV ejection fraction ≤ 35% and QRS duration > 120 milliseconds were retrospectively analyzed for baseline characteristics and followed to the primary outcome of all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for possible confounders. Results were further validated through propensity matching cohorts. Compared to CRT-D recipients, CRT-P patients were older (83 years vs. 81 years, P < 0.001) and had more comorbid conditions (Charlson index = 5 [3–6] vs. 4 [3–5], P = 0.007). During 40.8 months of follow-up, there were 280 deaths. Compared to CRT-D patients, CRT-P recipients had higher unadjusted mortality (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.15–2.08, P = 0.004). However, this difference lost significance after adjusting for baseline differences between the groups (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.78–1.77, P = 0.435).

- **Conclusion**: Higher all-cause mortality in older CRT-P versus CRT-D patients is largely explained by baseline clinical and demographic differences between the two groups, which are likely the drivers of device selection in real-world clinical practice.

### Upgrades from a previous device compared to de novo cardiac resynchronization therapy in the European Society of Cardiology CRT survey II [^111KWRCB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, there are no data from randomized controlled studies on the benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) when implanted as an upgrade in patients with a previous device compared to de novo CRT. In the CRT Survey II, we compared the baseline data of patients upgraded to CRT (CRT-P/CRT-D) from a previous pacemaker (PM) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to de novo CRT implantation.

- **Methods and results**: In the European CRT Survey II, clinical practice data of patients undergoing CRT and/or ICD implantation across 42 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) countries were collected between October 2015 and December 2016. Out of a total of 11,088 patients, 2,396 (23.2%) were upgraded from a previous PM or ICD, and 7,933 (76.8%) underwent de novo implantation. Compared to de novo implantations, upgraded patients were older, more often male, and more frequently had ischaemic heart failure aetiology, atrial fibrillation, reduced renal function, worse heart failure symptoms, and higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. Upgraded patients were more often PM-dependent and less frequently received CRT-D. Total peri-procedural, in-hospital complications and length of hospital stay were similar. Upgraded patients were less frequently treated with heart failure medication at discharge.

- **Conclusion**: Despite a lack of evidence-based data, close to one quarter of all CRT implantations across 42 ESC countries were upgrades from a previous PM or ICD. Despite older age and worse symptoms, the CRT implantation procedures in upgraded patients were equivalent to de novo procedures.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation: results from the Resynchronization for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) [^114yryFQ]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2012). High credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) prolongs survival in patients with systolic heart failure and QRS prolongation; however, most trials excluded patients with permanent atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods and results**: The Resynchronization for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) randomized patients to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or ICD+CRT. The randomization was stratified by the presence of permanent atrial fibrillation. Patients with permanent atrial fibrillation were randomized to either CRT-ICD (n = 114) or ICD (n = 115). Patients receiving a CRT-ICD were similar to those receiving an ICD in terms of age (71.6 ± 7.3 versus 70.4 ± 7.7 years), left ventricular ejection fraction (22.9 ± 5.3% versus 22.3 ± 5.1%), and QRS duration (151.0 ± 23.6 versus 153.4 ± 24.7 ms). There was no difference in the primary outcome of death or heart failure hospitalization between those assigned to CRT-ICD versus ICD (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.65–1.41; P = 0.82). Cardiovascular death rates were similar between treatment arms (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.55–1.71; P = 0.91); however, there was a trend towards fewer heart failure hospitalizations with CRT-ICD (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–1.01; P = 0.052). The change in the 6-minute hall walk duration between baseline and 12 months also did not differ significantly between treatment arms (CRT-ICD: 19 ± 84 m versus ICD: 16 ± 76 m; P = 0.88). There was a trend for greater improvement in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure score among patients treated with CRT-ICD between baseline and 6 months (CRT-ICD: 41 ± 21 to 31 ± 21; ICD: 33 ± 20 to 28 ± 20; P = 0.057).

- **Conclusions**: The study concluded that patients with permanent atrial fibrillation who received CRT-ICD showed tendencies towards improved outcomes in certain measures, although statistical significance was not met in primary endpoints.

### Appropriateness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device implants in the United States [^112CAfqg]. Heart Rhythm (2024). High credibility.

The appropriate use criteria (AUCs) are a diverse group of indications aimed at better evaluating the benefits of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization therapy. The purpose of this study was to quantify the proportion of ICD and cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) implants as appropriate, may be appropriate (MA), or rarely appropriate (RA) based on the AUC guidelines.

This multicenter retrospective study involved patients within the National Cardiovascular Data Registry undergoing ICD implantation between April 2018 and March 2019 at over 1500 US hospitals. The appropriateness of ICD implants was adjudicated using the AUC.

Of the 309,318 ICDs evaluated, 241,438 were primary prevention implants (78.1%), and 67,880 were secondary prevention implants (21.9%); 243,532 (79%) were mappable to the AUC. For primary prevention, 185,431 ICDs (96.4%) were deemed appropriate, 5660 (2.9%) MA, and 1205 (0.6%) RA. For secondary prevention, 47,498 ICDs (92.7%) were appropriate, 2581 (5%) MA, and 1157 (2.3%) RA. A significant number of RA devices were implanted in patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure, who were ineligible for advanced therapies (53.9%), and those with myocardial infarction within 40 days (18.1%).

The appropriateness of the pacing lead was more variable, with 48,470 dual-chamber ICD implants (62%) classified as appropriate, 29,209 (37.4%) MA, and 448 (0.6%) RA. Among CRT-D implants, 63,848 (82.2%) were appropriate, 9900 (12.7%) MA, and 3940 (5.1%) RA for left ventricu…

### On the underutilization of cardiac resynchronization therapy [^114k1zsh]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an innovative therapy designed to treat patients with systolic heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction who have a wide QRS complex. Indications for its use have been refined and expanded based on recent clinical data and guidelines. However, the rate of new CRT implants in the United States has not significantly changed over the past eight years. Many patients receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillators could benefit from CRT devices but are not receiving them despite appropriate indications.

- **Data summary**: We summarize data on CRT use.
- **Reasons for underutilization**: We discuss reasons for probable underutilization.
- **Recommendations**: We provide recommendations for augmenting proper and effective use of this highly beneficial therapy.

### Multispecialty approach: The need for heart failure disease management for refining cardiac resynchronization therapy [^114BYpPB]. Heart Rhythm (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been proven in clinical trials to be a very effective therapy in appropriate patients. However, although the literature has primarily focused on appropriate implanting techniques and inclusion criteria for CRT devices by electrophysiologists, most patients who receive CRT are managed by their primary care providers with the help of general cardiologists and/or heart failure (HF) specialists.

As CRT has been more broadly applied over the past decade, the fragmentation and specialization of care in the healthcare system have created challenges in optimizing this otherwise invasive but potentially beneficial intervention in the complex HF patient. Furthermore, cost considerations as well as appropriate follow-up care continue to challenge the optimal application of these devices, particularly when evidence to support multidisciplinary approaches is lacking. The challenge begins with identification of appropriate candidates for CRT, which is an evolving concept. This evolution is due to emerging studies with a wide range of inclusion and exclusion criteria, coupled with increasing oversight from providers or even logistical hurdles from patients.

Post-implant management practices and procedures are still evolving. The important and so-far unresolved concept of the "nonresponder" to CRT remains largely subjective and is variably defined in the literature. The lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms of "nonresponse" continues to challenge the long-term management of CRT, even given the recent developments in advanced sensors.

### Outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy by New York Heart Association class: A patient-level meta-analysis [^115fPaW8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Data on the benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with severe heart failure symptoms are limited. We investigated the relative effects of CRT in patients with ambulatory New York Heart Association (NYHA) IV versus III functional class at the time of device implantation.

- **Methods and results**: In this meta-analysis, we pooled patient-level data from the MIRACLE (Multicenter InSync Randomized Clinical Evaluation), MIRACLE-ICD (Multicenter InSync Implantable Cardioversion Defibrillation Randomized Clinical Evaluation), and COMPANION (Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure) trials. Outcomes evaluated were time to the composite endpoint of the first heart failure hospitalization or all-cause mortality, and time to all-cause mortality alone.

The association between CRT and outcomes was evaluated using a Bayesian hierarchical Weibull survival regression model. We assessed if this association differed between NYHA III and IV groups by adding an interaction term between CRT and NYHA class as a random effect. A sensitivity analysis was performed by including data from RAFT (Resynchronization-Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure). Our pooled analysis included 2,309 patients. Overall, CRT was associated with a longer time to heart failure hospitalization or all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.79 [95% credible interval, 0.64–0.99]; posterior probability or P = 0.044), with a similar association with time to all-cause mortality (aHR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.59–1.03]; P = 0.083). Associations of CRT.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116nUGe3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The usual enrollment criteria for CRT trials have included: (1) NYHA functional class II-IV despite optimal drug treatment; (2) LVEF less than 35%; (3) QRS duration greater than 120 ms or, in some trials, greater than 150 ms; and (4) sinus rhythm (although CRT may also be effective in patients in atrial fibrillation, particularly when combined with AV node ablation to help achieve 100% effective biventricular pacing). These criteria will include most patients with indications for ICD treatment according to SCD-HeFT.

A question arises as to whether the effect of the ICD is additive to that of CRT, considering that CRT treatment alone will already decrease all-cause mortality risk and the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Approximately one-third of all deaths in the group randomly assigned to CRT-P in CARE-HF were sudden, a rate similar to that observed among patients assigned to CRT-P in the COMPANION trial. Seven percent of patients in the CRT arm of CARE-HF died suddenly, compared with only 2.9% in the CRT-D arm of COMPANION. It is then reasonable to speculate that the ICD may be able to further reduce the risk of all-cause death by decreasing the number of sudden deaths.

However, it is debatable whether the ICD is of benefit in super-responders to CRT and those who do not respond to this therapy. While the former may have significantly lower mortality rates and lower risk of ventricular arrhythmias, the latter will have high mortality rates, mostly due to heart failure, and previous studies suggested the ICD has no effect on any mode of death in patients in NYHA class III.

### Echocardiography for cardiac resynchronization therapy selection: Fatally flawed or misjudged [^114zKnM3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

After the publication of the PROSPECT (Predictors of Response to CRT) trial, the use of echocardiography for the assessment of mechanical dyssynchrony and as a possible aid for selecting patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy has been heavily criticized. Calls have been made to observe the guidelines and implant according to the entry criteria of recent major trials. However, although this approach is currently recommended, the attempt to identify patients who will not receive the benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy and whose clinical condition may be worsened should continue. Devices are not analogous to drugs; initial costs are higher, complications are significant, and the device cannot readily be withdrawn. Professional resources and societal costs are high and wasted if devices are implanted inappropriately. Rather than discarding the attempt to identify the most suitable patients pre-operatively, further work is needed to refine the techniques and conduct new clinical trials. A combination of methods, including finding the site of the latest mechanical activation, myocardial scar localization, and assessing venous anatomy pre-operatively, may help identify those who will not derive any benefit or be potentially worsened.

### Effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy with implantable cardioverter defibrillator versus cardiac resynchronization therapy with pacemaker on mortality in heart failure patients: results of a high-volume, single-centre experience [^114nu63s]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

This may be the reason why several meta-analyses comparing the efficacy of CRT-D over CRT-P in patients with a primary indication for CRT have failed to show an incremental benefit of adding defibrillation therapy to CRT. The risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) may be sufficiently reduced with CRT-P alone. Furthermore, CRT-D devices have a significantly higher cost, and their widespread use remains limited, especially in emerging countries that have fixed budgets for healthcare and where healthcare utilization is based on cost–benefit analysis. In addition, the complex design of defibrillator leads presents additional challenges, including a higher risk of lead failure in the CRT-D systems.

Despite these great concerns, there is currently no consensus on in which patients CRT-P alone could be considered. The physician needs to estimate costs, benefit, and risks based on individual patients. Clinicians in many countries face challenges in reimbursement of CRT devices, and expected future healthcare reforms will lead to additional scrutiny of expensive medical device therapies. Until clinical guidelines or consensus statements become available, our results may help clinicians identify patients in whom CRT-P alone may be sufficiently effective in reducing adverse outcomes.

Our results are novel and provocative, suggesting that CRT-D does not have an incremental benefit over CRT-P in the reduction of all-cause mortality in non-ischaemic patients. Only patients with ischaemic aetiology of cardiomyopathy showed a significant reduction in mortality with an implanted CRT-D.

### A randomized study of cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator versus dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in ischemic cardiomyopathy with narrow QRS: the NARROW-CRT study [^1153Pr55]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). High credibility.

Recommendations require a QRS duration of ≥ 120 ms as a condition for prescribing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). This study was designed to test the hypothesis that patients with heart failure (HF) of ischemic origin, with indications for defibrillator implantation and QRS < 120 ms, may benefit from CRT in the presence of marked mechanical dyssynchrony.

- **Methods and results**: Patients with intraventricular dyssynchrony on echocardiography were randomly assigned to CRT or dual-chamber defibrillator implantation (CRT defibrillator and dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator arm, respectively). The primary endpoint was the HF clinical composite response, which scores patients as improved, unchanged, or worsened. The secondary endpoint was the cumulative survival from HF hospitalization and HF death. An additional secondary endpoint was the composite of HF hospitalization, HF death, and spontaneous ventricular fibrillation. Twenty-three of 56 patients with CRT defibrillator showed an improvement in their clinical composite response at 1 year, compared with 9 of 55 patients with dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (41% versus 16%; P = 0.004). After a median follow-up of 16 months, the CRT defibrillator arm showed a nonsignificant higher survival from HF hospitalization and HF death (P = 0.077), and a significantly higher survival from the combined endpoint of HF hospitalization, HF death, and spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (P = 0.028).

Conclusions were centered around comparing CRT defibrillator and dual-chamber implantable…

### Effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy with implantable cardioverter defibrillator versus cardiac resynchronization therapy with pacemaker on mortality in heart failure patients: results of a high-volume, single-centre experience [^1175PHp9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Baseline clinical characteristics of patients who underwent CRT-D vs. CRT-P implantation are listed in Table 1. During the 10-year period, 693 CRT-P devices (62%) and 429 CRT-D devices (38%) were implanted. The mean patient age was 65 ± 11 years, and 262 (23%) were women. We found a lower proportion of CRT-D implantation vs. CRT-P in the early years.

- **Patient demographics**: Patients with an implanted CRT-P were significantly older, more often female, and less likely to have ischemic cardiomyopathy compared to CRT-D patients. Prior myocardial infarction (MI), prior PCI, and prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) were less prevalent in CRT-P patients. Patients with CRT-P more often had permanent AF and were more likely to have wider QRS complexes compared to CRT-D patients (165.5 ± 27.8 ms vs. 158.2 ± 27.1 ms, P < 0.001).

- **Renal and medication comparisons**: Renal function at baseline was similar in both groups. CRT-D patients were more frequently prescribed aldosterone antagonists and amiodarone than those with an implanted CRT-P. Baseline echocardiographic parameters, including LVEF, LVEDD, and LVESD, were similar at baseline.

### 20 years of cardiac resynchronization therapy [^1135aZ46]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an accepted treatment for patients with heart failure (HF), impaired left ventricular (LV) function, and a wide QRS complex. It has been revolutionary for patients with advanced HF whose only previous option was cardiac transplantation, and it is now a realistic option for patients with mild HF. The development of CRT has also united the previously disparate cardiological subspecialties of electrophysiology and HF.

This review, written on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the first clinical use of CRT for HF, takes a historical perspective on CRT's evolution from "bench to bedside". We also comment on the task faced by electrophysiologists and HF specialists as they make this life-saving therapy available to an increasing number of eligible patients.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112b6jSp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

These observations are not disputed by the inherent limitations of this meta-analysis; however, the conclusion that the addition of the defibrillator to CRT reduces mortality risk should be taken cautiously. In fact, our main findings are not entirely unexpected when one considers the significant baseline differences between patients currently receiving CRT-D versus CRT-P (highlighted in Table 4). In the CERTITUDE cohort study, the higher all-cause mortality rate in CRT-P patients was almost entirely due to a much higher number of heart failure-related or non-cardiac deaths, while SCD was only slightly more frequent. By cause-of-death analysis, 95% of the excess mortality among CRT-P subjects was related to an increase in non-sudden death. This surprising finding is easily explained by the fact that CRT-P patients were older, had more advanced heart failure, and a higher number of comorbidities.

In fact, those findings suggest that, in the context of primary prevention, the addition of the ICD to CRT-P patients as currently selected in daily clinical practice may be futile in some cases, as SCD only represents a minority of the additional number of deaths in CRT-P patients. On the other hand, a very recent study by Gold et al. extrapolated lifelong treatment-specific all-cause mortality rates of CRT patients with mild heart failure enrolled in the REVERSE trial and concluded that, compared with CRT-P, CRT-D offered 2.77 additional life-years. Given the high degree of matching between CRT-D and CRT-P patients in the REVERSE trial, this provided support towards the benefits of CRT-D in these patients.

### Synchronization of repolarization after cardiac resynchronization therapy: A combined clinical and modeling study [^116xFKRE]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). High credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a nonpharmacological therapy recommended by clinical practice guidelines for heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and QRS duration > 130 ms. CRT significantly reduces mortality and heart failure hospitalizations. This beneficial effect is clearly linked to resynchronization of electrical activation, recoordination of contraction, and the accompanying improvement in pump function and cardiac reserve.

Electrocardiographic changes in depolarization after CRT have been studied in considerable detail. In contrast, less is known about changes in repolarization caused by CRT. A few studies in both animal tissues and humans have reported increased dispersion of repolarization during CRT, possibly suggesting an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. On the other hand, large clinical trials and multiple registries have shown a significantly lower risk of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in CRT patients, particularly in those who show significant reverse remodeling. These clinical observations suggest that adaptations in ventricular repolarization may occur after CRT. However, little is known about longitudinal changes in ventricular repolarization and their relation to reverse remodeling induced by CRT.

To address this gap in evidence, a multimodality approach including electrocardiography (ECG), vectorcardiography (VCG), and echocardiography, supplemented by patient-specific modeling, was considered. In the present study, we investigated a cohort of consecutive CRT patients.

### Importance of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator back-up in cardiac resynchronization therapy recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DvpnK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

In summary, despite the unequivocal benefit of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) alone compared with medical treatment in reducing morbidity as well as mortality through reduction in both heart failure death and sudden cardiac death (SCD), a percentage of deaths in CRT‐P patients are sudden. The addition of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may constitute an appropriate complement to CRT therapy in patients in NYHA class II and III, but probably not those in ambulatory NYHA class IV, very elderly patients, and those with advanced comorbidities. The decision to implant a CRT‐D versus CRT‐P also requires an exact understanding of the long‐term risk of complications (higher in those with CRT‐D), the preference and expectations of the patients, and the three-fold higher cost of CRT‐D compared with CRT‐P.

- **Cardiac resynchronization therapy: With or without a defibrillator?** Several observations can be made from the results of this meta‐analysis. First, CRT‐D patients, as currently selected in daily clinical practice, have significantly lower all‐cause mortality rates compared with those who receive CRT without a defibrillator. There was one fewer death in every ten CRT‐D patients compared with the same number of CRT‐P patients. Secondly, the lower mortality rate in CRT‐D patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy is clear but seems of lower magnitude in the context of non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy. A higher number of CRT‐D devices needs to be implanted in patients with non‐ischemic cardiomyopathy for one fewer death to be reported compared with CRT‐P patients. Thirdly, CRT‐P recipients are often older and have more advanced heart failure.

### Review of eligibility for cardiac resynchronization therapy [^112Z48z9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is underused. Recent guidelines have expanded indications for CRT to include less severe symptoms but now favor left bundle branch block morphology in patients with moderate QRS prolongation. The prevalence of CRT eligibility according to historical guidelines is uncertain. The aim of this review was to identify and synthesize all existing published research reporting the prevalence of CRT eligibility. A systematic review of electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, was performed. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients eligible for CRT according to historical and guideline criteria. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of eligibility — ejection fraction, symptoms, and QRS duration and morphology. Eligibility estimates were pooled using random-effects models due to marked heterogeneity in between-study variance.

Thirty studies were identified. No study used guideline criteria. Based on historical criteria, 11 ± 3% of ambulatory and 9 ± 3% of hospitalized patients are eligible for CRT. However, New York Heart Association class II in guidelines is at least as frequent as New York Heart Association III or IV. Approximately one-third of patients have QRS prolongation, two-thirds of whom have left bundle branch block. Only a few patients have non-left bundle branch block with QRS duration < 150 ms. Medical contraindication or ineligibility was rarely assessed.

In conclusion, estimates of need are outdated. Inclusion of milder symptoms potentially expands the pool of eligible patients.

### Impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy on hospitalizations in the Resynchronization-Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial [^111LEad1]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

This study reports the impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on hospitalizations in patients randomized to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or ICD-CRT in the Resynchronization-Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT).

- **Methods and results**: Hospitalization rates and lengths of hospital stay were compared between the two groups. At the 18-month follow-up, the numbers of patients hospitalized for any cause were similar in the ICD (n = 351, 38.8%) and ICD-CRT (n = 331, 30.0%) groups. The number of patients hospitalized for heart failure was significantly lower in the ICD-CRT (n = 101, 11.3%) compared with the ICD (n = 141, 15.6%; P = 0.003) group. The number of patients hospitalized for a device-related indication was similar in the ICD-CRT group (n = 147, 16.4%) and ICD group (n = 126, 13.9%; P = 0.148). The total number of hospitalizations for any cause (n = 1448 versus n = 1553; P = 0.042), any cardiovascular cause (n = 667 versus n = 790; P = 0.017), and any heart failure cause (n = 385 versus n = 505; P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in the ICD-CRT group compared with the ICD group, whereas the number of hospitalizations for device-related causes was significantly higher in the ICD-CRT group compared with the ICD group (246 versus 159; P < 0.001). Although the reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure in the CRT-ICD group was offset by an increased number of hospitalizations for device-related indications, the length of hospital stay for any cause was significantly shorter in the ICD-CRT group (8.83 ± 13.30 days) compared with the ICD group (9.59 ± 14.40 days).

### Cardiogenic shock shortly after initial success of cardiac resynchronization therapy [^113d7cao]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to improve symptoms, exercise capacity, and left ventricular function, as well as reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. Failures following the initial success of this treatment are mostly related to lead dislodgement. Another entirely different reason is presented in this case study.

### Outcomes following cardiac resynchronisation therapy in older people [^116B6G8p]. Age and Ageing (2023). Low credibility.

Older patients may be less likely to receive cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) for the management of heart failure. This study aimed to describe the differences in clinical response, complications, and subsequent outcomes following CRT implantation compared to younger patients.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of unselected, consecutive patients implanted with CRT devices between March 2008 and July 2017. We recorded complications, symptomatic and echocardiographic response, hospitalisation for heart failure, and all-cause mortality, comparing patients aged < 70, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years.

Five hundred and seventy-four patients (median age 76 years [interquartile range 68–81], 73.3% male) received CRT. At baseline, patients aged ≥ 80 years had worse symptoms, were more likely to have co-morbidities, and less likely to be receiving comprehensive medical therapy, although left ventricular function was similar. Older patients were less likely to receive CRT-defibrillators compared to CRT-pacemakers. Complications were infrequent and not more common in older patients. Age was not a predictor of symptomatic or echocardiographic response to CRT (67.2%, 71.2%, and 62.6% responders in patients aged < 70, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years, respectively; P = 0.43), and time to first heart failure hospitalisation was similar across age groups (P = 0.28). Ten-year survival was lower for older patients (49.9%, 23.9%, and 6.8% in patients aged < 70, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years, respectively; P < 0.001).

The benefits of CRT on symptoms and left ventricular function appear evident, although the survival outcome varies across different age groups.

### Geographic and temporal variation in cardiac implanted electric devices to treat heart failure [^111ByKNb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Several device-based therapies are used to supplement pharmaceutical treatment for systolic heart failure, primarily cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), either alone (CRT-P) or in combination with defibrillator backup (CRT-D). These devices are increasingly common in the United States, with estimated implant rates in patients with heart failure diagnoses or hospitalizations for sudden cardiac arrest ranging from 24% to 38%. For patients potentially eligible for CRT, CRT-D devices appear to be the "default" device in the United States. In a US national registry, for patients who met trial eligibility for CRT (i.e. left ventricular ejection fraction 120 ms, and New York Heart Association class III/IV), the overwhelming proportion (80%) received a combined CRT-D device. A re-analysis of the 74 patients randomized to CRT-P in the REVERSE trial (compared to 345 with CRT-D) found lower long-term mortality in CRT-D patients.

While some argue that any patient treated with CRT should also receive defibrillator backup, others counsel restraint in adding additional device functions. A recent cohort study adjudicated cause of death for patients with CRT-P versus CRT-D and found that the vast majority of excess mortality in CRT-P patients was non-sudden death, weakening the argument for default defibrillator backup. Preventing sudden cardiac death with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is distinct from improving heart failure symptoms, and not every patient views these as necessarily linked. Only the COMPANION trial has directly… (text truncated)

### Timing of cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation in heart failure patients and its association with outcomes [^1175o7XZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The conclusion drawn from landmark trials and clinical practice guidelines does not specifically address the optimal timing for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implantation relative to hospitalization for heart failure (HF). The primary finding from this analysis is that CRT implantation during HF hospitalization is associated with lower all-cause mortality and reduced HF re-hospitalization rates compared to patients who do not receive CRT. The clinical benefit is greater when CRT is implanted during HF hospitalization than when prescribed at discharge. These data suggest that a CRT utilization strategy that does not delay implantation to the post-discharge period following HF hospitalization may be appropriate.

Moreover, patients who require hospitalization for HF despite having CRT already in place had worse outcomes compared to those without CRT. This observation could be explained by these patients representing a particularly high-risk subgroup. Therefore, randomized trials should aim to identify the appropriate timing of CRT implantation relative to hospitalization for HF, as well as specific characteristics that may affect a patient's ability to derive the intended benefits of CRT.

### Timing of cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation in heart failure patients and its association with outcomes [^115ckCU7]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

When used in appropriately selected heart failure (HF) patients, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduces mortality and hospitalization. It is not understood whether CRT implantation during hospitalization for HF is associated with similar benefits.

- **Hypothesis**: Timing of CRT implantation relative to hospitalization for HF is associated with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: This analysis included patients eligible for CRT and discharged alive between January 2005 and December 2012 from 388 hospitals in Get With The Guidelines-HF. Participants were linked with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data to evaluate outcomes of all-cause mortality and HF re-hospitalization based on CRT status (present on admission, placed during hospitalization, and prescribed at discharge; reference = no CRT).

- **Results**: Of 15,619 CRT-eligible HF patients, 2,408 (15%) had CRT on admission, 1,269 (8%) underwent CRT implantation during hospitalization, and 643 (4%) had CRT prescribed at discharge. Compared with patients without CRT, mortality was lower in those who received CRT implantation during HF hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.63; P < 0.0001) and those prescribed CRT at discharge (adjusted HR 0.78; P = 0.048). A reduction in HF re-hospitalization was observed in patients with CRT implanted during hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.64; P < 0.0001), but not in those who were prescribed CRT at discharge (adjusted HR 1.02; P = 0.77).

- **Conclusion**: CRT implantation during HF hospitalization was associated with lower rates of mortality and HF re-hospitalization.

### Cardiac-resynchronization therapy for the prevention of heart-failure events [^114GVogC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This trial was designed to determine whether cardiac-resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing would reduce the risk of death or heart-failure events in patients with mild cardiac symptoms, a reduced ejection fraction, and a wide QRS complex.

- **Methods**: During a 4.5-year period, we enrolled and followed 1,820 patients with ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy, an ejection fraction of 30% or less, a QRS duration of 130 msec or more, and New York Heart Association class I or II symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive CRT plus an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (1,089 patients) or an ICD alone (731 patients). The primary end point was death from any cause or a nonfatal heart-failure event (whichever came first). Heart-failure events were diagnosed by physicians who were aware of the treatment assignments, but they were adjudicated by a committee that was unaware of assignments.

- **Results**: During an average follow-up of 2.4 years, the primary end point occurred in 187 of 1,089 patients in the CRT-ICD group (17.2%) and 185 of 731 patients in the ICD-only group (25.3%) [hazard ratio in the CRT-ICD group, 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52 to 0.84; P = 0.001]. The benefit did not differ significantly between patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The superiority of CRT was driven by a 41% reduction in the risk of heart-failure events, a finding that was evident primarily in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a QRS duration of 150 msec or more.

### A comparison of cardiac resynchronization by sequential biventricular pacing and left ventricular pacing to simultaneous biventricular pacing: Rationale and design of the DECREASE-HF clinical trial [^111aaAZx]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

The first generation of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices approved for the treatment of heart failure used simultaneous biventricular (BiV) pacing to achieve ventricular resynchronization. Left ventricular pacing alone and sequential BiV pacing also show promise as alternative ways to deliver CRT, but have not been studied together in a large randomized trial.

- **Methods**: The Device Evaluation of CONTAK RENEWAL 2 and EASYTRAK 2: Assessment of Safety and Effectiveness in Heart Failure (DECREASE-HF) Trial is a randomized, double-blind, 3-arm study of patients in New York Heart Association Class III or IV with an ejection fraction of 35% or less and a QRS duration ≥ 150 ms. Patients are randomized to receive either left ventricular pacing, simultaneous BiV pacing, or sequential BiV pacing.

- **Conclusion**: The study uses a novel composite endpoint that combines peak oxygen consumption and left ventricular end systolic dimension, thus combining a measure of symptomatic improvement (peak oxygen consumption) with a physiologic measure of ventricular reverse remodeling (left ventricular end systolic dimension) into a single composite score. Additionally, the safety and effectiveness of the CONTAK RENEWAL 2/4/4HE/EASYTRAK 2 system will be evaluated using: heart failure-related adverse events; system-related complications; left ventricular lead-related complications; detection time of induced ventricular fibrillation; and left ventricular lead performance (pacing threshold, pacing impedance, and R-wave amplitude).

### European cardiac resynchronization therapy survey: Rationale and design [^1175FkFm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

The European cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) Survey is a joint initiative taken by the Heart Failure Association (HFA) and European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) of the European Society of Cardiology. The primary objective is to describe the European practice and routines associated with CRT/CRT-D implantations based on a wide range of sampling in 13 countries.

- **Methods and results**: The data collected should provide useful information, including demographics and clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, implantation routines and techniques, short-term outcomes, adverse experiences, and assessment of adherence to guideline recommendations.

### Left ventricular-only fusion pacing versus cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure patients: A randomized controlled trial [^112uN95A]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Background: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves cardiac function and clinical outcomes in patients with symptomatic heart failure with a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and prolonged QRS duration (QRSd), preferentially left bundle branch block (LBBB). The underlying mechanism is the resynchronization of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) activation. However, CRT pacing modality does not consider the utilization of intrinsic RV conduction and dynamic changes in atrioventricular (AV) conduction.

Recently, LV-only pacing is proposed as an alternative approach to achieve resynchronization by the fusion of LV pacing with intrinsic RV conduction. Although acute and short-term investigations suggested comparable benefits of LV-only pacing and conventional biventricular pacing (BVP), varying AV conduction may still lead to electrical dyssynchrony during various daily activities or due to the changes in disease state over a longer period of time. Therefore, an adaptive algorithm is developed to optimize the fusion by continuously adjusting LV pacing timing to leverage intrinsic RV conduction and achieve dynamic and more physiological pacing. The purpose of this study is to assess mid-term cardiac function and clinical outcomes during adaptive LV-only fusion pacing (LVP) in comparison with conventional BVP in a selected group of CRT-indicated patients with intact AV conduction.

### Device complications with addition of defibrillation to cardiac resynchronisation therapy for primary prevention [^114K6nkg]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In patients indicated for cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT), the choice between a CRT-pacemaker (CRT-P) versus a defibrillator (CRT-D) remains controversial, and indications in this context have not been well delineated. Apart from inappropriate therapies, which are inherent to the presence of a defibrillator, whether adding a defibrillator to CRT in the primary prevention setting impacts the risk of other acute and late device-related complications has not been well studied and may bear relevance for device selection.

- **Methods**: This study was an observational multicentre European cohort study of 3008 consecutive patients with either ischaemic or non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and no history of sustained ventricular arrhythmias, undergoing CRT implantation with (CRT-D, n = 1785) or without (CRT-P, n = 1223) a defibrillator. Using propensity score and competing risk analyses, we assessed the risk of significant device-related complications requiring surgical reintervention. Inappropriate shocks were not considered unless they were due to lead malfunction requiring lead revision.

- **Results**: Acute complications occurred in 148 patients (4.9%) without a significant difference between groups, even after considering potential confounders (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.00, p = 0.47). During a mean follow-up of 41.4 ± 29 months, late complications occurred in 475 patients, with an annual incidence rate of 26 (95% CI 9 to 43) and 15 (95% CI 6 to 24) per 1000 patient-years in CRT-D and CRT-P patients, respectively. CRT-D was independently associated with an increased occurrence of late complications (HR = 1.68, 95% CI).

### Keys to successful cardiac resynchronization therapy [^115pGmvW]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves functional status in selected groups of patients with heart failure and has achieved widespread use. However, approximately one-third of patients fail to benefit from CRT. Many of these failures can be attributed to improper patient selection, suboptimal left ventricular lead placement, device programming, and inadequate medical therapy. This article addresses these issues and proposes an approach to improving the results of CRT.

### Effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy with implantable cardioverter defibrillator versus cardiac resynchronization therapy with pacemaker on mortality in heart failure patients: results of a high-volume, single-centre experience [^113YUgmR]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

The European CRT survey evaluated baseline clinical characteristics and outcomes of 2,438 CRT patients with or without an ICD from 13 European countries between November 2008 and June 2009. Similar to our study, they found that patients implanted with a CRT-D were younger, more often male, and more frequently had ischaemic aetiology of cardiomyopathy, while they had atrial fibrillation less often. However, the total cohort and patients implanted with a CRT-D in the European CRT survey were much older than the patients in our study (CRT-D patients were 68 years vs. 64 years in our study), and the proportion of ischaemic aetiology of cardiomyopathy was higher (55% vs. 51% in our study). The outcome data from the European CRT survey suggested that all CRT-D patients had better survival compared with CRT-P patients during short-term, 1-year (9–15 months) follow-up. Differences in clinical characteristics, such as a higher percentage of ischaemic patients and older age in the European CRT registry, may explain the different findings compared with our study. However, this needs further evaluation because currently, older patients are more likely to be implanted with a CRT-P device.

Another important observation of our registry data is the similar improvement in LV function in patients implanted with a CRT-D versus a CRT-P. This further underlines that since the improvement in cardiac function is the same in CRT-D and CRT-P, the all-cause mortality in ischaemic and non-ischaemic patients may be equally related to heart failure-related death, although there is a difference in sudden cardiac death (SCD)-related death.

### Left ventricular-only fusion pacing versus cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure patients: A randomized controlled trial [^116aQU1V]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

The study investigates whether the clinical benefits of cardiac resynchronization can be achieved by pacing only the left ventricle.

- **Hypothesis**: We aimed to compare the effect of a novel adaptive left ventricular-only fusion pacing (LVP) on ventricular function with conventional biventricular pacing (BVP) in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) indicated patients.

- **Methods**: This prospective, randomized, multicenter study enrolled CRT-indicated patients with a PR interval ≤ 200ms. Participants were randomized into the adaptive LVP group (using the AdaptivCRT™ algorithm with intentional non-capture right ventricular pacing) or the echocardiography-optimized BVP group. Cardiac function and echocardiography were evaluated at baseline and follow-ups. CRT super response was defined as a two-fold or more increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or final LVEF > 45%, a decrease in LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) > 15%, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class improved by at least one level.

- **Results**: Sixty-three patients were enrolled in the study (LVP = 34 vs. BVP = 29). At the 6-month follow-up, significant improvements in LVEF, LVESV, and NYHA class were observed in both groups. The CRT super response rate was significantly higher in patients with high-percentage adaptive LV-only pacing in the LVP group (68.4%) than in the BVP group (36.4%) [p = .04].

- **Conclusions**: Adaptive LV-only pacing was comparable to BVP in improving cardiac function and clinical condition in CRT-indicated patients. This finding raises the possibility that an adaptive LVP algorithm with appropriate right ventricular sensing could be beneficial.

### Survival in women versus men following implantation of pacemakers, defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices in a large, nationwide cohort [^111VvXbe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

The reasons for superior CRT outcome in women cannot be elucidated from this registry. Possibilities are systematic differences in patient selection and treatment differing from guidelines, presence of confounding factors encountered in real-world practice but not measured in randomized trials or accounted for in guidelines, or a fundamental sex-specific difference in the efficacy of therapy itself. In other reports, sex-specific CRT effect manifests even among patients matched for characteristics such as nonischemic cardiomyopathy, left bundle branch block, and QRS duration. Possibly, the value of the selection criterion of left bundle branch block is different between sexes, as noted for other diagnostic criteria in cardiology. Left ventricular size has recently been shown to be one such modulator, not accounted for in previous studies. These potential modulators demand prospective investigation, given the magnitude and importance of the effects demonstrated.

- **Strengths and limitations**: Our large cohort study of consecutive patients fulfills an important need described by the US Food and Drug Administration to gather real-world evidence, especially when randomized trial data are limited and generalizability to clinical practice is questionable. Given that any trial aiming to randomize on a sex-specific basis is likely to be unethical, large observational data are particularly important to resolve sex-specific treatment (but not comparative efficacy) effects in device patients. Available registries differ in important aspects. For instance, the NCDR collects data from Med.

### Upgrade of right ventricular pacing to cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: a randomized trial [^112KUvGv]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Between 24 November 2014 and 13 August 2021, a total of 576 patients were assessed for eligibility, and the reasons for exclusion are described in the supplementary data online, Table S3. Finally, 360 patients were enrolled at 17 sites from seven countries and randomly assigned to receive a CRT-D (n = 215) or an ICD (n = 145) upgrade procedure.

The clinical characteristics of the two groups were fairly balanced at baseline and previously described in detail. The study population had a substantial burden of comorbidities: most importantly atrial fibrillation, prior myocardial infarction, or diabetes. Almost half of the patients experienced hospitalization for heart failure (HF) within 12 months before enrollment. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 24.8 ± 6.6%, and more than two-thirds of the patients had a pacemaker (PM) device (predominantly DDD) implanted with a high right ventricular pacing burden (CRT-D group 85.4 ± 21.1%; ICD group 88.1 ± 18.8%).

Upgrade procedures failed in four (1.9%) patients assigned to the CRT-D arm due to unsuccessful LV lead implantation, while four (1.9%) patients in the CRT-D arm and one (0.7%) patient in the ICD arm were withdrawn before the procedure. The patients were followed for a median of 12.4 months. Twenty-seven patients (18.6%) crossed over from the ICD arm to CRT-D with biventricular pacing activated. Altogether, 12 (5.6%) patients in the CRT-D and 16 (11.0%) patients in the ICD arm died during follow-up.

### Echocardiography, dyssynchrony, and the response to cardiac resynchronization therapy [^115PGzfq]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Biventricular pacing, or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), has been a significant advancement in the treatment of chronic heart failure. However, not all patients experience benefits regarding symptoms or cardiac function, and some may even deteriorate with CRT. In this review, we explore the clinical and economic arguments for improved selection of patients for CRT beyond those outlined in current guidelines. It is evident that the primary mechanism of CRT is the correction of dyssynchrony, and we evaluate the various methodologies available to detect it.

Other factors, likely critical in determining outcomes, include lead position, the extent and form of myocardial damage, optimization of pacemaker performance, and clinical expertise. The potential costs of inappropriate CRT implantation are substantial for both patients and the healthcare economy, emphasizing the need for the cardiology community to develop better selection criteria. The guidelines can and should be enhanced.

### Optimizing resynchronization therapy: Can we increase the number of true responders [^111TVQdb]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy is now considered a standard therapy for patients with cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and interventricular conduction delay. Despite the demonstrated benefits in multiple large-scale trials, there is a clear nonresponder rate. This brief review will address some of the issues associated with maximizing the benefit of biventricular pacing and whether or not advances in programming of such devices will increase the number of true responders.
