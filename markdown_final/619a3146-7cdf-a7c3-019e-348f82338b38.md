## Question

Alyssa and Abigail need to collect 100 empty cans for their Science project. As of today, Alyssa collected 30 while Abigail collected 43 empty cans. How many more empty cans should they collect?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many more empty cans Alyssa and Abigail need to collect to reach their goal of 100 cans, given that Alyssa has 30 and Abigail has 43 so far. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of cans already collected. Then, I should verify the remaining amount needed by subtracting that total from the goal. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the current totals: Alyssa has 30 cans and Abigail has 43 cans, so together they have 30 + 43 = 73 cans collected so far.

> Wait, let me verify the subtraction before I jump ahead: the goal is 100 cans, and they have 73, so the remaining cans needed are 100 − 73 = 27 cans.

> Hold on, I should double-check the math to avoid a careless mistake: 30 + 43 is indeed 73, and 100 − 73 is 27, so the calculation is correct.

> Therefore, Alyssa and Abigail need to collect 27 more empty cans to reach their goal of 100 cans.

Alyssa and Abigail have collected **73 cans** so far (30 + 43) and need **27 more cans** to reach their goal of 100. The calculation is straightforward: 100 − 73 = 27.

---

## Calculation

- **Total cans collected**: 30 (Alyssa) + 43 (Abigail) = 73 cans
- **Cans needed**: 100 (goal) − 73 (collected) = 27 cans

---

## Answer

They need to collect **27 more empty cans** to reach their goal of 100.

### Safety and tolerance assessment of milk fat globule membrane-enriched infant formulas in healthy term Chinese infants: a randomised multicenter controlled trial [^33efdcf2]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Dietary intake

The participants received formula milk powder according to the coding in the concealed envelopes along with instructions for milk preparation and infant feeding. In the 2 nd week of enrolment all parents received a telephone call or home visit from the doctors or research nurses of each site to check milk intake, milk tolerance and to provide some advice on infant feeding including the amount of milk (milliliters) that should be prepared per feed, the number of milk feeds per day, and to record the volume of residual milk (milliliters) left in the bottle after feeding. A 24-h recall of food intake, tolerance, and stool characteristics were collected at each time visit (Fig. 1). To improve study adherence, participants in the formula-fed groups were asked to return the empty formula cans at each clinic visit. The counts of incoming empty formula cans and outgoing formula milk cans were recorded by the clerk in charge of the formula storage house. Parents or caregivers of breastfed infants were required to keep a record of all formula fed to their infants, so that researchers could check compliance with breast milk intake.

Evaluation of digestive tolerance was based on the volume of formula intake and any other dietary intakes, stool characteristics, including frequency of predominant stool color (brown, yellow, green, red or black) and consistency for each stool (1. hard (lumps), 2. formed (normal), 3. soft (creamy), 4. liquid or loose/watery (like diarrhea)), diarrhea defined as 4 or more loose or watery stools in 24 h and mucus, frequency of spitting up or vomiting, crying after 15 min feeding, night crying and sleep behavior and periods of restlessness.

Assessment of adverse events and health

Medically confirmed adverse events (AEs) including onset, duration, severity and seriousness, relationship with the study formula, any actions taken, and the outcomes were collected during the study. AEs were considered to be serious (SAEs) if they were fatal or life-threatening events causing permanent harm or requiring or extending inpatient treatment at a hospital. Serious AEs were followed-up by the investigator until a stable situation had been reached. The study investigators assessed the seriousness of an AE and its causal relation to the study products. All events that were anticipated from the study population were documented as AEs in the study database.

### Trypanosoma brucei gambiense-iELISA: a promising new test for the post-elimination monitoring of human African trypanosomiasis [^8a9a5295]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The g -iELISA makes use of a combination of native T.b. gambiense antigens that are also used in other serodiagnostic tests for g HAT, like the RDTs HAT Sero-K-SeT and SD Bioline HAT, latex agglutination, and other ELISAs. None of these tests had a specificity higher than the minimum of 99.5% proposed in the TPP. For example, an ELISA with a mixture of VSGs LiTat 1.3, LiTat 1.5, and LiTat 1.6 was 99.2% (95% CI: 95.7–100) specific with sera from 128 negative controls and 98.7% (95% CI: 93.1–100) sensitive with sera from 78 g HAT patients, which, at 0.05% prevalence, would yield a PPV of 6.0% (95% CI:.9–30.8%). At the same prevalence, the here described g -iELISA on plasma would yield a PPV of 9.2% (95% CI: 3.2–23.8%), which is still far from optimal. Interestingly, maximum PPV was obtained when testing DBS instead of plasma (due to 100% specificity). For large-scale surveillance, the easiest specimen to collect is DBS, which is used in other disease surveillance programs. Active, village-based screening for g HAT by means of collecting DBS for remote testing in ELISA or other antibody detection tests has already been proposed a long time ago as an alternative to active screening by mobile teams. Its cost-effectiveness is evaluated in an ongoing study in Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Guinea, and DRC. More detailed analysis is required to assess the level of certainty the g -iELISA would provide in verifying whether the elimination of transmission goal has been reached using this collection framework. The benefits of other plausible sampling schemes for measurement of the elimination goal could be quantified using state-of-the-art Bayesian statistical frameworks, historical data, and mechanistic modelling approaches.

### Acute canopy deficits in global cities exposed by the 3-30-300 benchmark for urban nature [^6863f535]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Figure 5 shows that tree size was a major difference between the New York and Seattle datasets. The median canopy area of individual trees near buildings in Seattle was 35–45 m² in a majority of census tracts, much higher than the median size of just 10–15 m² in a majority of New York's census tracts. However, planting density was much higher in New York, with densities extending up to around 110 trees/ha, whereas in Seattle, no census tract had a planting density exceeding 70 trees/ha, and a majority of tracts showed densities ranging from 30–50 trees/ha.

Fig. 5
Distribution of tree size and planting density in Seattle and New York.

Seattle's trees show higher average canopy cover, whereas New York is more effective at planting higher densities of trees.

It is important to recognise that these are asynchronous results collected using methods with different levels of precision and, therefore, must not be understood as a fair comparison of each city, but rather a comparison of two urban forests seeking to achieve a goal by different means. In this case, it is clear that a lower density of large trees around buildings outperformed a denser planting of small trees. It is also clear that both urban forests were not sufficiently mature or dense to perform well in the '30' test; a population with trees as large as Seattle's but planted as densely as those in New York may have achieved much higher success. It is unclear whether the predominance of very small trees in New York reflects a high proportion of recently planted trees or simply constrained growth. We also cannot be certain that the larger size of Seattle's median tree necessarily reflects an absence of these constraints.

### Alternative water transport and storage containers: assessing sustained use of the packHO in rural Haiti [^7f57176a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Water collection is both a physical and time burden when not available on household premises, and women and children have primary responsibility of collection in almost three quarters of global households. – Global access to basic drinking water services, defined as improved sources requiring no more than 30 minutes to collect, increased from 81.1% in 2000 to 88.5% in 2015. Despite this progress, an estimated 263 million people still have only limited access and spend more than 30 minutes per round trip to collect drinking water from improved water sources. Furthermore, unimproved sources, such as surface water and unprotected springs, are often located farther from home than improved sources.

In a study of 24 sub-Saharan African countries, the proportion of rural households who traveled more than 30 minutes varied from 2% in Liberia to 58% in Mauritania. In 13 of the 24 countries, between 20% and 50% of rural households spent more than 30 minutes per trip to collect water. In Artibonite, Haiti, 29.6% of households reported their drinking water source to be more than 30 minutes away. Similar to that in other geographic areas, women were predominately responsible for water collection in Artibonite, with 81.1% of households reporting an adult female to be involved in water collection.

Water collection containers are often carried on the head, although other methods of transport may include back-loading, rolling filled containers, or using animals. The existing literature suggests that carrying water on the head leads to back and neck pain and possible degenerative changes in the spine, given the weight of the loads and the repetitive stress. Whereas head-loading was found to be associated with neck pain, back-loading was associated with more areas of pain and discomfort than head-loading. However, both acute and long-term consequences of carrying water, either on the head or on the back, remain largely unknown. Typical containers for transporting and storing water include buckets or jerry cans, which are plastic, narrow-mouthed containers. These containers vary in size and may hold up to 20 L, weighing 44 pounds when filled with water. In Haiti, head-loading is common and the majority of households (89.1%) use a 20-L bucket as their primary storage container.

### Estimating need and coverage for five priority assistive products: a systematic review of global population-based research [^59f9d266]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

We have four main recommendations following our comprehensive review. First, considering the methodological and reporting variation between studies, we recommend establishing a global minimum AP dataset allowing researchers to address specific questions and compare evidence. This dataset should include the following: (1) standardised measures to determine individual need for an AP; (2) standardised APs (eg, APLs);(3) standardised AP access indicators (as presented in this review) and (4) standardised approaches to measuring them. Second, we recommend the collection and use of data that holistically considers an individual's personal and environmental factors when assessing their capacity to benefit from an AP. As more holistic measurement methodology is developed, it is critical that it is tested and adapted for diverse contexts, especially LMICs. Third, modules collecting data to inform AP indicators should be included in established population surveys to maximise existing data collection methods and enable more nuanced secondary analyses. This can be supported by working with national statistics offices in both high and LMIC countries. Finally, differentiation should be made between the total using an AP, and within that value, the total with met need. This can highlight undermet needs among AP users, which provides further data about the setting and/or population for which specific APs are not fully appropriate. To begin to collate this dataset, a global AT data portalaccompanying this review will make all extracted study data available and more accessible. This portal will also serve as a place to host future data, employing features to map evidence and provide context across disciplines to support knowledge sharing in this sector.

### Herbarium collections remain essential in the age of community science [^3d59cd9a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

As nations around the world embark on their path to protecting 30% of land by 2030, our ability to integrate climate change planning into the expansion of protected areas may determine the future of Earth's biodiversity –. Given the value of already digitized herbarium specimens, our results suggest that the digitization of remaining collections would likely greatly improve our ability to model biodiversity today and into a climatically uncertain future. Moreover, alongside offering valuable (and more scientifically reliable) species occurrence data, the physical specimen behind the digital record holds a wealth of additional information. In fact, the concept of digitization has recently been extended beyond simple digital images to include layers of additional morphological and genetic datathat have been used to estimate evolutionary lineages, sample historical genomes, quantify changes in functional traits, uncover new taxa, and re-evaluate what we thought were extinct species –. In the context of global change, herbaria, and their collections are increasingly relied on to understand biodiversity trends in the Anthropocene and provide critical baseline data for future assessments of climate change –. This has sparked calls for an open-access global metaherbarium to facilitate the use of herbarium data and realize the immense scientific potential of fully digitized collections. So why then have only ~21% of Earth's more than 396M herbarium specimens been digitized,?

It is not because herbaria lack the methodological knowledge to do so. Around the world, herbaria are undertaking mass-digitization projects that have resulted in millions of specimens now being digitally available to researchers –. In Canada, many of the 88 currently active herbaria have digitization experience, and standardized and reproducible digitization workflows are publicly available. Attempts since 2007 to aggregate data under the Canadensys network have contributed to the digitization of over 900,000 specimens and have produced a trove of digitization knowledge, resources, and technology. Unfortunately, in Canada and around the world, funding remains a major hurdle to the digitization of remaining specimens. We estimate that the digitization of Canada's remaining 7.3M specimens would cost around $22M (~$3 per specimen using traditional workflows,), which is relatively low when viewed against the biodiversity benefits. For context, in 2023, $22M represented only 0.14% of Canada's annual spending on science and technology.

### Half of resources in threatened species conservation plans are allocated to research and monitoring [^feab557c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Funds to combat biodiversity loss are insufficient, requiring conservation managers to make trade-offs between costs for actions to avoid further loss and costs for research and monitoring to guide effective actions. Using species' management plans for 2328 listed species from three countries we show that 50% of species' proposed recovery plan budgets are allocated to research and monitoring. The proportion of budgets allocated to research and monitoring vary among jurisdictions and taxa, but overall, species with higher proportions of budgets allocated to research and monitoring have poorer recovery outcomes. The proportion allocated to research and monitoring is lower for more recent recovery plans, but for some species, plans have allocated the majority of funds to information gathering for decades. We provide recommendations for careful examination of the value of collecting new information in recovery planning to ensure that conservation programs emphasize action or research and monitoring that directly informs action.

### Validation of an automatically generated screening score for frailty: the care assessment need (CAN) score [^14ba7d77]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Clearly, there are resource implications depending on the cut-off score used.

At the 95 th percentile most would be frail; however, the absolute numbers would likely be less than using a 55 th percentile. Furthermore, it is very likely that many in the 95 th percentile, even those not formally diagnosed with frailty, would already be receiving comprehensive care for complex illness in other clinical programs. If resources are limited, targeting patients in the 95 th percentile who are not already receiving specialized care is a reasonable alternative to initiate a frailty screening program. If resources are available to perform a CGA-based frailty assessment on all individuals with a CAN of 55, a frailty assessment program, that also excludes those receiving specialized care, could be initiated. Identifying 4 of 10 patients with true frailty is patient-centered, quality of life focused, and will also include the reward of additional organizational cost reductions. Another strategy to address the high false positive rates may be repeat testing over time. Contrasting with the difficulties of administering questionnaires or conducting performance-based tests, repeated testing with the CAN score becomes a feasible and more cost-effective approach. As frailty may be a reversible, having several data points at which the CAN score is generated over time would improve the accuracy of screening. This approach will require further study.

A major strength of this work is the widespread use of the validated CGA as a clinical tool based on millions of patient visits. Another strength of our study is the relatively large sample size and the completeness of our data. Although initially not considered in the design and development of this study, the CAN score fits within the deficit accumulation paradigm of frailty which supports construct validity between the tools. Limitations of our study was the inclusion of mostly male patients enrolled in a geriatric medicine clinic. Older patients in other primary care clinics with a larger number of older women may be different from this sample. Although the number of participants appears low, the sample exceeds the calculated minimum number of participants needed.

### Abiraterone acetate (Abirtega) [^7a64294c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take or treatments you receive, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. ABIRTEGA can interact with many other medicines.

You should not start or stop any medicine before you talk with the healthcare provider that prescribed ABIRTEGA.

Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them with you to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

How should I take ABIRTEGA?

Take ABIRTEGA and prednisone exactly as your healthcare provider tells you.
Take your prescribed dose of ABIRTEGA 1 time a day.
Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed.
Do not change or stop taking your prescribed dose of ABIRTEGA or prednisone without talking with your healthcare provider first.
Take ABIRTEGA tablets as a single dose one time a day on an empty stomach. Do not eat food 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking ABIRTEGA.
Do not take ABIRTEGA with food. Taking ABIRTEGA with food may cause more of the medicine to be absorbed by the body than is needed and this may cause side effects.
Swallow ABIRTEGA tablets whole. Do not crush or chew tablets.
Take ABIRTEGA tablets with water.
If you miss a dose of ABIRTEGA tablets or prednisone, take your prescribed dose the following day. If you miss more than 1 dose, tell your healthcare provider right away.
Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to check for side effects.

### Computational strategic recruitment for representation and coverage studied in the all of Us research program [^e7ce40f3]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the aforementioned limitations, this work has several promising applications and future directions. Using data available to the program right now, All of Us can evaluate which existing sites are worth investing additional recruitment resources in to achieve their desired recruitment goals. The same methodology can also be used to determine where to open new recruitment sites as long as the program has some prior knowledge about the response demographics at the potential new site. Beyond All of Us, other data repositories and collectors may utilize our methodology to guide recruitment efforts for representativeness and coverage. Our methodology may be applied to multi-site studies at any scale. Another promising avenue for research could be to measure participant retention rates and adapt the recruitment strategy accordingly, which may be of particular relevance for longitudinal studies and interventional trials. Further research could analyze the impacts – expected and unforeseen – of these modified recruitment strategies. For example, studies may analyze whether more representative and covering datasets do, in fact, yield more accurate or generalizable artificial intelligence models. Other future studies may analyze the impact of strategic recruitment on data quality or define representation across additional study-relevant variables. A notable strength of our proposed methodology is that study designers may choose which variables they want to prioritize for representation and coverage, provided they have a ground truth or target value available. We opted to use broad demographic variables (age, gender, race, and ethnicity) because of their availability for comparison against Census data, but clinical or geographic variables may also be used.

In conclusion, we showed the utility of computational strategic recruitment to guide site selection and improve representation and coverage of recruited cohorts. We extended previous work in adaptive recruitment resource allocationin three notable ways: to dual-objective constrained optimization that balances representation and coverage, to actual participant response distributions using historical data from a nationwide program, and to the larger and more complex recruitment policy space in All of Us. With these contributions, we further bridge the gap between methodological theory and practice and provide an actionable pathway for data-collecting programs to achieve several simultaneous recruitment goals.

### If we build it, will they come? Results of a quasi-experimental study assessing the impact of maternity waiting homes on facility-based childbirth and maternity care in Zambia [^10252b69]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Participants

A cross-sectional sample of households was identified at baseline (March–May, 2016) and endline (September–October, 2018) using a multi-stage random sampling procedure. In the first stage, 10 villages located at least 10 km from the RHC from each catchment area were randomly selected with probability proportional to size. To identify eligible villages, every village centre was visited and GPS coordinates were taken to determine travel distance to the RHC along the most direct route, calculated using ArcGIS Online (ESRI, Redlands, California, USA). In the second stage, eligibility was restricted to households with at least one woman 15 years or older who delivered a child in the previous 12 months, irrespective of her place of delivery or current vital status. An exhaustive list of eligible households was created with input from RHC staff, community health volunteers and local traditional leaders. Households were then ordered randomly and visited in that order to confirm eligibility and enrol until the target of approximately six households per village was reached. In the third stage, if a household had more than one eligible woman, one woman was selected at random during enrolment. While we did not ask about previous participation in the survey, it is possible that some women who had another delivery between the data collection rounds were selected for endline. There is no reason to believe this would disproportionately affect one study arm more than the other.

Procedures

During each round of data collection, a team of trained enumerators who spoke English and the local language spent 6 weeks conducting surveys. Data enumerators were introduced to the household head or senior woman by community volunteers. On confirming household eligibility, the study team consented the household head, geolocated the household and captured demographic information. On completion of this portion of the survey, the eligible woman was selected, consented separately and responded to the remainder of the survey in a private space. Survey topics included household composition and individual characteristics; experience of the last pregnancy including ANC, labour and delivery, birth outcomes and postnatal care; and MWH use. All responses were self-reported; when available, responses were verified against the mother's antenatal card or the baby's under-5 card. Data were captured electronically on encrypted tablets using SurveyCTO Collect software (V.2.212; Dobility). Audits on a random selection of 5% of households the following day found few inconsistencies.

### Global sampling decline erodes science potential of natural history collections [^3c6b06b3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

These examples illustrate that the increased richness, availability and connectivity of specimen-based data are repositioning natural history collections as globally relevant research infrastructure. However, this expanded value is fundamentally dependent on their taxonomic breadth, geographical range and ongoing temporal coverage. This means that the utility of natural history collections for understanding and responding to the world's major biological and environmental challenges depends both on the ongoing mobilisation of legacy specimen data, as well as the continued collection, characterisation and digitisation of new specimens from across geographical regions and clades of the tree of life. Indeed, our ability to effectively leverage collections data for studying and responding to environmental and societal challenges depends on ongoing specimen collection of sufficient volume, taxonomic breadth and spatial coverage to provide the information needed to understand historical and contemporary patterns and predict future trends.

### Lessons from COVID-19 for rescalable data collection [^471ad904]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Novel data and analyses have had an important role in informing the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing surveillance systems were scaled up, and in some instances new systems were developed to meet the challenges posed by the magnitude of the pandemic. We describe the routine and novel data that were used to address urgent public health questions during the pandemic, underscore the challenges in sustainability and equity in data generation, and highlight key lessons learnt for designing scalable data collection systems to support decision making during a public health crisis. As countries emerge from the acute phase of the pandemic, COVID-19 surveillance systems are being scaled down. However, SARS-CoV-2 resurgence remains a threat to global health security; therefore, a minimal cost-effective system needs to remain active that can be rapidly scaled up if necessary. We propose that a retrospective evaluation to identify the cost-benefit profile of the various data streams collected during the pandemic should be on the scientific research agenda.

### Appropriate use criteria for lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid testing in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease [^a2ec1b94]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion of the evidence — adverse effects and safety of LP for suspected AD states that CSF can be collected safely and reliably via LP; safety for CSF collection has been documented in more than 7000 patients with suspected AD in 10 studies and is consistent with documentation in more than 30,000 patients across neurologic disorders; to minimize risk, evaluate potential contraindications including medications that could interfere with coagulation, recent seizures, some disorders of blood clotting, intracranial lesions, impaired consciousness, and papilledema; the workgroup recommends using an atraumatic narrow bore needle, avoiding repeated attempts in difficult LP cases, and avoiding collection of more than 30 mL of CSF (the threshold for PLPH risk); fear of the procedure is an independent risk factor that can be decreased by sensitive, matter-of-fact verbal communication by clinicians familiar and comfortable with LP.

### Polyneuropathy quality measurement set: quality improvement in neurology [^98fd5eb1]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Polyneuropathy pain improvement measure — improvement is defined as 30% reduction in scale score for the first index score in the patient record, the index score does not reset annually, and there is no expectation of 100% improvement; the original index score is used through time to monitor improvement of 30% or greater, as evidence supports patients can expect a 30%–50% improvement over time with appropriate treatment, with patients possibly lost to the numerator when they are not seen at 12 months (± 60 days); validated 10-point or 100-point pain scales are now standard in practice, so no new data collection burden is anticipated.

### Low-carbohydrate diets in children and adolescents with or at risk for diabetes [^44264478]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Carbohydrate counting example for meal planning in adolescents: In practice, pediatricians often help families set goals to limit carbohydrate to a lower number of grams per day or per meal than baseline; for example, if an adolescent is eating 150 to 200 g of carbohydrate per meal, carbohydrate counting would be recommended to limit meals to 100 to 150 g of carbohydrate and increase servings of vegetables as a first step.

### Acute canopy deficits in global cities exposed by the 3-30-300 benchmark for urban nature [^9ba0df2b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

3-30-300 could also better incentivise the delivery of quality green infrastructure. The 3-30-300 rule does consider quality to some degree using size as a proxy (requiring 'reasonably established' trees in the '3' test, and parks above a certain size in the '300' test). However, the link between these proxies and the quality of parks and trees is quite tenuous. Recent studies have demonstrated how the quality of parksand the health of treescan be measured more precisely at the city scale. Our findings in relation to tree size underline the need for the latter consideration.

Another area of potential improvement is grading that captures the 3-30-300 concept without demanding a sharp binary assessment, whereby 29% canopy is just as much a failure as 1%. The examples of a notional grading demonstrated in Supplementary 2 ranged between 0 and 10, but this could be refined. Firstly, a scoring system might weigh the components of 3-30-300 rather than scoring them equally (for example, the canopy may be more important than tree views). Scorings that range from 0–10 might inadvertently position a full 3-30-300 achievement as an aspirational maximum score, rather than a bare minimum for human wellbeing. Accordingly, gradings could be revised to reward buildings for exceeding the standard and assign penalties for missing the standard. This could result in a scoring system that ranges from – 5 to + 5, with an achievement of 3-30-300 as the 0 point.

### Assessment, measurement and data collection tools [^3d840148]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

The terms 'measurement' and 'assessment' are often used interchangeably, especially when referring to the tools used to collect information. This leads to unclear thinking, and often to poor selection of a 'measure' or 'assessment'. This editorial suggests that we should distinguish between the identification of the data needed for some purpose, the methods used to collect data, and the use made of (interpretation of) the data collected. This would focus more attention on the three most important questions to consider when collecting data, whether in day-to-day clinical practice or in research: Why should the data be collected? How should the data be collected? and How should the results be interpreted?

Plot-level data on conversion decisions come from a household survey collected 1.5 years after the voucher distribution (July 2014), after planting for the main season was completed. A second wave of data was collected after the harvest between November 2014 and March 2015. This is the main source of plot-level data used in the analysis, as its timing allows us to fully capture the impact of modern seed varieties on households' conversion decisions. The household head (often a man in this context) was asked for detailed information about all the plots the household cultivated in the main season of 2014, including crop use, prior use of the plot, the period of fallow, planting and harvesting dates, tenure, etc. A separate module asked for recall data, for each plot, on agricultural labor for all main agricultural activities (clearing, land preparation, sowing, weeding, and harvesting), separately for men and women in the household, estimating both the number of people and the hours worked to obtain an estimate of total man-days. The module similarly asked for any hired labor and participation in labor exchanges. Data on agricultural wage labor income by household members come from an income module with all household members. Household surveys are further described in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary notes. Quantitative data collection and questionnaire design was preceded by extensive qualitative interviews and piloting before each wave. Qualitative fieldwork was also used to deepen understanding of farmers' land conversion decisions and to triangulate findings.

Sample selection for the surveys was based on village census and administrative data from the voucher distribution. In each of the treatment villages, we randomly drew two beneficiaries assigned the 30, 60, and 90% subsidy and three beneficiaries assigned the 100% subsidy for a total of 9 households per treatment village. The sample selection was stratified based on the households' membership in producer organizations, on having a leadership position in the village, and on polygyny. In each control village, 12 households were randomly selected based on the same stratification criteria.

From the household data, we can exploit differences in subsidy levels at the household level to measure forest conversion decisions at a granular (plot)-level and to distinguish between primary and secondary forest. We further rely on households' labor allocation for field preparation as an indirect measure of deforestation. Given the limited supply of labor at peak demand times in the study area and the labor intensity of tree cover removal, changes in land use decisions should translate into labor reallocation at the household level.

### Casein [^6364b4b7]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

10ml × 100 = Vn × 10,000

0.1 mL = Vn

Using a sterile technique, remove 0.10 mL of extract from the 10,000 AU/ml or BAU/ml vial and place it into a vial containing 9.90 mL of sterile diluent. The resulting concentration will be 10ml vial of 100 AU/ml or BAU/ml.

Intervals between doses: The optimal interval between doses of allergenic extract has not been definitely established. The amount of allergenic extract is increased at each injection by not more than 50%-100% of the previous amount and the next increment is governed by the response to the last injection. There are three generally accepted methods of pollen hyposensitizing therapy.

1. PRESEASONAL

Treatment starts each year 6 to 8 weeks before onset of seasonal symptoms. Maximal dose reached just before symptoms are expected. Injections discontinued during and following season until next year.

2. CO-SEASONAL

Patient is first treated during season with symptoms. Low initial doses are employed to prevent worsening of condition. This is followed by an intensive schedule of therapy (i.e. injections given 2 to 3 times per week). Fewer Allergists are resorting to this Co-seasonal therapy because of the availability of more effective, symptomatic medications that allow the patient to go through a season relatively symptom free.

3. PERENNIAL

Initially this is the same as pre seasonal. The allergen is administered twice weekly or weekly for about 20 injections to achieve the maximum tolerated dose. Then, maintenance therapy may be administered once a week or less frequently.

Duration of Treatment: The usual duration of treatment has not been established. A period of two or three years of injection therapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment.

### Global sampling decline erodes science potential of natural history collections [^1803c7cc]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Potential drivers of decline in collections data

There are likely multiple causal factors associated with the observed decline in collecting activity (e.g. geopolitical, socioeconomic, support for scientific and digital infrastructure, resources for growing and training capability, shifting public perceptions, etc.), the relative importance of which will vary by country and institution. While analysis of how various drivers may interact at institutional, local, national and global scales to drive observed collecting patterns is beyond the scope of this study, we highlight some key considerations here:
Resource constraints: Limited funding sources for collections, coupled with rising labour and infrastructure costs, and stricter fieldwork safety requirements have dramatically increased per-specimen costs and reduced institutional capacity for collecting, processing, and housing specimens –. For many natural history collections, ever-declining budgets mean that basic maintenance and collection management may be all that is feasible, despite growing demands for specimen-based data.
Regulatory and ethical considerations: These include safety/risk assessments (e.g. biosecurity and conservation concerns), which increasingly drive approval processes for collection permits. The rapid growth of alternative data streams (e.g. autonomous sensors, audio recordings, citizen science observations) likely contributes to views that the continued collection of physical specimens needs much stronger scientific justification than would have been the case in the past. This is particularly the case for vertebrates, where public sensitivity to collecting activities is high, though is not as relevant as a driver to consider for plants. Emerging national and international initiatives aimed at recognising the rights of traditional owners (e.g. the Nagoya Protocol, the Global Indigenous Data Alliance, CARE principles) add further complexities, requiring thoughtful navigation –.
Shifting workforce priorities: Growing recognition of the need to 'future-proof' natural history collections is driving capability expansion (e.g. digitisation, genomics, big data analytics and ML/AI applications). The demand for greater skills diversity in collection workforce roles means stretched funding for traditional curatorial expertise (see (e) below), exacerbated by the fact that, as collecting activities decline, fewer people are trained in collection techniques, curation and basic taxonomy.
Targeted collecting trends: There has been a shift towards collecting only specific target species rather than holistic, broad-based censuses of species present in an area. As we argue below, to some extent, future collecting activities may need to further shift the focus from species discovery (clear exceptions being geographic regions with biodiversity hotspots or hyper-diverse groups such as insects) to characterising and predicting eco-evolutionary processes in a changing world.
Funder and public perceptions: There continue to be persistent gaps in public awareness and funding body understanding of the role of natural history collections or how sampling, identification, and preservation of physical specimens critically underpins the ability of collections to contribute to addressing environmental problems. Importantly, collections-based work by formally trained taxonomists provides the essential knowledge base for other data sources such as long-term ecological sites, citizen science initiatives, and indeed any aspect of biodiversity science.
Species discovery: Related to points (d) and (e), is the possibility that observed declines in rates of species discovery (especially for Chordata and Plantae, which are much less diverse than Arthropoda) are related to these taxonomic groups approaching higher levels of taxonomic saturation (e.g. in Europe and North America). This could negatively impact the perceived need for continued collecting and thus the levels of institutional and funder support.

Data collection

Baseline surveys were administered to 869 girls and 764 caregivers from May to July 2015, and endline data were collected after intervention from August to October 2016. Survey data collectors were trained by Columbia University and IRC. Both the girls' and caregivers' surveys were translated into French, Swahili and Mashi, and interviewers and questionnaires were appropriately matched to respondents by language. All data were collected in empty, private rooms in local community-based organisations. Two methods of data collection were employed for the girls' survey. Less sensitive questions from the questionnaire were administered through face-to-face interviews using Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). More sensitive questions, such as those on violence exposure and sexual behaviours, were self-administered by girls using Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing (ACASI). Additionally, some of the violence and sexual health questions were not administered to girls aged 10–12 years for ethical and cultural reasons. All caregiver surveys were administered using CAPI. Primary and secondary outcomes for girls and caregivers can be found in table 1. All girl and caregiver outcomes were self-reported by girls and caregivers, respectively.

### CanScreen5, a global repository for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening programs [^acbb8d75]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Essential criteria for organized screening

The qualitative data collection tools collect data to assess 13 of the following 16 essential criteria identified by an IARC expert group to define organized cancer screening:(1) the cancer screening program has a protocol or guideline describing at least the target population, screening intervals, screening tests, referral pathway and management of positive cases; (2) there is a system in place for identifying the target population; (3) there is a system in place for inviting eligible individuals for screening; (4) the cancer screening program has a policy framework from the health authorities defining governance structure, financing, and the goals and objectives of the program; (5) performance of the screening program is evaluated with appropriate indicators; (6) the protocol or guideline at least describes monitoring and evaluation; (7) there is a system in place for notifying the results to the screened individuals and informing them about follow-up; (8) there is a system in place for sending a recall notice to noncompliant individuals; (9) the program can be audited; (10) a specified team or organization is responsible for quality assurance and improvement; (11) the performance of the cancer screening program is evaluated, published and widely disseminated on a regular basis; (12) all activities along the screening pathway are planned, coordinated and evaluated through a quality improvement framework (quality assurance); (13) there is an evidence-based protocol or guideline developed in consensus with most stakeholders; (14) an information system exists with appropriate links between population databases, screening information and cancer registries for screening implementation and evaluation; (15) the screening program has a provision for continued training for service providers; (16) the performance of the screening program is evaluated with reference standards for the indicators. The CanScreen5 project was started before we received recommendations from the IARC expert group. Hence, three indicators (6, 9 and 15) were not included in the qualitative questionnaire. These will be added in the next versions of the data collection tools.

Statistical analysis

For descriptive analysis on qualitative information, proportion (%) was used for each item according to continent (Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe and Oceania). For performance indicators on quantitative data, examination coverage, proportion put forward for further assessment, further assessment participation rate, detection rate, PPV of the screening test and treatment rate were calculated for each program using the formulas presented in Supplementary Table 4 (using the CanScreen5 website data manager).

### Global sampling decline erodes science potential of natural history collections [^27ac2850]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Potential impacts on collection science

The unique value of natural history collections is based on comprehensive spatiotemporal coverage of biodiversity at local, regional, continental and global scales. The over-arching consequence of the observed decline in collecting activities is to significantly erode this value, hampering advances in biodiversity science, and ultimately reducing the ability of collections to assist with understanding and responding to global crises such as climate change and biodiversity loss. This decline is particularly concerning for evidence-based policymaking, conservation, management of ecosystem services and crisis management, which rely on accurate predictions of spatial and temporal trends. Decreased specimen data coverage leads to lower accuracy and higher uncertainty in statistical inferences from collection data, and also undermines the utility of other ecological data streams, which are dependent on accurate species identification. These trends are compromising our ability to estimate ongoing climate and land-use change impacts, model species distribution trends, and predict future ecological and evolutionary impacts. This data gap further increases the risk that we will be unable to adequately manage or protect the ecosystems that represent our greatest natural resource, providing critical life support systems for humanity and Earth's biosphere.

Importantly, for natural history collections to mobilise, enhance and add value to the fundamental specimen data they hold, it is critical that they also deploy and integrate emerging technologies. This includes developing approaches to link taxonomic, geolocation, environmental, phenotypic and genetic data layers, and building predictive models and analytical tools to fully leverage biodiversity data. While increasingly, collections have new data science tools and technical platforms at their disposal, the trend of decreasing growth in collection data inhibits their capacity to leverage these tools to their full potential, leading to underutilisation of such technological advances, and decreased ability of collection science to contribute to global initiatives. Arguably, this is happening at a historical environmental juncture when these unique scientific contributions are most urgently required.

### Extent of illicit cigarette sales in Nepal: findings from a retail survey [^3185c1c0]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

There are several widely used and recommended methods to measure the extent of illicit cigarette trade, such as gap analysis, pack examination studies, survey of tobacco users and econometric modelling. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. However, many methods are not feasible in the case of Nepal due to the unavailability of required data. The possible and commonly used method is pack examination if there is a distinct pack feature, which allows determination of tax avoidance/evasion by visual inspection.

In the Nepalese context, cigarettes are widely sold as single sticks and almost half of men who smoke consume < 5 sticks/day. Littered pack analysis could result in bias if the people purchasing whole packs are different (most likely wealthier) from those purchasing single sticks. Therefore, we used the pack examination method, an adapted methodology used in neighbouring countries of Indiaand Bangladeshthat collects empty packets from single stick retailers at the end of the day. Additionally, discarded/littered cigarette packs were also collected from the streets nearby the retail shops (5 min walk), and photographs were taken of any brands stocked by each retailer that were not represented in the collection of empty packets at the end of the day to compare the estimates from different sources to the findings from retailers. A structured questionnaire was used to gather additional information from retailers.

IV. Blood Filtration Instructions

1. Filter and process whole blood within 72 hours of collection.

2. Mix whole blood/anticoagulant gently and thoroughly.

3. Place empty red cell storage bag on a horizontal surface.
4. Ensure cap of blood recovery vent above the filter is tightly closed.
5. Hang whole blood bag up to 60 inches (1.52 meters) above empty red cell storage bag and ensure filter is vertical. Note: The maximum head height should be 60 inches (1.52 meters) for whole blood filtered at room temperature and at 1 — 6 °C.
6. Open snap-open closure of whole blood bag. Priming will occur automatically by gravity.
7. After blood fills one side of the air vent below the filter, open snap-open closure immediately below the air vent to begin filtration.
8. Allow blood to filter by gravity. Note: Do not apply mechanical or manual pressure to increase flow rate. Filtration is complete when whole blood bag is empty.
9. Remove cap from blood recovery vent above the filter and allow the upstream side (non-printed side) of the filter to drain.
10. When the upstream side of the filter is empty, clamp tubing below the filter. Note: Filtration times can be influenced by collection and processing conditions and biological variability of donors. Experimental data with some filter products indicate that a prolonged filtration can be an indication of sub-optimal leukocyte reduction.
11. Seal tubing just below the snap-open closure.*
12. Detach and discard collection bag and filter.* Note: Do not strip tubing prior to sealing tubing. If it is desired to strip blood from numbered tubing, do so only after tubing has been sealed close to the snap-open closure and detached.
13. If desired, seal at or adjacent to "X" marks on the tubing to provide numbered segments of anticoagulated blood for typing or crossmatching.* Notes: If it is necessary to strip blood from numbered tubing for re-suspension, care should be taken when stripping is performed. Increased (mechanical) hemolysis has been associated with stripping when blood is cold and has a higher hematocrit. Do not strip forcefully or frequently against a snap-open closure.

The COMSA project was launched in January 2017. However, actual data collection in five phase-one provinces started in March 2018. The remaining provinces, included in phase two, started data collection in October 2018. The annual updated census, planned in late 2019, was delayed first by the rainy season and subsequently by the COVID-19 pandemic. A provincially staggered census was completed in the second half of 2020, providing data to update the sample population and assess and complement birth events data reported in the years 2019 and 2020.

Due to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the 2020 data collection, the CSAs were further trained and deployed to collect data on births and deaths retrospectively for the year 2020. Thus, data reported here include a combination of the events data reported by the CSAs since the start of the project, updated with the census conducted in 2020, and the 2020 retrospective capture of events during the pandemic period.

### Mapping global dynamics of benchmark creation and saturation in artificial intelligence [^6c8be88e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Creating global maps of AI benchmark dynamics

Comparing SOTA trajectories across a wide variety of tasks, benchmarks and performance metrics is not trivial: How significant is a certain increment in performance? What constitutes a markedly unimpressive result (i.e. the 'floor' of our expectations)? What would constitute the best result realistically possible (i.e. the 'ceiling' of our expectations)?

Different performance metrics can inherently cover widely different value ranges. For example, for the performance metric accuracy, the inherent lowest value would be 0%, while the inherent highest value would be 100%. However, this is often less helpful for judging benchmark results than one might hope: For a balanced dataset with two classes, the floor should rather be set to 50%, as this would be the accuracy achieved by a random classifier. For an unbalanced dataset, the inherent floor might be another value — i.e. it would be highly dataset specific. Similar concerns can also be raised about the potential ceiling value: for example, a perfect accuracy score of 100% might never be achievable even by the best hypothetical model because of limitations inherent in the dataset (e.g. mislabeled examples in the test set).

Arguably, the best solution for judging and comparing trajectories would be an in-depth manual analysis and curation of all benchmarks, where floor values are determined by trivially simple prediction algorithms and ceiling values are determined through gold standards (e.g. expert human curators). Unfortunately, such curated data are not available for the vast majority of benchmarks. Moreover, even purported gold standard test sets can have severe limitations. For example, many recent NLP benchmarks were quickly saturated with some systems reaching above-human performance on test sets — but further analyses reveal that models achieving very high performance often did so through recognizing benchmark-inherent artifacts that did not transfer to other data distributions.

To easily scale our analysis to all benchmarks without requiring cost-prohibitive per-benchmark curation of performance metrics value ranges, we normalized and calibrated SOTA benchmark results in a data-driven way. As the basis of further analyses, we calculated the relative improvement (i.e. increase in performance) for individual metrics (e.g. accuracy). We achieved this by comparing the stepwise increment from the first (A, anchor) to the last reported result (M, maximum) in each step of a SOTA trajectory.

### Computational strategic recruitment for representation and coverage studied in the all of Us research program [^8699b915]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Significant efforts and funding have been employed to ensure biomedical research adequately generalizes to everyone. One facet of these efforts has been improving the representation of understudied (i.e. UBR) populations in biomedical datasets. All of Us exemplifies these efforts, aiming to "build one of the most diverse health databases in history". To this end, All of Us has stated recruitment goals as 75% of participants from UBR groups and 45% from racial and ethnic minorities. These proportion goals provide a straightforward assessment of All of Us 's cohort and can evaluate progress over time. However, aggregate proportion goals lack the specificity to determine which groups are under- or overrepresented in detail. Thus, these measures have limited utility for planning recruitment strategies. More detailed statistical distance measures derived from entropy have been used to assess cohort representativeness to a target population and guide recruitment efforts in simulation. In this paper, we extended this methodology to a dual objective problem, prioritizing both Census-representativeness and coverage. By doing so, we address a key limitation of Census-representative datasets: a perfectly Census representative cohort may only have a few individuals from particularly small groups. For example, a perfectly Census representative 1000-person cohort would only contain 18 participants aged 85 or over (U.S. Census Table S0101). Such numbers may be insufficient for statistical power or to train a fair machine learning algorithm. The insufficiency of proportionate representation can further magnify when smaller groups are differentially impacted by disease. When we recruited a cohort using only representativeness as the objective, the proportion of UBR individuals was substantially lower than any other experiments (Supplementary Table 1). By including coverage as a second objective, we balance out the blind spots of proportional representation.

### Acute canopy deficits in global cities exposed by the 3-30-300 benchmark for urban nature [^a50b331d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The 3-30-300 rule is a recently proposed metric that sets minimum standards for access to nature in cities for human wellbeing. It specifies that homes, schools and workplaces should have a view of 3 trees, be in a neighbourhood with over 30% tree canopy cover and be within 300m walk of a park. This metric is an important progression for assessing urban nature because it is easy to understand, highly local, and sets a pass/fail benchmark for green infrastructure. Using datasets of over 2.5 million buildings in eight cities, we show that most buildings fail the 3-30-300 rule due to inadequate tree canopy, even in well-known global cities (the cities are Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Seattle, Denver, New York, Singapore, Melbourne and Sydney). The '3' standard was met more often, while achievement of the '300' standard was patchy. Further analysis indicates that existing trees are too small for adequate canopy cover. Cities should invest in improving planting conditions to support tree growth and enhance governance to reduce premature removals and excessive pruning.

The Choice Engineering Competition.

The participant's screen, the algorithm's behavior, and three participants' data. a Participants made 100 choices between two options (here: the black and white "sides"). Unbeknownst to them, a single algorithm determined when and on which side rewards would be allocated. b A schematic of the RaCaS algorithm: choosing Bias+ option leads to a structured sequence of rewards, with increasing intervals (1) between rewards. Choosing the Bias− option initially led to no reward and also punished the participants by suspending the regularity associated with Bias+. Symbols contributors: hadkhanong (Carrot), Africa Studio (Stick), meen_na (Red button), Francesco Milanese (Treasure box) — stock.adobe.com. c All choices made by a participant strongly biased towards the Bias+ option (participant #9; participant number reflects their ranking as a function of strength of bias). Choice is indicated by the color of the central strip (black for Bias+ and white for Bias−) and the arrow pointing up towards Bias+ or down towards Bias−. Rewards allocated by RaCaS are represented by the gray bar; a colored tilde indicates when the participant collected the reward (blank when missed). Note the developing regularity in rewards allocated to Bias+ as long as the participant showed commitment to the option (i.e. when the middle line is black for multiple consecutive trials). Intervals between rewards increase every few iterations, further luring participants to uncover (and then confirm) the new pattern. The actual allocation depended on the participant's behavior and the number of remaining trials and rewards. d Choices by two other participants with medium (participant #104) and weak biases (participant #207); the different events generated by the algorithm are highlighted. Green shading: the initial period, in which (structured) rewards are often allocated to Bias+, and not at all to the Bias− side, to encourage the participant to further explore Bias+. Yellow shading: the pattern begins to unfold and exploration of the Bias− option terminates the pattern. The pattern only begins anew when recommitment is detected. Orange shading: the Bias− rewards are largely hidden, since they are only allocated when the participant is highly committed to the Bias+ side until the residual rewards must be allocated throughout the remaining trials.

### Impact of small farmers' access to improved seeds and deforestation in DR Congo [^38498b6d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The context is further characterized by relative land abundance and the informality of the tenure system. When there is still primary forest within the village boundaries, access to it is allocated by village leaders, clan leaders, or family chiefs, depending on the prevailing allocation system. Once a household has cleared a primary forest plot, a long-term right to cultivate that plot is generally established. That said, there is considerable heterogeneity in the institutional structure of land allocation across villages as a result of inconsistent local agricultural policies, often dating back to the colonial regime.

Farmers practice slash-and-burn cultivation and, therefore, regularly open new fields in the forest. This process requires labor-intensive land preparation. First, trees and woody plants are cut down, and the vegetation is left to dry. Then, before the beginning of the rainy season, the biomass is burnt to create a layer of nutrient-rich ash and eliminate pests and weeds. Farmers typically cultivate several plots during the main agricultural season (average plot size: 0.6 hectares, average number of plots: 4.4). Some of those plots are on land that was already under cultivation the year before, while others require clearing of primary or secondary forest or overgrown fallow land. Household decisions regarding which fields to cultivate take place during the dry season preceding the main rainy season. Qualitative interviews conducted as part of the study's fieldwork revealed that farmers are keenly aware of the soil fertility implications of those decisions. There is also a short agricultural season from August to November, during which only part of the farmers cultivate, but as it is uncommon to open new fields in the forest for the short agricultural season, we concentrate on the main season.

### Computational strategic recruitment for representation and coverage studied in the all of Us research program [^57d97e29]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Even if we perfectly operationalized All of Us 's recruitment goals, our observed improvements in simulation may not manifest in reality. Our simulation necessarily simplifies real-world factors that affect recruitment, which could translate to a simulation-reality gap. For instance, 3- or 12-month cycles may be too short for resource re-allocation in practice and not reflect the realities of recruitment site staffing. To prevent massive disparities in resource allocation between sites, we constrain the ratio of maximum and minimum resource allocation to sites. Tightening this constraint has a noticeable impact on cohort representativeness and coverage (Supplementary Table 1). We also consider recruitments to be interchangeable between sites, which may not reflect differences in recruitable populations at different EHR sites. A site in a sparsely populated region may not support as many recruitments as one in a major urban center. Despite these caveats, the recruitment strategies empirically identified by our model often align with each site's historical resource allocation. Experimentally-derived resource allocations overlap with sites' historical recruitment counts in more than half of the EHR recruitment sites, including seven of the ten sites most heavily prioritized by our methodology. Nevertheless, sites such as 412, 148, and 640 would need to recruit about an order of magnitude more participants in simulation than reality, which may not be feasible. Even if such recruitment volume were feasible, it may change the response distribution at the site. This effect would be particularly pronounced at recruitment sites employing highly specialized recruitment strategies that may not scale easily. Likely, the improvements we observe over historical All of Us representativeness and coverage can be attributed to a combination of all three of these factors: a more optimized experimental methodology, a slightly different objective function, and a somewhat optimistic simulation of real-world recruitment.

CIFOR performance indicator — outbreak clinical specimen collections — defines the metric as the "Number and % of outbreak investigations with clinical specimens collected and submitted to PHL from two or more people" and defines a foodborne illness outbreak as "The occurrence of two or more similar illnesses resulting from ingestion of a common food". Measurement methods state to "Determine the number of foodborne illness outbreaks that were investigated" for the denominator and to "Determine the number of outbreaks for which clinical specimens were collected and submitted to the PHL from two or more people" for the numerator, then "Divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100". The performance fields label "Denominator (No. outbreaks) = ", "Numerator (No. outbreaks with clinical specimens collected) = " and compute "Rate (Num./Denom. × 100) = ". Feasibility notes that "This metric is associated with CIFOR Indicator 8.2.4 "Foodborne outbreaks investigated". It extends FoodCORE metrics to investigations for all pathogens".

### Treatment set ts339184 [^ffd3f998]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

If the first injection of the initial dilution of extract is tolerated without significant local reaction, increasing doses by 5–20% increments of that dilution may be administered. The rate of increase in dosage in the early stages of treatment with highly diluted extracts is usually more rapid than the rate of increase possible with more concentrated extracts. This schedule is intended only as a guide and must be modified according to the reactivity of the individual patient. Needless to say, the physician must proceed cautiously in the treatment of the highly sensitive patient who develops large local or systemic reactions.

Some patients may tolerate larger doses, but it is rarely necessary to give maintenance doses larger than 2,000 AU/ml of the standardized extract or 0.5 mL of 1:100 w/v of the unstandardized extract. Because dilute extracts tend to lose activity on storage, the first dose from a more concentrated vial, should be the same or less than the previous dose.1,2,3,4,16

Immunotherapy must be given under the supervision of a physician. Before an injection is given the patient should be asked about any reaction following the previous injection to help determine the next dose. Target maintenance dose should be determined by the physician's experience and patient response to skin testing and treatment.

### Not-so-disposable e-cigarettes: methods young people use to discard single-use e-cigarettes [^c86669bc]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

To date, most tobacco product waste research focuses on cigarettes. Less is known about single-use 'disposable' e-cigarette waste, which contains several hazardous and toxic materials. This exploratory study examines self-reported methods for discarding disposables among a national sample of US adolescents and young adults.

Design, Setting, Participants and Measurements

Data were obtained from a weekly cross-sectional survey of US residents aged 15-24years. The analytical sample consisted of data collected from November 2022 to August 2023 from respondents who reported past-30-day use of disposables (n = 1313). Weighted multinomial logistic regressions examined the association between tobacco use behaviors and respondents' primary self-reported method for discarding disposables (reference group: 'throw them in the regular trash'), controlling for socio-demographic variables.

Findings

Approximately half of respondents discarded their empty disposables in the regular trash (52.9%). On average, respondents reported throwing away 3.1 disposables monthly [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.83, 3.29]. Second most commonly, respondents reported keeping or collecting empty disposables (21.4%). Respondents who reported 10-30days (versus 1–9) of past-month vaping were more likely to primarily keep or collect disposable e-cigarettes (relative risk reduction = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.20, 2.24) compared to discarding in the trash.

Conclusions

Young people in the United States who use disposable e-cigarettes report primarily discarding their disposable e-cigarettes in the regular trash or keeping them. All reported disposal methods raise safety and environmental concerns.

### Extent of illicit cigarette sales in Nepal: findings from a retail survey [^44e01895]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Sampling design

The data collection team identified a central point in each PSU such as busy business, social areas, areas with government offices, colleges/schools and cigarette factory areas. All types of retailers selling loose stick cigarettes were eligible for inclusion except the street hawkers and dealers with small cigarette outlets who keep on moving. Retailers were briefed about the study purpose and written consent was taken. An empty bag with a unique ID was given to every retailer on the selected route and was asked to deposit all cigarette packs emptied throughout the day. The retailers were provided a small monetary reward of NPR10 (US$0.08) per empty pack deposited in the bag. The bags were collected at the end of the day towards the close of business. If the empty pack of that brand was not available in the bag, the team took a picture and coded all relevant attributes of such packs observed in the shop itself. Basic information such as the name and type of retail shop, and name, price and estimated quantity of the cheapest brand and the most popular brand sold in the shop was recorded by data collectors during bag collection using a questionnaire.

### How to design efficient cluster randomised trials [^04dc9587]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Designing a trial when the number of clusters is fixed

Assuming that the 15% absolute risk reduction is the target difference, our simple rule says that the minimum number of clusters required for each arm is seven (228×0.03). With one more than the minimum (eight clusters in each arm), the cluster size should not exceed the number needed in each arm under individual randomisation (228). Increasing the number of clusters to nine (two more than the minimum) would make the cluster size less than 114 (228/2), and with 10 clusters in each arm, the cluster size would be less than 76 (228/3). This shows that, if resources and logistics allow, increasing the number of clusters by a small amount above the minimum could drastically reduce cluster sizes. These simple calculations are easily performed by hand (assuming knowledge of the number needed under individual randomisation) and could be used as a quick scrutiny assessment by a funding panel or reviewer.

The exact calculations are shown in Appendix 1. To achieve 90% power with seven clusters in each arm, cluster size should be 1383, yielding a total sample size of 19 362 (table 1). To achieve 80% power with the same number of clusters, the required cluster size is only 89, yielding a total sample size of 1246. Moreover, if the number of clusters were increased by two, to nine in each arm, then a cluster size of 103 would achieve 90% power (equating to a total sample size of 1854 — a fraction of that required with for seven clusters in each arm). With 15 clusters in each arm, the cluster size required would be 28, giving a total sample size of 840.

Trade-off between number of clusters and cluster size for the case study

Sample size needed to detect a difference between two proportions of 0.60 and 0.45 at two sided significance level of 5%, assuming normal approximations (formula in Appendix 1).

### A simple pressure-assisted method for microED specimen preparation [^02e62a15]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Even if a good or usable specimen is obtained, finding ideal grid squares and good crystals for data collection is also important. This is because the thickness distribution of the amorphous ice layer is often not homogeneous across the grid, sometimes is not uniform within the same grid square. For crystals grown in non-viscous mother liquors, ideal grid squares and crystals have the following features: (1) grid squares with clear and sharp edges when viewed in low magnification (Fig. 5a), indicating the vitrified ice is very thin, (2) crystals found in these squares with blurred edges on the carbon film, indicating the crystals are still hydrated, and (3) crystals hanging over the empty holes with relatively clear edges, indicating the ice is very thin. It is desirable to collect MicroED data from these types of crystals, and at the regions where they are hanging over the holes. In these cases, carbon background is avoided, the ice thickness is minimized, and the crystals are usually still hydrated. A representative example including images and diffraction patterns is shown in Fig. 5a. When the buffer is viscous (e.g. 44% PEG 400 and 30% PEG 4000), the grid squares no longer show sharp edges and transparent areas are reduced compared to those prepared under non-viscous conditions, as shown in the low-magnification images in Fig. 5b, c. Under such circumstances, the ideal crystals for MicroED data collection are still those hanging over the holes (crystal images and ED patterns in Fig. 5b, c) despite the surrounding vitrified ice. Furthermore, for both viscous and non-viscous cases, most holes in the optimized grid squares are empty without vitrified ice except for the holes with crystals nearby or on top of the holes.

### Accounting for albedo in carbon market protocols [^235c22c7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For Tier 1, we propose that new projects incorporate albedo by prioritizing project sites or forest types where albedo is anticipated to have a lower deduction or a benefit. Project funders could ask about this in due diligence processes. Project ratings agencies could add it to their assessment methodologies. The Hasler data allows projects to demonstrate that they are in areas with lower potential albedo deductions. As this would not impact existing projects (only future projects), the projected credits for this tier match what is reported by projects today.

For Tier 2, albedo could be incorporated into protocols' "no net harm" guidelines for environmental impacts using the Hasler maps and data. Where an albedo deduction is large, additional follow-up could ensure that, when assessed at higher resolution, the effect was negligible. Where this cannot be demonstrated, the project could be deemed ineligible if the albedo deduction exceeds a specified threshold. We present 50% and 100% thresholds (i.e. negating half or all of the climate benefits from carbon sequestration) as examples, but others are possible. For the 172 projects we assessed, a 100% albedo deduction would render 21 (12%) projects ineligible, lowering the total projected credit production by 30.0% (Table 1 and Fig. 4). A 50% albedo deduction threshold would make 43 projects (25%) ineligible, lowering the total projected credit production by 39.1% (Table 1 and Fig. 4). We note that a relatively small reduction in eligible projects would lead to a relatively larger reduction in projected credits (e.g. 25% of projects ineligible versus 39.1% of credits ineligible in Tier 2 with a 50% threshold). This suggests that the projects with the largest albedo deductions appear to also be producing the most credits, perhaps due to being of larger geographic size.

Scenarios of the Future: What Do Stakeholders Want From Big Data?

The potential and promise of Big Data include opportunities to acquire, analyze, and share information for a multiplicity of goals. Summit attendees envisioned and reflected on the key objectives to which each stakeholder group might aspire in the utilization of the resultant data under ideal circumstances (Table 3). Some common themes emerged, including a passionate wish for accurate, secure, and complete data. Many groups detailed the urgent need for the development of tools that might distill data into visual depictions that could be used at the point of clinical care or for healthcare administration. An additional hope of attendees was that clinical and translational research could be facilitated and accelerated by the authorized sharing of patient data.

Table 3
Big Data and Stakeholders

What Do Patients Want From Big Data?

Patients expect excellence in health care. They are frustrated by the need to recount their personal history to every new provider, hospital, or service. They do not understand why our systems "can't just talk to each other". 14 They want to be partners in their care with the ability to access their personal information and to interface with their provider's office to make appointments, schedule tests, check results, and correct errors. Above all, they want their data to be secure and portable, whether they change doctors, systems, or states, and they want smart‐device interfaces so they have multiple options for access.

Patients assume their providers' recommendations will be based on the most up‐to‐date science and guidelines. They want to know all of the possible outcomes they can expect, and they want the best possible outcome at an affordable cost. Patients want to connect with others who share similar conditions and to use that community to better understand their own symptoms or disease, to share concerns, and to gather information to become more effective partners in care.

Patients have shown a willingness to share their personal data to improve the health of themselves and/or others. 94, 95, 96 They want to know about the latest research, but often that information is not readily available in an understandable format. Patients are willing to become involved in medical research and clinical trials but need to be made aware of the studies and then to have an easily accessible avenue for determining whether they or a loved one would be eligible to participate.

### Practical guidance for planning resources required to support publicly-funded adaptive clinical trials [^d7db0ef0]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Other ADs, like sample size re-estimation, may potentially increase the target sample size, and therefore trial duration. The change in resources required in this circumstance will depend on how this influences the tasks required. All CTUs who took part in the CAT mock costing exercise provided estimated resources based on the maximum target sample size, and the time needed to recruit to this. This is useful to inform the maximum resource needs. However, one must consider all potential scenarios that can occur, as well as the likelihood of each scenario, and how this will influence the resources required by the trial. In the more theoretic ADs literature, it has been a rule of thumb that quantities such as the 'average sample size' (i.e. the sample sizes associated with all possible scenarios, weighted by probabilities of each scenario occurring) can be a good representation of the efficiency of an AD. These metrics are based on multiple hypothetical trials and are not necessarily helpful for the specific trial being costed. They also do not take into account the fixed costs of starting and stopping the trial and the need to have funds available to cover all possible scenarios.

For designs that may lead to a high variation in the resources required, the host institution must carefully consider the implications of this. As in Step 2, larger organisations with many projects and staff may be better able to deal with uncertainty than smaller organisations.

It is important to remember that uncertainty is not unique to ADs. In most trials, there is uncertainty around feasibility aspects such as recruitment rates, and whether specified milestones will be met (e.g. as monitored in the internal pilot phase of a trial). Most non-adaptive trials can also be stopped early, e.g. due to safety concerns.

### Extent of illicit cigarette sales in Nepal: findings from a retail survey [^c358aab6]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of pack examination methodology, a suitable method for countries selling single stick cigarettes, inclusion of 1204 retailers across the whole of Nepal's diverse geography and collection of 4307 cigarette packs, which is a large enough sample to make robust estimates, give us high confidence that the results of this study have high internal validity. Further, the robustness of the findings has been validated by three additional methods: the littered pack collection, the direct interaction with cigarette retailers and pack photo collection.

Nevertheless, there are some limitations of the study. First, the study primarily relies on empty pack collection from retailers, which only represents a part of the loose cigarettes sold in Nepal and may not represent those buying full packs. But through the littered pack collection, we have tried to compensate for this weakness and the consistent results obtained were reassuring. These methods can be used in other low and middle-income countries where there is a high proportion of single stick sales. Second, our findings relied on the empty packs provided by retailers sold that day and there was a possibility that retailers would want to hide the illicit packs, making the study result (proportion of illicit cigarette) biased downward. But consistent results were obtained from the collection of littered packs. Third, our study only collected packs from the sampled cigarette retailers. Street hawkers and dealers with small cigarette outlets who keep on moving were not included. Fourth, retailers could be selling duty-free cigarettes and this study is unable to distinguish legal tax avoidance from illicit cigarette.

The finding of a cheaper counterfeit brand 'Khukuri' both in retailers and street collection near the India border at Siraha Municipality mandates further exploratory research in and around that area to control future smuggling. Further, it is worth noting that the nature of smuggling may change over time depending on the smugglers' tactics to penetrate the cigarette market. Therefore, considering the limitations and findings, the government needs to address the problem of illicit trade by strengthening the administration and governance. More studies are warranted.

### Clinical presentation, evaluation and case management of primary empty sella syndrome: a retrospective analysis of 10-year single-center patient data [^2f9d27a9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Once considered a rare disorder, diagnosis of ES has been increasing since it is primarily regarded as an incidental finding on brain imaging scans like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) predominantly, Computed Tomography (CT), or rarely plain X-ray. However, very often the patient may present with various symptoms which are attributed to PES in the absence of any other likely causation. The clinical significance related to the incidental finding is ambiguous and some studies elucidate it to more than a mere incidental finding. Several isolated case reports and case series have been published over the last three decades and statistics collectively from single-centerr or multicenter retrospective studies have reported prevalence as low as 2.3% to as high as 38% in autopsy studies with large predominance in the female gender.

Studies from the Saudi Arabian region are scanty except a report from the western region documenting a brief description of 537 patients with PES without exploring further details on clinical significance, the symptoms and hormonal assessments Moreover, no specific guidelines or recommendations exist in the diagnosis and management of PES, resulting in the majority of the cases being managed without a referral to an endocrinologist. However, experts in the field have advised endocrine assessment of even the asymptomatic cases and a multi-disciplinary approach in the management of PES. The objective of the present study is to report a 10-year retrospective review of primary empty sella from a single-center registry, aiming to determine the epidemiology, clinical presentation and management of PES, and to identify the differences in investigations and diagnosis of PES between endocrinologists and non endocrinologists in a tertiary care setting".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nuclear cardiology signal-to-noise and count acquisition — detector dose explains that noise is approximately the square root of number of counts, with illustrative examples that if 100 counts are collected, noise would account for about 10 counts (square root of 100 is 10), and signal to noise ratio would be 10, whereas if 10,000 counts are collected, the signal to noise ratio would be 100. Three variables affect registered counts — the imaging system's sensitivity, the amount of radioactivity administered to the subject (which affects the subject's dose), and the length of time that counts are acquired to form the image — and typically a scan continues until a requisite number of counts has been collected; if the administered dose is small, a longer acquisition time will be required, yet patients cannot lie still indefinitely, limiting practical duration to avoid motion artifacts.

### Progress and challenges for measles elimination by 2012 in the Western pacific region [^70e6101e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The 37 countries and areas of the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region have targeted measles for elimination by 2012.

Methods

We reviewed routine and supplementary immunization coverage based on 2010 WHO/United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates and Joint Reporting Forms and epidemiologic and laboratory data submitted by the countries and areas.

Results

In 2009, 21 of 37 countries and areas had ≥ 90% coverage with a first dose of measles vaccine; 32 countries and areas provided 2 routine doses of measles vaccine with 94% weighted average coverage among those reporting. From 1996 to 2009, 235 million persons received measles vaccine during 94 immunization campaigns in 30 countries and areas. As of 2009, 2.8 suspected cases per 100,000 population were discarded as nonmeasles; however, only 43% of second level administrative units reported at least 1 discarded case per 100,000. Adequate specimen collection rate was 71%. Measles incidence was 34 per million population in 2009, a 58% decrease compared with 2008 and the lowest ever reported. As many as 25 countries and areas already may have eliminated measles.

Conclusions

Achieving the 2012 measles elimination goal is feasible provided political and financial commitments are increased at every level to further improve routine and supplementary immunization activity (SIA) coverage and surveillance in every district.

### Current sample size conventions: flaws, harms, and alternatives [^f34a2bb9]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Value of information methods

Many methods have already been described in the statistical literature for choosing the sample size that maximizes the expected value of the information produced minus the total cost of the study. See for an early discussion, for recent examples, and the introduction of for additional references. These require projecting both value and cost at various different sample sizes, including quantifying cost and value on the same scale (note, however, that this could be avoided by instead maximizing value divided by total cost). They also require formally specifying uncertainty about the state of nature; although this can be criticized as being subjective, it improves vastly on the usual conventional approach of assuming that one particular guess is accurate. These methods can require considerable effort and technical expertise, but they can also produce the sort of thorough and directly meaningful assessment that should be required to justify studies that are very expensive or that put many people at risk.

Simple choices based on cost or feasibility

Recent work has justified two simple choices that are based only on costs, with no need to quantify projected value or current uncertainty about the topic being studied. Because costs can generally be more accurately projected than the inputs for conventional calculations, this avoids the inherent inaccuracy that besets the conventional approach. One choice, called n min, is the sample size that minimizes the total cost per subject studied. This is guaranteed to be more cost-efficient (produce a better ratio of projected value to cost) than any larger sample size. It therefore cannot be validly criticized as inadequate. The other, called n root, is the sample size that minimizes the total cost divided by the square root of sample size. This is smaller than n min and is most justifiable for innovative studies where very little is already known about the issue to be studied, in which case it is also guaranteed to be more cost efficient than any larger sample size. An interactive spreadsheet that facilitates identification of n min and n root is provided as Additional file 2.

A common pragmatic strategy is to use the maximum sample size that is reasonably feasible. When sample size is constrained by cost barriers, such as exhausting the pool of the most easily studied subjects, this strategy may closely approximate use of n min and therefore share its justification. When constraints imposed by funders determine feasibility, doing the maximum possible within those constraints is a sensible choice.

### Commonly used data-collection approaches in clinical research [^fed8cd8d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We provide an overview of the different data-collection approaches that are commonly used in carrying out clinical, public health, and translational research. We discuss several of the factors that researchers need to consider in using data collected in questionnaire surveys, from proxy informants, through the review of medical records, and in the collection of biologic samples. We hope that the points raised in this overview will lead to the collection of rich and high-quality data in observational studies and randomized controlled trials.

### Extent of illicit cigarette sales in Nepal: findings from a retail survey [^0adbfc76]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

From the 1204 sampled single stick retailers, 4307 empty cigarette packets were collected (table 2). The retailers were of five different types: general stores (55%) (including groceries, shops, mini marts, etc), hotels and restaurants (28%), paan shops (7%), tea shops (8%) and others (2%) which included dairy, bakeries, electronic stores that sell cigarettes, etc. All the sampled retailers agreed to participate and provided their written consent to be part of the research. However, due to few sticks sold on the pack collection day, 48 retailers did not have any packs collected in the provided bag at the end of the business hours. Therefore, these 48 shops were excluded from the empty pack analysis.

Table 2
Empty cigarette pack collection

Among the provinces, the highest number of packs was collected from Province 1 (881), followed by Bagmati and Lumbini Provinces, while the lowest collection was from Karnali (166) as expected due to the remoteness of the area. In the PSU-level collection, Kathmandu had the highest pack collection (960), followed by Hetauda (633) and Biratnagar (629). The result is very plausible due to the number of retailers sampled and the demographic characteristic of cities. Devtal and Annapurna PSUs had the lowest pack collection. This was likely as Devtal is a Terai region where most people use chewing tobacco, and Annapurna is a remote hilly region.

Nuclear cardiology image quality and counts — signal-to-noise relationships and acquisition parameters are characterized by noise being approximately the square root of number of counts, so with 100 counts noise would be about 10 and signal to noise ratio 10, whereas with 10,000 counts the signal to noise ratio would be 100. Three variables affect the number of registered counts — the imaging system's sensitivity, the amount of radioactivity administered to the subject, and the length of time that counts are acquired — and a given scan is typically conducted until a requisite number of counts has been collected; if the radiopharmaceutical dose is small a longer scan acquisition time will be required, but patients cannot lie still indefinitely, placing practical limits on acquisition duration.

### Illicit cigarette sales in Indian cities: findings from a retail survey [^de463ed9]. Tobacco Control (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate illicit cigarette consumption in India using a modified and replicable method and compare it with estimates generated by the tobacco industry and by a commercial entity.

Methods

The study employed a modified approach to cigarette pack analysis suitable for countries with prevalent single-cigarette sales. Empty cigarette packs generated by 1day's single-cigarette sales were collected directly from cigarette vendors in four large and four small cities covering the length and breadth of India. Ten areas were randomly selected in each city/town, and all shops selling cigarettes within 1 km of the central point were surveyed. A cigarette pack was classified as illicit if it had at least one of the following attributes: (a) a duty-free sign; (b) no graphic health warnings; (c) no textual health warnings; or (d) no mention of 'price inclusive of all taxes' or similar text.

Findings

We collected 11063 empty cigarette packs from 1727 retailers, and 2.73% of them were classified as illicit. The estimates varied substantially across locations with the highest prevalence of illicit packs in the town of Aizawl near the Bangladesh and Myanmar border (35.87%). The share of illicit cigarettes was found to be much higher (13.77%) among the cheapest cigarette brands. Illicit cigarettes are primarily distributed via formal stores rather than informal tea/pan shops.

Conclusion

Our estimate of the illicit cigarette market share of 2.73% casts serious doubt on the tobacco industry estimate of 20% and Euromonitor's estimate of 21.3%.

### Maternal birth preparedness and complication readiness in the greater accra region of Ghana: a cross-sectional study of two urban health facilities [^fdfdc021]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) has a target of reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) to less than 70 per 100,000 live births in 2030, the burden in Ghana remains high with a MMR of 310 per 100,000 live births. This goal may not be reached with the annual reduction rate of 2.7% as opposed to the required estimate of 7.5%.

Data from the Ghana Health Service (GHS) showed that the highest number of maternal deaths was reported in the Greater Accra Region in 2016 with 130 deaths, closely followed by the Eastern Region with a little under 100 deaths. A high proportion of direct maternal deaths was due to obstetric hemorrhage, followed by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

Skilled birth attendance is one of the most important factors for reducing maternal mortality and birth preparedness and complication readiness (BP/CR) is an approach to promote this. The prevalence of skilled birth attendance was recorded as 56.2% nationwide and 59.4% for the Greater Accra Region in 2016 according to GHS whereas the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) reported 73.7% nationwide and 92.5% for the Greater Accra Region in 2014. GHS attributes its lower numbers to lack of a centralized data collection system to capture births from private facilities and maternity homes.

### Design and field methods of the ARISE network COVID-19 rapid monitoring survey [^4dd16c1c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Field methods.

The target sample sizes per site were 300 healthcare providers from urban areas of each of the three countries (for a total of 900 providers), and 300 adults and 300 adolescents from each of the six sites (1,800 adults and 1,800 adolescents in total). From each sampling frame (urban household, rural household, and healthcare providers), additional telephone numbers beyond the target sample size were selected to allow for nonresponse or refusal. We aimed to select 500 healthcare providers from each country to allow for a 60% nonresponse rate, but higher rates of nonresponse in some countries led us to select additional healthcare providers from the sampling frames at some sites to reach the target sample size. Based on HDSS records and previous survey experience at these sites, for the household survey, we assumed that 20% of the households had adolescents and that 60% of the selected households would respond to the survey. This led us to aim to randomly select 2,500 households from each urban site and rural site to reach the minimum target of 300 adolescents and 300 adults from each site. Some sites were able to use prior census records to select households with known adolescents. From each household, we selected one adult 20 years or older and one adolescent 10 to 19 years of age (this age group was defined based on the World Health Organization definition of adolescence)if there was at least one adolescent regularly residing in the household.

Data collectors called each household to obtain consent to survey the household head or another person in the household and to obtain parental/guardian permission to speak to the adolescent if one was present in the household. After the adult completed the survey, data collectors obtained assent from the adolescent and completed the adolescent interview or arranged to call the adolescent at a later time. When two or more adults or adolescents were listed for one household, one was selected randomly for interview by selecting the participant with the nearest birthday. Before obtaining informed consent, data collectors screened participants to ensure they were eligible and in the correct age range. After obtaining consent, they directly asked each participant to provide their age in years. Specific procedures for each site are described.

Open global standards, workflow integration profiles, and related processes have been developed through consensus-based procedures. Although these standards and profiles should be augmented with additional therapeutic area-based content standards, they are available now to enable the use of electronic health records to directly support clinical research concurrent with patient care. Improving the exchange of information and integrating workflow between research and health care are inherently necessary to accelerate the pace of informing clinical decisions based on current research findings and for an efficient, cost-effective health care system to improve the quality of patient care.

### More quality measures versus measuring what matters: a call for balance and parsimony [^7807336d]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2012). Medium credibility.

If the USA continues with the proliferation of required quality measures, we will go from hundreds of required metrics to thousands. There are thousands of diseases, injuries, clinical states and interventional procedures that have a large and growing list of evidence-based care processes, and every special interest group could lobby for 'their' disease, injury or procedure to enjoy the 'legitimacy' and command for resources that are associated with being designated as a required quality metric. At the same time, providers of care have a genuine need to develop internal mechanisms to continuously measure and improve the processes of care delivery (ie, what they do) and the outcomes and costs of care that they provide.

We believe that if current trends in the growth of required quality measures continue, providers will need to invest so much money to report externally imposed measures that there will be scant funds left to support provider-specific internal measurement systems needed for monitoring and improving quality and for capturing longitudinal measures and cascading them to major clinical programmes and front-line clinical microsystems. Unchecked growth in mandated quality measures will lead to a commensurate growth in quality metric budgets devoted to 'required metrics' and thereby leave few 'discretionary' dollars to focus on internal quality measurement systems or on the results that matter most to the end users. In short, the drive to increase the scope and depth of required measures to judge quality could have the unanticipated consequence of decreasing providers' ability to manage and improve quality and meet our need for better quality, better outcomes and lower per capita costs.

To summarise, the growth in the number of publicly reported and externally mandated quality measures has generated positive and negative effects. We ask, has the time come to provide guidance and principles for the future development of quality metrics that providers are required to produce? We think the answer to this question is 'yes'. Even if we can shift some of the measurement burden to patients through greater reliance on patient reported measures, a development we support, the exponential growth of other measures will overtake our limited resources. Thus, the resources that might be devoted to 'end user' value will be diverted to cover a plethora of quality-performance metrics that may have a limited impact on the things that patients and payers want and need (ie, better outcomes, better care and lower per capita costs).

The series is based on three principles: each Preferred Practice Pattern should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners; each recommendation that is made should be given an explicit rating that shows its importance to the care process; and each recommendation should also be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence that supports the recommendation and reflects the best evidence available. Adherence to these Preferred Practice Patterns will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation, and these practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results.

### Gut-proglucagon-derived peptides are essential for regulating glucose homeostasis in mice [^8ede9165]. Cell Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The importance of pancreatic versus intestinal-derived GLP-1 for glucose homeostasis is controversial. We detected active GLP-1 in the mouse and human pancreas, albeit at extremely low levels relative to glucagon. Accordingly, to elucidate the metabolic importance of intestinal proglucagon-derived peptides (PGDPs), we generated mice with reduction of Gcg expression within the distal (Gcg DistalGut-/-) or entire (Gcg Gut-/-) gut. Substantial reduction of gut Gcg expression markedly reduced circulating levels of GLP-1, and impaired glucose homeostasis, associated with increased levels of GIP, and accelerated gastric emptying. Gcg DistalGut-/- mice similarly exhibited lower circulating GLP-1 and impaired oral glucose tolerance. Nevertheless, plasma levels of insulin remained normal following glucose administration in the absence of gut-derived GLP-1. Collectively, our findings identify the essential importance of gut-derived PGDPs for maintaining levels of circulating GLP-1, control of gastric emptying, and glucose homeostasis.

IDSA and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) agree that urine should not sit at room temperature for more than 30 minutes; samples should either be transported to the lab in urine transport media in vacuum-filled tubes or refrigerated (2°C to 10°C) immediately, the clinician should discourage patients from bringing samples from home, and clinicians should also have a suspicion for such contamination when high levels of bacteriuria are seen in the context of a urinalysis without detectable pyuria.

A 27-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 1, at 9 weeks gestation, initially presented with clinical and ultrasonographic features suggestive of a missed spontaneous abortion for which surgical evacuation was performed. A diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was made as on histological review no fetal or chorionic tissue was seen. Medical management for an ectopic pregnancy was initiated. Following methotrexate administration she was readmitted with severe abdominal pain. Findings on diagnostic laparoscopy revealed an asymmetrically enlarged swollen fundus. Hysteroscopy was performed concurrently demonstrating an empty uterine cavity. A diagnosis of intramyometrial pregnancy was made based on these findings. An MRI scan was performed postprocedure which supported the diagnosis. In view of her parity and future fertility medical management was adopted with methotrexate. She was followed up until hormone levels returned to baseline and serial scans showed a healed solid collection.

Results

Demographics

We initially approached 1750 households, out of which 267 (15.2%) declined participation or were inaccessible, leaving 1483 households included in the survey. A total of 1252 (84.4%) households provided electronic means of communication (WhatsApp number) for later verification and/or completion of data.

Two clusters (42 and 43) were replaced with similar clusters within the same district due to inability to obtain security clearance for teams to enter the area, while two others (40 and 41) had limited data collected for the same reason. Cluster 33 was abandoned completely due to the extremely high risk involved in accessing the cluster and the lack of similar clusters within proximity to replace it. All five clusters were within the Northern Aleppo countryside sector, which had 13 other clusters completed.

The sample included 6225 (50.7%) males and 6043 (49.3%) females. The population was predominantly composed of young people; 50.3% were 20 years old or younger. The median household size was 6 persons (IQR 5–8). The median number of children under 5 in the household was 1 child (IQR 0–2). The age population pyramid distribution is shown in online supplemental file 2.

Among the participating households, 921 were displaced in total. The previous residence place was known for 920 households, and the majority were originally from other parts of the Idlib governorate. The head of the household at the time of the survey was mostly one of the parents. The median household income (including food baskets supplied by relief organisations) was 80 dollars (IQR 50–125). The basic sociodemographic characteristics of the surveyed population are listed in table 1.

Compile results and reevaluate goals — Compile results of outbreak investigations in a manner that enables comparisons with the original goals for the investigation, state the original goals, and demonstrate how each goal was achieved; if the goal was not achieved, explain why. For documentation, in an investigation of an outbreak associated with a restaurant, document the steps taken to identify the agent, which could include identifying the number of stool specimens collected; determining intervals between symptom onset, collection, and laboratory processing; identifying the methods used to culture or test the specimens; and determining the results of the tests. Novel questions or opportunities during the investigation might require reevaluation of the investigation's goals. Prepare epidemic curves, and update them daily to depict the beginning and end of the outbreak; select time scales to highlight the agent, mode of transmission, and duration; note notable events on the curve; and consider generating an accompanying timeline of investigation events, as continued motion of successive epidemic curves day by day indicates continuation of the outbreak.

A yolk sac within an intrauterine fluid collection "is incontrovertible evidence of a pregnancy, and the sonogram should be interpreted as demonstrating a definite GS or definite pregnancy". Without a yolk sac or embryo, the collection "is still highly likely to represent a pregnancy" and "an empty sac should be reported as a probable GS or probable pregnancy". In multifetal pregnancy before embryo visualization, the appearance "should be reported as a single GS rather than as a 'single pregnancy'".

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Setting and study population.

The ARISE COVID-19 Survey was developed in partnership with the Africa Academy for Public Health (Tanzania), the Center de Recherche en Santé de Nouna (Burkina Faso), University of Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Haramaya University (Ethiopia), Addis Continental Institute of Public Health (Ethiopia), Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (Tanzania), University of Dodoma (Tanzania), University of Ibadan Research Foundation (Nigeria), Heidelberg Institute of Global Health (Germany), and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (United States). Sites were selected based on the existing data collection infrastructure, willingness of site leaders to take on a new survey, and research capacity, including collecting, managing, and storing high-quality survey data, conducting analyses, and performing dissemination of findings.

Investigators at each site selected the specific study communities, including one urban and one rural area, within each country to understand the potentially different impacts of COVID-19 on different settings. The urban study communities were in Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, and Lagos in Nigeria. The rural communities were in Nouna in Burkina Faso, Kersa in Ethiopia, and Ibadan in Nigeria (Figure 1). Sites were categorized as urban or rural based on how the communities are categorized administratively according to the governments of each country. The communities included in the study represent a wide variety of contexts, thus offering valuable opportunities for comparative research. In addition to the purposeful selection of communities based on heterogeneity and the opportunity for comparisons, we also chose the communities based on our ability to rapidly deploy a novel survey. The two main factors in our assessment of whether we could rapidly deploy the survey were an existing research infrastructure for survey science that was available to us, including data collectors and health researchers familiar with the community, tablets for electronic data collection, and systems to collect and store electronic data, and previous experience working in the community. In each country, healthcare workers, adolescents, and adults from the general population were recruited for the study. Demographic characteristics of adults and adolescents enrolled in the household survey in each community are shown in Table 1. Demographic characteristics of the healthcare providers are shown in Table 2.

### Apadamtase alfa (Adzynma) [^425de74d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For intravenous use after reconstitution only.

2.1	Dosage

Each vial of ADZYNMA is labeled with the actual rADAMTS13 activity, measured in terms of its potency in International Units (IU).
Calculate administration dose and volume based on the patient's body weight using the actual potency (and not the nominal potency) as printed on ADZYNMA vial.
For Intravenous (IV) Infusion at a rate of 2 to 4 mL per minute.

Prophylactic Therapy

The recommended prophylactic dosage regimen of ADZYNMA is as follows:

Administer 40 IU/kg body weight once every other week.
The prophylactic dosing frequency may be adjusted to 40 IU/kg body weight once weekly based on prior prophylactic dosing regimen or clinical response [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14)].

On-Demand Therapy

A guide for dosing ADZYNMA for on demand treatment of an acute event is provided in Table 1.

2.2	Preparation and Administration

Use aseptic technique (clean and germ-free) throughout the procedure.
Check the expiration date of the product prior to use.
Do not use ADZYNMA if the expiration date has passed.

Reconstitution

Prepare a clean, germ-free, flat surface and gather all the materials you will need for the reconstitution and infusion. Figure A depicts the materials provided in the carton box.

Do not use ADZYNMA if the expiration date has passed.
Use ADZYNMA within 3 hours after reconstitution and keep at room temperature not to exceed 86°F/30°C. Do not store at any other temperature. Discard any unused reconstituted product if not used within 3 hours after reconstitution.
Allow the vials of ADZYNMA and diluent to reach room temperature before use.
If the patient needs more than one vial of ADZYNMA per injection, reconstitute each vial according to the instructions stated under 'Reconstitution'.
Inspect the reconstituted ADZYNMA solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution should be clear and colorless in appearance.
Do not administer if particulate matter or discoloration is observed.
Wash and dry your hands thoroughly, and put on clean exam gloves.
Remove plastic caps from the ADZYNMA and diluent vials and place the vials on a flat surface (Figure B).
