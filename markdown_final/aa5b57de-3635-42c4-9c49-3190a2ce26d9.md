## Question

Why in MCA territory infraction there is mild leg weakness?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why MCA territory infarction can cause mild leg weakness. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cortical somatotopy and which arterial territories supply leg versus arm and face. Then, I should verify the subcortical motor pathways, especially the internal capsule and corona radiata, and their blood supply. Next, I will examine how proximal MCA occlusion affects lenticulostriate perforators and the internal capsule. After that, I should review clinical evidence for leg weakness in MCA infarcts and consider collateral physiology and time dependence. Finally, I will synthesize a coherent explanation and note exceptions and caveats, including ACA overlap and lesion size effects [^112ugFp1] [^1141UC6S].

> Let me first confirm the cortical anatomy. The leg motor homunculus is represented on the medial surface of the hemisphere in the paracentral lobule, which is primarily supplied by the anterior cerebral artery, whereas the MCA classically supplies the lateral convexity controlling arm and face, so at first glance one might expect MCA infarcts to spare the leg and preferentially affect arm and face, which aligns with traditional teaching and case series of ACA infarcts causing predominant leg weakness [^114Dkeqz] [^112BXLL1].

> Wait, let me verify the subcortical motor anatomy because that is often the key. The corticospinal and corticoreticular fibers descend through the corona radiata and the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and these white matter tracts are somatotopically organized, with leg fibers tending to be more posterior and medial within the corona radiata and internal capsule, meaning they can be involved by subcortical MCA territory infarcts even when the cortical leg area is spared [^116VktSf] [^115igGhX].

> I need to check the blood supply to these subcortical tracts. The posterior limb and superior portion of the internal capsule, where leg fibers traverse, are supplied by the lateral and intermediate lenticulostriate arteries arising from the proximal MCA; these are end arteries with little to no collateral supply, so proximal MCA occlusion commonly causes infarction in this region, including the internal capsule, thereby disrupting leg motor pathways despite cortical sparing [^111Wv2f5] [^1155V8ag].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm with clinical data. Multiple case series and reports document MCA territory infarcts presenting with hemiparesis that includes the leg, often due to involvement of the basal ganglia, corona radiata, or internal capsule, with MRI showing infarcts in the caudate, lentiform nucleus, corona radiata, or internal capsule alongside M1/M2 occlusions, and NIHSS motor leg scores reflecting measurable weakness even when cortical leg areas are not involved [^113sDngc] [^1172nhnY] [^1155V8ag].

> Let me consider the mechanism more precisely. When the MCA is occluded proximally, lenticulostriate perforators fail, producing striatocapsular infarction that damages the internal capsule and corona radiata; because leg fibers occupy the posterior and medial portions of these tracts, they are frequently affected, yielding contralateral leg weakness that may be milder than arm weakness but still clinically evident, especially early after onset before compensatory plasticity emerges [^111Wv2f5] [^116VktSf] [^115igGhX].

> I should double-check the time dependence and collateral issues. Early reperfusion, particularly with thrombectomy, can sometimes salvage the internal capsule if achieved within hours, underscoring that the leg weakness in proximal MCA occlusion is both structurally predictable and time-sensitive; delays beyond roughly 5 hours are associated with a high likelihood of internal capsule infarction and persistent leg motor deficits despite reperfusion of more proximal segments [^1155V8ag] [^111Wv2f5].

> But wait, what if the leg weakness is disproportionate or isolated. In that scenario, I need to ensure I consider ACA involvement or a small, somatotopically placed corona radiata lesion; indeed, small subcortical infarcts targeting posterior corona radiata can produce isolated leg paresis, and ACA emboli or branch occlusions can preferentially impair leg control, so the coexistence of ACA disease or distal embolization should be kept in mind when leg weakness dominates the picture [^115igGhX] [^112ugFp1] [^114Dkeqz].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing contradicts. MCA territory infarction can cause mild leg weakness because proximal MCA occlusion interrupts lenticulostriate supply to the internal capsule and corona radiata, where leg corticospinal fibers travel; although the cortical leg representation is ACA territory, the subcortical leg fibers are MCA-supplied and vulnerable, explaining why MCA strokes often produce hemiparesis that includes the leg, albeit frequently with arm more severely affected than leg on clinical scoring [^111Wv2f5] [^116VktSf] [^113BpyKr].

---

MCA territory infarcts cause mild leg weakness because the **internal capsule and corona radiata** contain corticospinal fibers to the leg that are supplied by MCA lenticulostriate branches [^111Wv2f5]. Even when the leg motor cortex is spared, **subcortical involvement** of these fibers produces contralateral leg weakness that is often milder than arm weakness due to the leg's larger cortical representation and collateral supply [^116VktSf] [^113BpyKr]. Early reperfusion can **limit internal capsule injury** and reduce leg weakness [^1155V8ag].

---

## Anatomical basis of leg motor control

The **primary motor cortex (M1)** controls leg movement, with the leg area located medially in the paracentral lobule, supplied mainly by the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) [^114Dkeqz]. The **corticospinal tract** descends through the corona radiata and posterior limb of the internal capsule — both within the MCA territory — to the leg motor neurons.

---

## Vascular supply to leg motor pathways

The **MCA supplies** the lateral convexity, including the corona radiata and internal capsule, via lenticulostriate branches [^111Wv2f5]. The **ACA supplies** the medial cortex, including the leg motor area, via pericallosal and callosomarginal branches.

---

## Mechanism of leg weakness in MCA infarction

Leg weakness in MCA infarction arises from **subcortical involvement** of the internal capsule and corona radiata, where corticospinal leg fibers are concentrated [^116VktSf]. Even if the leg motor cortex is spared, **damage to these subcortical fibers** causes contralateral leg weakness [^1155V8ag].

---

## Severity of leg weakness compared to arm and face

Leg weakness is often **milder than arm and face weakness** in MCA infarcts because the leg motor cortex is ACA-supplied and may be spared; the leg's larger cortical representation and collateral supply also confer greater resilience [^113BpyKr] [^112y7eqY] [^114Dkeqz].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting this explanation

Clinical studies show that MCA infarcts often cause **hemiparesis with relatively greater arm and face weakness than leg weakness**, consistent with subcortical involvement of leg fibers [^1175bPbw] [^1159iwzN]. Early reperfusion can **salvage the internal capsule** and reduce leg weakness, underscoring the role of subcortical motor fibers [^1155V8ag].

---

## Summary of key points

| **Anatomical structure** | **Vascular supply** | **Role in leg motor control** | **Involvement in MCA infarction** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Primary motor cortex (leg area) | Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) | Initiates leg movement | Typically spared |
| Internal capsule | Middle cerebral artery (MCA) | Conducts motor signals to leg | Commonly involved |
| Corona radiata | Middle cerebral artery (MCA) | Conducts motor signals to leg | Commonly involved |

---

MCA territory infarcts cause mild leg weakness primarily due to **involvement of the internal capsule and corona radiata**, which carry leg motor fibers, even when the leg motor cortex is spared [^111Wv2f5].

### Ischemic stroke after wasp sting [^112mB3Q9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the common occurrence of hymenopteran stings worldwide, primary neurologic manifestations including stroke are rare. We report a case of a healthy male who developed a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory ischemic stroke after getting stung by a wasp.

Case Report

A 44-year-old man with hypertension presented to the hospital with sudden-onset left hemiparesis, left facial weakness, and dysarthria after being stung by a wasp. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) scans of the brain revealed a right MCA territory infarct and a lack of flow in the distal right internal carotid artery and MCA. He was treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. A computed tomography angiography scan of the brain performed 24 hours later revealed multiple regions of vasoconstriction in the territory of the bilateral MCA. Evaluations for causes of stroke, including echocardiography and telemetry, were not revealing. Immunologic testing showed significantly elevated levels of serum wasp immunoglobulin E. Therapy with aspirin and atorvastatin was started. At discharge, the patient had a mild left facial droop but normal strength in his left arm and leg. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians encounter large numbers of hymenopteran sting cases each year. These patients typically present with local reactions, such as itching, pain, and erythema. Systemic manifestations, such as anaphylaxis causing severe hypotension and bronchospasm, are less common but deadly. Neurologic complications, such as ischemic stroke, are extremely rare. This manuscript highlights the pathophysiology and management of stroke after a hymenopteran sting. There are no guidelines for the management of stroke after a hymenopteran sting, and therefore we intend to provide some guidance to physicians for treating stroke after a hymenopteran sting.

### Radiological imaging features of the basal ganglia that may predict progression to hemicraniectomy in large territory middle cerebral artery infarct [^117ViZk8]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Predicting which patients are at risk for hemicraniectomy can be helpful for triage and can help preserve neurologic function if detected early. We evaluated basal ganglia imaging predictors for early hemicraniectomy in patients with large territory anterior circulation infarct.

Methods

This retrospective study evaluated patients with ischemic infarct admitted from January 2005 to July 2011. Patients with malignant cerebral edema refractory to medical therapy or with herniating signs such as depressed level of consciousness, anisocoria, and contralateral leg weakness were triaged to hemicraniectomy. Admission images were reviewed for presence of caudate, lentiform nucleus (putamen and globus pallidus), or basal ganglia (caudate + lentiform nucleus) infarction.

Results

Thirty-one patients with large territory MCA infarct, 10 (32%), underwent hemicraniectomy. Infarction of the caudate nucleus (9/10 vs 6/21, p = 0.002) or basal ganglia (5/10 vs 2/21, p = 0.02) predicted progression to hemicraniectomy. Infarction of the lentiform nucleus only did not predict progression to hemicraniectomy. Sensitivity for patients who did and did not have hemicraniectomy were 50% (5/10) and 90.5% (19/21). For caudate nucleus and caudate plus lentiform nucleus infarcts, the crude- and age-adjusted odds of progression to hemicraniectomy were 9.5 (1.4–64.3) and 6.6 (0.78–55.4), respectively.

Conclusion

Infarction of the caudate nucleus or basal ganglia correlated with patients progressing to hemicraniectomy. Infarction of the lentiform nucleus alone did not.

Case 1

A 59-year-old woman presented with weakness in the right limb. She had 10-year history of hypertension. A detailed physical examination showed a right central facial and lingual nerve palsy. On the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, the muscle strength of the right upper limb was 3/5 and right lower limb was 4/5. The NIHSS score was 8: level of consciousness 1, level of awareness 1, facial paralysis 1, upper limb movement 1, lower limbs movement 1, sensory 1 and articulation 1. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) revealed an acute infarct in the left basal ganglia on the following day (figure 1A). MRA showed that the M1 segment of the left MCA was occluded (figure 1B). DSA confirmed the occlusion. Its distal artery was small and sparse. Statin and antiplatelet medications were used. On the eighth day of hospitalisation, the symptoms became worse. Her right arm had no strength and right leg was 3/5. The NIHSS score was 15. DWI revealed an acute infarct in the left basal ganglia with a small dot-like embolic infarct in the cortex (figure 1C). Large areas of low perfusion were present in the left MCA territory (figure 1D). She received left MCA angioplasty (figure 2A, B) and was started on antithrombolytics, statin and antihypertensive drugs. Rehabilitation continued. Her symptoms significantly relieved. Follow-up DSA examination indicated that recanalization was successful after 40 days (figure 2C). The mRS score was 2 after 3 months.

### Azygous anterior cerebral artery infarction [^112BXLL1]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

A 45-year-old woman developed sudden-onset weakness in all four limbs, legs more than arms, and was admitted on the second day of the illness. Muscle tone was increased in all four limbs, with strength of 3/5 at the hips, knees and ankles, 3/5 at the shoulders and 4+/5 at the elbows and wrists. Tendon reflexes in all four limbs were brisk, and both plantar responses were extensor. Sensation, coordination and cranial nerve functions were normal. She had normal speech and higher functions. Her National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score was 6 (range 0–42).

CT scan of head showed no acute infarction or haemorrhage (figure 1). MR scan of brain showed high signal intensities in both anterior cerebral artery territories, suggesting acute bifrontal infarction (figure 2). MR angiogram identified an azygous anterior cerebral artery supplying both anterior cerebral artery territories (figure 3). MR scan of cervical spine was normal.

### Distribution of weakness in the upper and lower limbs post-stroke [^113BpyKr]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the distribution of weakness in the upper and lower limbs post-stroke and the factors associated with weakness.

Method

The design was a prospective cross-sectional survey. A consecutive sample of 75 patients (37 (49%) men, mean age 71.5 (SD 12.2) years, 46 (61%) left hemiplegics) with a first-time anterior-circulation stroke, tested 2–4 weeks post-stroke, were recruited from two NHS trusts.

Main Outcome Measures

Weakness (Motricity Index, MI).

Results

Mean MI score was 58.5 (SD 39.6) and 69.1 (SD 33.6) for the upper and lower limb (p < 0.001), but examination of individual data indicated 36 (48%) had no/ negligible difference (0 ± 9 points) in MI score between the limbs. When there was a difference, the lower limb was more frequently the stronger. There was no significant difference between the proximal and distal joints in either limb (p < 0.217 and 0.410). Severity of weakness was not associated with the subjects' demographics or stroke pathology, but was associated with neglect and sensation.

Conclusions

Although group analysis showed that the leg was significantly stronger than the arm, individual analysis showed that most participants had a similar degree of weakness in both limbs. When there was a difference, the lower limb was more frequently the stronger. Proximal joints were not more severely affected than distal joints. Patient demographics and stroke pathology factors were not associated with weakness, but stroke-related impairments were.

### Interleaving cerebral CT perfusion with neck CT angiography part I. proof of concept and accuracy of cerebral perfusion values [^116yH2ob]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Visual assessment of the perfusion maps

In eight of 20 patients, a perfusion deficit was visible. All perfusion deficits were visible in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. Two patients showed an infarct core of one third of the MCA territory with no penumbra and two patients showed small infarct core lesions in less than one third of the MCA territory with no penumbra. Two patients showed only penumbra of less than one third of the MCA territory. Two patients showed only penumbra which was more than two thirds of the MCA territory.

The study showed full agreement between the original perfusion maps and the perfusion maps with a 6 s time gap in the detection of a perfusion deficit. However, in one case a possible small cortical perfusion deficit was noted in the original perfusion maps, while not rated in the perfusion maps with a 6 s gap; after reviewing the images next to each other, this was rather due to observer variability than to the imaging technique. At follow-up, no infarct was demonstrated in this area. No perfusion deficits were missed and the sizes of penumbra and infarct core were described similar in both perfusion maps. An example is shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3
CT perfusion maps of a 41-year-old female with an infarct in the right MCA territory presented with weakness in left arm and legs and a right-sided face droop. In the upper row perfusion maps of the original CTP protocol are shown (a, b, and c). The lower row (d, e, and f) shows perfusion maps of the same patient in which the second time point was deleted. The perfusion images show an increased MTT with a small area of reduced CBV and CBF in the right MCA territory. Note that the perfusion maps are similar of the original and the perfusion maps with a 6 s gap. WL settings were not changed since the observer was shown the images as the perfusion software calculated the perfusion maps with these WL settings

### The cause of the stroke: a diagnostic uncertainty [^114uV7Bm]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 39-year-old man with a history of sickle cell disease (SCD) presented with left leg weakness. He had a normal CT head and CT angiogram, but MRI head showed multiple acute bilateral cortical infarcts including in the right precentral gyrus. The MRI findings were more in keeping with an embolic source rather than stroke related to SCD, although it could not be ruled out. He also had an echocardiogram which revealed a patent foramen ovale. He was treated with antiplatelet therapy and also had red blood cell exchange transfusion. His symptoms improved significantly and he was discharged with follow-up as an outpatient and a cardiology review.

Case presentation

A usually independent and active octogenarian with no pre-existing cognitive impairment and a preadmission Barthel Index of 20 presented to the emergency department of our institution. His medical history included angina, hypertension and a previous Bell's palsy affecting the left side of his face. Medication prior to admission included aspirin 75 mg once a day, isosorbide mononitrate 40 mg once a day, lisinopril 5 mg once a day, artificial tears as required, omeprazole 20 mg once a day, atenolol 25 mg once a day and atorvastatin 20 mg once a day.

He was last seen well at 10:00 but was found at 12:40 'confused', with speech disturbance associated with a right-sided facial droop and right-sided weakness. He arrived at 13:40 and the stroke team were contacted at 13:50, at which point his National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 19: although he was conscious, he had severe aphasia (and therefore was unable to answer questions about the month and his age), he struggled to obey two commands, had visual inattention, significantly reduced power in both the right arm and leg, near unintelligible speech and severe hemi-inattention.

Intravenous access was obtained and baseline blood tests sent, all of which were unremarkable. Plain CT of the head revealed changes consistent with small vessel disease and arterial calcification particularly in the middle cerebral arteries. In view of the NIHSS score and symptoms and signs consistent with a left total anterior circulation ischaemic infarct, and in the absence of any contraindications, the patient was thrombolysed with intravenous alteplase 26 min from referral. As the thrombolytic therapy was being infused, we proceeded to CT angiography and CT perfusion, in preparation for possible thrombectomy of the suspected thrombus occluding the left middle cerebral artery.

Initially, the patient's blood pressure had been acceptable (155/88 mm Hg), but this rose during thrombolysis and a bolus of intravenous labetalol was required to bring the blood pressure back within range. Thereafter, blood pressure control was adequate.

We report three patients with large middle cerebral artery infarctions in the non-dominant hemisphere, with striking recovery of motor function. In each case this excellent functional outcome correlated with selective sparing of the motor cortex in the precentral gyrus. We discuss some of the possible circulatory variants that might underlie this pattern of infarction.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF LVO

Given the ability to alter their natural history with endovascular thrombectomy, early identification of patients with LVOs is critical. Differentiating AIS patients with LVOs from those without based on clinical presentation is nonetheless challenging due to the variable nature of collateral vasculature and the potential for unique "at risk" and symptomatic tissue patterning across patients with the same anatomical site of occlusion. LVOs can also commonly manifest with minimal symptomology. Accordingly, in one recent retrospective study, there was no significant difference in average NIHSS score between AIS patients with and those without LVOs (23 vs 18.5, P = 0.55). Even when broken down into the 11 NIHSS subcategories (level of consciousness, questions, commands, gaze, visual fields, facial palsy, motor arm and leg, ataxia, sensory, language, dysarthria, and extinction), only an increased severity of facial palsy with LVO (P = 0.03) was significant on univariate analysis, before losing significance upon multivariate testing (P = 0.053). AIS patients with LVOs were nonetheless significantly more likely to have a lower mean systolic blood pressure upon presentation than those without LVOs (153 vs 179, P < .01 on both univariate and multivariate analysis). Conversely, in a separate retrospective analysis of a less symptomatic cohort of patients with AIS, an increased NIHSS was the only clinical predictor of LVO (13 vs 2, P < .01).

While not pathognomonic, the clinical presentation of patients with LVOs is nonetheless often stereotyped and anatomically matched to the site of occlusion and downstream affected cerebrum (Table 2). Specifically, ICA or proximal MCA occlusions often present with contralateral hemibody and face weakness and/or numbness, contralateral homonymous hemianopsia, and ipsilateral gaze deviation, as well as aphasia for dominant hemispheric lesions and neglect for lesions of the nondominant hemisphere. More nuanced presentations of variable clinical severity and importance are observed with more distal occlusions. One notable distal occlusion site is the M3 branch to the angular gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. Due to the involvement of this vascular territory in speech processing and complex cognition, focal occlusions in this location are sometimes more aggressively pursued for thrombectomy in an attempt to preserve speech and cognition as compared to similarly distant blockages in arteries supplying less eloquent cortex.

Investigations

The patient was initially reviewed by ophthalmology and differential diagnoses included optic neuritis, carotid artery dissection, vasculitis and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Neuroimaging showed complete right common, internal and external carotid artery occlusions, multifocal left common carotid artery thrombus, resulting in 75% stenosis of the left common carotid, with thrombus extending into the proximal left internal carotid artery (ICA) and total occlusion of the left external carotid artery. There was also a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis affecting the right transverse and sigmoid sinuses (see figure 1). There were also multiple small acute grey and white matter infarcts scattered throughout the right anterior and posterior circulations on diffusion-weighted imaging MRI. The right eye visual changes were due to a right retinal artery occlusion. A CT chest and neck angiogram demonstrated the aforementioned right ICA thrombosis and a right lower lobe pulmonary arterial embolus with no evidence of any arterial dissection (see figure 2). Later that day, he developed new left upper limb weakness. CT brain perfusion and angiogram revealed proximal propagation of the right transverse sinus thrombosis and a persistent right carotid thrombosis.

On day 16, the patient developed an acute onset of severe right arm and leg weakness, severe receptive and expressive dysphasia and right-sided neglect with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 22. Repeat CT brain perfusion at that point revealed total occlusion of the left ICA, and new infarcts in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territories with occlusive thrombus demonstrated within the inferior division of the M2 segment of the left MCA and within the callossomarginal branch of the left ACA (see figure 3). The vision loss in his right eye (present on admission) had worsened and he developed a new left eye vision loss due to a left retinal artery occlusion rendering him blind in both eyes.

Impairment assessment after stroke — In the United States, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ranges from 0 to 42 with higher scores indicating more severe loss of body function/structure, is a good predictor of short-term and long-term morbidity and mortality, and has been found to be sensitive to change in numerous studies, but limitations include low granularity for defining differences in level of impairment and insensitivity to many common poststroke deficits such as depression, hand-motor deficits, swallowing, or memory loss; common modality-specific measures include the upper limb motor section of the Fugl-Meyer scale or the Box and Block Test for arm motor deficits and the leg motor section of the Fugl-Meyer scale or gait velocity for leg motor deficits.

Malignant middle cerebral artery infarction ≤ 60 years — in patients ≤ 60 years of age with unilateral MCA infarctions who deteriorate neurologically within 48 hours despite medical therapy, decompressive craniectomy with dural expansion is reasonable because it reduces mortality by close to 50%, with 55% of the surgical survivors achieving moderate disability (able to walk) or better (mRS score 2 or 3) and 18% achieving independence (mRS score ≤ 2) at 12 months; randomized trials showed an absolute risk reduction in mortality of 50% (95% CI, 34–66) at 12 months.

### Anterior cerebral artery emboli in combined intravenous and intra-arterial rtPA treatment of acute ischemic stroke in the IMS I and II trials [^112ugFp1]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) emboli may occur before or during fibrinolytic revascularization of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) T occlusions. We sought to determine the incidence and effect of baseline and new embolic ACA occlusions in the Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) studies.

Materials and Methods

Case report forms, pretreatment and posttreatment arteriograms, and CTs from 142 subjects entered into IMS I & II were reviewed to identify subjects with baseline ACA occlusion, new ACA emboli occurring during fibrinolysis, subsequent CT-demonstrated infarction in the ACA distribution, and to evaluate global and lower extremity motor clinical outcome.

Results

During M1/M2 thrombolysis procedures, new ACA embolus occurred in 1 of 60 (1.7%) subjects. Baseline distal emboli were identified in 3 of 20 (15%) T occlusions before intra-arterial (IA) treatment, and new posttreatment distal ACA emboli were identified in 3 subjects. At 24 hours, 8 (32%) T occlusions demonstrated CT-ACA infarct, typically of small volume. Infarcts were less common following sonography microcatheter-assisted thrombolysis compared with standard microcatheter thrombolysis (P = 0.05). Lower extremity weakness was present in 9 of 10 subjects with ACA embolus/infarct at 24 hours. The modified Rankin 0 to 2 outcomes were achieved in 4 of 25 (16%) subjects with T occlusion overall, but in 0 of 10 subjects with distal ACA emboli or ACA CT infarcts (P = 0.07).

Conclusions

With IV/IA recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment for MCA emboli, new ACA emboli are uncommon events. Distal ACA emboli during T-occlusion thrombolysis are not uncommon, typically lead to small ACA-distribution infarcts, and may limit neurologic recovery.

### Presumed perinatal ischemic stroke: vascular classification predicts outcomes [^1177KfWd]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Perinatal stroke commonly causes childhood neurological morbidity. Presumed perinatal ischemic stroke (PPIS) defines children presenting outside a normal perinatal period with chronic, focal infarction on neuroimaging. Infarcts are assumed to represent arterial strokes, but recent evidence suggests the periventricular venous infarction (PVI) of infants born preterm may also occur in utero and present as PPIS. Using the largest published cohort, we aimed to define arterial and PVI PPIS syndromes and their outcomes.

Methods

A PPIS consecutive cohort was identified (SickKids Children's Stroke Program, 1992–2006). Systematic neuroradiological scoring executed by blinded investigators included previously defined arterial stroke syndromes. PVI criteria included unilateral injury with at least four of the following conditions: (1) focal periventricular encephalomalacia, (2) internal capsule T2 prolongation, (3) cortical and (4) relative basal ganglia sparing, and (5) remote hemorrhage. Arterial and PVI classifications were validated and correlated with neurological outcomes (Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure).

Results

In 59 PPISs (64% male), 94% of lesions fell within potential middle cerebral artery territories. Although arterial proximal M1 infarction was most common (n = 19; 35%), venous PVI was second (n = 12; 22%) and accounted for 75% of subcortical injuries. Motor outcomes (mean follow-up, 5.3 years) were predicted by basal ganglia involvement including leg hemiparesis, spasticity, and need for assistive devices (p < 0.01). Nonmotor outcomes were associated with cortical involvement, including cognitive/behavioral outcomes, visual deficits, and epilepsy (p < 0.01). Classification interrater reliability was excellent (correlation coefficients > 0.975).

Interpretation

Recognizable PPIS patterns predict long-term morbidity and may guide surveillance, therapy, and counseling. PVI is an underrecognized cause of PPIS and congenital hemiplegia.

### Can the FAST and ROSIER adult stroke recognition tools be applied to confirmed childhood arterial ischemic stroke? [^116KRWZ8]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The aims of our study were to describe the spectrum of signs and symptoms of radiologically confirmed stroke in children presenting to a tertiary emergency department and more specifically to determine whether adult stroke recognition tools could be applied in childhood stroke. We found that face, arm or leg weakness and speech disturbance were the most common clinical signs of stroke and that two adult stroke recognition tools, FAST and ROSIER had fair to good sensitivity of 76% and 81% respectively for detection of stroke symptoms. Mode of presentation was influenced by vascular territory with lateralised limb weakness and sensory disturbance being more common in anterior circulation stroke and visual field defects, eye movement abnormalities and limb ataxia being more common in posterior circulation stroke. There was a corresponding difference in the sensitivity of the FAST and ROSIER tools, being lower in posterior circulation stroke.

Overall, this study shows that childhood AIS has similar clinical features to adult stroke. In adults the most common presenting signs of stroke are arm weakness (68–81%), leg weakness (54–73%), facial weakness (45–59%), speech disturbance (45–59%) and sensory loss (36–49%) largely similar to our pediatric stroke data. There is limited data on the presenting clinical features of stroke in children and our study provides in depth analysis of all neurological signs and symptoms at presentation. Previous studies have described clinical findings in terms of focal sign, motor deficits or hemiparesis. Some studies have described speech and visual field deficits but sensory deficits, cranial nerve or cerebellar signs have only been reported in one study. In contrast seizures at presentation have been more consistently reported in the pediatric literature, occurring in 11–28% of children at the time of initial presentation which is consistent with our findings.

### Haemorrhagic transformation of a recent silent cerebral infarct during thrombolytic stroke treatment [^113fmvGv]. BMJ Case Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

We present a patient in her 60s who was admitted with a sudden loss of power in her right arm and leg, right sided facial weakness, and difficulties with speaking. An acute ischaemic stroke in the left hemisphere was diagnosed and the patient received intravenous thrombolytic treatment. Treatment was stopped halfway as a cerebral haemorrhage was suspected. A small haemorrhage in the right frontal cortex was thereafter identified on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Re-examination of the CT scan taken before the start of thrombolytic treatment revealed a recent silent infarct with cortical petechial haemorrhage at this site. A month later the patient still suffered from a partial paralysis in her right arm and leg, but could now walk without help; she did not have any lasting symptoms of the haemorrhage. Our case illustrates that a recent silent infarct can be a cause of a haemorrhage at an unexpected site during thrombolytic treatment.

### Can the FAST and ROSIER adult stroke recognition tools be applied to confirmed childhood arterial ischemic stroke? [^112hmwg4]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Results

A search of the RCH stroke registry identified 55 patients during the 5 year study period. A total of 47 patients were included in the study; 34 (72%) had anterior circulation stroke, 12 (26%) had posterior circulation stroke and one child (2%) had involvement of both. Eight patients were excluded: 5 had incomplete documentation and 3 had a transient ischaemic attacks without radiological evidence of parenchymal infarction.

All patients with no lateralising motor or sensory symptoms had other symptoms including visual disturbances, headache/vomiting, altered concious state, and seizures.

Patients ranged in age from 4 months to 16 years with a median age of 7 years. Fifty-four percent arrived by ambulance and thirty-eight percent of the patients brought by their parents arrived by private car. High triage categories 1 and 2 were assigned to only 25% of AIS patients. Forty-seven percent of patients had prior relevant medical history including history of migraine/headaches (7), head/neck trauma (5), previous stroke (3), chickenpox (2), cardiac disease (2) and other diagnosis (4). Median time from onset of symptoms to the ED presentation was 21 hours (IQR 5.7–48).

Clinical Data

Table 1 shows presenting complaints and neurological examination findings. The majority (83%) of patients presented with sudden onset of symptoms and one third presented within 6 hours of stroke onset. The most common presenting symptoms were arm (63%), facial (62%) or leg weakness (57%), speech disturbances (46%) and headache (46%). Focal arm face or leg weakness were more common with anterior circulation stroke and visual disturbance or headache were more common with posterior circulation stroke. Most patients (85%) had a GCS of ≥ 14. The most common neurological signs were facial (70%), arm (61%) or leg weakness (57%) and slurred speech (34%). Once again focal arm, face or leg weakness were more common with anterior circulation stroke and visual disturbance or ataxia were more common with posterior circulation stroke

Patients were classified according to the Pediatric Stroke Classification (Table 2).

### Biological mechanism of sex difference in stroke manifestation and outcomes [^112UMJ3g]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our MRI-based nationwide multicenter study of 6,464 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke, multivariable statistical analyses revealed that, compared with male patients, female patients have more severe neurologic symptoms and poorer 3-month functional outcomes probably due to anatomic sex differences: that is, more frequent symptomatic MCA steno-occlusion and striatocapsular lesions that more frequently produce motor weakness and END. Covariate-adjusted sex differences in the incidences of END and unfavorable functional outcome were 3.5% and 4.5% higher in female patients, respectively, corresponding to NNTs of 28.6 and 22.2. These values are similar to the magnitude of treatment effect by acute stroke unit care vs general ward care in reducing unfavorable functional outcome. In addition, multivariable brain mapping showed that left parieto-occipital cortical brain regions associate with a significantly higher neurologic severity in female patients, although this intrinsic difference had less impact when compared with the anatomic sex differences.

In line with previous research, our study showed that female patients with acute ischemic stroke presented with more severe neurologic symptoms compared with male patients. Multivariable adjustment for age and other covariates did not change the result, and female patients had higher admission NIHSS scores than male patients with similar percentage infarct volumes. Earlier work showed that female patients had better collateral flow and smaller infarct core volume in large vessel occlusion strokes. However, our study found that percentage infarct volumes did not differ significantly between female patients and male patients. Moreover, in female patients, stroke more frequently affected the basal ganglia, internal capsule, and corona radiata compared with male patients. That these motor-eloquent subcortical regions are more often involved in female patients (vs ataxia-related cerebellar regions in male patients) align with higher NIHSS scores in female patients because the motor elements have a maximum total of 11 points (facial palsy and unilateral limb weakness) in the scoring system. By contrast, the ataxia element has a maximum of only 2 points. Although cerebrocortical and cerebellar lesions were more common in male patients than in female patients, these lesions are less often associated with limb weakness.

### Altered hemodynamic responses in patients after subcortical stroke measured by functional MRI [^115KR5dL]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) is a promising method for defining brain recovery after stroke quantitatively. Applications thus far have assumed that the BOLD hemodynamic response in patients after stroke is identical to that in healthy controls. However, because of local vascular compromise or more diffuse vascular disease predisposing to infarction, this assumption may not be justified after stroke. We sought to test whether patients who have suffered a lacunar stroke show BOLD fMRI response characteristics identical to those of healthy controls.

Methods

We measured the BOLD fMRI signal time course in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the affected hand with finger- or hand-tapping tasks for minimally or mildly impaired right-handed patients (n = 12) after lacunar strokes causing limb weakness and for healthy controls (n = 20).

Results

With a right-handed sequential finger-tapping task, the rate of rise and maximum increase of the BOLD signal in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex were > 30% lower (P ≤ 0.01) in the stroke patients. Similar relative decreases were found for the same task performed with the left hand. These changes were found in patients both in the hemisphere affected by stroke and in the unaffected hemisphere, suggesting that the BOLD fMRI time course differences observed arise from a diffuse functional pathology. The difference between patients and controls is not a result of age alone, since differences were not found between the younger (n = 10; aged 22 to 38 years) and the older (n = 10; aged 56 to 83 years) healthy controls. The effect also does not seem to be dependent on the specific hand movement task used.

Conclusions

The magnitude of the BOLD fMRI response can be reduced in stroke patients even if infarcts do not involve the cortex. This may be a consequence of the stroke, but the observation that the BOLD signal time course is similar in the affected and unaffected hemispheres suggests that it also could result from preexisting pathophysiological changes in the cerebral microvasculature.

### Infarct hemisphere and noninfarcted brain volumes affect locomotor performance following stroke [^1115GjmU]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Brain damage within the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory is particularly disruptive to mediolateral postural stabilization. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to test the hypothesis that chronic right MCA infarcts (as compared to left) are associated with slower and more bilaterally asymmetrical gait. We further hypothesized that in those with chronic right MCA infarct, locomotor performance is more dependent on gray matter (GM) volumes within noninfarcted regions of the brain that are involved in motor control yet lie outside of the MCA territory.

Methods

Gait speed was assessed in 19 subjects with right MCA infarct, 20 with left MCA infarct, and 108 controls. Bilateral plantar pressure and temporal symmetry ratios were calculated in a subset of the cohort. GM volumes within 5 regions outside of the MCA territory (superior parietal lobe, precuneus, caudate, putamen, and cerebellum) were quantified from anatomic MRIs.

Results

Right and left infarct groups had similar poststroke duration (7.6 ± 6.0 years), infarct size, and functional independence. The right infarct group demonstrated slower gait speed and greater asymmetry compared to the left infarct group and controls (p < 0.05). In the right infarct group only, those with larger GM volumes within the cerebellum (r(2) = 0.32, p = 0.02) and caudate (r(2) = 0.56, p < 0.001) exhibited faster gait speed.

Conclusion

Individuals with chronic lesions within the right MCA territory, as compared to the left MCA territory, exhibit slower, more asymmetrical gait. For these individuals, larger GM volumes within regions outside of the infarcted vascular territory may help preserve locomotor control.

### The precision by the face arm speech time (FAST) algorithm in stroke capture, sex and age differences: a stroke registry study [^113abbMf]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

Out of 6363 patients admitted with acute stroke, 5022 (80.5%) had complete NIHSS at admission and were included in this study (flow chart, figure 1). Patients not included due to missing NIHSS at admission were older, with more severe strokes, and 430 (32%) died before the 3-month follow-up (online supplemental table 1).

Figure 1
Complete NIHSS = available scores on at least one of the NIHSS subitems consciousness, orientation and/or motor arm at admission. NIHSS, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)

Of the 5022 patients included in this study, 2312 (46%) were women. Women were older, with a mean (SD) age of 76.0 (13.9) years, compared with 71.3 (12.9) in men. In total, 4468 (89%) suffered ischaemic stroke without sex differences. Women had a significantly higher NIHSS than men (mean (SD) NIHSS 6 (7) vs NIHSS 5 (6), p < 0.001), with 1127 (56%) and 1460 (60%) of strokes categorised as mild (NIHSS ≤ 3) for women and men, respectively. Dysarthria (present in 38%), followed by facial palsy (present in 36%), was the most common NIHSS item affected. When combining left and right weakness, weakness in one arm or leg (present in 34%) was the third most common symptom. There was a significantly higher proportion of women with scores on 9 of the 15 NIHSS items (consciousness, orientation, commands, gaze, left arm, motor leg, sensory, best language and neglect). Patient characteristics and sex differences are presented in table 1.

Table 1

FAST precision by sex, age, and stroke severity

In all, 2972 patients (59.2%) had at least one FAST symptom at hospital admission, and as many women as men were admitted with FAST symptoms (p = 0.215). Further, there were no sex or age differences found in FAST precision when stratifying for stroke severity. In mild strokes (NIHSS ≤ 3), 23%–32% were FAST positive, whereas 94% and above were FAST positive in moderate and severe strokes (table 2).

### Association of modified rankin scale with recovery phenotypes in patients with upper extremity weakness after stroke [^115AQ4yS]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Precise measurement of outcomes is essential for stroke trials and clinical care. Prior research has highlighted conceptual differences between global outcome measures such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and domain-specific measures (e.g., motor, sensory, language or cognitive function). This study related motor phenotypes to the mRS, specifically aiming to determine whether mRS levels distinguish motor impairment and function phenotypes, and to compare mRS outcomes to meaningful changes in impairment and function from acute to subacute recovery after stroke.

Methods

Patients with upper extremity weakness after ischemic stroke were assessed with a battery of impairment and functional measures within the first week and at 90 days after stroke. Impairment and functional outcomes were examined in relation to 90-day mRS scores. Clinically meaningful changes in motor impairment, activities of daily living, and mobility were examined in relation to 90-day mRS score.

Results

In this cohort of 73 patients with stroke, impairment and functional outcomes were associated with 90-day mRS scores but showed substantial variability within individual mRS levels: within mRS level 2, upper extremity impairment ranged from near hemiplegia (with an upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score 8) to no deficits (upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score 66). Overall, there were few differences in impairment and functional outcomes between adjacent mRS levels. While some outcome measures were significantly different between mRS levels 3 and 4 (Nine-Hole Peg, Leg Motor, gait velocity, Timed Up and Go, NIH Stroke Scale, and Barthel Index), none of the outcome measures differed between mRS levels 1 and 2. Fugl-Meyer and grip strength were not different between any adjacent mRS levels. A substantial number of patients experienced clinically meaningful changes in impairment and function in the first 90 days after stroke but did not achieve good mRS outcome (mRS score ≤ 2).

Discussion

The mRS broadly relates to domain-specific outcomes after stroke, confirming its established value in stroke trials, but it does not precisely distinguish differences in impairment and function, nor does it sufficiently capture meaningful clinical changes across impairment, activities of daily living status, and mobility. These findings underscore the potential utility of incorporating detailed phenotypic measures along with the mRS in future stroke trials.

### Functional, cognitive, physical, and vascular outcomes 9 years after lacunar and mild cortical ischemic stroke [^111tpjnw]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Difficulties with activities of daily living were common. 42% (n = 19/45) of participants with lacunar stroke reported difficulties completing household tasks, compared with 29% (n = 14/49) of those with cortical stroke (W = 966.5, p = 0.22). 24% (n = 11/45) of participants with lacunar stroke acknowledged facing challenges with self-care tasks, including washing and dressing, compared with 10% (n = 5/48) of participants with cortical stroke (W = 984.5, p = 0.28) (Table 3).

Problems with mobility, balance, and muscle strength were common: 36% (n = 16/45) of participants with lacunar stroke and 32% (n = 16/50) of those with cortical stroke had "slight-to-moderate" problems with mobility, and 9% (n = 4/45) of the lacunar stroke group and 12% (n = 6/50) of the cortical stroke group had severe mobility difficulties (W = 1,136, p = 0.92). Impaired balance was slightly more frequent in participants with lacunar stroke (42% [n = 19/45]) than in those with cortical stroke (35% [n = 17/49]) (W = 1,022.5, p = 0.48). Most participants with cortical stroke (55% [n = 26/47]) regained a substantial portion of strength in their affected limb after stroke, compared with 31% (n = 14/45) of those with lacunar strokes; a higher proportion of participants with lacunar stroke (40% [n = 18/45]) only gained a minimal amount of strength compared with 13% (n = 6/47) of those with cortical strokes (W = 705.5, p ≤ 0.001) (Table 3).

Most participants were living with family (lacunar: 66% [n = 29/44]; cortical: 71% [n = 34/48]), followed by those living independently (lacunar: 32% [n = 14/44]; cortical: 27% [n = 13/48]). Only 2% (n = 1/44) of lacunar and 2% (n = 1/48) of cortical stroke questionnaire respondents were residing in assisted living facilities.

### Impaired hemodynamics and neural activation? A fMRI study of major cerebral artery stenosis [^112r2D5s]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Functional MRI motor mapping was performed in two women with unilateral high-grade stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) to determine the influence of impaired hemodynamics on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response. In both patients no structural lesions were present in primary motor pathways. A redistribution of the motor network to the healthy hemisphere was the main indicator of chronic hemodynamic compromise.

### Wallerian degeneration in the corticospinal tract evaluated by diffusion tensor imaging correlates with motor deficit 30 days after middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke [^1152F2TZ]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The quantification and clinical significance of WD in CSTs following supratentorial stroke are not well understood. We evaluated the anisotropy by using DTI and signal-intensity changes on conventional MR imaging in the CST to determine whether these findings are correlated with limb motor deficit in patients with MCA ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods

We studied 60 patients within 12 hours of stroke onset. At admission, day 3, and day 30 of evolution, patients underwent multimodal MR imaging, including DTI sequences. We assessed the severity of limb weakness by using the motor subindex scores (5a, 5b, 6a, 6b) of the m-NIHSS and established 3 groups: I (m-NIHSS scores of 0), II (m-NIHSS, 1–4), and III (m-NIHSS, 5–8). FA values and rFAs were measured on the affected and the unaffected CSTs in the pons.

Results

FA values for the CST were significantly lower on the affected side compared with the unaffected side only at day 30 (P < .001), and the rFA was significantly correlated with the motor deficit at day 30 (P < .001; r = -0.793). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for motor deficit by rFA < 0.925 were 95.2%, 94.9%, 90.9%, and 97.4%, respectively.

Conclusions

WD in the CST revealed by DTI correlates with motor deficit 30 days after MCA ischemic stroke. This study highlights the utility of imaging follow-up at 30 days and the potential of DTI as a surrogate marker in clinical trials.

### Neurodevelopmental profiles of children with unilateral cerebral palsy associated with middle cerebral artery and periventricular venous infarctions [^115ETfhX]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The differences between the PVI and MCA group can be explained by neuroanatomical location and timing of injury during brain development. The MCA injury in the parietal cortex is frequently situated near the distal hand projections of the cortex and encompasses both the primary motor and sensory areas. Hence with MCA injuries, distal hand function is impacted and changes in both motor and sensory processing can be identified. The cortical projections to the legs are located near the longitudinal fissure separating the two hemispheres and therefore relatively outside the MCA infarction area. The area of the MCA infarction can also involve the optic radiation which explains the higher proportion of children with visual field cuts and is localized in the cortex, which explains the higher proportion of children with cognitive impairment and seizures. For individuals with PVI, the area of haemorrhagic infarction is predominantly located in the subcortical area which implicates the motor tracts of the arm and leg rather than the arm being preferentially targeted. The mechanism of sensory sparing in PVI has been elucidated by Staudt et al. 26 who identified that the ascending thalamocortical somatosensory axons at the time of the injury (typically at the beginning of the third trimester) have not yet reached their final destination. These tracts divert laterally/posteriorly around the periventricular injury eventually reaching the primary sensory cortex.

The majority of children in the PVI and MCA groups were born at term gestation (greater than 80%). The high proportion of term gestation in the PVI group is important to highlight as the mechanism of injury is widely attributed to a germinal matrix haemorrhage – an injury associated with the preterm brain – creating a blockage of 'outflow' in the deep medullary veins leading to a venous infarction. 27 However, it is increasingly recognized that this injury pattern can occur silently in utero with the term‐born infant presenting in the first year of life with a presumed perinatal ischemic stroke. 11 This finding of a predominant term presentation of PVI is a unique finding of our study, as many of the registry studies do not have detailed neuroimaging findings to accurately identify PVI and there is variability of how PVI is categorized (focal vascular injury vs white matter injury).

Lower extremity weakness or sensory loss — fall risk increased with lower extremity impairment, with a Class I relative risk (RR) of 2.4 (1.7 to 3.2); among stroke survivors, Class II odds ratios (ORs) of 2.2 (1.1 to 4.7) for motor impairment and 3.1 (1.5 to 6.8) for combined motor and sensory impairments; and among seniors, ORs of 1.8 (1.1 to 3.2) for sensory loss and 4.1 (2.2 to 7.4) for hip flexion weakness.

### Involuntary movements after anterior cerebral artery territory infarction [^113uXEUM]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Patients with anterior cerebral artery territory infarction presenting with involuntary movements have rarely been described in the literature.

Case Descriptions

The author reports 9 such patients: 3 with asterixis, 5 with hemiparkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, hypokinesia), and 1 with both. Asterixis developed in the acute stage in patients with minimal arm weakness, whereas parkinsonism was usually observed after the motor dysfunction improved in patients with initially severe limb weakness. Asterixis correlated with small lesions preferentially involving the prefrontal area; parkinsonism is related to relatively large lesions involving the supplementary motor area.

Conclusions

Anterior cerebral artery territory infarction should be included in the differential diagnosis of asterixis and hemiparkinsonism.

### Scorpion sting-induced malignant middle cerebral artery infarction [^111AMgHt]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A previously healthy middle-aged man in his 40s with a history of red scorpion envenomation presented to the emergency department for the management of an acute stroke syndrome, involving the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, that developed 12 hours after the scorpion sting. He presented to the hospital 15 hours following the stroke. The activation of the autonomic nervous system by the Indian red scorpion venom is known to produce severe systemic manifestations, including cardiogenic shock and acute pulmonary oedema. Death is a rare consequence. Neurological complications resulting from red scorpion injuries are exceedingly uncommon and inadequately documented in the literature. The patient underwent an emergency decompressive craniectomy in view of neurological deterioration despite intracranial pressure-reducing agents. Thrombectomy could not be done in view of the malignant infarct (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score of 1) which involved over one-third of the MCA territory. Our patient has made a full recovery and at 6months' follow-up; he was capable of walking without assistance. It is essential to promptly identify and manage this under-recognised presentation in order to yield favourable functional outcomes for the patient.

Statin therapy after ischemic stroke/TIA — SPARCL and TST trials: The SPARCL trial included adults with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack in the prior 1 to 6 months and LDL-C 100 to 190 mg/dL, randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo, with median 4.9 years follow-up showing stroke in 11.2% versus 13.1% (adjusted HR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71–0.99]); the TST trial enrolled adults with cerebral infarction in the prior 3 months or high-risk TIA (arm and leg motor deficit or speech disturbance lasting > 10 minutes) in the prior 15 days with documented atherosclerotic disease, randomly assigned to LDL-C targets of < 70 mg/dL versus 90 to 110 mg/dL, and over a median 3.5 years the primary composite major cardiovascular event occurred in 8.5% versus 10.9% (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.61–0.98]); additionally, a secondary IMPROVE-IT analysis found a significantly lower risk of ischemic stroke with ezetimibe in addition to simvastatin among patients with prior MI.

### Role of primary motor cortex in gait: automatic-voluntary dissociation seen in paretic leg of a patient who had a stroke [^114Dkeqz]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 49-year-old Japanese sweets craftsman who had no previous stroke episode noticed paresis in his right leg one morning, and was transported to a local acute care hospital. MRI studies at that hospital showed high-intensity lesion in the left paracentral lobule on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted images (figure 1A, B). MR angiography revealed pearl and string sign in the right anterior cerebral artery at A2 segment, suggesting a dissecting aneurysm as the cause of infarction (figure 1C). Low-density area observed on T2✱WI image confirmed haemorrhage in the infarct area. No abnormal findings suggesting previous stroke were detected. The diagnosis was cerebral infarction in left frontal cortex caused by dissection of left anterior cerebral artery. Medical examination revealed risk factors of stroke including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and homocysteinaemia. After 3 weeks of conservative acute-phase treatment, he was transferred to our hospital for stroke rehabilitation.

### Role of primary motor cortex in gait: automatic-voluntary dissociation seen in paretic leg of a patient who had a stroke [^112d2r4n]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Neurological examination at admission showed clear consciousness, no cognitive disturbances, no facial palsy and no upper limb weakness. However, paresis was found in his right leg. Manual muscle testingscore was 3 in the proximal muscles (iliopsoas, quadriceps and hamstrings), and 0 in the distal muscles (tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus, and toe extensors and flexors). No leg muscle atrophy was found. Deep tendon reflexes were normal in both arms and in the left leg. In the right leg, patella tendon reflex (PTR) and Achilles' tendon reflex (ATR) were diminished. Plantar reflex was flexor on the unaffected side, and no response on the paretic side. Sensation was normal to all modalities. Paralysis on the right side as assessed by Brunnstrom recovery stagewas stage VI in upper arm and fingers, and stage I–II in the leg.

### Diagnosis of non-consensus transient ischaemic attacks with focal, negative, and non-progressive symptoms: population-based validation by investigation and prognosis [^114Jty41]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Patients were seen by study doctors as soon as possible after their initial presentation. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, or assent was obtained from relatives of patients with dementia or receptive dysphasia. Patients who had an event while temporarily away from Oxfordshire were included on their return, but visitors to Oxfordshire not normally registered with a study general practice were excluded.

Procedures

Using a standard form, we recorded baseline demographic data, risk factors, clinical history, and symptoms, including duration of attack and number of attacks. Severity of stroke was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).

All cases were reviewed by the study's senior neurologist (PMR) and classified prospectively, usually on the day of ascertainment, as either non-vascular conditions (eg, migraine aura or seizure), stroke, classic TIA, or non-consensus TIA. Patients with transient positive visual or sensory symptoms or progressive symptoms suggestive of transient neurological attacks were excluded from this analysis and will be reported separately. Non-consensus TIA was prospectively subclassified using predefined definitions (panel), as isolated vertigo, isolated ataxia, isolated diplopia, non-dysphasic isolated speech disturbance (slurred speech), isolated bilateral decreased vision, or isolated unilateral sensory symptoms involving only one body part (eg, face, arm, hand, or leg). In view of known differences in prognosis, classic TIAs were subclassified as amaurosis fugax, cerebral TIA involving motor weakness, or cerebral TIA without motor weakness. Stroke was defined according to WHO criteria; classic TIA and non-consensus TIA were also classified according to the likely vascular territory (anterior, posterior, or uncertain).

### Central facial palsy revisited: a clinical-radiological study [^111tGLdW]. Annals of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

We investigated the pattern of volitional facial motor deficits in acute stroke patients. We assessed the strength of single facial movements and correlated it to the site of infarct classified on computed tomography scans. Exclusion criteria were previous stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and subcortical stroke. Results showed that weakness in eyelid closure was associated with anterior cerebral artery (ACA) stroke. Weakness in lip opening was associated with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. We suggest that sparing of upper facial movements in MCA stroke is due to the presence of an upper face motor representation in both the MCA and ACA territories.

Society for Vascular Surgery — patient selection cautions after acute stroke: Patients with a significant neurologic deficit (modified Rankin scale score > 2), with an area of infarction > 30% of the middle cerebral artery territory and those with altered consciousness should not undergo CEA until significant neurologic improvement has occurred. The most important of these appears to be the degree of hemispheric involvement (< 30% of middle cerebral artery by volume), time to reperfusion, and age. Patients with an acute fixed deficit of > 6 hours' duration and a mild to moderate deficit can be considered for carotid intervention after a period of medical stabilization.

### A case of foreign accent syndrome [^1163CKSj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Foreign accent syndrome is a rare but potentially devastating clinical condition associated with altered speech rhythm and prosody, often occurring after a cerebral vascular accident. Missing this diagnosis can lead to delayed stroke work-up and treatment.

Objective

We report a case of foreign accent syndrome in a 60-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with 3 weeks of altered speech pattern, widened gait, bilateral leg heaviness, and mild headache.

Case Report

The patient had a history of Type 2 diabetes, malignant hypertension, toxic nodular goiter, and hyperlipidemia. She initially presented to the ED at the onset of symptoms, was thought to have had speech change secondary to a goiter impinging on the recurrent laryngeal nerve, and was discharged. She returned to the ED 3 weeks later when outpatient imaging revealed subacute infarction of the left hemi-pons and absent flow within the left vertebral artery. On examination, the patient was alert and conversational. She spoke fluently with an accent that had components of Jamaican and the accent of an Italian speaking English. Neurology was consulted and the patient was admitted. The patient was treated medically, and was discharged home with primary care follow-up. She developed a second, more significant stroke 1 month later, with unilateral weakness and slurred speech in the middle cerebral artery distribution.

Conclusion

Clinicians should be aware that some stroke patients present with various atypical symptoms, and should suspect stroke in any patient with acute-onset neurological symptoms, including speech change.

### A literature review of the pathophysiology and onset of post-stroke spasticity [^112DXSXv]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Spasticity occurs after stroke and gives rise to substantial burden for patients and caregivers. Although it has been studied for many years, its definition continues to undergo reconsideration and revision. This partly reflects the diversity of its manifestations and that its pathophysiology, although well studied, is still debated.

Methods

A literature review was carried out to define the pathophysiology and risk factors for onset of post-stroke spasticity.

Results

It is clear that an acquired brain injury, including stroke, results in an imbalance of inhibitory and excitatory impulses that leads to upper motor neuron symptoms and that the location and extent of the lesions result in differing symptoms and degrees of spastic severity. The onset of spasticity is highly variable and may occur shortly or more than 1 year after stroke. The current understanding of spasticity onset is complicated by the role of contractures, which have been assumed to arise out of spasticity but may have a role in its cause. Other possibly predictive factors for the risk of post-stroke spasticity have been identified, including early arm and leg weakness, left-sided weakness, early reduction in activities of daily living, and a history of smoking.

Conclusions

Further understanding of spasticity risk factors is necessary for the development and integration of early interventions and preventive measures to reduce spasticity onset and severity.

### Somatotopically located motor fibers in corona radiata: evidence from subcortical small infarcts [^116VktSf]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Using T2-weighted MRI, we measured the relative anteroposterior distance of small corona radiata infarcts in 54 patients who had disproportionate weakness in the bulbar (Group A), arm (Group B), and leg (Group C) muscles. The lesions were differently (p < 0.01) located: Group A, most were located anteriorly; Group B, most were in the middle; and Group C, most were located posteriorly. These results suggest that motor fibers are somatotopically arranged in the human corona radiata.

### Relationship of recovery of contralesional ankle weakness with the corticospinal and corticoreticular tracts in stroke patients [^116Lk5jb]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Our assessment of the correlations between the MRC score of the contralesional ankle DF and DTT parameters revealed positive correlations between the MRC score of the contralesional ankle DF and the TVs of the contralesional CST and CRT (contralesional CST: moderate correlation, contralesional CRT: strong correlation). These results indicate that an increase in the number of neural fibers in the contralesional CST and CRT seems to be related to an increase in the degree of recovery of contralesional ankle DF weakness in stroke patients with complete injuries of the ipsilesional CST and CRT. Interestingly, compared with the contralesional CST, the contralesional CRT seems to be more closely associated with recovery of contralesional ankle DF weakness.

As far as we are aware, only one previous study demonstrated a recovery mechanism for ankle motor weakness in a stroke patient. In 2021, Cho and Jangused DTT to demonstrate that contralesional ankle DF weakness was recovered through activation of leg somatotopic fibers of the ipsilesional CST and the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation in a chronic patient with middle cerebral artery infarction. Another related study reported recovery of the gait function in patients with complete injury of the ipsilesional CST. In 2013, Jang et al.used DTT to demonstrate a relationship between the contralesional CRT state and gait function in 54 chronic stroke patients. They found that the TV of the contralesional CRT was closely associated with gait function in chronic stroke patients with complete injury of the ipsilesional CST. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate a relationship between contralesional ankle DF weakness and the contralesional CST and CRT status in stroke patients with complete injuries of the ipsilesional CST and CRT.

### Implications of MMP-12 in the pathophysiology of ischaemic stroke [^114cGGnA]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

MMP-12 involvement in poststroke functional deficits and recovery

Strokes, including ischaemic and haemorrhagic, are the primary cause of long-term disability. Strokes can cause one or more physical or cognitive impairments. Some of the disabling effects and complications of a stroke include paralysis, muscle weakness, difficulty standing or walking, slowed movements, lack of coordination, impairment of fine motor skills, sensory disturbances, speech, language, vision, memory loss and emotional and behavioural disorders. Stroke survivors experience one or more of these debilitating neurological impairments. The post-ischaemic complications and outcomes of a stroke patient are dependent on the affected brain region(s). More than 50% of stroke survivors aged 65 and older have reduced mobility. Therefore, even with intensive therapy, a patient may not fully recover from a stroke and may have a persistent impairment.

Several animal stroke models have been developed to investigate the mechanisms underlying post-stroke injury and to develop effective therapies to reduce brain damage and improve functional recovery. Since blockade of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is the most common cause of IS in humans, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to induce experimental focal cerebral ischaemia in rodent models. Because it allows the study of reperfusion, it is less invasive than craniotomy models, and reliably produces cerebral infarcts, the MCAO procedure in rodents is often used in stroke research. Most importantly, transient MCAO followed by reperfusion results in a number of short-term and long-term cognitive, somatosensory and motor deficits in rodents.

The recovery of somatosensory and motor functions in stroke-induced rats was enhanced by shRNA-mediated gene silencing of MMP-12. The recovery of motor function was also significantly enhanced in mice with a stroke following MMP-12 suppression. The cognitive abilities of stroke-induced mice treated with MMP-12 siRNA are significantly enhanced. The sooner MMP-12 after IS is suppressed, the greater the recovery of sensory and motor function.

### Role of primary motor cortex in gait: automatic-voluntary dissociation seen in paretic leg of a patient who had a stroke [^1163NvX3]. BMJ Neurology Open (2022). High credibility.

Outcome of rehabilitation

Two months later, PTR on the right became more active than the left, but ATR remained weak. Finally, the patient was discharged from the hospital and returned to his previous work, using a T-cane and a small ankle-foot orthosis. At the time of discharge, NIRS showed no functional recovery in the left motor cortex during treadmill gait, although surface EMGs on the right side improved and the amplitudes of proximal muscles increased during isolated muscle contractions. During walking, however, lack of coordinated activities among flexors and extensors remained on the paretic side, and adapted changes of EMG activities were seen on the unaffected side.

### Neuropsychological and neurobehavioral outcome following childhood arterial ischemic stroke: attention deficits, emotional dysregulation, and executive dysfunction [^1128YtkH]. Child Neuropsychology (2014). Low credibility.

METHOD

Participants

Full ethical approval was received from the National Health Service Research Ethics Committee. Children were recruited from a specialist pediatric neurovascular clinic in London, United Kingdom. This clinic serves to follow up all children with cerebrovascular disorders presenting from the referral population of the hospital (North London). Inclusion criteria were (a) aged between 6–18 at assessment, (b) experienced an Arterial Ischemic Stroke (AIS) beyond the neonatal/perinatal period, that is, beyond 28 days of life, (c) MCA territory AIS, and (d) English speakers.

Sixty-four children met the inclusion criteria. Forty-nine children agreed to participate and were assessed either in an outpatient clinic or in their homes between August 2009 and February 2010. The group comprised of 30 boys (61.2%) and 19 girls (38.8%), ranging between 6 and 18 years at assessment (M = 11.08, SD = 3.65). Mean time since stroke onset was 6 years (SD = 3.41). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are presented in Tables 1 and 2. As can be seen in Table 2, the majority of ischemic strokes included basal ganglia and/or MCA infarcts, with the frontal cortical areas predominantly spared.

Table 1.
Demographics and Clinical Characteristics of the Sample.

Table 2
Clinical Characteristics of Participants.

Motor impairment was rated as (a) absent, (b) mild (hemiparesis, able to isolate individual finger movements), or (c) severe (hemiparesis, unable to isolate finger movements). The neurological severity ratings indicated that half the sample (49%) showed normal or reflex asymmetry only, and 51% showed hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body), either mild (able to do isolated finger movements) or severe (unable to do isolated finger movements). The most common risk factors for AIS identified were chicken pox/other infections, moyamoya, and other cerebrovascular abnormalities. Over half the participants had recurrent transient ischemic attacks or recurrent stroke, and a quarter had a history of seizures.

A subgroup (n = 9) was followed up at 19–31 months since initial assessment. Follow-up assessments were conducted in participant homes between November 2011 and March 2012. The follow-up group comprised of 4 boys (44%) and 5 girls (56%), aged between 10 and 19 years (M = 14.43, SD = 2.90).

### Acute ischaemic stroke-related choreoathetosis treated with arterial thrombectomy [^113f3z4R]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A rare case of acute choreoathetosis after acute stroke is presented. This 66-years-old, right-handed Caucasian woman presented with weakness of her right arm and right leg with dysarthria, which resolved by the time she arrived in the emergency department. No obvious focal sign apart from the abnormal choreoathetoid movement of the right arm and leg and of the neck was present. Her medical history included atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation. CT head was nil acute (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score of 10). CT angiography of the carotids showed a hyperdense M2 segment of the left middle cerebral artery. Intravenous thrombolysis immediately followed by thrombectomy was decided. Using the Penumbra aspiration device (ACE 68) two clots were removed with two aspirations. A small distal clot remained but partial recanalisation (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction/Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b) was achieved. 30seconds after restoring blood flow, the choreoathetoid movements ceased. The patient was brought to intensive care for further monitoring, which was uneventful.

### Intracranial thrombectomy using the solitaire stent: a historical vignette [^113RyZf1]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Case presentation

This 67-year-old woman presented on 3 March 2008 at 16:00 to the neurological emergency room. Earlier that day (at 14:50), her relatives had witnessed the acute onset of a fluctuating paresis of her left arm and leg. Diffusion weighted MR images, carried out at 16:30, revealed an area of restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia and the deep periventricular white matter and an MR angiogram demonstrated complete occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) in the M1 segment. The emergency stroke team decided to initiate intravenous thrombolysis, which started within a 2 h window (16:45). As the patient did not show any clinical improvement within the next 30 min, the attending stroke physician decided to proceed with a bridging concept and endovascular treatment was initiated, after the patient was informed of the proposed procedure. This information included a description of the procedure, the potential risks and benefits and an explanation that extensions of the procedure (eg, surgical craniectomy) or the off-label use of medical devices (eg, coronary stents, etc) might become necessary. The patient gave informed consent to the operator. The neurological examination before digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed a severe dysarthria and a left-sided hemiplegia with facial nerve palsy (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 10). The emergent angiography began 3 h and 20 min after the onset of symptoms and the first DSA run was recorded at 18:12.

### Neurophysiological criteria for intraoperative prediction of pure motor hemiplegia during aneurysm surgery. case report [^116a1Sn7]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

The value of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) as an intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring tool for detecting selective subcortical ischemia of the motor pathways during intracerebral aneurysm repair is described and the use of such measures to predict postoperative motor status is discussed. The authors present the case of a 64-year-old woman in whom there was an incidental finding of two right middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms. During the aneurysm clipping procedure, an intraoperative MEP loss in the left abductor pollicis brevis and tibial anterior muscles occurred during an attempt at permanent clip placement. There were no concurrent changes in somatosensory evoked potentials. Postoperatively, the patient demonstrated a left hemiplegia with intact sensation. A computerized tomography scan revealed an infarct in the anterior division of the MCA territory, including the posterior limb of the internal capsule. In this patient, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring with MEPs has been shown to be a sensitive tool for indicating subcortical ischemia affecting selective motor pathways in the internal capsule. Therefore, intraoperative loss of MEPs can be used to predict postoperative motor deficits.

### Stroke vision, aphasia, neglect (VAN) assessment-a novel emergent large vessel occlusion screening tool: pilot study and comparison with current clinical severity indices [^1171DhJ2]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Performing the VAN examination

The initial and sine qua non of the VAN examination is to conduct a motor weakness assessment (table 1). Patients are asked to raise both arms up and hold them up for 10 s. If the patient has mild drift, severe weakness, or paralysis, the assessment continues. In their absence, the patient is VAN negative and the assessment ends.

If weakness (mild drift, severe weakness, or paralysis) is observed, the VAN assessments are carried out (table 1). If the patient has weakness and any other positive finding among the vision, aphasia, or neglect category, they are considered VAN positive. While forced gaze to one side might be considered a visual finding among users, we included it within the neglect category. Table 2 compares elements of the VAN ELVO screening with others that have been published.

Table 2
Comparison of aspect of the vision, aphasia, neglect emergent large vessel occlusion screening with other screening tools

Analysis

The VAN status of patient was used to compare sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy to CTA confirmed ELVO. The same analysis was done using the new guideline recommended (NIHSS of 6). ELVO was defined as thromboembolic occlusion of an M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), internal carotid artery, basilar artery, or M2 segment for which embolectomy was considered.

### BE-FAST (balance, eyes, face, arm, speech, time): reducing the proportion of strokes missed using the FAST mnemonic [^112G9PLX]. Stroke (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The FAST algorithm (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) helps identify persons having an acute stroke. We determined the proportion of patients with acute ischemic stroke not captured by FAST and evaluated a revised mnemonic.

Methods

Records of all patients admitted to the University of Kentucky Stroke Center between January and December 2014 with a discharge International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code for acute ischemic stroke were reviewed. Those misclassified, having missing National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale data, or were comatose or intubated were excluded. Presenting symptoms, demographics, and examination findings based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale data were abstracted.

Results

Of 858 consecutive records identified, 736 met inclusion criteria; 14.1% did not have any FAST symptoms at presentation. Of these, 42% had gait imbalance or leg weakness, 40% visual symptoms, and 70% either symptom. With their addition, the proportion of stroke patients not identified was reduced to 4.4% (P < 0.0001). In a sensitivity analysis, if face weakness, arm weakness, or speech impairment on admission examination were considered in addition to a history of FAST symptoms, the proportion missed was reduced to 9.9% (P = 0.0010). The proportion of stroke patients not identified was also reduced (2.6%) with the addition of a history of gait imbalance/leg weakness or visual symptoms (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Of patients with ischemic stroke with deficits potentially amenable to acute intervention, 14% are not identified using FAST. The inclusion of gait/leg and visual symptoms leads to a reduction in missed strokes. If validated in a prospective study, a revision of public educational programs may be warranted.

### Can combined bypass surgery at middle cerebral artery territory save anterior cerebral artery territory in adult moyamoya disease? [^111aHVPs]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with moyamoya disease are frequently encountered with improved symptoms related to anterior cerebral artery territory (ACAt) and middle cerebral artery territory (MCAt) after bypass surgery at MCAt.

Objective

To evaluate hemodynamic changes in MCAt and ACAt after bypass surgery in adult moyamoya disease.

Methods

Combined bypass surgery was performed on 140 hemispheres in 126 patients with MCAt symptoms. Among them, 87 hemispheres (62.1%) accompanied preoperative ACAt symptoms. Clinical, hemodynamic, and angiographic states were evaluated preoperatively and approximately 6 months after surgery.

Results

Preoperative symptoms resolved in 127 MCAt (90.7%) and 82 ACAt (94.3%). Hemodynamic analysis of total patients showed a significant improvement in MCAt basal perfusion and reservoir capacity (P < .001 and P = 0.002, respectively) and ACAt basal perfusion (P = 0.001). In a subgroup analysis, 82 hemispheres that completely recovered from preoperative ACAt symptoms showed a significant improvement in MCAt basal perfusion and reservoir capacity (P < .001 and P = 0.05, respectively) and ACAt basal perfusion (P = 0.04). Meanwhile, 53 hemispheres that had never experienced ACAt symptoms significantly improved MCAt basal perfusion and reservoir capacity (P < .001 and P = 0.05, respectively); however, no ACAt changes were observed. A qualitative angiographic analysis demonstrated a higher trend of leptomeningeal formation from MCAt to ACAt in the former subgroup (P = 0.05). During follow-up, no ACAt infarctions were observed.

Conclusion

Combined bypass surgery at MCAt resulted in hemodynamic improvements in ACAt and MCAt, especially in patients with preoperative ACAt symptoms.

### Rare case of duplicated middle cerebral artery and acute ischaemic stroke managed successfully with mechanical thrombectomy [^1172nhnY]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A man in his early 80s presented with acute onset aphasia and right-sided weakness with an NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 17. He was last seen normal 9hours before the presentation. MRI of the brain showed acute infarcts in the left caudate, lentiform nucleus and corona radiata. MRI angiogram (MRA) revealed an occluded left main middle cerebral artery (MCA) and an associated ipsilateral patent duplicated middle cerebral artery (DMCA). Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was performed, and he was discharged with an NIHSS of 8. In this report, we review and discuss the challenges during the intervention of MCA occlusion in the presence of duplicated MCA, a rare anomaly.

### Alien limb following posterior cerebral artery stroke: failure to recognize internally generated movements? [^1135t5yx]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

We describe two rare cases of alien limb syndrome following right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. Both patients present with left hemianopia, visual neglect and proprioceptive loss in addition to their alien limb symptoms. Lesion subtraction from seven control PCA patients revealed that medial parietal-occipital and thalamic areas were selectively damaged in the alien limb patients. We propose that loss of the sense of motor intention and internal model of the current state of the arm, combined with deficient proprioceptive and visual feedback of the moving limb, are critical for genesis of posterior alien limb and discuss how affected regions normally function to ensure awareness of self-generated motor activity.

### Sensory retraining of the leg after stroke: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117QLHMU]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Somatosensory impairment is common after stroke, occurring in up to 89% of stroke survivors. Proprioception and tactile somatosensation are more impaired in the leg than in the arm post stroke, with the frequency increasing with increasing level of weakness and stroke severity. Leg somatosensory impairment also has a significant impact on independence in daily activitiesand activity participation in stroke survivors, as well as predicts longer hospital stays and lower frequency of home discharges.

Leg somatosensory impairment negatively influences balance and gait. Post-stroke plantar tactile deficits correlate with lower balance scores and greater postural sway in standing. Tactile and proprioceptive feedback provide critical information about weight borne through the limb. Accordingly, tactile and proprioceptive somatosensory deficits may hinder paretic limb load detection ability, potentially leading to reduced weight-bearing and contributing to balance impairment and falls post stroke. Indeed, stroke survivors with somatosensory impairment have a higher falls incidence compared to those without somatosensory impairment. In addition to reduced balance, impaired load detection may also contribute to gait asymmetry, particularly in the push-off phase. In addition, leg proprioception influences variance in stride length, gait velocity, and walking endurance in stroke survivors. In fact, leg somatosensory impairment has been shown to be the third most important independent factor for reduced gait velocity in stroke survivors.

Two systematic reviews have previously investigated the effects of interventions for retraining somatosensory function after stroke. In the first review, published more than a decade ago, only four of the 14 included studies targeted the leg, while the second only included studies of the arm. Nevertheless, both reviews reported that there were insufficient data to determine the effectiveness of these interventions. A third systematic review evaluating the effectiveness of proprioceptive trainingonly included 16 studies with stroke-specific populations, of which only two specifically addressed the leg. From these three reviews, the effects of interventions for post-stroke leg somatosensory impairment remain unclear. In addition, the first reviewwas critiqued for including studies with participants without somatosensory impairment, and that did not report somatosensory outcomes. Therefore, a targeted systematic review, addressing the limitations of previous reviews, is required to elucidate the effects of interventions for post-stroke leg somatosensory impairment.

It is of interest to clinicians and researchers to evaluate the effects of leg somatosensory retraining on factors that may ultimately influence activity and participation, as this could change practice. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to examine the effects of post-stroke leg somatosensory retraining on somatosensory impairment, balance, gait, motor impairment, and leg function.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116gRRgj]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association stroke rehabilitation — ataxia features and management note that ataxia is present in 68% to 86% of patients with brainstem stroke, and ataxia without concurrent hemiparesis has a better prognosis for functional recovery in acute rehabilitation; however, the presence of ataxia with or without weakness does not affect general functional recovery negatively. Ataxia can affect the quality of use of the functional hand negatively because patients with cerebellar lesions can have impaired motor learning, yet case studies indicate that intensive task-oriented therapy may improve motor performance and actual use of ataxic limbs in patients with stroke-related ataxia. For rehabilitation, postural training and task-oriented therapy may be considered for rehabilitation of ataxia (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C).

### Early thrombectomy protects the internal capsule in patients with proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion [^1155V8ag]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions impede blood flow to the noncollateralized lenticulostriate artery territory. Previous work has shown that this almost inevitably leads to infarction of the dependent gray matter territories in the striate even if perfusion is restored by mechanical thrombectomy. Purpose of this analysis was to evaluate potential sparing of neighboring fiber tracts, ie, the internal capsule.

Methods

An observational single-center study of patients with proximal MCA occlusions treated with mechanical thrombectomy and receiving postinterventional high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging was conducted. Patients were classified according to internal capsule ischemia (IC+ versus IC-) at the postero-superior level of the MCA lenticulostriate artery territory (corticospinal tract correlate). Associations of IC+ versus IC- with baseline variables as well as its clinical impact were evaluated using multivariable logistic or linear regression analyses adjusting for potential confounders.

Results

Of 92 included patients with proximal MCA territory infarctions, 45 (48.9%) had an IC+ pattern. Longer time from symptom-onset to groin-puncture (adjusted odds ratio, 2.12 [95% CI, 1.19–3.76] per hour), female sex and more severe strokes were associated with IC+. Patients with IC+ had lower rates of substantial neurological improvement and functional independence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.09–0.81] and adjusted odds ratio, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.07–0.86]) after adjustment for confounders. These associations remained unchanged when confining analyses to patients without ischemia in the corona radiata or the motor cortex and here, IC+ was associated with higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale motor item scores (β, +2.8 [95% CI, 1.5 to 4.1]) without a significant increase in nonmotor items (β, +0.8 [95% CI, -0.2 to 1.9).

Conclusions

Rapid mechanical thrombectomy with successful reperfusion of the lenticulostriate arteries often protects the internal capsule from subsequent ischemia despite early basal ganglia damage. Salvage of this eloquent white matter tract within the MCA lenticulostriate artery territory seems strongly time-dependent, which has clinical and pathophysiological implications.

### Association between optic disc pallor and lacunar stroke [^1146cZMr]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Stroke classification

Clinical

A stroke physician (author FD) examined all patients and assessed stroke severity using the NIH Stroke Scale. The stroke clinical syndrome was classified as either lacunar or cortical based on the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification. Briefly, cortical stroke was defined as a partial anterior circulation stroke syndrome or, if in the posterior circulation, visual field loss. Lacunar stroke was defined by pure motor weakness and/or sensory loss in the face and arm, arm and leg, or all three, as well as ataxic hemiparesis or clumsy hand dysarthria syndrome.

Radiological

A consultant neuroradiologist (author JW) identified and located acute ischaemic stroke lesions (low signal on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map, high signal on diffusion imaging), old ischaemic stroke lesions (high/low FLAIR signal, high T2 signal, no signal on diffusion imaging/ADC map) and old haemorrhages (low gradient-echo signal). Lacunar infarcts were defined as acute ischaemic lesions, round and under 2 cm in the centrum semiovale, internal capsule, brainstem or basal ganglia. Cortical lesions were defined as acute ischaemic lesions affecting cortical and adjacent subcortical tissue in a known cortical arterial branch territory, including striatocapsular infarcts (> 2 cm diameter in the basal ganglia). Clinical ratings were combined with MRI-based measures (whether the recent infarct was cortical or lacunar) to produce a final stroke subtype classification. Where the two differed, the radiological classification was preferred.

Total SVD score

Total SVD score (ordinal score of 0–4) was calculated according to Staal's (2014) method, whereby one point was allocated for each of four MRI features of SVD: presence of lacunes, presence of microbleeds, moderate to severe enlarged perivascular spaces (grades 2–4) and WMHs (Fazekas score 2 or 3 for deep WMH and Fazekas score 3 for WMH extending into deep white matter).

### Isolated middle cerebral artery disease: clinical and neuroradiological features depending on the pathogenesis [^111JWwmR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery (MCA) disease is often difficult to differentiate from cardioembolic disease if intracranial atherosclerosis coexists with cardiac disease.

Objectives

To evaluate whether clinical and neuroradiological features of isolated MCA disease differ according to the underlying aetiology.

Methods

Isolated MCA disease was defined as a unilateral angiographically occlusive lesion of the MCA on the symptomatic side without lesions of other intracranial or extracranial vessels. Patients with isolated MCA disease were divided into atherosclerotic and potentially cardioembolic, and the clinical, laboratory, and neuroradiological data analysed.

Results

Among the 850 consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack, 107 (12.6%) met the criteria for isolated MCA disease (76 with atherosclerotic disease and 31 with a potential source of cardiac embolism). Total anterior circulation infarcts were more common and baseline NIHSS score was higher in potentially embolic occlusions than in atherosclerotic disease (each p < 0.001). While cortical infarcts and territorial infarcts were more common in the potential embolism group (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively), subcortical border zone infarcts were more common in the atherosclerotic group (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that border zone infarcts and mild stroke were independently associated with atherosclerotic MCA disease, while territorial and cortical infarcts were associated with potential cardiac embolic disease.

Conclusions

Clinical and neuroradiological characteristics can differentiate isolated atherosclerotic MCA disease from MCA disease associated with potential sources of cardiac embolism, and may reflect the differences in underlying pathogenesis.

### Management of acute ischemic stroke [^1126RanH]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cerebral Edema

Large infarcts of the MCA or ICA are associated with high morbidity rates of up to 80%. Patients with large hemispheric infarcts (LHIs) are at increased risk of cerebral edema and fast neurologic deterioration that led to the term "malignant MCA infarction"(MMI). Hypodensity seen in more than 50% of the MCA territory (Fig. 2 B) or an infarct volume of greater than 145 cc within 14 hours of ictus are the most reliable predictors for a malignant course with increased intracranial pressure, herniation, and need for decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC). The ultimate intervention to alleviate increased intracranial pressure and avoid herniation in LHI with significant edema is surgical decompression with DHC. Three European clinical trials assessed the benefit of DHC in patients 60 years and younger. A pooled analysis of these trials showed that DHC does not only reduce mortality by 50% but also improve long-term functional outcome. The NNT to avoid a death is 2 (mRS = 6), whereas the NNT to avoid death and the most severe to moderately severe disability is 4 (mRS = 4–6). The proportion of patients alive with minimal-to-moderate disability (mRS = 0–3) was increased from 21% to 43%. Viewed another way, DHC resulted in a 49% absolute risk reduction in death, and an absolute increase in the proportion of patients rated as mRS = 2 of 12%, mRS = 3 of 10%, and mRS = 4 of 29%.

The DEcompressive Surgery for the Treatment of malignant INfarction of the middle cerebral arterY (DESTINY-II) clinical trial assessed the outcome of DHC in patients older than 60. It demonstrated that DHC increases the probability of survival, but most survivors had significant disabilities (mRS = 4–5). In all these trials, DHC was performed within 48 hours, and currently, there is no indication for a "wait and see strategy" (e.g. waiting for neurologic deterioration or radiographic midline shift). However, the ideal timing of DHC is still unclear and more data including standardized medical management are necessary. Furthermore, it remains debatable what the definition of a favorable functional outcome is and what degree of disability is regarded as acceptable. Additional surgical interventions that may be entertained in critically ill AIS patients are external ventricular drainage for the management of hydrocephalous and suboccipital craniectomy for posterior fossa/cerebellar infarcts with life-threatening cerebral edema.

Neuroimaging prognostication by CT and MRI in large hemispheric infarction — A hypodensity covering > 50% of the MCA territory had an 85% positive predictive value for fatal clinical outcome, with a sensitivity and specificity of 61 and 94%, respectively; infarct volume > 220 mL and midline shift > 3.9 mm were also predictive of malignant infarction. For MRI, an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of < 80% and volume of > 82 mL within 6 h of symptoms onset was predictive with a sensitivity and specificity of 87 and 91%, respectively; reported DWI thresholds included > 82 ml, 145 ml, and > 177 ml, with volumes greater than 145 mL more likely to require hemicraniectomy. We recommend using early changes on CT and MRI to predict malignant edema after LHI (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Updated Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines for management of extracranial carotid disease [^114a958H]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Extracranial carotid disease — imaging indications in neurologically symptomatic patients: Typical carotid territory ischemic symptoms include contralateral weakness of the face, arm, or leg, or both; contralateral sensory deficit or paresthesia of the face, arm, or leg, or both; or transient ipsilateral blindness (amaurosis fugax). Given the incidence of significant carotid stenosis in patients who present with stroke and the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in reducing stroke in symptomatic patients with > 50% carotid stenosis, it is important to evaluate the carotid bifurcation in every patient with symptoms of a carotid territory ischemia. Amaurosis fugax or the finding of a Hollenhorst plaque is correlated with the presence of significant carotid bifurcation stenosis, but neither amaurosis fugax nor identification of a Hollenhorst plaque are associated with the same stroke risk as transient cerebral ischemia. ACAS and ACST found that CEA was effective in reducing stroke risk in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis > 60%, and neurologically symptomatic patients and neurologically asymptomatic patients at high risk for harboring a carotid stenosis of ≥ 60% would be candidates for carotid bifurcation imaging.

### Management of cerebral 4-vessel disease with anterior circulation symptoms by stenting both vertebral arteries at the same session [^116GtE7X]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Stroke is among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The coexistence of bilateral carotid and vertebral artery (VA) occlusion and/or stenosis is in the very rare entity group in the literature. Here, we present a case with bilateral carotid artery occlusion and bilateral VA stenosis, who presented with an atypical clinical presentation and underwent bilateral vertebral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting in the same session.

Case Report

A 67yearold male patient was brought to the emergency department with complaints of inability to speak and weakness in both legs for 1 day. There were bilateral infarct areas in the anterior cerebral artery region and an additional infarct area in the left middle cerebral artery region. First, the right VA stenosis level was crossed using a 0.14 guidewire. After PTA, balloon-expandable stenting was performed with a 3.0×12mm NC (non-compliant) balloon, and nearly complete recanalization was observed. Therefore, it was decided to perform an intervention on the left VA in the same session.

Conclusion

As in this example case, in cases where cerebral perfusion is severely impaired, medical treatment after recanalization may be one of the best treatment options.

Clinical Impact

The carotid arteries are the main arteries supplying the anterior circulation, and the vertebral arteries supply blood to the posterior circulation. However, in cases where both carotid arteries are occluded/dysfunctional, all cerebral perfusion remains over the vertebrobasilar system. However, in cases such as this, where both carotid arteries are occluded/dysfunctional, all cerebral perfusion remains over the vertebrobasilar system and may be responsible for anterior circulation strokes. The situation becomes more severe if both vertebral artery critical stenosis is added. Synchronous carotid and vertebral artery revascularization is not recommended in the guidelines for patients with combined carotid and vertebral artery disease. In patients with four-vessel occlusion/stenosis, as in this particular case, the intervention method and priorities are unclear. We achieved a favorable clinical outcome with simultaneous bilateral vertebral artery angioplasty and stenting, a hazardous method that can be a guide as an approach option in similar cases.

### Somatotopic organization of motor fibers in the corona radiata in monoparetic patients with small subcortical infarct [^115igGhX]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The somatotopic organization of the corticospinal fibers is of importance because it is related to certain stroke syndromes. Although it has been suggested that motor fibers are somatotopically arranged in the corona radiata, the evidence is still insufficient in human.

Methods

The relative anteroposterior and mediolateral location of the lesions was measured on T2-weighted MRI in 28 patients who developed isolated motor deficit limited to the arm, leg, or bulbofacial muscles after a small corona radiata infarct.

Results

The location of the lesions associated with bulbofacial, arm, and leg paresis showed anterolateral-to-posteromedial distribution.

Conclusions

The results suggest that motor fibers subserving the bulbofacial, arm, and leg muscles are somatotopically arranged at the level of the corona radiata.

### Clinical and sonographic patterns of tandem internal carotid artery / middle cerebral artery occlusion in tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients [^116vhy9y]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is predictive of thrombus presence but has limited ability to identify occlusion location in the anterior circulation. We describe clinical and sonographic patterns that are associated with tandem internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions.

Methods

Consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients receiving intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) were studied. Pretreatment NIHSS scores and bedside transcranial Doppler (TCD) were obtained for all patients.

Results

A total of 95 patients treated with intravenous TPA at 132 ± 60 minutes from stroke onset were studied. On TCD, 48 had isolated MCA occlusion (mean NIHSS 16.8 ± 5.8, median 17, range 5 to 28); and 16 had tandem ICA/MCA occlusion (mean NIHSS 18.8 ± 5.8, median 22, range 8 to 29; P = NS). In the MCA occlusion and tandem ICA/MCA occlusion groups, 19% and 11%, respectively, had NIHSS scores < 12 points. Compared with the NIHSS scores in patients with hemiplegia, forced gaze deviation, and complete neglect, the lower NIHSS scores were attributable to partial arm and/or leg paresis, gaze preference, and partial neglect. In those patients, TCD showed ≥ 2 major collateral channels and low-resistance flow at the M1 origin, suggesting perfusion of perforating arteries. Although TCD cannot differentiate between high-grade ICA stenosis or occlusion, collateral flow patterns and stenotic signals at the terminal ICA differentiated tandem lesions from isolated MCA occlusion (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Tandem ICA/MCA occlusion was found on TCD in 17% of TPA-treated patients. NIHSS scores were similar in patients with isolated MCA and tandem occlusions. Lower NIHSS scores were seen in patients with a higher number of major collateral flow channels and higher Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia (TIBI) flow grades at the MCA origin.

### Poststroke restless legs syndrome and lesion location: anatomical considerations [^111VgVmv]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Several case studies have reported on restless legs syndrome (RLS) associated with stroke. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and the lesion topography of poststroke RLS. There were 137 patients with ischemic stroke included in this study. The diagnosis of RLS was made 1 month after the index stroke using the criteria established by the International RLS Study Group. All patients enrolled underwent magnetic resonance imaging within 7 days of the onset of the stroke. The prevalence of stroke-related RLS was calculated, and the topography of the associated ischemic lesions was analyzed. Among 137 patients, 17 patients (12.4%) were diagnosed with RLS after a stroke. Stroke-related RLS was found in 10 out of 33 patients with a basal ganglia/corona radiata infarct (30.3%), 1 out of 8 patients with an internal capsular infarct (12.5%), and 1 out of 7 patients with a thalamic infarct (14.3%). In addition, one out of 54 with a cortical lesion with/without subcortical involvement (1.9%), and 4 out of 18 patients with a pontine lesion (22.2%) had RLS. The analysis of the lesions in the cortical and subcortical group showed only 1 patient in the cortical group had stroke-related RLS, whereas 16 in the subcortical group had stroke-related RLS. The results of this study suggest that lesions of the subcortical brain areas such as the pyramidal tract and the basal ganglia-brainstem axis, which are involved in motor functions and sleep-wake cycles, may lead to RLS symptoms in patients after an ischemic stroke.

### Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) as a model of small vessel disease: update on clinical, diagnostic, and management aspects [^111LA6Cj]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Subcortical ischemic events

Transient ischemic attacks and stroke are reported in approximately 85% of symptomatic individuals and are related to cerebral small vessel pathology. Mean age at onset of ischemic episodes is approximately 45–50 years, but the range at onset is broad (3rd to 8th decade).

Ischemic episodes typically present as a classical lacunar syndrome (pure motor stroke, ataxic hemiparesis/dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome, pure sensory stroke, sensorimotor stroke), but other lacunar syndromes (brain stem or hemispheric) are also observed. The total lacunar lesion load, symptomatic and asymptomatic, is strongly associated with the development of severe disability with gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, pseudobulbar palsy and cognitive impairment. Strokes involving the territory of a large artery have occasionally been reported but whether these are co-incidental or related to the CADASIL pathology itself is uncertain. There have been a few cases of subcortical hemorrhage, mostly in patients taking anticoagulants.

### Impact of eloquent motor cortex-tissue reperfusion beyond the traditional thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) scoring after thrombectomy [^112y7eqY]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Eloquent motor cortex reperfusion assessment

Neuroangiographic imaging before and after EVT was available for all included patients. Eloquent motor cortex angiographic reperfusion assessment was performed by two independent readers who were blinded to functional outcome, followed by consensus adjudication. Lateral projection angiography was used to identify the central (Rolandic) arterial region corresponding to PMC location within the cerebral hemisphere. Antegrade perfusion in distal cortical branches was evaluated, irrelevant of proximal anatomic features and variations. Eloquent reperfusion (ER) was defined as presence of antegrade flow on final digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within four main cortical branches, supplying the PMC (MCA – precentral, central (aka Rolandic), postcentral (aka anterior parietal); anterior cerebral artery (ACA) – medial frontal branch arising from callosomarginal or pericallosal arteries).ER-PMC grading scale is described in detail in table 1.

### Stroke vision, aphasia, neglect (VAN) assessment-a novel emergent large vessel occlusion screening tool: pilot study and comparison with current clinical severity indices [^113YBzPQ]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrated that VAN is an effective clinical assessment tool by nurses who underwent a 2 h training session to determine the likelihood of a severe stroke caused by an ELVO. VAN captured all patients that were considered for embolectomy (100% sensitivity) and only five VAN positive patients were found to not harbor an ELVO (90% specificity) with 80% (4/5) being stroke mimics. Furthermore, VAN was easily taught and adopted by nurses in our emergency room and outperformed an NIHSS threshold used by physicians in the emergency room. Because the decay in the treatment effect of embolectomy is profound, earlier treatment is much better, and the ability to use VAN for either pre-hospital or in-hospital triage may be critical to improving ELVO outcome.

While we used VAN as a screening tool in our emergency room we would like to see it used as a prehospital triage tool for ELVO, similar to the way the 3I-SS, LAMS, RACE, LEGS, and severe hemiparesisscreening tools have been tested and utilized (table 4). Derived from predictive items within the NIHSS, RACE, not surprisingly, had a similar ability to identify an LVO as the NIHSS. However, in common with the NIHSS, it may be both too cumbersome to administer in the field and have imperfect accuracy. While much easier to employ and also predictive of LVO, LAMSand 3I-SShave been criticized because they may not assess those cortical deficits most predictive of LVO: LAMSbecause too few cortical signs are tested and 3I-SSbecause it was not derived from the NIHSS 15. The severe hemiparesis score may have value in the field but this was a small and select cohort of patients that only had this severe hemiparesis so it may not be applicable to all stroke comers. VAN, like 3I-SS, is not completely derived from the NIHSS but does test more cortical functions than both the 3I-SS and LAMS yet retains ease of use. Like LAMS, severe hemiparesis, and 3I-SS, it puts motor deficit as the central feature but only makes you assess cortical symptoms if weakness exists, unlike RACE, LEGS, and CPSSS, which force the user to conduct an entire examination every time. In our study, 30% of stroke codes had no focal motor weakness and the VAN screen took only 15 s. VAN is currently being evaluated by emergency medical services in the field in another small pilot study. Larger numbers as well as interobserver reliability of emergency medical services with nurses and physicians is needed.

### The paradoxical relationship of sensorimotor deficit and lesion volume in acute ischemic stroke [^1123E42a]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The role of edema progression in the mouse AIS model

The development of ischemic lesions is always associated with cerebral edema. The swelling is more pronounced in patients with successful recanalization because the restoration of active blood flow is accompanied by ion and water entry through the damaged capillary walls into the brain. The development of brain edema typically peaks on day 3–4 and has been shown to increase the mortality rate of MCA territory strokes by 80%, as the initial swelling progresses to space-occupying edema. The most severe form of brain edema following AIS involving the entire MCA territory is called malignant MCA infarction, which is known to have devastating effects on patients because of the compression of surrounding tissue, possible herniation, and death in one-fifth of patients within the first week. Cerebral edema is now the subject of intense research in animal models. Since focal brain edema exerts compression on the surrounding tissue and expands the size of the lesion, the volume of edema, and the volume of the edema-free infarcted regions can be calculated for accurate tracking of infarct size. We chose to use edema correction according to a reproducible method used to estimate brain swelling in rodents. Although large lesional swelling volume has been found to predict poor outcome in patients with hemispheric stroke, edema alone does not account for the deficits observed in our study. However, edema progression greatly masked LV and hindered the accurate estimation of stroke size in our model.

### Lacunar stroke is the major cause of progressive motor deficits [^114Xgq3t]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Severe motor deficits are the predominant cause of long-term disability in stroke patients. In particular, progressive hemiparesis in the initial stage after stroke onset is frequently devastating. Therefore, we attempted to define the population at risk with respect to the presumed pathogenesis.

Methods

Among 941 stroke patients hospitalized during a 3-year period, 92 patients (41 men, 51 women; mean age, 68 years) had a severe motor deficit (< 25 of 42 points on the 7 motor items of the European Stroke Scale) resulting from brain infarcts. Risk factors, neurological examinations, comprehensive diagnostic tests, and therapy were documented. The study population was separated into patients with (group A) and without (group B) progressive motor deficits. Progression was defined as a further decrease of at least 5 points on the initial European Stroke Scale motor score during the first 5 days after stroke onset.

Results

Of the 92 patients, 23.9% had significant worsening of motor function with a decrease in the mean European Stroke Scale motor score from 20.3 to 12.9 points (P < 0.01). Infarcts in group A patients were subcortical in 59.1%, whereas most infarcts were cortical in group B (61.4%, P < 0.05). Progressive hemiparesis was also significantly associated with lacunar stroke (group A: 59.1%; group B, 24.3%; P < 0.01). With regard to risk factors, diagnostic studies, and neuroimaging, small-vessel disease was the predominant presumed cause of stroke in group A (63.6%, P < 0.01), whereas infarcts in group B patients were frequently caused by embolism from cardiac or undetermined sources (61.4%, P < 0.01). Prevalence of high-grade carotid stenosis was not significantly different between groups A and B; however, subtotal stenoses and complete internal carotid artery occlusions were found only among patients without progressive motor deficits.

Conclusions

Lacunar stroke caused by small-vessel disease is the major cause of progressive motor deficits, probably because of stepwise occlusion of the branches of small penetrating arteries.

### Stroke in an adult with HIV infection due to carotid artery stenosis successfully treated with steroids: HIV-associated arteritis? [^115bVzzf]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

A 33-year-old Caucasian man with a 17-year history of HIV infection developed sudden right-sided hemiplegia, with the arm more affected than the leg, and aphasia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed hemodynamic watershed stroke between the anterior and middle cerebral artery territories and an ischemic stroke within the left posterior middle cerebral artery territory. Color-coded Duplex sonography and Doppler sonography revealed hypoechogenic stenosis of the left common carotid artery, the left internal carotid artery, left external carotid artery and right internal carotid artery. An extensive diagnostic workup led us to hypothesize that HIV-associated arteritis was the cause of the stroke, and following intravenous steroid therapy, the carotid artery stenoses vanished.

### Early thrombectomy protects the internal capsule in patients with proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion [^111gWBWS]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Impact of Salvaging the IC

IC+ patients had more putaminal hemorrhages (55.6% versus 17%, P < 0.001, Table 2), and NIHSS scores on the day of discharge or day 7 were higher (median 7 versus 3, P < 0.001). Moreover, patients with IC+ tended to have lower rates of substantial neurological improvement (45.5% versus 67.4%, P = 0.055) and achieving functional independence on discharge or day 90 was less likely (26.8% versus 55.6%; P = 0.009 and 55.6% versus 91.2%; P < 0.001). For these end points, associations remained statistically significant, when adjusting for potential confounders including age, admission NIHSS, intravenous thrombolysis, reperfusion grade, and final infarct volume (aOR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.09–0.81]; aOR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.07–0.86]; and aOR, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.03–0.89], respectively).

Tissue and Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Strata of IC+ Versus IC− Pattern

To increase the specificity for evaluating the effect of IC+, we confined a subanalysis to cases without white matter tract involvement of the internal capsule above the level of the striatocapsular region and/or ischemic lesions within the motorcortex. In this subgroup (n = 51, 23 IC+, 28 IC−), IC− patients had lower NIHSS scores on the day of discharge (median 1 versus 7, P < 0.001). The lower NIHSS scores were mainly attributable to lower score on the motor items (median motor sum 0 versus 4, median facial: 0 versus 1, P < 0.001, arm: 0 versus 2, P < 0.001 and leg: 0 versus 1, P < 0.001). These differences remained significant on linear regression analyses after adjusting for the same clinical covariates used for the binary logistic regression model about the main clinical outcomes (Table I in the).

### Pathological laughter as a symptom of middle cerebral artery stroke [^113J4JWB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pathological laughter is defined as uncontrollable and inappropriate laughter unrelated to an emotion or a mood. This symptom can reveal a stroke.

Case Report

We described the case of a 57-year-old patient who presented to the emergency department 2 h after a sudden onset of left hemiparesis preceded by pathological laughter. The left motor weakness was very discrete and underestimated because of severe behavioral changes, that is, laughter, joviality, and motor restlessness. Despite abnormal brain imaging results, symptoms were considered as atypical to evoke a stroke. The patient did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging performed 2 days after admission confirmed the diagnosis of stroke. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians are at the forefront of stroke management. They should be aware that the initial symptom of a stroke can be atypical and lead to misunderstanding the diagnosis. Because the treatment of stroke requires the fastest care, it is important for emergency physicians to know that sudden behavioral troubles and pathological laughter can reveal strokes.

Vignette F: ischaemic stroke with concurrent pulmonary embolism

A 58-year-old male (Patient 27), previously independent in a high-risk occupation for developing COVID-19, presented with acute onset aphasia and dense right-sided weakness. This was preceded by a 2-day history of lethargy and cough. He was found to be drowsy and unresponsive. Brain CT confirmed a proximal middle cerebral artery thrombus and territorial infarct (Fig. 4A–D) with local mass effect. He was transferred to a specialist hospital due to risk of vasogenic oedema leading to malignant middle cerebral artery syndrome. Due to the degree of established infarction neither intravenous thrombolysis nor mechanical thrombectomy were appropriate. CT angiogram also showed a saddle pulmonary embolism, which was managed conservatively with split dose low molecular weight heparin. His condition was critical in the hyperacute period with fluctuating level of consciousness and tachycardia, but stabilized. His D-dimer was in excess of 80 000 µg/l on admission but reduced to 2800 µg/l after 7 days of anticoagulation. Lupus anticoagulant was positive. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation unit on Day 8.

Discussion

This study shows 4 major findings. First, endovascular reperfusion may salvage the internal capsule at the level supplied by the MCA lenticulostriate arteries despite ischemia in the putamen and the caudate nucleus, providing further evidence for higher ischemic resistance of white matter within this area. Second, salvage of the capsule is clearly time-dependent, most likely reflecting the noncollateralized end artery supply in this territory. Third, putaminal hemorrhage may be associated with internal capsule infarction potentially because both phenomena are related to prolonged and/or more severe ischemia and hence, more severe tissue damage. Fourth, protection of the internal capsule was associated with a clinical benefit (ie, mainly of motor functions) in patients with and without ischemia above the level of the basal ganglia.

Multiple studies suggested that infarct growth is distinctly different between cerebral gray and white matter, because ischemic tolerance is higher in white matter.– Correspondingly, white matter tracts may be protected from ischemia by early reperfusion, despite gray matter ischemia in the same territory. In this study, we specifically examined, if these associations are also tangible in the noncollateralized proximal MCA territory. For this purpose, we evaluated infarction of the internal capsule at the posterosuperior lenticulostriate artery territory encompassing the corticospinal tract. While there is some heterogeneity regarding the supply of the posterior limb of the internal capsule at different levels, the entire anteroposterior length of the upper part of the internal capsule is supplied by the lateral and intermediate groups of lenticulostriate arteries arising from the middle cerebral artery.– As repeatedly reported by microstructural cadaver studies, there are no or very few anastomoses between the different lenticulostriate artery groups. Specifically, Rosner et aldid not observe a single anastomose between the lateral lenticulostriate arteries and any other group of perforating arteries studied in 50 cadaver hemispheres. Correspondingly, we found a strong time-dependency of the IC+ pattern corroborating findings that the proximal MCA territory is not or at best poorly collateralized. We also found no impact of collateral status; however, this analysis was confined to a subset of patients only. In contrast to deep gray matter structures, which showed signs of ischemia in all included patients and have been reported to almost exclusively undergo infarction despite early reperfusion, nearly half of the patients did not show signs of IC ischemia on postinterventional DWI. Nevertheless, the predicted probabilities of IC+ were > 80% after 5 hours, and the maximum time from symptom-onset to lenticulostriate artery reperfusion observed in a patient with an IC− pattern was 325 minutes. Of course, this does not imply that thrombectomy is not beneficial beyond this time window in patients with proximal occlusions; however, its benefit may be reduced and may potentially be more time-dependent. It is important to stress that the reported observations are of mere qualitative nature and dichotomization may not adequately reflect gradually changing damage of the corticospinal tract over time. This may also explain why IC+ ischemia patients showed significant heterogeneity concerning their neurological deficits (interquartile range of NIHSS day 7/discharge 4–13). Another explanation for this heterogeneity may be pervious thrombi allowing residual flow through macroscopically occluding thrombi, which has been associated with good outcomes.
