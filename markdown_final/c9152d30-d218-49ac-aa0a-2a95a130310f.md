## Question

My patient states he had sex with a random girl. He states he received oral sex from her without a condom and then had sex with her with a condom. He wants to know the chances of getting a std from oral sex

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk of sexually transmitted infections from receiving unprotected oral sex and how to counsel and test accordingly. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which STIs are actually transmissible via receptive oral sex. Then, I should verify the relative risk compared with other sexual exposures, especially for HIV. Next, I will examine how condom use for vaginal sex modifies overall risk. After that, I need to consider partner-specific and exposure-specific modifiers that could increase risk. Then, I should translate this into practical counseling and screening recommendations, including whether post-exposure prophylaxis is appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, balanced bottom line the patient can act on, making sure I double-check any numeric estimates I cite along the way.

> Let me first confirm which infections are relevant here. Receiving fellatio without a condom can transmit gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, and HPV, and in principle hepatitis B, whereas chlamydia is less commonly transmitted via the oropharynx and is not a major oral-sex pathogen in this context, and HIV transmission via receptive oral sex is possible but the risk is very low compared with vaginal or anal intercourse [^11652TaU] [^115eto9o] [^115eto9o] [^117CpQMP] [^114QnuxF].

> Wait, let me verify the HIV risk estimate before I anchor on it. I initially thought the per-act risk for receptive oral sex might be around 0.04%, but hold on, I should double-check that because most authoritative summaries describe the risk as "low" without a precise point estimate due to sparse events. The CDC's 2025 nPEP guidance lists oral–genital contact as low risk and does not recommend routine nPEP for oral exposure absent complicating factors, and a systematic review places oral sex risks far below vaginal and anal intercourse, reinforcing that the absolute risk is very low even if not zero [^114QnuxF] [^111woxDn] [^112uRjYb].

> Next, I should review the bacterial STI risks that are more salient here. Pharyngeal gonorrhea is common and silent, and the oropharynx can serve as a reservoir for urethral infection; case-control data suggest a meaningful proportion of symptomatic urethritis in MSM is attributable to oropharyngeal exposure, and surveillance has documented syphilis acquisition via oral sex alone, so I need to ensure we do not understate these risks even though they are not as high as for penetrative vaginal or anal sex [^112DAQLc] [^111gVide] [^112QnzDG].

> I will now examine how condom-protected vaginal sex changes the overall risk picture. Condoms substantially reduce transmission of HIV and bacterial STIs during penetrative sex, so using a condom for vaginal intercourse meaningfully lowers cumulative risk from the encounter; however, because the oral exposure was unprotected, the patient remains at risk for oropharyngeally acquired infections that condoms cannot mitigate after the fact, which is why targeted testing is still indicated [^114k3xjC] [^116zuYR6].

> Let me consider exposure modifiers that could shift risk upward. Ejaculation into the mouth, presence of oral or genital ulcers, bleeding gums, or other mucosal trauma, and a partner with known or likely STIs all increase risk; likewise, acute or untreated STIs in the partner can facilitate transmission, and saliva exchange itself may contribute to gonorrhea spread, so I should ask about these specifics to refine counseling and testing decisions [^114QnuxF] [^117DwR6E] [^1122VhKX].

> Now, I should translate this into concrete counseling. I need to explain that receptive oral sex without a condom is not risk-free, with HIV risk being very low but not zero, and with nontrivial risks for gonorrhea, syphilis, HSV, HPV, and possibly hepatitis B; I should emphasize that symptoms may be absent, so testing is warranted even if he feels fine, and I should normalize barrier use for future oral sex with condoms or dental dams to reduce risk [^115eto9o] [^113srGjV].

> Next, I should review testing recommendations. For a heterosexual man with receptive oral exposure, I would test now for gonorrhea and chlamydia at the urethral site, add a pharyngeal swab for gonorrhea given the exposure, and obtain syphilis serology and HIV testing with fourth-generation assays; I should also consider HSV if there are compatible lesions and review hepatitis B immunity and vaccination status, with repeat HIV testing at about 2–4 weeks to capture early infection if initial testing is early after exposure [^11652TaU] [^117CpQMP].

> Hold on, I should verify whether doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis applies here. Current CDC doxyPEP guidance is for MSM and transgender women with recent bacterial STIs or high likelihood of condomless exposure; it is not routinely recommended for heterosexual men after a single oral exposure, so I should not offer doxyPEP in this scenario, though I can explain its evidence base and eligibility for those who fit the target populations [^1153uNyP] [^111nqwby] [^112QQAXE].

> I need to ensure I address HIV post-exposure prophylaxis appropriately. Given that the only exposure was receptive oral sex and there were no complicating factors like trauma or known high viral load partner, nPEP is not routinely recommended; I should document the risk discussion and advise baseline HIV testing now with follow-up, while reinforcing that nPEP is time-sensitive and should be initiated promptly if new high-risk exposures occur or if individual risk factors emerge [^114QnuxF] [^111woxDn].

> Let me reconsider the numeric framing so I do not overstate precision. While I initially considered citing a specific per-act HIV risk for receptive oral sex, the best-supported message is that the risk is very low relative to vaginal or anal sex and that no precise point estimate is available from high-quality data; therefore, I should communicate uncertainty honestly and focus counseling on actionable steps like testing, symptom vigilance, and future barrier use rather than a misleadingly precise number [^114QnuxF] [^112uRjYb].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the patient understands that unprotected receptive oral sex carries a low but real risk of STIs, with HIV risk being very low and bacterial STI risk being low to moderate depending on partner and exposure factors; using a condom for vaginal sex reduced overall risk from that act, but it does not negate the need for STI screening after unprotected oral exposure, so I recommend testing now and again in a few weeks, avoidance of sex until results return, and consistent barrier use going forward, with vaccination and risk-reduction counseling as indicated [^117CpQMP] [^11652TaU] [^114k3xjC].

The risk of acquiring an STI from unprotected receptive oral sex is **low but not zero** [^114QnuxF] [^115eto9o]. The main risks are **gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, HPV, and hepatitis B** [^111gVide] [^117CpQMP]; HIV risk is very low but possible with trauma or high viral load [^114QnuxF] [^111woxDn]. Using condoms for vaginal sex reduces overall risk but does not eliminate oral exposure risks. Testing is recommended 2–4 weeks after exposure for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV, with repeat testing at 3 months; consider HPV and hepatitis B testing if unvaccinated or symptomatic [^notfound]. Advise condoms or dental dams for future oral sex and discuss HPV and hepatitis B vaccination [^113srGjV] [^117CpQMP].

---

## STIs transmissible through receptive oral sex

Several STIs can be transmitted through receptive oral sex, including:

- **Gonorrhea**: Commonly transmitted via oral sex; pharyngeal infections are often asymptomatic [^11652TaU] [^112DAQLc].

- **Syphilis**: Easily transmitted through oral sex; outbreaks have been linked to oral exposure [^111gVide] [^112QnzDG].

- **Herpes simplex virus (HSV)**: HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be transmitted orally, causing oral or genital lesions [^115eto9o].

- **Human papillomavirus (HPV)**: Transmitted via oral sex, associated with oropharyngeal cancers [^115eto9o] [^113344Nn].

- **Hepatitis B**: Transmitted through oral exposure to semen or blood; risk is higher with trauma or mucosal breaks [^117CpQMP].

- **HIV**: Risk is very low but not zero; higher with trauma, mucosal breaks, or high viral load [^114QnuxF] [^112uRjYb].

---

## Estimated risk of STI transmission through receptive oral sex

Quantifying exact risk is difficult because it depends on partner factors, exposure characteristics, and individual susceptibility. However, **general risk estimates** include:

| **Sti** | **Estimated risk through receptive oral sex** |
|-|-|
| Gonorrhea | Moderate; pharyngeal infections are common and often asymptomatic [^111s8o3q] [^117DwR6E] |
| Syphilis | Moderate; oral sex is a well-documented route of transmission [^111gVide] [^112QnzDG] |
| HSV | Moderate; both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be transmitted orally [^notfound] |
| HPV | Moderate; oral HPV is linked to oropharyngeal cancer [^113344Nn] |
| Hepatitis B | Low to moderate; higher with trauma or mucosal breaks [^notfound] |
| HIV | Very low; not zero, especially with trauma or high viral load [^114QnuxF] [^111woxDn] |

---

## Factors influencing risk of STI transmission

Several factors influence **risk of STI transmission** through receptive oral sex:

- **Presence of cuts or sores**: Trauma to oral mucosa increases risk [^111woxDn].

- **Partner's STI status**: Higher risk if partner has active infection or high viral load [^111nuiSd].

- **Ejaculate exposure**: Exposure to semen increases risk compared to saliva alone [^1122VhKX].

- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised individuals have higher risk [^113MCTro].

---

## Impact of condom use during subsequent vaginal sex

Condom use during vaginal sex significantly reduces the risk of STIs such as HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis [^111s8o3q]. However, it does not eliminate the risk of STIs transmitted through oral exposure, as the oral exposure in this scenario was unprotected. Therefore, the overall risk is **reduced but not eliminated** by condom use during vaginal sex [^116Awszn].

---

## Recommended testing and follow-up

Given the exposure, **testing is recommended**:

- **Initial testing**: 2–4 weeks after exposure for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV [^notfound].

- **Follow-up testing**: Repeat at 3 months to detect infections with longer incubation periods (e.g. HIV, hepatitis B) [^notfound].

- **HPV and hepatitis B**: Consider testing if unvaccinated or symptomatic [^11652TaU].

---

## Preventive measures and counseling

Preventive counseling should include:

- **Barrier methods**: Use condoms or dental dams during oral sex to reduce risk [^113srGjV].

- **Vaccination**: HPV and hepatitis B vaccines are recommended [^111mH5sQ] [^117CpQMP].

- **Regular screening**: Routine STI screening is advised for sexually active individuals with multiple partners [^115BxM4q].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The risk of acquiring an STI from unprotected receptive oral sex is **low but not zero** [^111jjABg]. The main concerns are gonorrhea, syphilis, HSV, HPV, and hepatitis B; HIV risk is very low but possible with trauma or high viral load [^115eto9o] [^111woxDn]. Condom use during vaginal sex reduces overall risk but does not eliminate oral exposure risks. Testing at 2–4 weeks and again at 3 months is recommended, and future oral sex should involve barriers or vaccination where applicable [^113TLiK4] [^113srGjV] [^117CpQMP].

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services for persons with HIV — background states that sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), also known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are infections transmitted through penile, vaginal, oral, or anal sexual contact, regardless of the presence of symptoms or signs, and defines STD preventive services for persons with HIV as assessment of behavioral and biological factors that may increase the risk of transmitting HIV or STD; sexual risk-reduction interventions; screening asymptomatic persons for STD pathogens; clinical evaluation (including physical examination and diagnostic testing of persons with STD signs or symptoms); treatment; and partner services; it further notes that STD preventive services are an essential component of HIV prevention because 1) the diagnosis of an STD is an objective biologic marker of unprotected sexual activity that may result in HIV transmission; 2) certain STDs may increase plasma HIV viral load and genital HIV shedding, which may increase the risk of sexual and perinatal HIV transmission; and 3) STD treatment may reduce STD-related morbidity and lower the risk of HIV transmission.

We analysed a cohort of heterosexual HIV- serodiscordant couples with the aim of evaluating the risk of transmission ascribed to unprotected orogenital intercourse. A total of 135 seronegative individuals (110 women and 25 men), whose only risk exposure to HIV was unprotected orogenital sex with their infected partner, registered 210 person-years of follow-up. After an estimated total of over 19,000 unprotected orogenital exposures with the infected partner not a single HIV seroconversion occurred.

Abstinence and Reduction of Number of Sex Partners

Abstinence from oral, vaginal, and anal sex and participating in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with a partner known to be uninfected are prevention approaches to avoid transmission of STIs. For persons who are being treated for an STI (or whose partners are undergoing treatment), counseling that encourages abstinence from sexual intercourse until completion of the entire course of medication is vital for preventing reinfection. A trial conducted among women regarding the effectiveness of counseling messages when patients have cervicitis or vaginal discharge demonstrated that women whose sex partners have used condoms might benefit from a hierarchical message that includes condoms but women without such experience might benefit more from an abstinence-only message. A more comprehensive discussion of abstinence and other sexual practices that can help persons reduce their risk for STIs is available in Contraceptive Technology, 21st Edition.

### Transmission of nonviral sexually transmitted infections and oral sex [^111jjABg]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oral sex is usually considered a lower-risk sexual activity when compared with sex, but it is frequently the cause of sexually transmitted infections (STI). In particular, STI transferred through oral sex might have no visible symptoms, depending on the type of infection.

Aims

The aim of this study is to review the literature about the role of oral sex in the transmission of nonviral STI.

Main Outcome Measures

State-of-the-art information in the area of STI in relation to sexual function and self-care, this last important for development of STI prevention products such as vaginal microbicides. Sexual behaviors assessed focusing on receiving oral sex and giving oral sex.

Methods

A search of the main electronic databases including registers of clinical controlled trials was performed in addition to a hand search of the most relevant Journals. The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, literature review of research articles, and public health department Internet Web sites, for the period of 1945–2011. In addition to searching the Clinical Trials Registry at the US National Institutes of Health, we also used the meta Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

Results

STI affect the mucous membranes both directly and indirectly producing characteristic diagnostic signs and lesions. Daily dental clinical activity needs an appropriate knowledge of any kind of oral lesions-related STI. The reader is offered a practical approach with clinically relevant recommendations that may prove useful in his/her daily practice when dealing with STI.

Conclusions

These data provide a foundation for understanding diverse STI. We advise physicians to be receptive to discuss sexuality issues and provide patients with adequate therapy.

### Estimating per-act HIV transmission risk: a systematic review [^112uRjYb]. AIDS (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Effective HIV prevention programs rely on accurate estimates of the per-act risk of HIV acquisition from sexual and parenteral exposures. We updated the previous risk estimates of HIV acquisition from parenteral, vertical, and sexual exposures, and assessed the modifying effects of factors including condom use, male circumcision, and antiretroviral therapy.

Methods

We conducted literature searches to identify new studies reporting data regarding per-act HIV transmission risk and modifying factors. Of the 7339 abstracts potentially related to per-act HIV transmission risk, three meta-analyses provided pooled per-act transmission risk probabilities and two studies provided data on modifying factors. Of the 8119 abstracts related to modifying factors, 15 relevant articles, including three meta-analyses, were included. We used fixed-effects inverse-variance models on the logarithmic scale to obtain updated estimates of certain transmission risks using data from primary studies, and employed Poisson regression to calculate relative risks with exact 95% confidence intervals for certain modifying factors.

Results

Risk of HIV transmission was greatest for blood transfusion, followed by vertical exposure, sexual exposures, and other parenteral exposures. Sexual exposure risks ranged from low for oral sex to 138 infections per 10,000 exposures for receptive anal intercourse. Estimated risks of HIV acquisition from sexual exposure were attenuated by 99.2% with the dual use of condoms and antiretroviral treatment of the HIV-infected partner.

Conclusion

The risk of HIV acquisition varied widely, and the estimates for receptive anal intercourse increased compared with previous estimates. The risk associated with sexual intercourse was reduced most substantially by the combined use of condoms and antiretroviral treatment of HIV-infected partners.

### Risk of HIV infection attributable to oral sex among men who have sex with men and in the population of men who have sex with men [^111C81dL]. AIDS (2002). Low credibility.

We examined HIV infection and estimated the population-attributable risk percentage (PAR%) for HIV associated fellatio among men who have sex with other men (MSM). Among 239 MSM who practised exclusively fellatio in the past 6 months, 50% had three partners, 98% unprotected; and 28% had an HIV-positive partner; no HIV was detected. PAR%, based on the number of fellatio partners, ranges from 0.10% for one partner to 0.31% for three partners. The risk of HIV attributable to fellatio is extremely low.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^113srGjV]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Box 7-C — important topics when informing persons with HIV about how to prevent transmission of HIV to others — highlights topics related to sexual transmission, including communicating with partners to foster healthy sexuality. Methods that HIV-discordant couples can use to reduce the risk of sexual HIV transmission include using latex and polyurethane male and female condoms: negotiating with partner to use; reminders to use; correct and consistent use, using dental dams or other physical barriers while having oral-vaginal or oral-rectal sex, and using sexual positioning that lowers a partner's risk of acquiring HIV (order from lowest to highest risk: insertive fellatio, receptive fellatio, insertive penile-vaginal sex, receptive penile-vaginal sex, insertive anal sex, receptive anal sex). Additional measures include avoiding sexual intercourse with HIV-infected persons after invasive anal or genital procedures until healing is complete; or when anal or genital bleeding, inflammation, or trauma may be present (e.g., if infected with STD or when using irritating sexual aids), using only water-based spermicides and lubricants that do not contain nonoxynol-9, and reducing the number of sex partners. Risk discussions also include the presence of symptomatic or asymptomatic STD in HIV-uninfected partners, which may increase their risk of acquiring HIV and may indicate a substantial risk for HIV that is a clinical indication for PrEP, evidence that male circumcision may reduce a man's risk of acquiring HIV from a female partner with HIV, methods to prevent unintended pregnancy, and conception options that reduce the risk of HIV transmission.

### Committee opinion no. 582: addressing health risks of noncoital sexual activity [^115eto9o]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Noncoital sexual behavior is a common expression of human sexuality, which commonly cooccurs with coital behavior. Sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis virus (types A, B, and C), syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydial infection, can be transmitted through noncoital sexual activity. When engaging in oral and anal sex, most individuals, including adolescents, are unlikely to use barrier protection for a variety of reasons, including a greater perceived safety of noncoital sexual activity compared with vaginal sex. Clinicians should assess patient sexually transmitted infection risk and provide risk reduction counseling accordingly. Clinicians should encourage and counsel patients regarding the correct and consistent use of condoms, barrier protection during oral sex, and cleaning of sex toys. Patients who engage in noncoital sexual activity also commonly have vaginal sex and may require contraceptive counseling.

### Youths' knowledge and perceptions of health risks associated with unprotected oral sex [^113344Nn]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck cancers associated with oral sex are increasing, less than 10% of youths report using protection. This study aims to assess youths' knowledge and perceptions of oral sex risk and barriers to protection use.

Methods

Our study uses MyVoice, a national text message poll of youths aged 14–24 years. Four open-ended probes were fielded to 1,215 youths in March 2019. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis and quantitative data were summarized with descriptive statistics.

Results

Nine hundred and nine youths responded to the survey (relative risk [RR] = 74.8%). Youths' responses regarding why protection is frequently not used centered around: lack of education (22.4%), no perceived STI risk (19.8%), decreased pleasure (19.3%), and no pregnancy risk (15.7%). Youths believed that comprehensive education (53.7%), normalization in popular culture and media (19.1%), increased access to protection (15%), and improved protection options (10.5%) would increase protection use during oral sex.

Conclusion

Youths demonstrated limited knowledge of the risks of oral sex, dissatisfaction with current protection options, and a need for normalization in popular culture. Programs developed with youths in mind may be able to successfully increase protection use and decrease rates of STI transmission and oral sex-related HPV head and neck cancer. VISUAL ABSTRACT.

3. Protection from STIs

"Do you and your partner(s) discuss prevention of STIs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?"
"Do you and your partner(s) discuss getting tested?"
For condoms: º "What protection methods do you use? In what situations do you use condoms?"

4. Past history of STIs

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^113NUqTN]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services — persons with HIV who continue to practice HIV risk behaviors, particularly unprotected sex with multiple or anonymous partners, are highly likely to be exposed to STD and may benefit from screening every 3 to 6 months instead of annually; these persons may include some MSM, substance users, and persons aware that their sex partners have multiple sex partners. Risk behaviors are behaviors that can result in transmitting HIV to others or acquiring HIV through sexual contact, drug use, or during pregnancy (e.g., anal or vaginal intercourse without a barrier, sharing nonsterile drug-injection equipment). Additional information and practical resources to support implementation of these recommendations can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/guidelines/.

### Transmission of primary and secondary syphilis by oral sex – Chicago, Illinois, 1998–2002 [^111gVide]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

During 1998–2002, the STD/HIV Prevention and Care Program of the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) recorded 1,582 cases of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most of any U.S. city. Although case numbers and overall rates remained stable in Chicago during this period, patterns of transmission changed substantially. Throughout most of the 1990s, P&S syphilis was reported almost exclusively among heterosexuals. During 1998–2000, however, men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for approximately 15% of Chicago's P&S syphilis morbidity. Since 2001, MSM have accounted for nearly 60% of patients with P&S syphilis. During 2000–2002, CDPH conducted interviews with persons with syphilis; some MSM reported they had engaged in only oral sex and were surprised to have acquired syphilis. In response, CDPH began collecting information on oral sex from persons with syphilis. To assess the role of oral sex in the transmission of P&S syphilis in Chicago, CDPH analyzed surveillance data and interview responses. This report summarizes the results of these analyses, which suggested that a substantial proportion (13.7%) of syphilis cases were attributed to oral sex, particularly among MSM. Persons who are not in a long-term monogamous relationship and who engage in oral sex should use barrier protection (e.g., male condoms or other barrier methods) to reduce the risk for sexually transmitted disease (STD) transmission.

Current Practice on Selected Clinical Services in the United States

STDs can be prevented using various strategies, including male latex condoms, behavioral counseling, preexposure vaccination, and presumptive treatment after exposure. Timely and appropriate treatment of persons with STDs is critical for reducing transmission and preventing complications. Prevention and timely treatment of STDs depend on several factors, including taking a sexual history, assessing risk for STDs, performing screening and diagnostic testing, providing on-site medications, and notifying and managing sex partners.

Obtaining a sexual history and assessing risk for STDs include the five Ps (i.e. partners, practices, protection, past STDs, and prevention of pregnancy). Most primary care providers obtain a sexual history if it is relevant to the chief complaint but less frequently at an initial or routine annual visit and seldom at acute care, non-STD–related visits. Adolescent medicine clinicians, pediatricians, and obstetricians-gynecologists are more likely to regularly take a sexual history than family medicine clinicians, general practitioners, and internists. Primary care providers most commonly inquire about sexual activity and history of STDs but less often ask about the number of sex partners, gender of sex partners, and specific sexual practices (oral, vaginal, or anal sex). Several studies have determined that STD clinics obtain more complete sexual histories than primary care clinics.

Screening and diagnostic testing are important to detect asymptomatic or confirm suspected infections. Previous studies have documented that one third to one half of primary care clinicians routinely screen men or women for STDs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, or HIV). Obstetricians-gynecologists screen nonpregnant women more often than other primary care physicians. Community health centers often provide routine HIV testing for pregnant women but less frequently offer routine HIV testing for men and nonpregnant women. Some emergency departments perform routine HIV testing, although the practice is not widespread. For correctional settings, routine testing varies by type of facility. State and federal prison systems commonly perform routine syphilis testing at intake but less often offer routine testing for HIV, gonorrhea, or chlamydia. Some city and county prisons conduct routine testing for syphilis but rarely offer routine testing for HIV, gonorrhea, or chlamydia. Jails and juvenile detention centers infrequently offer routine testing for STDs and rarely perform routine HIV testing.

### Recent advances in pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV [^111MHMaX]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-the use of antiretroviral drugs by non-infected people to prevent the acquisition of HIV-is a promising preventive option, important public health questions remain. Daily oral emtricitabine (FTC)-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is highly efficacious in preventing the acquisition of HIV in people at risk as a result of a range of different types of sexual exposure. There is good evidence of efficacy in women and men, and when men who have sex with men use event based dosing. Studies have been conducted in several countries and epidemics. Because adherence to this treatment varies greatly there are questions about its public health benefit. Oral FTC-TDF is extremely safe, with minimal impact on kidney, bone, or pregnancy outcomes, and there is no evidence that its effectiveness has been reduced by risk compensation during open label and programmatic follow-up. It is too early to assess the impact of this treatment on the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) at a population level. Many challenges remain. Access to pre-exposure prophylaxis is limited and disparities exist, including those governed by race and sex. Different pricing and access models need to be explored to avoid further widening inequalities. The optimal combination prevention program needs to be defined, and this will depend on local epidemiology, service provision, and cost effectiveness. This review updates the evidence base for pre-exposure prophylaxis regarding its effectiveness, safety, and risk compensation.

Risk screening — recommended topics to cover during risk screening include sexual behaviors, alcohol and drug-use behaviors, and biomedical and biologic factors that may influence infectiousness or the risk of HIV transmission, as well as biomedical and biologic factors that may influence the risk of acquiring HIV by partners or the fetus or infant of a woman with HIV. For sexual behaviors, discuss sexual practices (vaginal, penile, anal, or oral sex; insertive vs. receptive sex, including recent condom use) and sex partners (number, age, gender, HIV status, drug-use history, and recent STD diagnoses; whether a partner is new or committed; where partners met; intimate partner violence). For alcohol and drug-use behaviors, ask about sharing drug-injection equipment and the use of new, sterile syringes and other drug-injection equipment, including sources of equipment. Biomedical topics include recent diagnosis of acute HIV infection based on HIV test results or clinical evaluation, and for partners or pregnancy contexts, use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) with antiretroviral medications.

### Sexual abstinence only programmes to prevent HIV infection in high income countries: systematic review [^116w7aVV]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of sexual abstinence only programmes for HIV prevention among participants in high income countries.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

30 electronic databases without linguistic or geographical restrictions to February 2007, contacts with experts, hand searching, and cross referencing.

Review Methods

Two reviewers independently applied inclusion criteria and extracted data, resolving disagreements by consensus and referral to a third reviewer. Randomised and quasirandomised controlled trials of abstinence only programmes in any high income country were included. Programmes aimed to prevent HIV only or both pregnancy and HIV. Trials evaluated biological outcomes (incidence of HIV, sexually transmitted infection, pregnancy) or behavioural outcomes (incidence or frequency of unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex; incidence or frequency of any vaginal, anal, or oral sex; number of partners; condom use; sexual initiation).

Results

The search identified 13 trials enrolling about 15,940 US youths. All outcomes were self reported. Compared with various controls, no programme affected incidence of unprotected vaginal sex, number of partners, condom use, or sexual initiation. One trial observed adverse effects at short term follow-up (sexually transmitted infections, frequency of sex) and long term follow-up (sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy) compared with usual care, but findings were offset by trials with non-significant results. Another trial observed a protective effect on incidence of vaginal sex compared with usual care, but this was limited to short term follow-up and countered by trials with non-significant findings. Heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis.

Conclusion

Programmes that exclusively encourage abstinence from sex do not seem to affect the risk of HIV infection in high income countries, as measured by self reported biological and behavioural outcomes.

Regarding preventative measures for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend to counsel MSM and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) in the past 12 months that doxycycline can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Offer persons in this group a prescription for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg, not to exceed 200 mg every 24 hours) after shared decision-making, to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

Risk screening and risk-reduction interventions — evidence supporting the recommendations summarizes sources and the role of screening. Evidence included studies on male circumcision and risk of HIV acquisition published between 2000 and 2012 and a cost-effectiveness analysis with per-client cost estimates and intervention effects based on 5 effective interventions from the CDC compendium; the writing group also conducted a narrative PubMed review between 2010 and March 2014. Accurate information on behavioral and biologic risks is needed to identify the most appropriate risk-reduction interventions, but estimation is difficult because risk varies by sexual and drug-injection behaviors, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use and adherence, HIV viral load, concurrent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), pregnancy, partners' HIV status, and other factors, and the results of risk screening may be inaccurate due to factors including poor recall, misunderstanding about risks, previous negative experiences with disclosing risk behaviors, fear of negative judgments or stigmatization, desire for social approval, concerns about legal consequences, doubts about confidentiality protections, and poor rapport with providers. Studies show that some persons diagnosed with an acute bacterial STD deny having unprotected sex, and conducting risk screening using a nonjudgmental approach that stresses confidentiality may encourage trust and elicit more honest responses.

Appendix B. Glossary — Definitions include HIV planning group (an official organization or committee that develops, advocates for, and implements a comprehensive plan for HIV prevention and care for a given jurisdiction) and HIV prevention counseling (an interactive process between client or patient and counselor aimed at reducing sexual, drug-use, and reproductive behaviors that pose a risk of HIV transmission or acquisition). HIV superinfection is the acquisition of another HIV strain that may reduce the effectiveness of HIV treatment if new, drug-resistant HIV strains are acquired. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that causes immune deficiency and may eventually lead to AIDS, especially if appropriate treatment is not used. Incidence is the number of new cases of a disease diagnosed in a defined population in a specified period, often a year. Index patient refers to a person with diagnosed HIV or STD and whose diagnosis prompts an investigation to identify other persons (known as partners) who may have become infected through sexual contact or exposure to blood or other body fluids of the index patient, and Indicator refers to a measure used to determine implementation over time of prevention or care services and the functions, processes, or outcomes of those services. Informed consent is communication between a person and a provider of prevention, testing, treatment or other health services, such as starting HIV treatment or referral to mental health services, and it includes an oral or written summary of 1) the risks and benefits of the service, 2) documentation of services rendered and their outcomes, 3) the opportunity to ask questions, and 4) reassurance that declining a service will not result in denial of other clinical or nonclinical services. Insertive anal sex, insertive fellatio, and insertive vaginal sex are defined as the practice of inserting one's penis into a partner's anus, mouth, or vagina, respectively. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is an in vitro fertilization procedure in which specially prepared ("washed") sperm of a man with HIV is injected directly into an egg retrieved from an ovarian follicle to achieve fertilization while minimizing the risk of HIV transmission to the female partner. Linkage facilitator describes an individual who assists persons with HIV to access HIV medical care and other medical and social services through active methods, and Linkage to care is the process of helping persons with HIV to obtain HIV medical care and prevention or social services through active methods (e.g., appointment scheduling, reminders, transportation to appointments).

Regarding preventative measures for human immunodeficiency virus infection, more specifically with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis with emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide for HIV prevention in sexually active male adults and adolescents (weighing at least 35 kg) reporting sexual behaviors placing them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and acquisition. Do not use emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide for HIV prevention in females or other persons at risk through receptive vaginal sex.

### Serosorting and recreational drug use are risk factors for diagnosis of genital infection with Chlamydia and gonorrhoea among HIV-positive men who have sex with men: results from a clinical cohort in Ontario, Canada [^1178h8tk]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings have implications for chlamydia/gonorrhoea prevention, testing and treatment among HIV-positive MSM. Non-zero diagnosis rates among men reporting condom-protected anal sex suggests some acquisition through unmeasured risk practices such as oral sex; sexual education messages should emphasise the differences in bacterial STI transmission routes compared with HIV. Testing was below recommended guidelines; the proportion of untested men reporting high-risk behaviours was substantial. We strongly encourage rectal testing which could detect up to 80% more asymptomatic infections. There is a need to design and deliver interventions to promote safer sex and testing in ways that are engaging, non-stigmatising and acceptable for men at risk. Potential clinic-based interventions to optimise testing include algorithms targeting high-risk patients, clinical decision support systems, automated patient/provider alerts and laboratory technologies to improve case detection.

### Effects of pre-exposure prophylaxis for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection on sexual risk behavior in men who have sex with men: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111WxZfw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in reducing HIV risk in men who have sex with men (MSM). However, concerns remain that risk compensation in PrEP users may lead to decreased condom use and increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We assessed the impact of PrEP on sexual risk outcomes in MSM.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of open-label studies published to August 2017 that reported sexual risk outcomes in the context of daily oral PrEP use in HIV-negative MSM and transgender women. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis, and a qualitative review and risk of bias assessment were performed.

Results

Sixteen observational studies and 1 open-label trial met selection criteria. Eight studies with a total of 4388 participants reported STI prevalence, and 13 studies with a total of 5008 participants reported change in condom use. Pre-exposure prophylaxis use was associated with a significant increase in rectal chlamydia (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.19–2.13) and an increase in any STI diagnosis (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, .99–1.54). The association of PrEP use with STI diagnoses was stronger in later studies. Most studies showed evidence of an increase in condomless sex among PrEP users.

Conclusion

Findings highlight the importance of efforts to minimize STIs among PrEP users and their sexual partners. Monitoring of risk compensation among MSM in the context of PrEP scale-up is needed to assess the impact of PrEP on the sexual health of MSM and to inform preventive strategies.

Estimated per-act probability of acquiring HIV from an infected source — Risk for HIV acquisition (per 10,000 exposures) includes sexual exposures: Receptive anal intercourse 138, Insertive anal intercourse 11, Receptive penile-vaginal intercourse 8, Insertive penile-vaginal intercourse 4, and Receptive oral intercourse Low§ and Insertive oral intercourse Low§; parenteral exposures: Blood transfusion 9,250, Needle sharing during injection drug use 63, and Percutaneous (needle stick) 23; and other exposures: Biting Negligible, Spitting Negligible, and Sharing sex toys Negligible. Risk is considered low relative to the other sexual exposures, but it is not zero; sample size in the study was too small to generate a precise point estimate.

### High-risk sexual behavior by HIV-positive men who have sex with men – 16 sites, United States, 2000–2002 [^115wXqUZ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2004). Low credibility.

The majority of persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States are men who have sex with men (MSM). High-risk sexual behavior by HIV-positive MSM exposes sex partners to HIV. The risk for transmitting HIV from an infected partner to an uninfected partner through unprotected insertive anal intercourse (UIAI) is greater than the risk for transmission through receptive anal intercourse or oral sex. Differences in sexual risk behavior might be associated with the perceived HIV serostatus of the partner (i.e. HIV positive, HIV negative, or unknown serostatus), as well as with the sex partner type (i.e., steady or nonsteady). During May 2000-December 2002, HIV-positive MSM were interviewed in a behavioral surveillance survey at surveillance sites in 16 states. This report describes insertive anal intercourse practices reported by these MSM; findings indicated that a large percentage of HIV-positive MSM were sexually abstinent, practiced safer sexual behavior by having protected insertive anal intercourse, or had UIAI with an HIV-positive partner. However, a small percentage of HIV-positive MSM reported UIAI with partners who were HIV negative or whose serostatus was unknown; for this group, more intensive and comprehensive HIV-prevention efforts are needed to eliminate this risk behavior.

### Sexual behaviour, structural vulnerabilities and HIV prevalence among female sex workers in Pakistan [^114YHmEK]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

Studies among FSWs in South Asia have identified individual risk factors for HIV/STIs and associations with higher levels of condom use. In this study, more than half of FSWs reported at least one non-paying partner in the previous month. Regular, repeat or non-paying partnerships are common among FSWs in Pakistan, and such partnerships have been associated with lower rates of condom useand shown to be important to the sustained dynamics of STIs. In this study, 'always' condom use with paying partners was lower than reported in other parts of South Asia. Condom use with non-paying partners is similar to that reportedoutside Pakistan, and underscores the importance of differential uptake of condoms based on the type of partnership, and the need for a different approach to increasing condom uptake during sex acts between an FSW and her non-paying partner. Anal and oral sex was common in commercial partnerships, with approximately half of FSWs engaging in non-vaginal sexual intercourse. Although few studies have questioned FSWs about providing oral sex, self-reported anal sex in the context of female sex work in Pakistan is similar to that reported in Bangladesh. Unprotected anal sex is associated with an increased risk of HIV transmissionand unprotected oral sex is a mode of transmission for syphilis and gonorrhoea. Addressing protective behaviours during non-vaginal sex will be an important component for prevention of STIs and HIV in this population.

### An estimate of the proportion of symptomatic gonococcal, chlamydial and non-gonococcal non-chlamydial urethritis attributable to oral sex among men who have sex with men: a case-control study [^112DAQLc]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) of the pharynx are common among men who have sex with men (MSM); the degree to which these infections are transmitted through oral sex is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a case-control study of MSM attending Public Health-Seattle & King County STD Clinic between 2001 and 2013 to estimate the proportion of symptomatic urethritis cases attributable to oral sex using two methods. First, we categorised men into the following mutually exclusive behavioural categories based on their self-reported sexual history in the previous 60days: (1) only received oral sex (IOS); (2) 100% condom usage with insertive anal sex plus oral sex (PIAI); (3) inconsistent condom usage with anal sex (UIAI); and (4) no sex. We then determined the proportion of cases in which men reported the oropharynx as their only urethral exposure (IOS and PIAI). Second, we calculated the population attributable risk per cent (PAR%) associated with oral sex using Mantel-Haenszel OR estimates.

Results

Based on our behavioural categorisation method, men reported the oropharynx as their only urethral exposure in the past 60days in 27.5% of gonococcal urethritis, 31.4% of chlamydial urethritis and 35.9% non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial urethritis (NGNCU) cases. The PAR%s for symptomatic gonococcal urethritis, chlamydial urethritis and NGNCU attributed to oropharyngeal exposure were 33.8%, 2.7% and 27.1%, respectively.

Conclusions

The pharynx is an important source of gonococcal transmission, and may be important in the transmission of chlamydia and other, unidentified pathogens that cause urethritis. Efforts to increase pharyngeal gonorrhoea screening among MSM could diminish STI transmission.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111mH5sQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Few data are available regarding the risk for STIs conferred by sex between women; however, transmission risk probably varies by the specific STI and sexual practice (e.g. oral-genital sex; vaginal or anal sex using hands, fingers, or penetrative sex items; and oral-anal sex). Practices involving digital-vaginal or digital-anal contact, particularly with shared penetrative sex items, present a possible means for transmission of infected cervicovaginal or anal secretions. This possibility is most directly supported by reports of shared trichomonas infections and by concordant drug-resistance genotype testing and phylogenetic linkage analysis identifying HIV transmitted sexually between women. The majority of WSW (53%–97%) have had sex with men in the past and continue to do so, with 5%–28% of WSW reporting male partners during the previous year (,–).

HPV can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, and sexual transmission of HPV likely occurs between WSW. HPV DNA has been detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based methods from the cervix, vagina, and vulva among 13%–30% of WSW and can persist on fomites, including sex toys. Among WSW who report no lifetime history of sex with men, 26% had antibodies to HPV-16, and 42% had antibodies to HPV-6. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) have been detected on Papanicolaou smears (Pap tests) among WSW who reported no previous sex with men. WSWM are at risk for acquiring HPV from both their female partners and male partners and thus are at risk for cervical cancer. Therefore, routine cervical cancer screening should be offered to all women, regardless of sexual orientation or practices, and young adult WSW and WSWM should be offered HPV vaccination in accordance with recommendations.

### Risk factors associated with human mpox infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112mGPgr]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

MSM and unsafe sexual activities

Recent Mpox outbreak saw a rapid surge among the MSM groups in previously unaffected areas, driven by sexual network heterogeneity. The results from two studiesindicated that Mpox cases predominantly affected MSM, with a high incidence of lesions in the anogenital region. As no heterogeneity was detected (I² = 0%, p = 0.39), a fixed-effects model was selected for meta-analysis. Our results indicate that MSM individuals are at a higher risk of contracting Mpox (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.88, 2.51, p value < 0.0001) (figure 3A), with 2.18 times greater odds compared with those who are not MSM. Additionally, two studiesreported that unprotected anal sex or engaging in three or more sexual activities, such as oral, anal and/or oral–anal, compared with just one or two activities in the 21 days before symptom onset, significantly increased the risk of Mpox infection. No heterogeneity was detected (I² = 0%, p = 0.74), and a fixed-effects model was selected for meta-analysis. From the forest plot, sexual contact was a significant risk factor associated with Mpox (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.13, 2.07, p value = 0.005) (figure 3A). The result indicates that those who engaged in unprotected anal and oral sex had 1.53 times the risk of Mpox compared with those who did not.

### Do as we say, not as we do: experiences of unprotected intercourse reported by members of the Society of Family Planning [^113xy54K]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

We examine the lifetime and past-year prevalence and circumstances of unprotected intercourse among members of the Society of Family Planning (SFP), a professional reproductive health organization in the United States.

Study Design

We invited the membership of SFP (n = 477) via email to participate in an anonymous online survey. The response rate was 70% (n = 340). We asked whether respondents had ever and in the past year had unprotected vaginal intercourse when not intending a pregnancy and, if so, how many times, under what circumstances, and at what age the first time. We then asked about unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse ever and in the past year under three different scenarios relating to sexually transmitted infections (STIs): (1) partner STI status unknown, respondent STI-free; (2) partner known infected, respondent STI-free; (3) partner STI-free, respondent STI status unknown or known infected. Each scenario included questions about the number of times, applicable circumstances, and age at first time.

Results

Forty-six percent of respondents had ever had unprotected vaginal intercourse when not intending pregnancy, 7% within the past year. Sixty percent had ever had unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse with a partner whose STI status was unknown, 12% within the past year. Four percent had ever had unprotected intercourse with a partner known to have STI, and 8%, with an STI-free partner when they themselves either had an STI or did not know their STI status.

Conclusions

Ever having taken a risk with respect to pregnancy and/or STIs is common among our sample of reproductive health professionals.

Implications

Most reproductive healthcare professionals in our sample have taken sexual risks in their lifetime and a small proportion has done so in the past year. These findings could inform counseling by encouraging healthcare professionals to reflect upon their own experiences when developing strategies to promote safe sex among their patients.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1122VhKX]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection

HIV seroconversion has occurred among persons whose only known risk factor was sexual assault or sexual abuse; however, the frequency of this occurrence likely is low. In consensual sex, the per-act risk for HIV transmission from vaginal intercourse is 0.08%, and for receptive anal intercourse, 1.38%. The per-act risk for HIV transmission from oral sex is substantially lower. Specific circumstances of an assault (e.g. bleeding, which often accompanies trauma) might increase risk for HIV transmission in cases involving vaginal, anal, or oral penetration. Site of exposure to ejaculate, viral load in ejaculate, and the presence of an STI or genital lesions in the assailant or survivor also might increase risk for HIV acquisition.

PEP with a 28-day course of zidovudine was associated with an 81% reduction in risk for acquiring HIV in a study of health care workers who had percutaneous exposures to HIV-infected blood. On the basis of these results and results from animal studies, PEP has been recommended for health care workers who have occupational exposures to HIV. These findings have been extrapolated to nonoccupational injecting drug and sexual HIV exposures, including sexual assault. The possibility of HIV exposure from the assault should be assessed at the initial examination; survivors determined to be at risk for acquiring HIV should be informed about the possible benefit of PEP in preventing HIV infection. Initiation of PEP as soon as possible after the exposure increases the likelihood of prophylactic benefit.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^111UmZL7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Transmission Probability

The transmission probability, directly in relation to R₀, varies from one pathogen to another. In the case of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, it is estimated to be high and modified by individual-level determinants. Transmission from male to female seems to be more efficient than from female to male. Young women are more susceptible to infection than older women, through the same biological pathway observed due to the use of oral contraceptive and injectable hormones, whereby cervical ectopy increases the risk of acquiring gonorrhea and is more common among hormonal contraceptive users and younger women.

Coinfections have also been found to increase the transmission probability, whereas barrier methods, such as condoms, are effective in decreasing the risk for gonorrhea transmission or acquisition in particular and STIs in general. In a vulnerable population, such as female sex workers, the risk of STI acquisition is modified by a consistent use of condoms. Condom use in turn varies depending on the type of sexual partner. It has been observed to be less consistent with partners or regular clients than new or occasional clients, implying that only the partners with whom female sex workers do not use condoms are increasing their risk. Therefore, in a population such as female sex workers, the number of partners might be a less accurate measure of risk than the type of partner, which in turn will determine the sexual behavior.

Duration of Infectiousness

Early diagnosis and effective treatment are the most efficient approaches to reduce the duration of infectiousness (in direct relation to R₀) and, as such, were classified as proximate. These are influenced by the presence of biological symptoms, health beliefs, and community and structural determinants of access to healthcare, such as structure of healthcare systems and measures of marginalization or social conflict.

How these recommendations differ from previous recommendations — the updated recommendations provide new guidance for nonclinical providers to ask about pregnancy status and reproductive health plans and to refer clients to reproductive health counseling, contraceptive services, and other reproductive health care, and for nonclinical and clinical providers to inform persons with HIV about the benefits of ART for preventing HIV transmission in HIV-discordant couples who have unprotected sex or are attempting conception. Unprotected sex is defined as sexual activity without using a physical barrier, with examples including penile sex without using a male condom, vaginal sex without using a male or female condom, oral-anal contact without using a dental dam or other barrier device, vaginal-digital contact without using a female condom, latex glove, or finger cot, and rectal-digital contact without using a latex glove or finger cot.

Section 9. Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Preventive Services — recommendations for persons with HIV include providing persons with HIV who have STD symptoms or report recent sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis with access to presumptive STD treatment (while awaiting STD test results) through onsite treatment at a health care facility or immediate linkage to a health care facility that offers clinical evaluation and onsite presumptive STD treatment. Engaging nonclinical providers to inform sexually active persons with HIV that some STDs may increase the risk of HIV transmission and that screening for these STDs at least annually is beneficial, to offer recommended STD screening tests using venous blood specimens or provider-initiated self-collected specimens or refer clients to clinical settings that offer STD screening, and to promptly link persons with HIV who report symptoms of STD or sexual contact with partners treated for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis to health care providers for clinical evaluation (including physical examination and diagnostic testing) and presumptive treatment with recommended injectable or oral antimicrobial drugs. Engaging health departments to integrate or routinely match STD and HIV surveillance data to identify populations or individuals with HIV with STD coinfection who may warrant being offered HIV and STD preventive services, including voluntary HIV partner services; presumptive treatment involves providing treatment for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection or trichomoniasis before results of STD testing or clinical evaluation are available and is recommended for persons who report symptoms suggestive of these STDs or recent sex partners who were treated for these STDs, or have clinical signs of these STDs.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) prevention in people with HIV — condom effectiveness and per‑act risk estimates: A larger trial demonstrated a 26% reduction in HSV-2 genital infection with condom use, and a pooled analysis of 6 studies found condom use reduced HSV-2 acquisition by 30%, with the risk increasing steadily with each unprotected sex act; per sexual act odds were 3.6% when condoms were never used, 2.7% when sometimes used, and 0% when always used. Individuals with HIV should use latex condoms consistently and correctly during sexual intercourse, should specifically avoid sexual contact when herpetic lesions are evident, and condoms will not protect against orogenital transmission and infection transmitted prior to penetration.

Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV

Daily oral antiretroviral PrEP with a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) have demonstrated safety and a substantial reduction in the rate of HIV acquisition for MSM. TDF/FTC has demonstrated safety and efficacy for mixed-status heterosexual couples and heterosexual men and women recruited individually; however, no evidence is yet available regarding TAF/FTC among heterosexually active women. In addition, one clinical trial involving persons who inject drugs and one involving heterosexual mixed-status couples demonstrated substantial efficacy and safety of daily oral PrEP with TDF alone. High adherence to oral PrEP was strongly associated with protection from HIV infection. Studies conducted with MSM have demonstrated that taking PrEP at specific times before and after sexual intercourse was effective in preventing HIV; however, less experience exits with this regimen, it is not FDA cleared, and it has not been studied among other populations.

Comprehensive clinical practice guidelines are available for providers in prescribing PrEP to reduce the risk for HIV infection. Among HIV-negative sexually active men and women, bacterial STIs are key indicators of risk for HIV acquisition. Studies have documented the risk for HIV acquisition among MSM within 1 year after infection with rectal gonorrhea or chlamydia (one in 15 men), primary or secondary syphilis (one in 18), and among men with no rectal STI or syphilis infection (one in 53). Sexually active adults and adolescents should be screened for STIs (e.g. chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) in accordance with recommendations, and persons with infection should be offered PrEP. The USPSTF recommends that persons at risk for HIV acquisition be offered PrEP. Persons at risk for HIV acquisition include HIV-negative persons whose sexual partner or partners have HIV infection (especially if viral load is detectable or unknown), persons who have had gonorrhea or syphilis during the previous 6 months, and injecting drug users who share injection equipment. Clinical practice guidelines recommend STI screening for persons taking PrEP because increased rates of STI acquisition have been described.

### Unintended HIV-1 transmission to a sex partner in a study of a therapeutic vaccine candidate [^113o3wD5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

We report a case of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that occurred during treatment discontinuation in a therapeutic vaccine trial, following oral sex. Transmission occurred even though the index participant was an HIV/AIDS activist, particularly well informed about the risks and modalities of transmission. This case report highlights the risk of secondary transmission of HIV during cessation of treatment in HIV cure-related trials.

### Sexual health risks among young Thai women: implications for HIV / STD prevention and contraception [^115ECTSA]. AIDS and Behavior (2003). Low credibility.

This paper examines factors that may place female Thai adolescents and young adults at risk for HIV, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and unintended pregnancies. A total of 832 female vocational students participated in a cross-sectional audio-computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) survey after providing informed consent. The questionnaire covered: sociodemographic characteristics; knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs related to HIV and STDs; contraceptive practices; sexual experiences and behaviors; and drug use. Oral fluid was tested for HIV antibodies and urine was tested for illicit drugs and for the presence of gonococcal or chlamydial nucleic acids. A total of 359 women (43.1%) reported sexual intercourse history, with an average age at first sex of 17.6 years, and a 2.6 mean number of lifetime sex partners. Twenty-one percent of the entire sample reported coerced sexual contact or intercourse. Among those with sexual intercourse experience, 27.3% (n = 98) had been pregnant and the majority of their most recent pregnancies were terminated. Three tested positive for HIV antibodies. Sexually active young Thai women report behaviors or experiences that may expose them to HIV/STD infection and unintended pregnancy in the future. These include unprotected intercourse, sexual coercion, low levels of contraceptive use, and drug and alcohol use. Culturally appropriate interventions that increase their awareness of and ability to respond to these sexual health risks are needed.

### Preexposure prophylaxis to prevent acquisition of HIV: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116zuYR6]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) follow-up and continuation guidance state that HIV testing every 2 to 3 months is recommended, and pharmacokinetic data for TDF/FTC indicate maximal intracellular tenofovir levels after approximately 7 days in peripheral blood mononuclear cells/rectal tissue and approximately 20 days in cervicovaginal tissues. Patients can continue PrEP as long as risk of HIV acquisition continues, may discontinue for various reasons, and on reinstating should have the same evaluation and testing as for initiation, including HIV testing. When cabotegravir injections are discontinued, patients should be informed of the long period of declining drug levels, the risk of developing drug-resistant HIV if infection occurs during this period, and that the CDC recommends daily oral PrEP or other effective prevention methods if ongoing exposure risk is anticipated. PrEP does not reduce the risk of other STIs; consistent condom use decreases risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 80% and reduces other STIs, and CDC recommends regular STI screening for persons taking PrEP and testing for anyone with symptoms.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: a clinical practice guideline [^112oZQex]. HIV.gov (2021). High credibility.

HIV testing — HIV testing with confirmed results is required to document that patients do not have HIV when they start taking PrEP medications, and clinicians should document a negative HIV test result within the week before initiating (or reinitiating) PrEP medications. For patient safety, HIV testing should be repeated at least every 3 months after oral PrEP initiation or every 2 months when CAB injections are being given. The CDC and USPSTF recommend that MSM, PWID, patients with a sex partner who has HIV, and others at substantial risk of HIV acquisition undergo an HIV test at least annually or for those with additional risk factors, every 3–6 months.

Recommendations — sexually transmitted disease (STD) preventive services at follow-up HIV care visits provide all persons with HIV the following services: review of sexual, alcohol, and substance use histories since last visit to determine if behavioral risk-reduction interventions are warranted; review of STD symptoms since last visit and recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment to determine if STD testing, physical examination, or treatment is warranted; STD screening at least annually or more often if indicated by sexual risk behaviors; and review of sex partners who were not notified of possible HIV or STD exposure to determine if offering HIV partner services is warranted. For persons with a positive STD test; STD symptoms or signs; or recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment for syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis or experiencing STD symptoms, provide oral or injectable treatment onsite according to the latest CDC STD Treatment Guidelines (including presumptive treatment [while awaiting STD test results] if indicated because of STD symptoms, or recent sex partners who have had STD symptoms or treatment), advise to return 3 months after treatment for gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, or trichomoniasis to obtain retesting for the relevant infection at the anatomic site of infection, advise persons diagnosed with syphilis to return for follow up serologic testing according to latest CDC recommendations, provide or refer to brief or intensive behavioral risk-reduction interventions, refer to voluntary HIV/STD partner services at health department or other trained partner services provider, and report cases of STD according to jurisdiction requirements and inform persons diagnosed with STD that case reporting may prompt health departments to offer voluntary, confidential partner services in some jurisdictions.

### African-American female adolescents who engage in oral, vaginal and anal sex: "doing it all" as a significant marker for risk of sexually transmitted infection [^116dtviw]. AIDS and Behavior (2009). Low credibility.

African-American female adolescents who engaged in vaginal sex only (N = 272) were compared to adolescents who engaged in two types (vaginal plus oral or anal; N = 295) and three types (vaginal, oral and anal; N = 144) on a constellation of other sexual risk behaviors (SRBs) and on sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Adjusted contrasts among groups revealed that adolescents who engaged in two and in three types of sex as compared to those who engaged in vaginal sex only were more likely to engage in six of the seven SRBs, but were just as likely to have a STI. One SRB, having ≥ 4 lifetime sex partners, was in turn associated with STI. Two-way interactions indicated that having a casual sex partner and having multiple sex partners in the last 60 days increased the likelihood of STI, but only for adolescents who engaged in all three types.

Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention

PrEP is the use of medications for preventing an infection before exposure. Studies have demonstrated that a daily oral medication TDF/FTC is effective in preventing HIV acquisition, and specifically among MSM. PrEP guidelines provide information regarding sexually active persons who are at substantial risk for acquiring HIV infection (having had anal or vaginal sex during the previous 6 months with either a partner with HIV infection, a bacterial STI in the past 6 months, or inconsistent or no condom use with a sex partner) or persons who inject drugs (injecting partner with HIV infection or sharing injection equipment). Those guidelines provide information regarding daily PrEP use for either TDF/FTC (men or women) or tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine for MSM. Screening for bacterial STIs should occur at least every 6 months for all sexually active patients and every 3 months among MSM or among patients with ongoing risk behaviors. MSM taking PrEP might compensate for decreased HIV acquisition risk by using condoms less frequently or modifying their behavior in other ways, although data regarding this behavior are inconsistent. Studies have reported that MSM taking PrEP have high rates of STIs, and frequent screening is warranted.

Importance of Rectal and Pharyngeal Testing

Rectal and pharyngeal testing by NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia is recognized as an important sexual health consideration for MSM. Rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia are associated with HIV infection, and men with repeat rectal infections can be at substantially higher risk for HIV acquisition. Pharyngeal infections with gonorrhea or chlamydia might be a principal source of urethral infections. Studies have demonstrated that among MSM, prevalence of rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from 0.2% to 24% and 2.1% to 23%, respectively, and prevalence of pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from 0.5% to 16.5% and 0% to 3.6%, respectively. Approximately 70% of gonococcal and chlamydial infections might be missed if urogenital-only testing is performed among MSM because most pharyngeal and rectal infections are asymptomatic. Self-collected swabs have been reported to be an acceptable means of collection for pharyngeal and rectal specimens, which can enhance patient comfort and reduce clinical workloads.

A detailed sexual history should be taken for all MSM to identify anatomic locations exposed to infection for screening. Clinics that provide services for MSM at high risk should consider implementing routine extragenital screening for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections, and screening is likely to be cost-effective.

### Sexual behaviour of heterosexual men and women receiving antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention: a longitudinal analysis [^1165xNcp]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Scarce data are available to assess sexual behaviour of individuals using antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention. Increased sexual risk taking by individuals using effective HIV prevention strategies, like pre-exposure prophylaxis, could offset the benefits of HIV prevention. We studied whether the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis in HIV-uninfected men and women in HIV-serodiscordant couples was associated with increased sexual risk behaviour.

Methods

We undertook a longitudinal analysis of data from the Partners PrEP Study, a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis among HIV-uninfected partners of heterosexual HIV-serodiscordant couples (n = 3163, ≥ 18 years of age). Efficacy for HIV prevention was publicly reported in July 2011, and participants continued monthly follow-up thereafter. We used regression analyses to compare the frequency of sex-unprotected by a condom-during the 12 months after compared with the 12 months before July 2011, to assess whether knowledge of pre-exposure prophylaxis efficacy for HIV prevention caused increased sexual risk behaviour.

Results

We analysed 56132 person-months from 3024 HIV-uninfected individuals (64% male). The average frequency of unprotected sex with the HIV-infected study partner was 59 per 100 person-months before unmasking versus 53 after unmasking; we recorded no immediate change (p = 0.66) or change over time (p = 0.25) after July, 2011. We identified a significant increase in unprotected sex with outside partners after July, 2011, but the effect was small (average of 6.8 unprotected sex acts per year vs 6.2 acts in a predicted counterfactual scenario had patients remained masked, p = 0.04). Compared with before July, 2011, we noted no significant increase in incident sexually transmitted infections or pregnancy after July, 2011.

Interpretation

Pre-exposure prophylaxis, provided as part of a comprehensive prevention package, might not result in substantial changes in risk-taking sexual behaviour by heterosexual couples.

### STI risk perception in the British population and how It relates to sexual behaviour and STI healthcare use: findings from a cross-sectional survey (natsal-3) [^115wEJZ7]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Notes for this figure: Denominator is those aged 16–44 reporting at least one sexual partner in the past year. Graphs show age-adjusted relative risk ratios (with 95% confidence interval) for each outcome, comparing those rating themselves as not very much at risk or greatly/quite a lot at risk with those rating themselves as not at all at risk. 'Unsafe sex' = reported either no condom used at first occasion of sex with a new partner and/or sex with 2 + partners and no condom used with any partner (past year), excluding those who had only oral sex in the past year. Prevalent STI in urine: Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, or Mycoplasma genitalium. Denominators for prevalent STI in urine are smaller than for behavioural variables as urine was only requested from a sub-sample of participants. For full data, including denominators, see Supplementary Table 2.

Despite these strong associations, the absolute proportion of those reporting risk behaviours but not rating themselves as at risk was very high. For example, among those classed as having 'unsafe sex' in the past year (comprising approximately 1 in 5 sexually-active 16–44-year-olds), 39.2% (95% CI: 35.1%–43.5%) of men and 51.0% (47.4%–54.5%) of women rated themselves as not at all at risk of STIs (Table 1). 59 men and 114 women had a prevalent STI detected in their urine sample at the time of interview (Chlamydia trachomatis in 36 men and 62 women; Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 2 men and 3 women; Mycoplasma genitalium in 24 men and 48 women; Trichomonas vaginalis in 7 women). Among these, 43.5% (29.2%–59.0%) of men and 58.7% (46.8%–69.6%) of women rated themselves as not at all at risk of STIs, and a further 29.4% (17.8%–44.5%) and 29.5% (20.1%–41.0%) respectively rated themselves as not very much at risk (Table 1). However, of those with a prevalent STI, 63.7% (50.2%–75.3%) of men and 41.8% (31.4%–52.9%) reported having had unsafe sex in the past year.

### Exuberant oral lesions in an immunocompromised patient [^113MCTro]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: Which of the statements below is not considered a risk factor for the disease in this case report?
A. Sexually active life
B. Immunosuppression
C. Complete HPV vaccine schedule
D. Self-inoculation
E. Unprotected sexual intercourse

Answers:

A. Sexually active life — Incorrect. Transmission occurs mainly through social contact, self-inoculation, and infected fomites as in this present case.
B. Immunosuppression — Incorrect. The risk factors for HPV infection include smoking, immunosuppression, and sexual behavior. As observed in the clinical picture, the patient had immunosuppression secondary to the HIV diagnosis.
C. Complete HPV vaccine schedule — Correct. Considering the oncogenic nature of HPV, patients should be instructed on the use of preventive methods and a HPV vaccine schedule.
D. Self-inoculation — Incorrect. It is transmitted through direct horizontal contact, such as anogenital intercourse with genital and/or oral contact with the mucous membranes of an infected area, or indirect contact, such as contaminated utensils. As reported, the patient had oral lesions consistent with this form of transmission.
E. Unprotected sexual intercourse — Incorrect. The main transmission form is self-innoculation or direct contact through unprotected sexual intercourse. Patients should be made aware of the use of preventive methods.

Appendix A — condomless intercourse and oral–genital contact: For "Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom when the source has HIV with detectable viremia or unknown viral suppression status", the rationale states "The recommendation to routinely offer nPEP in this scenario is based on the potential for HIV acquisition (Table 2) and the overall safety and tolerability of current nPEP regimens (17)". When the scenario is "Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom when it is not known whether the source has HIV", the table indicates Case-by-case determination, noting "Quantifying the likelihood of HIV acquisition in this scenario is not possible. The decision to initiate nPEP must be based on individual risk assessment and shared decision-making", and specifically that "HIV nPEP should be offered to survivors of sexual assault as part of comprehensive post-assault services when the assault included any contact associated with substantial risk for HIV transmission and the source's HIV status is unknown (21)". For "Oral–genital sexual contact without a condom, regardless of source's HIV status", the table states nPEP not routinely recommended and explains "The likelihood of HIV transmission with oral–genital sexual contact is low (22). On the basis of the individual risk assessment, health care professionals might choose to offer nPEP in the presence of other factors that might increase the risk for HIV transmission (e.g., trauma with blood exposure, non-intact mucous membranes, or high-level viremia) (23)".

### Sexual health clinic attendance and non-attendance in britain: findings from the third national survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles (natsal-3) [^114GYjUW]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2018). Low credibility.

We also acknowledge limitations in our measures. First, our measure of SHC non-attendance does not take into account testing for STIs in other settings, such as primary care or community-based testing, which is particularly relevant for chlamydia and HIV as a substantial proportion of testing for these STIs occurs outside of SHCs. However, we have quantified chlamydia testing among those not attending SHC (for those aged < 45 years on whom we have these data). Second, our two questions asking about SHC attendance and hypothetical service preference do not capture the increasing complexity of sexual health service provision in Britain. Given the broad range of settings providing SH services, we cannot be sure how participants interpreted 'sexual health clinic (GUM clinic) '; however, we obtained similar estimates of SHC attendance to those from GUM clinic surveillance data. Finally, we defined those with STI testing needs as participants reporting (in the past year) unprotected first sex with a new partner or more than one partner and no use of condoms. This refers to condom use for vaginal and anal sex since Natsal-3 did not ask about condom use during oral sex, which is a limitation as transmission risk for many STIs is determined by condomless oral sex. In addition, we acknowledge that an individual's STI risk extends beyond their own behaviour as it also reflects the characteristics and behaviours of their partner(s) and wider sexual networks. This means our measure will overestimate risk for some and underestimate risk for others. In particular, while we recognise that risks may differ by age and age of sexual partners, we did not have the power to stratify analysis by age. Nonetheless, this measure does provide some indicator of exposure to risk and is in line with national clinical recommendations for those who have had unprotected sex with a new partner to have a sexual health check.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^115ZunFT]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Issues that influence implementation of the recommendations — sexual transmission risk and MSM behavior: Abstinence from penetrative sexual intercourse is the most effective method to reduce the risk of sexual HIV transmission. An analysis of 2009 surveillance data found that among about 600,000 persons with HIV with unsuppressed viral load, 20% engaged in unprotected, HIV-discordant risk behavior, resulting in an estimated transmission rate of 23.13%. A meta-analysis of 30 U.S. studies that included more than 18,000 MSM with HIV estimated that the prevalence of unprotected anal sex was 30% (95% CI: 25%-36%) with partners with HIV, 16% (95% CI: 13%-21%) with partners of unknown HIV infection status, and 13% (95% CI: 10%-16%) with HIV-uninfected partners.

### Risk pathways for gonorrhea acquisition in sex workers: can we distinguish confounding from an exposure effect using a priori hypotheses? [^1167KW6P]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The nature of causation has been the subject of a comprehensive debate in philosophy, medicine, and, relatively more recently, epidemiology. The 2 main interpretations of causation that have been explored are (1) a deterministic interpretation, whereby a cause is invariably followed by its effect, being both necessary and sufficient; and (2) a probabilistic interpretation, where a cause increases or decreases the likelihood of the effect occurring, but is not required to be necessary or sufficient. In this article, we aim to provide a plausibility and probability assessment of the available literature to develop risk pathways, taking as an example sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in general and gonorrhea in particular.

Sexually transmitted infections, including treatable bacterial infections such as gonorrhea, represent a significant global health burden. Eighty percent of women and up to 10% of men remain asymptomatic during gonorrhea infection; when symptomatic, patients present with inflammation of the urogenital tract, throat, or rectum producing discomfort and discharge. Possible complications include pelvic inflammatory disease leading to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The presence of an untreated STI also enhances human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition and transmission risks. Whereas the deterministic (necessary and sufficient) cause of gonorrhea infection at an individual level (ie, the presence of the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae), is well described; at a population level, probabilistic causes that determine the variability in the population distribution of the infection and their complex interplay are less well understood.

### Hepatitis A and B immunization in persons being evaluated for sexually transmitted diseases [^113m429F]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Sexual transmission accounts for the majority of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in industrialized countries. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) can be transmitted by sexual practices that involve fecal-oral exposure. Both infections are disproportionately frequent in men who have sex with men (MSM). Routine immunization against HBV is recommended for MSM and for persons being evaluated or treated for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and HAV immunization is advised for MSM and for other persons at risk who are commonly seen in STD care settings, such as users of illegal drugs. However, numerous attitudinal and structural barriers interfere with routine immunization in persons at risk for sexual acquisition of HAV and HBV. Substantial success has been documented in vaccinating persons at risk in public STD clinics and other settings; however, at a national level, efforts to achieve desired immunization rates have largely failed. Until universal childhood immunization produces a largely immune adult population, the universal vaccination of adults-as a supplement to the current risk-based approaches-may be worthwhile to achieve immunization of persons at risk for sexual transmission of HBV.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^11652TaU]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Gonorrhea and Chlamydia

The following testing is recommended for MSM:

A test for urethral infection * with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had insertive intercourse during the preceding year (urine NAAT is preferred).
A test for rectal infection * with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had receptive anal intercourse during the preceding year (rectal NAAT is preferred).
A test for pharyngeal infection * with N. gonorrhoeae among men who have had receptive oral intercourse during the preceding year (pharyngeal NAAT is preferred).
Testing for C. trachomatis pharyngeal infection is not recommended.

Basing screening practices solely on history might be suboptimal because providers might feel uncomfortable taking a detailed sexual history, men might also feel uncomfortable sharing personal sexual information with their provider, and rectal and pharyngeal infections can be identified even in the absence of reported risk behaviors. Furthermore, the role of saliva, kissing, and rimming (i.e. oral-rectal contact) in the transmission of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis has not been well studied.

Rectal and pharyngeal testing (provider-collected or self-collected specimens) should be performed for all MSM who report exposure at these sites. Testing can be offered to MSM who do not report exposure at these sites after a detailed explanation, due to known underreporting of risk behaviors. All MSM with HIV infection entering care should be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia at appropriate anatomic sites of exposure as well as for syphilis.

More frequent STI screening (i.e. for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) at 3- to 6-month intervals is indicated for MSM, including those taking PrEP and those with HIV infection, if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners. In addition, providers can consider the benefits of offering more frequent HIV screening (e.g. every 3–6 months) to MSM at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection.

Hepatitis B Virus

All MSM should be screened with HBsAg, HBV core antibody, and HBV surface antibody testing to detect HBV infection. Vaccination against both HAV and HBV is recommended for all MSM for whom previous infection or vaccination cannot be documented. Serologic testing can be considered before vaccinating if the patient's vaccination history is unknown; however, vaccination should not be delayed. Vaccinating persons who have had previous infection or vaccination does not increase the risk for vaccine-related adverse events (see Hepatitis A Virus; Hepatitis B Virus).

Background

Heterosexual anal and oral sex are related to the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus infection. We examined the correlates of heterosexual anal and oral sex in the general population, using data from the National Survey of Family Growth.

Methods

The sample included 12,571 men and women aged 15–44 years (79% response rate).

Results

One-third of men and women had ever had anal sex, and three-quarters had ever had oral sex. Condom use during last oral or anal sex was relatively uncommon. In separate models for men and women, having ever had anal sex was associated with white race, age of 20–44 years, and having had a non-monogamous sex partner. White race, age of 20–44 years, being married, and having higher numbers of lifetime sex partners were related to having ever given oral sex in men and women. Giving oral sex was associated with having a non-monogamous sex partner in men. Ever receiving oral sex was associated with white race and a non-monogamous sex partner in men and women.

Conclusions

It would be beneficial to track the prevalence of heterosexual anal and oral sex and associated condom use on a more frequent basis.

STI and HIV Infection Risk Assessment

Primary prevention of STIs includes assessment of behavioral risk (i.e. assessing the sexual behaviors that can place persons at risk for infection) and biologic risk (i.e. testing for risk markers for STI and HIV acquisition or transmission). As part of the clinical encounter, health care providers should routinely obtain sexual histories from their patients and address risk reduction as indicated in this report. Guidance for obtaining a sexual history is available at the Division of STD Prevention resource page and in the curriculum provided by the National Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Centers. Effective interviewing and counseling skills, characterized by respect, compassion, and a nonjudgmental attitude toward all patients, are essential to obtaining a thorough sexual history and delivering effective prevention messages. Effective techniques for facilitating rapport with patients include using open-ended questions (e.g. "Tell me about any new sex partners you've had since your last visit" and "What has your experience with using condoms been like?"); understandable, nonjudgmental language (e.g. "What gender are your sex partners?" and "Have you ever had a sore or scab on your penis?"); and normalizing language (e.g. "Some of my patients have difficulty using a condom with every sex act. How is it for you?"). The "Five P's" approach to obtaining a sexual history is one strategy for eliciting information about the key areas of interest (Box 1). In addition, health care professionals can consider assessing sexual history by asking patients such questions as, "Do you have any questions or concerns about your sexual health?" Additional information about gaining cultural competency when working with certain populations (e.g. gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men [MSM]; women who have sex with women [WSW] or with women and men [WSWM]; or transgender men and women or adolescents) is available in sections of these guidelines related to these populations.

Section 7. Risk screening and risk-reduction interventions — training, decision-support, and alternative delivery modalities are described: At least three studies found that training and decision-support tools can enhance providers' comfort, skill, efficiency, and motivation to provide risk screening and risk-reduction interventions. Brief provider- or patient-administered risk-screening tools and computer-based and video-based risk-reduction interventions may be practical alternatives for both clinical and nonclinical providers when time is limited. By offering accurate, self-collected STD screening tests that do not require provider time for specimen collection, providers can routinely use positive test results as markers of unprotected sex.

### Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for preventing HIV in high-risk individuals [^1129nBLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

More than 30 years into the global HIV/AIDS epidemic, infection rates remain alarmingly high, with over 2.7 million people becoming infected every year. There is a need for HIV prevention strategies that are more effective. Oral antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in high-risk individuals may be a reliable tool in preventing the transmission of HIV.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of oral antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis in preventing HIV infection in HIV-uninfected high-risk individuals.

Search Methods

We revised the search strategy from the previous version of the review and conducted an updated search of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE in April 2012. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of any antiretroviral agent or combination of antiretroviral agents in preventing HIV infection in high-risk individuals

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning outcomes, details of the interventions, and other study characteristics were extracted by two independent authors using a standardized data extraction form. Relative risk with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used as the measure of effect.

Main Results

We identified 12 randomised controlled trials that meet the criteria for the review. Six were ongoing trials, four had been completed and two had been terminated early. Six studies with a total of 9849 participants provided data for this review. The trials evaluated the following: daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) versus placebo; TDF versus placebo and daily TDF-FTC versus intermittent TDF-FTC. One of the trials had three study arms: TDF, TDF-FTC and placebo arm. The studies were carried out amongst different risk groups, including HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men, serodiscordant couples and other high risk men and women. Overall results from the four trials that compared TDF-FTC versus placebo showed a reduction in the risk of acquiring HIV infection (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.86; 8918 participants). Similarly, the overall results of the studies that compared TDF only versus placebo showed a significant reduction in the risk of acquiring HIV infection (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.63, 4027 participants). There were no significant differences in the risk of adverse events across all the studies that reported on adverse events. Also, adherence and sexual behaviours were similar in both the intervention and control groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Finding from this review suggests that pre-exposure prophylaxis with TDF alone or TDF-FTC reduces the risk of acquiring HIV in high-risk individuals including people in serodiscordant relationships, men who have sex with men and other high risk men and women.

### Behavioral counseling interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116ozgi4]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF supporting evidence scope notes that to update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review of the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions for preventing STI acquisition, and that the review included randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials in adolescents or adults of any sexual orientation, level of reported sexual activity, or pregnancy status that were published after 1999.

### Kissing, saliva exchange, and transmission of Neisseria gonorrhoeae [^117DwR6E]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Data from mathematical models suggest that kissing and saliva exchange during sexual activity might be major contributors to community gonorrhoea morbidity. Although there is little evidence to support this, it provokes discussion of the potential role of the oropharynx in gonorrhoea control. Improved sensitivity and ease of diagnostic testing, as well as increased screening for extragenital infections among men who have sex with men, have increased awareness of the high frequency of oropharyngeal gonorrhoea. However, there are insufficient data to determine the mechanisms of transmission for these infections. Innovative studies that use quantitative microbiological techniques are needed to accurately assess how oral gonorrhoea or saliva exchange in infected people contribute to the morbidity of gonorrhoea in the community. More empirical data on pharyngeal gonorrhoea infections, and the role of transmission to and from the oropharynx, are needed to inform prevention planning.

Hepatitis B Virus Infection

The incubation period for HBV infection from time of exposure to symptom onset ranges from 6 weeks to 6 months. The highest concentrations of HBV are located in blood, with lower concentrations in other body fluids including wound exudates, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva. HBV is more infectious and more stable in the environment than other bloodborne pathogens (e.g. HCV or HIV).

HBV infection can be either self-limited or chronic. Among adults, approximately half of newly acquired HBV infections are symptomatic, and approximately 1% of reported cases result in acute liver failure and death. Risk for chronic infection is inversely related to age at acquisition; approximately 90% of infected infants and 30% of infected children aged < 5 years become chronically infected, compared with 2%–6% of persons who become infected as adults. Among persons with chronic HBV infection, the risk for premature death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma is 15%–25%.

HBV is efficiently transmitted by percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to HBV-infected blood or body fluids that contain HBV. The primary risk factors associated with infection among adolescents and adults are unprotected sex with an infected partner, having multiple partners, men having sex with men, having history of other STIs, and injecting drug use. In addition, studies have demonstrated other modes of HBV transmission, including premastication and lapses in health care infection control procedures, as less common sources of transmission.

CDC's national strategy for eliminating transmission of HBV infection includes prevention of perinatal infection through routine screening of all pregnant women for HBsAg and immunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers with HBsAg or mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown, routine infant vaccination, vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents through age 18 years, and vaccination of previously unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection. High vaccination coverage rates with subsequent decreases in acute HBV infection incidence have been achieved among infants and adolescents. The vaccination of persons as children and adolescents likely has led to improved vaccination coverage among adults aged < 30 years and corresponding lower rates of acute HBV infection among this group. In contrast, vaccination coverage among the majority of adult populations at high risk aged ≥ 30 years (e.g. persons with multiple sex partners, MSM, and injecting drug users) has remained low; these groups account for the highest rates of preventable acute infections. STD clinics and other health care settings providing STI services to adults at high risk for infection should administer hepatitis B vaccine to those who are unvaccinated.

### Barriers to infectious disease care among lesbians [^112imMp8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Some sexual practices, including oral-genital sex, vaginal or anal sex using hands, fingers, or penetrative sex toys, and oral-anal sex, are commonly practiced by female sex partners. Practices involving digital-vaginal or digital-anal contact, particularly with shared penetrative sex toys, present a plausible means for transmission of infected cervicovaginal secretions. This concept is most directly supported by reports of metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis and genotype-concordant HIV, which have been sexually transmitted between women who reported these behaviors. Reports of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae transmission between women are anecdotal and largely unpublished; however, approximately 3%–5% of respondents to surveys assessing lesbians' lifetime history of these STIs indicate that a chlamydial infection had been diagnosed by a healthcare provider. Among 6,146 respondents in the National Lesbian and Bi Women's Health Survey, conducted in the early 1990s, women reported contracting an STI from a female partner (including herpes by 135 persons, chlamydia by 102, genital warts by 100, gonorrhea by 16, hepatitis by 9, and HIV by 1). Although self-report of STI history is often inaccurate (as is attribution of STI to a specific source partner), these data indicate that the respondents sought care for perceived genitourinary abnormalities and received a diagnosis that indicated the provider had reason to suspect an STI. The most important bacterial STI for which more precise data are needed is C. trachomatis infection. Although the rate of transmission of STIs between women is probably low relative to that of transmission from men to women, a substantial proportion of lesbians, including those who self-identify as lesbians, and especially younger women most at risk for chlamydial infection, may continue to have sex with men.

### Regression-based risk scores using sociodemographic and sexual behaviour data do not predict asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections among HIV PrEP users [^114yv6bQ]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Among users of oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), condom use is low and incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is high, hence guidelines recommend STI screening every 3–6 months. Identifying individuals with higher asymptomatic STI risk for targeted screening may offer an opportunity to reduce the burden of STI screening.

Methods

In the Netherlands, PrEP has been offered through the National PrEP Pilot Program since 2019, which includes screening every 3 months. We included data of all individuals who received care through the PrEP programme between July 2019 and June 2022 and attended at least one PrEP care visit. STI-related symptoms and notification of possible STI exposure by sexual partners are recorded during each visit. We assessed the predictors of any chlamydia, gonorrhoea or syphilis infection diagnosed during routine asymptomatic STI screening (ie, no reported symptoms or partner notification) using logistic regression and calculated risk scores from coefficients of the multivariable logistic regression model. We estimated the sensitivity and specificity for the optimal prediction score cut-off.

Results

Among the 11 035 included individuals (97% men who have sex with men), 14 926 bacterial STIs (9114 diagnosed during routine asymptomatic screening) were diagnosed during a median of 24 months (IQR 15–30) of follow-up. We found that PrEP users who engaged in sex work, had condomless anal sex, participated in group sex or chemsex (ie, use of gamma-hydroxybutyrate/gamma-butyrolactone, mephedrone or crystallised methamphetamine during sex), injected drugs or used alcohol or non-chemsex-related drugs during sex had an increased risk of STIs diagnosed during routine asymptomatic screening. PrEP users born in the Netherlands and those who attended college or university had a lower STI risk. A risk score using these covariates resulted in a sensitivity of 0.55 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.56) and specificity of 0.55 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.55). Individuals eligible for STI screening accounted for 54% of STIs diagnosed during follow-up.

Conclusions

Using routinely available demographic and behavioural data, it was not possible to construct a well-performing risk score to identify individuals at high risk of STIs diagnosed during routine asymptomatic screening. Other factors, methods or ways to analyse data may be needed to increase predictive capacity for STI risk scores.

### The resurgence of syphilis among men who have sex with men [^112QnzDG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To identify recent progress and emerging problems in addressing syphilis among men who have sex with men.

Recent Findings

A resurgence of syphilis has occurred among men who have sex with men in many developed countries. Infection has been associated with HIV coinfection, multiple partners, and recreational drug use. Unlike HIV, oral sex appears to be a common route of syphilis transmission. Many prevention approaches have shown, at best, modest success. Variable clinical presentation and potentially inconclusive lab tests make diagnosis confusing.

Summary

As the infection remains relatively rare, clinicians treating men who have sex with men should maintain a high index of suspicion for syphilis lesions, and should screen their sexually active patients for latent disease. Debates about syphilis control and treatment continue. The clinical manifestations, serologic responses, efficacy of treatment, and complications of syphilis have always been complicated. HIV coinfection adds to the confusion.

### Preexposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV infection in the United States – 2021 update: a clinical practice guideline [^115cDX9H]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for human immunodeficiency virus infection, more specifically with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to provide access, directly or by facilitated referral, to the following when pre-exposure prophylaxis is prescribed:

- support for medication adherence and continuation in follow-up pre-exposure prophylaxis care, because high medication adherence and persistent use are critical to pre-exposure prophylaxis effectiveness for prevention of HIV acquisition

- additional proven effective risk-reduction services, as indicated by reported HIV exposure-prone behaviors, to enable the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis in combination with other effective prevention methods to reduce risk for sexual acquisition of STIs or acquisition of bloodborne bacterial and viral infections through injection drug use.

### An outbreak no longer: factors contributing to the return of syphilis in greater manchester [^1171RMYS]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2003). Low credibility.

Background

In the past few years, increased diagnoses of syphilis have been reported in cities around Britain and Europe. Enhanced surveillance of cases began in 1999 to identify the epidemiology of this increase in Greater Manchester.

Methods

Information was collected on all cases of syphilis newly diagnosed in genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in Greater Manchester between January 1999 and November 2002. The data collected included demographic information and information about other sexually transmitted infections, sexual behaviour, perception of risk of infection, and awareness of syphilis transmission.

Results

The majority of cases identified were white homosexual men resident in Greater Manchester. Of the 414 cases diagnosed, 74% had either a primary or secondary stage of syphilis infection and 37% of cases were HIV positive. High numbers of individuals practised unprotected oral sex despite good awareness of the risk of infection with syphilis. There is evidence that the way people are meeting sexual contacts is changing, with increasing numbers meeting most of their partners through the internet.

Conclusions

These findings have implications for targeting interventions. The provision of rapid diagnostic and treatment services is likely to be key for the control of syphilis and potentially of subsequent increases in HIV in the region.

### Sexual activity as a risk factor for hepatitis C [^111krDC8]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

The accumulated evidence indicates that hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted by sexual contact but much less efficiently than other sexually transmitted viruses, including hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, because sex is such a common behavior and the reservoir of HCV-infected individuals is sizable, sexual transmission of HCV likely contributes to the total burden of infection in the United States. Risk of HCV transmission by sexual contact differs by the type of sexual relationship. Persons in long-term monogamous partnerships are at lower risk of HCV acquisition (0% to 0.6% per year) than persons with multiple partners or those at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (0.4% to 1.8% per year). This difference may reflect differences in sexual risk behaviors or differences in rates of exposure to nonsexual sources of HCV, such as injection drug use or shared razors and toothbrushes. In seroprevalence studies in monogamous, heterosexual partners of HCV-infected, HIV-negative persons, the frequency of antibody-positive and genotype-concordant couples is 2.8% to 11% in Southeast Asia, 0% to 6.3% in Northern Europe, and 2.7% in the United States. Among individuals at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the median seroprevalence of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) is 4% (range, 1.6% to 25.5%). HIV coinfection appears to increase the rate of HCV transmission by sexual contact. Current recommendations about sexual practices are different for persons with chronic HCV infection who are in steady monogamous partnerships versus those with multiple partners or who are in short-term sexual relationships.

USPSTF patient population and risk stratification: This recommendation 'applies to asymptomatic, sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons'. In this statement, 'the recommendations are stratified by "men" and "women", although the net benefit estimates are driven by biological sex (ie, male/female) rather than gender identity', and 'Persons should consider their sex at birth and current anatomy (especially presence of a cervix/vagina) and consult with their own clinician, if necessary, to determine which recommendation best applies to them'. 'Age is a strong predictor of risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections, with the highest infection rates in women occurring during ages 15 to 24 years'. For women 25 years or older, risk factors include 'a new sex partner, more than 1 sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI; practice inconsistent condom use when not in a mutually monogamous relationship; or have a previous or coexisting STI', and 'Exchanging sex for money or drugs and history of incarceration also are associated with increased risk'.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^111f3YNb]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Section 7, risk screening and risk-reduction interventions — background defines risk screening as the collection of information to determine a person's risk of transmitting HIV and as a brief evaluation of behavioral factors (e.g., unprotected sex or sharing drug-injection equipment) and biomedical or biologic factors (e.g., antiretroviral treatment [ART] use, ART adherence, sexually transmitted disease [STD], and pregnancy), and states that risk screening is used to identify behavioral or biomedical risk-reduction interventions suited to a specific individual. The section addresses risk screening and behavioral risk-reduction interventions that can promote safer sexual and drug-injection behavior over a lifetime. Behavioral risk-reduction interventions include various services provided in clinical and nonclinical settings that have been shown to promote safer behaviors and reduce the risk of exposing others to HIV and can be offered to individuals or groups through counseling, discussion, role plays, or exercises; print media such as brochures and posters; and interactive media such as computers, telephones, and mobile devices. Some interventions aim to provide information, build knowledge, and improve skills that lead to safer behaviors, others increase motivation to adopt safer behaviors or modify social norms, and some involve a structural component, such as increasing access to condoms. Quality improvement and program monitoring and evaluation methods can determine if interventions are implemented as intended, yield the expected outcomes, or warrant changes in delivery methods.

### Antiretroviral drugs for treatment and prevention of HIV in adults: 2024 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^117Bbwfc]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (doxyPEP) for bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — Doxycycline (Doxy-PEP) taken after condomless anal or oral sex is recommended for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women and nonbinary people at risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis within the past 12 months (evidence rating: AIa), and doxyPEP is also recommended, using a shared decision-making approach, for MSM and transgender women who have not had a bacterial STI during the previous year but have a high likelihood of condomless exposure to STIs (evidence rating: AIII). Initiating oral doxyPEP is recommended as quickly as possible (but certainly within 72 hours) after condomless sexual exposure for cisgender MSM and transgender women (evidence rating: AIa). This intervention reduces the incidence of chlamydia by 70% to 88% and early syphilis by 73% to 87%, while effects on gonorrhea are less consistent. Dosing may be taken as frequently as daily (evidence rating: BIa). One study of doxyPEP for cisgender women in Kenya did not show a protective effect, but pharmacologic modeling suggests that doxyPEP should be effective for vaginal exposures and should be considered on a case-by-case basis among individuals with likelihood of STI acquisition via vaginal exposure (evidence rating: BIII). DoxyPEP prescriptions are recommended in quantities of 30 doses at a time (evidence rating: CIII), and screening of sites/orifices with sexual contact as well as blood testing for syphilis is recommended quarterly (evidence rating: AIa).

### How citizens' experience of democracy can actually pave the way to democratic backsliding [^112jMgg3]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

How experience can undervalue rare and catastrophic events

People's reasoning about risks draws on at least two sources: descriptive information and personal experience. Experts typically provide descriptive risk warnings — written, graphic, or symbolic — about rare but potentially highly consequential events, such as the health consequences of smoking or unprotected sex. Yet such descriptions often clash with individuals' personal experience, which may suggest far lower or no risk at all. When description and experience diverge, evidence indicates that experience tends to prevail. Specifically, when relying on experience, both animals and humans tend to decide, choose, and act as if they underestimate — or at least underweight — the risk of rare consequential events such as a future catastrophic eruption of Vesuvius or contracting a sexually transmitted disease.

### Identifying adolescent patients at risk for sexually transmitted infections: development of a brief sexual health screening survey [^116367sr]. Clinical Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

This study examined the association between survey responses to health behaviors, personality/psychosocial factors, and self-reported sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to create a brief survey to identify youth at risk for contracting STIs. Participants included 200 racially diverse 14- to 18-year-old patients from a pediatric primary care clinic. Two sexual behavior variables and one peer norm variable were used to differentiate subgroups of individuals at risk of contracting a STI based on reported history of STIs using probability (decision tree) analyses. These items, as well as sexual orientation and having ever had oral sex, were used to create a brief sexual health screening (BSHS) survey. Each point increase in total BSHS score was associated with exponential growth in the percentage of sexually active adolescents reporting STIs. Findings suggest that the BSHS could serve as a useful tool for clinicians to quickly and accurately detect sexual risk among adolescent patients.

### Progress toward UNAIDS global HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis targets: CDC-supported oral pre-exposure prophylaxis-37 countries, 2017 ─ 2023 [^114Tp5FD]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) reduces HIV acquisition from sex by 99% and from injection drug use by ≥ 74% when taken as recommended. In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended that persons at high risk for HIV infection be offered tenofovir-based oral PrEP as part of a comprehensive package of HIV prevention services. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has set a goal of scaling up services to achieve 21.2 million persons using (initiating or continuing) PrEP globally during 2025 to end HIV as a public health threat by 2030 *. The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), with U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense, Agency for International Development, and CDC, provides support for PrEP through partnerships with host countries. Starting in 2016, CDC joined ministries of health in implementing PrEP globally with an initial focus on adolescent girls and young women aged 15–24 years. In 2020, many PEPFAR-supported countries integrated oral PrEP into their prevention activities. Depending on local HIV incidence patterns, prioritized populations included serodifferent couples (couples in which one partner is living with HIV and the other is not), pregnant and breastfeeding women, adolescent girls and young women, and groups categorized by PEPFAR as key populations. These groups include female sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender persons, persons who inject drugs, and persons in prisons and other closed settings. In collaboration with ministries of health and others, PEPFAR develops annual targets for PrEP initiations for each implementing agency (including CDC) in each country, often based on program performance, financial support, and other factors, including coverage with other HIV interventions such as antiretroviral therapy. CDC supports PrEP programs in four regions including sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Eurasia, and the Americas. † This report describes CDC-supported PrEP initiations globally for prioritized populations by region, sex, and age.

### Declining prevalence of STI in the london sex industry, 1985 to 2002 [^116XEA4w]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe major changes in the London sex industry between 1985 and 2002 and assess the implications for sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk.

Method

A descriptive study comparing women who first attended a sex work clinic between 1996 and 2002 and those first attending from 1985 to 1992; a nested case-control study. 1050 female sex workers took part. The setting was a specialist clinical service for sex workers based in a London genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic, and fieldwork in west London. The main outcome measures were reported condom use and prevalent STI.

Results

Over the period of the study there was a significant increase in the proportion of sex workers not born in the United Kingdom (from 25% to 63%, p < 0.001), and women entered sex work at an older age (median 24 years compared with 20 years, p < 0.001). Condom use increased (with the exception of oral sex). There was a significant decline in the proportion of participants reporting a previous STI (32% compared with 80%, p < 0.001) and the prevalence of acute STI declined from 25% to 8% (p < 0.001). Acute STI was associated with younger age, younger age at first sex work, being new to sex work, and inconsistent condom use. In a multivariate analysis unprotected sex with clients was the only significant risk.

Conclusion

Major restructuring of the sex industry, including the shift to a primarily migrant workforce, has been associated with a steep decline in acute STI, undermining popular assumptions that migrant sex workers are central to the ongoing STI epidemic. We attribute the decline in acute STI to an increase in safer sex.

### Strengthening resilience to reduce HIV risk in Indian MSM: a multicity, randomised, clinical efficacy trial [^1112q4ES]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This study showed that a resilience-based psychosocial intervention for MSM in India was successful in terms of reducing condomless anal sex acts with male partners, and that two of the hypothesised proximal intervention targets, self-esteem and depressive symptoms, mediated this effect in the expected direction. Though number of condomless anal sex acts differentially changed between study arms, STI incidence did not differ, and one of the targets of the intervention, the single-item assessment of self-acceptance, was not significant as a mediator. From the perspective of mental health and quality of life, these are important findings, especially given the evidence of disproportionately high levels of mental health distress seen in this disenfranchised and often hidden and overlooked population. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that addressing resilience to the many barriers that Indian MSM face can reduce distress and an important health-risk behaviour, condomless anal sex with male partners.

However, from an HIV and STI prevention perspective, the absence of a significant difference in incidence between conditions, and the generally high level of incident STIs (23%) and HIV (4%) in this population are concerning. Although the risk behaviours for HIV, which were reduced in terms of self-reporting of condomless anal sex reductions in both study conditions, and STIs are not identical, incident STIs are a good biomarker of condomless oral and anal sex, and hence it is difficult to discern the degree to which self-report could be influenced by other variables. Similarly, syphilis can be transmitted through genital-to-genital rubbing, and does not necessarily require unprotected anal sex for transmission. The high HIV and STI rates at 12 months of follow-up show the great need for additional intervention components to reduce STIs in MSM in India. Furthermore, if and when PrEP becomes available on a large scale in MSM in India, the high STI rates suggest that use of PrEP will not obviate the relevance of counselling and skills-building around condom use, given the high prevalence of STIs.

Non-oral hormonal contraceptives and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) — evidence and guidance indicate that little is known about how ART interacts with non-oral hormonal contraceptives, and characteristics of some non-oral methods suggest interactions with ART may be less likely than with oral contraceptives. Recent studies have raised questions about whether the use of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate may increase HIV transmission to male sex partners or women's risk of acquiring HIV infection; because the evidence remains inconclusive, CDC and the World Health Organization recently recommended that women with HIV who use this injectable contraceptive should ensure that male or female condoms are consistently used during intercourse.

Interventions to reduce the STI exposure

Promoting condom use has been one of the central tenets of the HIV and STD risk-reduction strategy in the United States. Many programmes have developed to ensure marketing and wide distribution of large numbers of condoms, and instructions for condom use have been part of the national STD guidelines since 1989. Condoms are effective when used correctly and consistently in reducing the risk of STIs, including HIV.

HIV partner services — indications and provider actions are as follows: Newly diagnosed sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) that indicate recent unprotected sex and facilitate HIV transmission — primary and secondary syphilis; gonorrhea and chlamydial infection (including rectal infection); herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2); and trichomoniasis (in women); increased risk of HIV transmission due to pregnancy; behaviors that pose a high risk of exposing others to HIV (e.g., multiple, anonymous partners; having unprotected sex with persons with negative or unknown HIV-infection status; sharing drug-injection equipment); and a specific request for partner services. Ask index patients if they have disclosed their HIV infection to all sex and drug-injection partners and if self-notification would pose any risks, promptly refer index patients to health department partner services directly or through HIV case reporting according to the methods of the jurisdiction, if the index patient declines referral for health department assistance, offer partner services as appropriate to the provider's legal authority and skills and the index patient's preferences, and offer services to partners who are referred by index patients as appropriate to the provider's legal authority and skills.

### Population-based interventions for reducing sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection [^1144fAAh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are common in developing countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that in 1999, 340 million new cases of syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis occurred. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also common in developing countries. UNAIDS estimates that over 95% of the 40 million people infected with HIV by December 1999 live in developing countries (UNAIDS 2003). The STI and HIV epidemics are interdependent. Similar behaviours, such as frequent unprotected intercourse with different partners, place people at high risk of both infections, and there is clear evidence that conventional STIs increase the likelihood of HIV transmission. Several studies have demonstrated a strong association between both ulcerative and non-ulcerative STIs and HIV infection (Cameron 1989, Laga 1993). There is biological evidence, too, that the presence of an STI increases shedding of HIV, and that STI treatment reduces HIV shedding (Cohen 1997, Robinson 1997). Therefore, STI control may have the potential to contribute substantially to HIV prevention.

Objectives

To determine the impact of population-based STI interventions on the frequency of HIV infection, frequency of STIs and quality of STI management.

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched for relevant randomised trials or reviews:1) MEDLINE for the years 1966 to 2003 using the search terms "sexually transmitted diseases" and "human immunodeficiency virus infection"2) The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, in the most recent issue of the Cochrane Library3) The specialist registry of trials maintained by the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.4) EMBASE The abstracts of relevant conferences were searched, and reference lists of all review articles and primary studies were scanned. Finally, authors of included trials and other experts in the field were contacted as appropriate.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in which the unit of randomisation is either a community or a treatment facility. Studies where individuals are randomised were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied the inclusion criteria to potential studies, with any disagreements resolved by discussion. Trials were examined for completeness of reporting. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the same two reviewers, with details recorded of randomisation method, blinding, use of intention-to-treat analysis and the number of patients lost to follow-up, using standard guidelines of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group.

Main Results

Five trials were included. Frequency of HIV infection: In Rakai, after 3 rounds of treatment of all community members for STIs, the rate ratio of incident HIV infection was 0.97 (95%CI 0.81 to 1.16), indicating no effect of the intervention. In Mwanza, the incidence of HIV infection in the intervention groups (strengthened syndromic management of STIs in primary care clinics) was 1.2% compared with 1.9% in the control groups (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.42–0.70), corresponding to a 38% reduction (95%CI 15% to 55%) in HIV incidence in the intervention group. In the newest trial by Kamali et al, the rate ratio of behavioral intervention & STI management compared to control on HIV incidence was 1.00 (0.63–1.58, p = .98). These are consistent with Rakai data showing no effect of intervention. Frequency of STIs: In both Mwanza and Rakai, there was no significant reduction in gonorrhoea, chlamydia, urethritis, or reported STI symptoms among intervention communities. The prevalence ratio of syphilis between intervention and control groups in Rakai was 0.8 (95%CI 0.71–0.89), of trichmoniasis was 0.59 (0.38–0.91), and of bacterial vaginosis was 0.87 (0.74–1.02). In Mwanza, the prevalence of serologically diagnosed syphilis in the intervention community was 5% compared with 7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted re7% in the control community at the end of the trial (adjusted relative risk 0.71 (95%CI 0.54–0.93). In Kamali et al, there was a significant decrease in gonorrhoea and active syphilis cases. Rate ratio for gonorrhoea was 0.29(0.12–0.71, p = 0.016), active syphilis was 0.53(0.33–0.84, p = 0.016). There was a trend towards significance with intervention on the use of condoms with the last casual partner; the rate ratio was 1.27(1.02–1.56, p = 0.036). Quality of treatment: In Lima, following training of pharmacy assistants in STI syndromic management, symptoms were recognised as being due to an STI in 65% of standardised simulated patients (SSPs) visiting intervention and 60% of SSPs visiting control pharmacies (p = 0.35). Medication was offered without referral to a doctor in most cases (83% intervention and 78% control, p = 0.61). Of those SSPs offered medication, only 1.4% that visited intervention pharmacies and only 0.7% of those that visited control pharmacies (p = 0.57) were offered a recommended regimen. Similarly in only 15% and 16% of SSP visits respectively was any recommended drug offered. However, education and counseling were more likely to be given to SSPs visiting intervention pharmacies (40% vs 27%, p = 0.01). No SSPs were given partner cards or condoms. In Hlabisa, following the intervention targeting primary care clinic nurses (strengthened STI syndromic management and provision of STI syndrome packets containing recommended drugs, condom, partner cards and patient information leaflets), SSPs were more likely to be given recommended drugs in intervention clinics (83% vs 12%, p < 0.005) and more likely to be correctly case managed [given correct drugs, partner cards and condoms] (88% vs 50%, p < 0.005). There were no significant differences in the proportions adequately counseled (68% vs 46%, p = 0.06), experiencing good staff attitude (84% vs 58%, p = 0.07), and being consulted in privacy (92% vs 86%, p = 0.4). There was no strong evidence of any impact on treatment-seeking behaviour, utilisation of services, or sexual behaviour in any of the four trials.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is limited evidence from randomised controlled trials for STI control as an effective HIV prevention strategy. Improved STI treatment services have been shown to reduce HIV incidence in an environment characterised by an emerging HIV epidemic (low and slowly rising prevalence), where STI treatment services are poor and where STIs are highly prevalent. There is no evidence for substantial benefit from treatment of all community members. The addition of the Kamali trial to the existing evidence supports the data from the Rakai trial of no effect. There are, however, other compelling reasons why STI treatment services should be strengthened, and the available evidence suggests that when an intervention is accepted it can substantially improve quality of services provided. The Kamali trial shows an increase in the use of condoms, a marker for improved risk behaviors. Further community-based randomised controlled trials that test a range of alternative STI control strategies are needed in a variety of different settings. Such trials should aim to measure a range of factors that include health seeking behaviour and quality of treatment, as well as HIV, STI and other biological endpoints.

### Sildenafil use, sexual risk behavior, and risk for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection [^113tWHMg]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the rates of sildenafil (Viagra) use among different populations, primarily among men who have sex with men, and to measure the association of sildenafil use with increased sexual risk behavior and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Methods

The National Center for Biotechnology Information PubMed was searched using a variety of terms for relevant publications from January 1999 to July 2004. In addition, all scientific abstracts from national and international conferences on STDs from January 1999 to July 2004 were searched. Relevant journal articles and scientific abstracts presenting original data and meeting given criteria were included.

Results

Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven of the 11 studies in men who have sex with men showed sildenafil use rates > 10% (range 3%-32%). Increased odds of unprotected anal sex with a partner of unknown or serodiscordant HIV status ranged from 2.0 to 5.7 times (mean = 3.9) for sildenafil users versus nonusers. The risk of sildenafil use and STD diagnosis among HIV-positive men who have sex with men was 1.92 (P = 0.05), and the odds of sildenafil use among those newly HIV infected was 2.5 (95% CI 1.1–4.1).

Conclusions

Most studies reported frequent sildenafil use in men who have sex with men, and several showed independent associations between use of the drug and sexual risk behavior, as well as an increased risk for STDs, including incident HIV infection. Although future research among more varied participants is needed, these results warrant a multi-faceted response to reduce the misuse of sildenafil and its consequences, particularly among men who have sex with men.
