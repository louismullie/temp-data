## Question

Celexa

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Celexa (citalopram). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and class. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indication and key efficacy data. Next, I will review dosing, titration, and dose limits, especially the QT-related restrictions. After that, I need to check special populations and drug interactions. I will then examine adverse effects, boxed warnings, and monitoring. Finally, I will consider practical prescribing pearls, pregnancy and lactation, overdose management, and how citalopram compares with alternatives, before summarizing a cautious, clinically actionable bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the basics: Celexa is the brand name for citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) indicated for major depressive disorder in adults, with the mechanism of action being inhibition of serotonin reuptake at the synapse, which increases serotonergic neurotransmission and underpins antidepressant efficacy [^1e0702c5] [^1b220666].

> I should confirm the labeled indication and not overextend beyond it. The FDA-approved indication is treatment of major depressive disorder in adults; pediatric use is not established and is not approved, so I need to be careful not to imply pediatric indications despite occasional off-label use discussions in the literature [^1e0702c5] [^74d2c8ee].

> Next, I should review efficacy data. Wait, let me verify the pivotal trials: two placebo-controlled studies in adult outpatients with MDD established efficacy, with 40 mg/day showing clear benefit and 60 mg/day not outperforming 40 mg/day; importantly, doses of 10–20 mg/day were less effective than 40 mg/day, supporting a dose–response up to 40 mg/day but not beyond, which aligns with the later dose cap imposed for safety reasons [^3b739503] [^64692f19]. Hold on, I should also note maintenance data: continuation therapy reduced relapse versus placebo over 24 weeks, reinforcing the need for adequate maintenance treatment after acute response [^326e3b4b].

> I will now examine dosing and titration. Standard initiation is 20 mg once daily, with a recommended increase to 40 mg after at least 1 week if tolerated; doses above 40 mg/day are not recommended due to QT prolongation risk, which is a critical safety ceiling I must emphasize [^0eba248f] [^a30f7019]. Let me double-check special populations: in patients older than 60 years, those with hepatic impairment, or CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/day because of higher exposure and arrhythmia risk; I initially thought "elderly" might mean ≥ 65, but the label specifies > 60 years, so I should correct that nuance here [^0eba248f] [^215802d0].

> I need to ensure I cover drug interactions and CYP considerations. Citalopram is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19; potent CYP2C19 inhibitors like cimetidine or omeprazole increase citalopram exposure and warrant a 20 mg/day maximum, whereas CYP3A4 inhibition (e.g., ketoconazole) did not meaningfully change citalopram PK in a controlled study, though caution remains reasonable in polypharmacy [^d42be47a] [^dba33e22]. But wait, what if the patient is on other serotonergic drugs? I should confirm serotonin syndrome risk: concomitant triptans, tramadol, linezolid, methylene blue, MAOIs, and others increase risk, and MAOIs are contraindicated within 14 days of citalopram, so I must screen carefully and counsel on symptoms [^442deb06] [^1f8d05d0].

> Next, I should review adverse effects and tolerability. Very common reactions include nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, insomnia, and hyperhidrosis; sexual dysfunction is also common and should be proactively discussed and managed when it emerges [^2fc5f16b] [^a51f189d]. Hold on, I should verify discontinuation risk: abrupt stopping can precipitate discontinuation syndrome, so tapering is recommended when stopping therapy, with slower tapers if symptoms arise [^0eba248f] [^44ac37ac].

> I will now examine the boxed warning and suicidality risk. The FDA boxed warning highlights increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors in patients ≤ 24 years, with the highest risk in MDD; close monitoring is essential, especially early in treatment and after dose changes, and families/caregivers should be engaged in observation and reporting of emergent suicidality or behavioral changes [^8774f770] [^3561a7e6]. I should confirm that citalopram is not approved for pediatric patients, reinforcing the need for caution and shared decision-making in younger adults [^74d2c8ee].

> Let me consider QT prolongation and cardiac safety, since this is a key differentiator. Citalopram causes dose-dependent QTc prolongation and has been associated with torsades de pointes; therefore, avoid use in congenital long QT, bradycardia, hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia, recent MI, or uncompensated heart failure, and avoid coadministration with other QT-prolonging drugs; if used in higher-risk patients, obtain baseline and periodic ECGs and electrolytes, and discontinue if QTc > 500 ms [^a30f7019] [^66464b62]. I should double-check that the 40 mg/day cap is driven by this risk signal and that exceeding it is contraindicated in labeling, which it is [^0eba248f].

> Next, I should review special populations. In hepatic impairment, clearance is reduced and the maximum dose is 20 mg/day; in mild to moderate renal impairment, no adjustment is needed, but severe renal impairment lacks clear guidance, so I should use caution and consider lower starting doses with close monitoring; in pregnancy, third-trimester exposure is linked to neonatal complications, so risk–benefit discussions and potential tapering near delivery are advised, with ACOG recommending SSRIs as first-line for perinatal depression but citalopram as a second-line option due to these risks [^4b253b9c] [^17ff6d9b] [^ea2705d2]. For lactation, citalopram is present in breast milk at low relative infant dose, but infants should be monitored for irritability, poor feeding, and weight changes; if adverse effects occur, consider dose reduction or switching [^74d2c8ee].

> I should confirm practical prescribing pearls. Screen for bipolar disorder before initiation because antidepressants can precipitate mania/hypomania; monitor for activation symptoms early in treatment; and counsel on expected time to effect, typically 1–4 weeks, to support adherence while watching for adverse effects and suicidality [^0eba248f] [^ecd8ba89]. Hold on, I should verify bleeding risk: concomitant NSAIDs, aspirin, or anticoagulants increase bleeding risk, so review the medication list and coordinate with other prescribers, especially peri-procedurally or in patients at high bleeding risk [^f9dcfc64] [^6c97e4c8].

> Let me think about overdose management, since citalopram has distinctive cardiotoxic features. In significant ingestions, monitor for QT prolongation, torsades, and seizures; sodium bicarbonate can be used for QRS widening or QT prolongation, and activated charcoal may be beneficial in larger ingestions; modeling suggests cardiac monitoring for ingestions over about 1000 mg, with longer monitoring in older adults or those with tachycardia, though clinical judgment and ECG findings should guide disposition [^fe92433a] [^d431c8c3].

> I should compare citalopram with alternatives to contextualize use. Relative to other SSRIs, citalopram has a less favorable QT risk profile, prompting many clinicians to prefer sertraline, fluoxetine, or escitalopram when QT risk is a concern; nonetheless, citalopram remains a reasonable option when QT risk is low and prior response or tolerability favors it, with the caveat to respect the 40 mg/day ceiling and 20 mg/day cap in higher-risk patients [^a30f7019] [^08e7e571]. But wait, what if efficacy is the priority and QT risk is acceptable? Citalopram's efficacy is comparable to other SSRIs in MDD, and maintenance benefits are established, so individualized risk–benefit decisions are appropriate with appropriate monitoring plans [^3b739503] [^326e3b4b].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clinically actionable. Citalopram is an SSRI with established efficacy for adult MDD, a typical starting dose of 20 mg/day with a 40 mg/day maximum due to QT risk, and important restrictions to 20 mg/day in patients over 60, those with hepatic impairment, or CYP2C19 poor metabolizers; monitor for suicidality, serotonin syndrome, bleeding, hyponatremia, and discontinuation symptoms, and avoid QT-prolonging co-medications or cardiac risk states when possible; in pregnancy, consider alternatives late in gestation and monitor the neonate if exposure occurs, and in lactation, monitor the infant for adverse effects [^0eba248f] [^a30f7019] [^ea2705d2] [^74d2c8ee].

Celexa (citalopram) is an SSRI approved for **major depressive disorder** in adults [^1e0702c5], with typical dosing of 20–40 mg once daily [^0eba248f]; doses above 40 mg are not recommended due to **QT prolongation risk** [^a30f7019]. Common adverse effects include nausea, dry mouth, insomnia, somnolence, and sexual dysfunction [^2fc5f16b] [^a51f189d]; serious risks include serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, and bleeding with NSAIDs or anticoagulants [^442deb06] [^fc69f7b3] [^f9dcfc64]. In hepatic impairment, patients older than 60 years, or CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, the maximum dose is 20 mg/day [^0eba248f] [^215802d0]. Citalopram is not approved for pediatric use and carries a boxed warning for increased suicidality in patients 24 years and younger [^74d2c8ee] [^8774f770]. Gradual tapering is recommended to avoid discontinuation symptoms [^0eba248f] [^44ac37ac].

---

## Drug interactions

- **CYP2C19 inhibitors**: Reduce max dose to 20 mg/day (e.g. cimetidine, omeprazole) [^0eba248f] [^5048ddf0].
- **QT-prolonging drugs**: Avoid concomitant use (e.g. antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics) [^a30f7019].
- **Serotonergic drugs**: Increased serotonin syndrome risk (e.g. triptans, tramadol, linezolid) [^442deb06].

---

## Special populations

In pregnancy, **third-trimester exposure** is associated with neonatal complications; weigh risks and benefits [^ea2705d2]. In lactation, citalopram is present in breast milk; monitor infants for adverse effects [^74d2c8ee]. In pediatrics, safety and efficacy are not established; use is not approved [^74d2c8ee].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line**: SSRIs, including citalopram, are first-line for MDD [^e3e896cb].
- **Elderly**: Preferred due to favorable tolerability; use 20 mg/day max [^0eba248f].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess efficacy, adverse effects, and suicidality, especially early in treatment [^3561a7e6].

---

## Patient counseling points

- **Adherence**: Take as prescribed; do not stop abruptly [^0eba248f].
- **Side effects**: Report persistent nausea, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, or unusual symptoms [^a51f189d].
- **Alcohol**: Limit intake; may worsen side effects [^ecd8ba89].
- **Pregnancy**: Inform if pregnant or planning pregnancy [^f9dcfc64].

---

Celexa (citalopram) is an effective SSRI for adult MDD with a favorable tolerability profile, but clinicians must respect the **40 mg/day ceiling** [^a30f7019], monitor for QT effects, and adjust dosing in special populations. It is not approved for pediatric use and requires close monitoring for suicidality in younger adults [^74d2c8ee] [^8774f770].

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The premarketing development program for Celexa included
citalopram exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from 3 different groups
of studies: 429 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic
studies; 4422 exposures from patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical
trials, corresponding to approximately 1370 patient-exposure years. There were,
in addition, over 19,000 exposures from mostly open-label, European
postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with Celexa
varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and
double-blind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and
dose-titration studies, and short-term and long-term exposure. Adverse reactions
were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations,
vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic
examinations.

Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and
recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing.
Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the
proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping
similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories.
In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization
(WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events.

Maintenance Treatment

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require
several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic
evaluation of Celexa in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy
is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial
treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to
placebo or to the same dose of Celexa (20–60 mg/day) during maintenance
treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in
the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of Celexa 20 or
40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates
of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Based on these limited data, it is
not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is
identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are
bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg/day can be considered.

Discontinuation of Treatment with Celexa

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Celexa and other
SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients should be monitored for these
symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather
than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms
occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment,
then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently,
the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase
Inhibitor

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI
and initiation of Celexa therapy. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed
after stopping Celexa before starting an MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Initial Treatment

Celexa (citalopram HBr) should be administered at an initial dose
of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mg/day. Dose
increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less
than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the
only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an
advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are
therefore not ordinarily recommended.

Celexa should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or
without food.

Special Populations

20 mg/day is the recommended dose for most elderly patients and
patients with hepatic impairment, with titration to 40 mg/day only for
nonresponding patients.

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal
impairment. Celexa should be used with caution in patients with severe renal
impairment.

Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third
Trimester

Neonates exposed to Celexa and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the
third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged
hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS). When treating pregnant women with Celexa
during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the
potential risks and benefits of treatment. The physician may consider tapering
Celexa in the third trimester.

Clinical Efficacy Trials

The efficacy of Celexa as a treatment for depression was
established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks in duration) in
adult outpatients (ages 18–66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major
depression. Study 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed Celexa
doses of 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/day, showed that Celexa at doses of 40 and 60
mg/day was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)
total score, the HAMD depressed mood item (Item 1), the Montgomery Asberg
Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity
scale. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 and 20 mg/day doses, and the
60 mg/day dose was not more effective than the 40 mg/day dose. In study 2, a
4-week, placebo-controlled trial in depressed patients, of whom 85% met criteria
for melancholia, the initial dose was 20 mg/day, followed by titration to the
maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. Patients treated with
Celexa showed significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the
HAMD total score, HAMD item 1, and the CGI Severity score. In three additional
placebo-controlled depression trials, the difference in response to treatment
between patients receiving Celexa and patients receiving placebo was not
statistically significant, possibly due to high spontaneous response rate,
smaller sample size, or, in the case of one study, too low a dose.

Patients should be told that, although Celexa has not been shown in
experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill
impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of Celexa and alcohol in
depressed patients is not advised.

Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are taking, or
plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, as there is a
potential for interactions.

Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of Celexa and NSAIDs,
aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of
psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has
been associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant
or intend to become pregnant during therapy.

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they are
breastfeeding an infant.

While patients may notice improvement with Celexa therapy in 1 to 4 weeks,
they should be advised to continue therapy as directed.

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their
families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with
treatment with Celexa and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient
Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious
Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for Celexa. The
prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and
their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in
understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss
the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they
may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of
this document.

Reduced renal function - In patients with mild to moderate renal function
impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal
subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No
information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients
with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 20
mL/min).

Drug-Drug Interactions

In vitro enzyme inhibition data did
not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did
suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would
be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in
vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.

Since CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of
citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole,
itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g.,
omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However,
coadministration of citalopram and the potent 3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not
significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is
metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not
appreciably decrease citalopram clearance. Citalopram steady state levels were
not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive 2D6 metabolizers
after multiple-dose administration of Celexa, suggesting that coadministration,
with Celexa, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically
significant effects on citalopram metabolism. See Drug Interactions under PRECAUTIONS for more detailed information on available
drug interaction data.

Triptans: There have been rare
postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan.
If concomitant treatment of Celexa with a triptan is clinically warranted,
careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment
initiation and dose increases (see WARNINGS -
Serotonin Syndrome).

CNS Drugs - Given the primary CNS effects of citalopram, caution
should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting
drugs.

Alcohol - Although citalopram did not potentiate the cognitive
and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial, as with other psychotropic
medications, the use of alcohol by depressed patients taking Celexa is not
recommended.

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) - See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS.

Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin,
etc.)- Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis.
Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have
demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere
with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may
potentiate the risk of bleeding.

Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been
reported when SSRIs and SNRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients
receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when Lexapro is
initiated or discontinued.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The premarketing development program for citalopram included citalopram exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from 3 different groups of studies: 429 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies; 4422 exposures from patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, corresponding to approximately 1370 patient-exposure years.

Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations.

Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events.

The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment

Among 1063 depressed patients who received citalopram at doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 weeks in duration, 16% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 8% of 446 patients receiving placebo. The adverse events associated with discontinuation and considered drug-related (i.e., associated with discontinuation in at least 1% of citalopram-treated patients at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are shown in TABLE 2. It should be noted that one patient can report more than one reason for discontinuation and be counted more than once in this table.

### Citalopram hydrobromide (citalopram) [^ec15154c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION — Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram Tablets, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of citalopram).

 Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for citalopram should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

### Citalopram hydrobromide (Celexa) [^70fd9b55]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Triazolam - Combined administration of Celexa (titrated to 40
mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg)
did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or
triazolam.

Ketoconazole - Combined administration of Celexa (40 mg) and
ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the Cmaxand AUC of
ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the
pharmacokinetics of citalopram.

CYP3A4 and 2C19 Inhibitors - In vitro studies indicated that CYP3A4 and 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the
metabolism of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram (40 mg) and
ketoconazole (200 mg), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly
affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Because citalopram is metabolized by
multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably
decrease citalopram clearance.

Metoprolol - Administration of 40 mg/day Celexa for 22 days resulted in a
two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker
metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with
decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of Celexa and metoprolol had no
clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.

### Citalopram hydrobromide (Celexa) [^600abf70]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

In female depressed patients receiving Celexa, the reported incidence of
decreased libido and anorgasmia was 1.3% (n = 638 females) and 1.1% (n = 252
females), respectively.

There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with
citalopram treatment.

Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs.

While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction
associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such
possible side effects.

Vital Sign Changes

Celexa and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean
change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and
diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for
potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables.
These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs
associated with Celexa treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and
standing vital sign measures for Celexa and placebo treatments indicated that
Celexa treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes.

Weight Changes

Patients treated with Celexa in controlled trials experienced a
weight loss of about 0.5 kg compared to no change for placebo patients.

Laboratory Changes

Celexa and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean
change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis
variables, and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially
clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses
revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters
associated with Celexa treatment.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The premarketing development program for citalopram included citalopram exposures in patients and/or normal subjects from 3 different groups of studies: 429 normal subjects in clinical pharmacology/pharmacokinetic studies; 4,422 exposures from patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, corresponding to approximately 1,370 patient-exposure years. There were, in addition, over 19,000 exposures from mostly open-label, European postmarketing studies. The conditions and duration of treatment with citalopram varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term and long-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse events, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations.

Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events.

Imipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) - In vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively
weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of Celexa (40 mg/day for 10 days)
with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not
significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram.
However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was
increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine
change is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of
TCAs with Celexa.

Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) - There are no clinical studies
of the combined use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Celexa.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of
Fertility

Carcinogenesis

Citalopram was administered in the diet to NMRI/BOM strain mice
and COBS WI strain rats for 18 and 24 months, respectively. There was no
evidence for carcinogenicity of citalopram in mice receiving up to 240
mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to 20 times the maximum recommended human daily
dose (MRHD) of 60 mg on a surface area (mg/m²) basis.
There was an increased incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats receiving
8 or 24 mg/kg/day, doses which are approximately 1.3 and 4 times the MRHD,
respectively, on a mg/m² basis. A no-effect dose for this
finding was not established. The relevance of these findings to humans is
unknown.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

- Administer once daily with or without food (2).

- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily (2.1).

- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily (2.2).

- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually (2.4, 5.6).

2.1 Recommended Dosage

Administer citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.

Dosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.2 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Citalopram Tablets

Prior to initiating treatment with citalopram tablets or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Specific Populations

The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram tablets for patients who are greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers is 20 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.4 Dosage Modifications with Concomitant Use of CYP2C19 Inhibitors

The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram tablets when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor is 20 mg once daily

 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7)].

2.5 Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor Antidepressant

At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and initiation of therapy with citalopram tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping citalopram tablets before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

2.6 Discontinuing Treatment with Citalopram Tablets

Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of citalopram tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping citalopram tablets abruptly whenever possible.

Cimetidine - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day
Celexa, combined administration of 400 mg/day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in
an increase in citalopram AUC and Cmaxof 43% and 39%,
respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

Digoxin - In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day
Celexa, combined administration of Celexa and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did
not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or
digoxin.

Lithium - Coadministration of Celexa (40 mg/day for 10 days) and
lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the
pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium. Nevertheless, plasma lithium levels
should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the lithium dose in
accordance with standard clinical practice. Because lithium may enhance the
serotonergic effects of citalopram, caution should be exercised when Celexa and
lithium are coadministered.

Pimozide - In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg
co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was
associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared
to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or Cmaxof pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic
interaction is not known.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of citalopram hydrobromide PO (also known as Celexa):
- **Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome**: do not discontinue abruptly in any patient.
- **Bleeding**: use caution in patients taking aspirin, NSAIDs, antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Monitor INR in patients on warfarin.
- **Exacerbation of acute angle-closure glaucoma**: use caution in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. Avoid use if possible.
- **Exacerbation of seizure**: use caution in patients with seizure disorder.
- **Hyponatremia, SIADHs**: use caution in all patients, especially in the elderly and in patients with volume depletion or taking diuretics.
- **Prolonged QT interval**: use caution in all patients, as citalopram causes dose-dependent QT prolongation. Do not exceed 40 mg once daily.
- **Prolonged QT interval**: use caution in patients aged > 60 years, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, or patients taking other CYP2C19 inhibitors, as higher citalopram exposures would be expected. Do not exceed 20 mg once daily.
- **Reactivation of mania**: use caution in patients with bipolar disorder. Screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania before initiating citalopram.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use caution in patients taking other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, TCAs, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort). Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
- **Sexual dysfunction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SSRIs have been associated with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory delay or failure in males, and decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm in females.
- **Torsades de pointes, ventricular arrhythmias**: use extreme caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, uncompensated HF, or taking other QT-prolonging drugs. Avoid use unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Obtain ECG monitoring when used.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Citalopram tablets, USP should be administered once daily, in the morning or evening, with or without food.

Initial Treatment

Citalopram tablets, USP should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dose of 40 mg/day at an interval of no less than one week. Doses above 40 mg/day are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation. Additionally, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose.

Special Populations

20 mg/day is the maximum recommended dose for patients who are greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or those patients taking cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor. (see WARNINGS)

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Citalopram should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.

Treatment of Pregnant Women During the Third Trimester

Neonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding (see PRECAUTIONS). When treating pregnant women with citalopram tablets during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of CELEXA as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18–66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).

Study 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed CELEXA doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that CELEXA 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of CELEXA is 40 mg once daily.

In study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with CELEXA showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving CELEXA and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.

CYP3A4 and CYP 2C19 inhibitors:

Since CYP3A4 and CYP 2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and potent inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. Citalopram 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Coadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.

Clinical Efficacy Trials

The efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for depression was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks in duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depression. Study 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg or 60 mg/day, showed that citalopram at doses of 40 and 60 mg/day was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the HAMD depressed mood item (Item 1), the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity scale. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 and 20 mg/day doses, and the 60 mg/day dose was not more effective than the 40 mg/day dose. In study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in depressed patients, of whom 85% met criteria for melancholia, the initial dose was 20 mg/day, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg/day. Patients treated with citalopram showed significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, HAMD item 1, and the CGI Severity score. In three additional placebo-controlled depression trials, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant, possibly due to high spontaneous response rate, smaller sample size, or, in the case of one study, too low a dose.

### Citalopram (Celexa) [^66464b62]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The citalopram dose should be limited in certain populations. The maximum dose should be limited to 20 mg once daily in patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers or those patients receiving concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, since higher citalopram exposures would be expected. The maximum dose should also be limited to 20 mg once daily in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who are greater than 60 years of age because of expected higher exposures [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4), Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Electrolyte and/or ECG monitoring is recommended in certain circumstances. Patients being considered for treatment with CELEXA who are at risk for significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements with periodic monitoring. Hypokalemia (and/or hypomagnesemia) may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmia, and should be corrected prior to initiation of treatment and periodically monitored. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients for whom CELEXA use is not recommended unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks for a particular patient (see above). These include those patients with the cardiac conditions noted above, and those taking other drugs that may prolong the QTc interval.

Discontinue CELEXA in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms. If patients taking CELEXA experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope, the prescriber should initiate further evaluation, including cardiac monitoring.

Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram Tablets

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of citalopram tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with citalopram tablets. Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping citalopram tablets before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Use of Citalopram Tablets with Other MAOIs, Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue

Do not start citalopram tablets in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

In some cases, a patient already receiving citalopram tablets therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, citalopram tablets should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with citalopram tablets may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see WARNINGS).

The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with citalopram tablets is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use (see WARNINGS).

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^ea2705d2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of citalopram hydrobromide PO (also known as Celexa) in pregnant patients for third trimester: consider safer alternatives. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for direct toxic effects of the drug, serotonin syndrome and discontinuation syndrome. The use of SSRIs in late pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and symptoms of poor adaptation in the neonate. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends SSRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy for perinatal depression and anxiety, with citalopram being a reasonable option. The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments recommends citalopram as a second-line option for major depressive disorder during pregnancy. The drug citalopram hydrobromide PO (also known as Celexa) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations.

In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.

Excretion

Following intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.

Specific Populations

Geriatric Patients

Citalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects ≥ 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects ≥ 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Male and Female Patients

In three pharmacokinetic studies (total N = 32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N = 114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N = 237) and women (N = 388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

CELEXA (citalopram HBr) is not a controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

Animal studies suggest that the abuse liability of CELEXA is low. CELEXA has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. The premarketing clinical experience with CELEXA did not reveal any drug-seeking behavior. However, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict, on the basis of this limited experience, the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, health care providers should carefully evaluate CELEXA patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementations of dose, drug-seeking behavior).

5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior in Adolescents and Young Adults

In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients, and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1.

*CELEXA is not approved for use in pediatric patients.

It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing CELEXA, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.

In some cases, a patient already receiving citalopram therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, citalopram should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with citalopram may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue (see WARNINGS).

The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with citalopram is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use (see WARNINGS).

In two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to CELEXA during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of CELEXA or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of CELEXA 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of CELEXA 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued CELEXA treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of CELEXA. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of CELEXA is 40 mg once daily.

Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

5.2 QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes

CELEXA causes dose-dependent QTc prolongation an ECG abnormality that has been associated with Torsade de Pointes (TdP), ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death, all of which have been observed in postmarketing reports for citalopram [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Because of the risk of QTc prolongation at higher CELEXA doses, it is recommended that CELEXA not be given at doses above 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

CELEXA should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure unless the benefits outweigh the risks for a particular patient. CELEXA should also be avoided in patients who are taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Such drugs include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CELEXA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CELEXA or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of CELEXA have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with CELEXA, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.

Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of 4422 patients in clinical studies of CELEXA, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects ≥ 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

SSRIs, including CELEXA, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Increased Risk of Bleeding

Inform patients about the concomitant use of CELEXA with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Activation of Mania or Hypomania

Advise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Discontinuation Syndrome

Advise patients not to abruptly discontinue CELEXA and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when CELEXA is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Sexual Dysfunction

Advise patients that use of CELEXA may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

Pregnancy

Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with CELEXA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Advise patients that CELEXA use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.7 Seizures

CELEXA has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. In clinical trials of CELEXA, seizures occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with CELEXA (a rate of one patient per 98 years of exposure) and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo (a rate of one patient per 50 years of exposure). CELEXA should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.

5.8 Angle-closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including CELEXA, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including CELEXA, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

5.000000000000000e+00 9 Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including CELEXA. Cases of serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue CELEXA and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Citalopram (Citalopram hydrobromide) [^753474f5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes

Citalopram causes dose-dependent QTc prolongation, an ECG abnormality that has been associated with Torsade de Pointes (TdP), ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death, all of which have been observed in postmarketing reports for citalopram.

Individually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the Cmaxfor the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec.

Because of the risk of QTc prolongation at higher citalopram doses, it is recommended that citalopram should not be given at doses above 40 mg/day.

It is recommended that citalopram should not be used in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure. Citalopram should also not be used in patients who are taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Such drugs include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

Population Subgroups

Age - Citalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects ≥ 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects ≥ 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended dose for patients who are greater than 60 years of age (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), due to the risk of QT prolongation.

Gender - In three pharmacokinetic studies (total N = 32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N = 114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N = 237) and women (N = 388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT. No adjustment of dosage on the basis of gender is recommended.

Reduced hepatic function - Citalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended dose for hepatically impaired patients (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), due to the risk of QT prolongation.

CYP2C19 poor metabolizers – In CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state Cmaxand AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively. Citalopram 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended dose in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers due to the risk of QT prolongation (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

CYP2D6 poor metabolizers - Citalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.

Reduced renal function - In patients with mild to moderate renal function impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severely reduced renal function (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).

### Symptom relapse following switch from celexa to generic citalopram: an anxiety disorders case series [^ce25d7cf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Generic agents do not require large clinical trials of safety and efficacy to enter the market, although they must demonstrate both pharmacological and bioequivalence to the brand name drug. Bioequivalence is attained when the extent of absorption of the generic falls within an FDA predefined range relative to the brand name drug. This potential variation in bioequivalence is not thought to be clinically meaningful, however, there are reports of a lack of therapeutic equivalence between some generic medications and the brand name. This study examines the potential risks posed by a switch from Celexa to generic citalopram. Twenty patients at an Anxiety Disorders Clinic who were unknowingly switched to generic citalopram, from Celexa (Lundbeck, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and experienced a re-emergence of their anxiety symptoms or development of new adverse events are described in this case series report. The mean time for re-emergence of symptoms or development of adverse events was 3.4 ± 1.6 weeks (range 0.5–8 weeks). All patients reestablished previous treatment response with a change back to Celexa in a mean time of 3.8 ± 2.6 weeks (range 0.7–12 weeks). Given these results, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the potential for loss of treatment effect or symptom re-emergence posed by a switch to a generic agent. Randomized, double blind, controlled investigations would likely provide useful information as current bioequivalence and pharmacological equivalence do not necessarily translate into clinical equivalence.

CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Since CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Cimetidine

In subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day CELEXA, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and Cmaxof 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7)].

CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Coadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.

### Naturalistic study of the early psychiatric use of citalopram in the United States [^1a9a1bdf]. Depression and Anxiety (2002). Low credibility.

We obtained information on the efficacy and safety of citalopram in settings that resemble actual clinical practice. A total of 1,783 patients participated in this open, uncontrolled, naturalistic Phase IV evaluation of citalopram at 447 U.S. investigative sites. Participants were selected by guidelines in the citalopram package insert using minimal exclusion criteria. Citalopram dosing began at 20 mg/day and could be titrated to 60 mg/day. Outcomes included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I) and a Patient Global Evaluation. Separate analyses were performed on patients with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) (76%) who reported intolerance or nonresponse to previous selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Patients included tended to have treatment-resistant or intolerant, chronic or recurrent, comorbid depression with a mean duration of illness of 10 years. At study completion, more than 68% of treatment completers were classified as responders (CGI-I score of 1 or 2). Endpoint analyses showed response rates of 54% in all patients, 56% in patients with MDD, 49% in SSRI nonresponsive patients, and 53% in patients with a history of SSRI intolerance. Nausea (9.8%) and headache (7.3%) were the most often reported adverse events. Patients with a history of SSRI intolerance had a discontinuation rate of 21.8%, whereas those without such a history had a discontinuation rate of 13.3%. Citalopram administered at an average dose of 23.6 mg/day was associated with favorable outcomes and was generally well tolerated.

Coadministration of CELEXA (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.

Pimozide

In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or Cmaxof pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Association of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use with abnormal physical movement patterns as detected using a piezoelectric accelerometer and deep learning in a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized persons in the US [^2431362e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a common first-line treatment for some psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety; although they are generally well tolerated, SSRIs have known adverse effects, including movement problems, sleep disruption, and gastrointestinal problems (eg, nausea and upset stomach). No large-scale studies using naturalistic, longitudinal, objective data have validated physical activity findings, and actigraphy data are well suited to address this task.

Objectives

To evaluate whether differences in physical movement exist among individuals treated with SSRIs compared with control participants and to identify the unique features of the movement of patients treated with SSRIs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study examines longitudinally collected wearable movement data within a cross-sectional sample of 7162 participants from the 2005–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative population-based sample of noninstitutionalized persons in the US having both medication information and passive movement data. Statistical analysis was performed from April 1, 2021, to February 1, 2022.

Exposures

The use of SSRIs (sertraline hydrochloride, escitalopram oxalate, fluoxetine hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride, and citalopram hydrobromide), as reported by participants interviewed by NNHANES personnel, was the primary exposure, measured as a binary variable (taking an SSRI vs not taking an SSRI).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the intensity of body movement as recorded by a piezoelectric accelerometer worn on the right hip for more than 1 week.

Results

Of the 7162 participants included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 33.7 (22.6) years, 266 (3.7%) were taking an SSRI, 3706 (51.7%) were female, 1934 (27.0%) were Black, 1823 (25.5%) were Mexican American, 210 (2.9%) were other Hispanic, 336 (4.7%) were other or multiracial, and 2859 (39.9%) were White (per the NHANES data collection protocol). A cross-validated, deep learning classifier was constructed that achieved fair performance predicting SSRI use (area under the curve, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.64–0.71] for the validation set and 0.66 [95% CI, 0.64–0.68] for the test set). To account for possible confounding by indication, we constructed a parallel model incorporating depression severity, finding only marginal performance improvement. When averaged across individuals and across 7 days, the results show less overall movement in the SSRI group (mean, 120.1 vertical acceleration counts/min [95% CI, 115.7–124.6 vertical acceleration counts/min]) compared with the non-SSRI control group (mean, 168.8 vertical acceleration counts/min [95% CI, 162.8–174.9 vertical acceleration counts/min]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cross-sectional study found a moderate association between passive movement and SSRI use, as well as SSRI detection capacity of passive movement using time series deep learning models. The results support the use of passive sensors for exploration and characterization of psychotropic medication adverse effects.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^85e17f0e]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Since the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of fluoxetine (Prozac) in 1988, SSRIs have been the most prescribed antidepressants on the market. They act by inhibiting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) uptake. Since then, other SSRIs have emerged in the market, and these include citalopram (Celexa), fluvoxamine (Floxyfral), paroxetine (Aropax) and sertraline (Zoloft). Although SSRIs have been well tolerated by patients because of fewer side effects than previous drug, there is still a substantial profile of adverse drug reactions, such as sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, dizziness and tremors. The tolerability of a drug can be assessed by discontinuation rates in clinical trials. The discontinuation rate within 2 months for fluvoxamine was ~70%, followed by fluoxetine (45%) and sertraline (40%).

After the successful development of SSRIs, it was proposed that the simultaneous action of selective noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake could provide better efficacy. Thus, antidepressant SNRIs are as effective as TCAs, but side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias and seizures are significantly reduced. SNRIs available on the market include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) and milnacipran (Savella).

Mothers were asked if they had any illnesses other than the ones already discussed (for example, hypertension or diabetes) and whether they took any medication for the illness. Women could report depression here, which would then be followed by a question about any medications taken for the illness. There were also specific medication related questions: "between three months before conception and [the baby's] date of birth, did you take any of the following medications? Prozac? Paxil? Zoloft? Celexa?" There was no specific question for Lexapro. For this analysis, we considered women exposed if they reported taking citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), or sertraline (Zoloft) at least once in the period from one month before conception through the third month of pregnancy. Women who reported taking more than one type of SSRI were only included in the multiple SSRI category. We considered women as unexposed if they did not take any antidepressants in the period from three months before to the end of the pregnancy and did not report any depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or obsessive compulsive disorder. Women who did not answer all medication related questions, used SSRIs in a period other than the period of interest, or took antidepressants other than SSRIs (for example, bupropion and venlafaxine) were excluded.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^ddda3575]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Other potential limitations were that data from individual published and unpublished randomised controlled studies might not have been included in the initial review. The reporting quality of many of the older reviews was assessed as being poor with a high risk of bias, mainly because of data collection and study appraisal issues (online supplemental table S3). Overlap of primary studies within the reviews might be considered a limitation, and while no clear guidelines exist on how best to resolve it, the analysis of reviews at low risk of bias indicated a high to very high overlap. In 2019, Furukawa et al found that the SSRI class and citalopram dose-response between 20 mg and 40 mg per day, being at odds with reviews assessing similar datasets and those with no overlap. On the other hand, the lack of primary studies assessing dose-response effects for older adults was a clear limitation, and warrants further investigation. Similarly the quality of primary studies is a potential limitation, but most were considered to be at low to moderate risk of bias. Furthermore, a high degree of heterogeneity existed between the 42 reviews owing to methodological diversity and the progressive development of systematic review methodologies since 1988. Despite this, the review of reviews found a general consensus between older and newer reviews that SSRIs demonstrated flat dose-response effects for the treatment of depression, and larger doses were associated with more adverse drug effects, even when reviews assessed as having a higher risk of bias were excluded. Owing to similar results being observed across and within the reviews, including data from primary and secondary care settings, the findings appear to be generalisable to routine primary and secondary care practice, and are considered as being relatively robust.

### An electronic health records study of long-term weight gain following antidepressant use [^47e20a5a]. JAMA Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Short-term studies suggest antidepressants are associated with modest weight gain but little is known about longer-term effects and differences between individual medications in general clinical populations.

Objective

To estimate weight gain associated with specific antidepressants over the 12 months following initial prescription in a large and diverse clinical population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We identified 22,610 adult patients who began receiving a medication of interest with available weight data in a large New England health care system, including 2 academic medical centers and affiliated outpatient primary and specialty care clinics. We used electronic health records to extract prescribing data and recorded weights for any patient with an index antidepressant prescription including amitriptyline hydrochloride, bupropion hydrochloride, citalopram hydrobromide, duloxetine hydrochloride, escitalopram oxalate, fluoxetine hydrochloride, mirtazapine, nortriptyline hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride, venlafaxine hydrochloride, and sertraline hydrochloride. As measures of assay sensitivity, additional index prescriptions examined included the antiasthma medication albuterol sulfate and the antiobesity medications orlistat, phentermine hydrochloride, and sibutramine hydrochloride. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate rate of weight change over 12 months in comparison with the reference antidepressant, citalopram.

Main Outcome and Measure

Clinician-recorded weight at 3-month intervals up to 12 months.

Results

Compared with citalopram, in models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical features, significantly decreased rate of weight gain was observed among individuals treated with bupropion (β [SE]: -0.063 [0.027]; P = 0.02), amitriptyline (β [SE]: -0.081 [0.025]; P = 0.001), and nortriptyline (β [SE]: -0.147 [0.034]; P < .001). As anticipated, differences were less pronounced among individuals discontinuing treatment prior to 12 months.

Conclusions and Relevance

Antidepressants differ modestly in their propensity to contribute to weight gain. Short-term investigations may be insufficient to characterize and differentiate this risk.

### Citalopram versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^e3e896cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recent US and UK clinical practice guidelines recommend that second-generation antidepressants should be considered amongst the best first-line options when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Systematic reviews have already highlighted some differences in efficacy between second-generation antidepressants. Citalopram, one of the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) introduced in the market, is one of these antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with tricyclics, heterocyclics, other SSRIs and other conventional and non-conventional antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to February 2012. No language restriction was applied. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to citalopram versus any other antidepressants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), patient acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side-effects).

Main Results

Thirty-seven trials compared citalopram with other antidepressants (such as tricyclics, heterocyclics, SSRIs and other antidepressants, either conventional ones, such as mirtazapine, venlafaxine and reboxetine, or non-conventional, like hypericum). Citalopram was shown to be significantly less effective than escitalopram in achieving acute response (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.02), but more effective than paroxetine (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.96) and reboxetine (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91). Significantly fewer patients allocated to citalopram withdrew from trials due to adverse events compared with patients allocated to tricyclics (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78) and fewer patients allocated to citalopram reported at least one side effect than reboxetine or venlafaxine (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.97 and OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88, respectively).

Authors' Conclusions

Some statistically significant differences between citalopram and other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found in terms of efficacy, tolerability and acceptability. Citalopram was more efficacious than paroxetine and reboxetine and more acceptable than tricyclics, reboxetine and venlafaxine, however, it seemed to be less efficacious than escitalopram. As with most systematic reviews in psychopharmacology, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias and publication bias should be borne in mind when interpreting review findings. Economic analyses were not reported in the included studies, however, cost effectiveness information is needed in the field of antidepressant trials.

### Citalopram therapy for depression: a review of 10 years of European experience and data from U.S. clinical trials [^498a3f98]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

Background

This review summarizes and evaluates clinical experience with citalopram, the latest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to be approved for the treatment of depression in the United States.

Data Sources

Published reports of randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical studies of citalopram were retrieved using a MEDLINE literature search. Search terms included citalopram, SSRI, TCA (tricylic antidepressant), depression, and clinical. For each study, data on antidepressant efficacy and adverse events were evaluated. Pharmacokinetic studies and case reports were reviewed to supplement the evaluation of citalopram's safety and tolerability. Data presented at major medical conferences and published in abstract form also were reviewed.

Study Findings

Thirty randomized, double-blind, controlled studies of the antidepressant efficacy of citalopram were located and reviewed. In 11 studies, citalopram was compared with placebo (1 of these studies also included comparison with another SSRI). In 4 additional studies, the efficacy of citalopram in preventing depression relapse or recurrence was investigated. In another 11 studies (including 1 meta-analysis of published and unpublished trials), citalopram was compared with tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants. Finally, results are available from 4 studies in which citalopram was compared with other SSRIs. A placebo-controlled study of citalopram for the treatment of panic disorder was reviewed for data on long-term adverse events.

Conclusion

Data published over the last decade suggest that citalopram is (1) superior to placebo in the treatment of depression, (2) has efficacy similar to that of the tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants and to other SSRIs, and (3) is safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic dose range of 20 to 60 mg/day. Distinct from some other agents in its class, citalopram exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interaction potential. These features make citalopram an attractive agent for the treatment of depression, especially among the elderly and patients with comorbid illness.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^6c97e4c8]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — procedural checklist for managing anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during interventional techniques outlines patient evaluation of risk factors (age, diabetes, bleeding disorders, hypertension, obesity, low body weight, renal disease, low creatinine clearance) and identification of antithrombotic medications. Aspirin use is classified as "Primary Prophylaxis: Absence of established cardiovascular disease or risk factor" and "Secondary Prophylaxis: Presence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease", with the same primary/secondary categories listed for fish oil. The medication inventory includes antiplatelets (clopidogrel [Plavix], prasugrel [Effient], ticagrelor [Brilinta]); direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (dabigatran [Pradaxa], apixaban [Eliquis], rivaroxaban [Xarelto], edoxaban [Savaysa, Lixiana]); warfarin (Coumadin); identification of over-the-counter drugs influencing thrombolysis (garlic, vitamin E); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram [Celexa], fluoxetine [Prozac], escitalopram [Lexapro], paroxetine [Paxil], sertraline [Zoloft]); and NSAIDs. Subsequent steps include risk stratification and recommendations (low risk, moderate or intermediate risk, high risk), informed decision making, restarting of drugs, and postoperative monitoring.

### Comparison of pharmacokinetic profiles of brand-name and generic formulations of citalopram and venlafaxine: a crossover study [^517aa318]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Generic drugs are lower-cost versions of patent-expired brand-name medications. Bioequivalence is decreed when the 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the generic to the reference compound for the area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) fall within a 0.80 to 1.25 range. The aim of the present pilot study was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of brand-name and generic formulations of citalopram and extended-release venlafaxine.

Method

Effexor XR/Novo-venlafaxine XR 75 mg and Celexa/Gen-citalopram 40 mg were studied in a randomized crossover design. Healthy male volunteers took either Effexor XR or Novo-venlafaxine XR for 4 days, a 4-day washout was allowed, and then participants took the other venlafaxine formulation for 4 days. This was followed by a washout of at least 7 days. The participants then took Celexa or Gen-citalopram for 8 days, a 14-day washout was allowed, and then participants took the other citalopram formulation for 8 days. In each of the study phases, the sequence of treatment (brand-name x generic) was randomly assigned. Plasma levels of drugs were measured at fixed intervals after participants took the drugs and at steady state. The study was conducted from November 2007 through July 2008.

Results

Twelve participants completed the venlafaxine study. Nine of the participants, plus 3 new participants, were then enrolled in the citalopram study, to maintain a total of 12. The plasma levels of citalopram were similar after ingestion of the brand-name and generic drugs. After ingestion of venlafaxine, the C(max) values were 36 ± 6 ng/mL and 52 ± 8 ng/mL in the brand-name and generic groups, respectively. The ratio of the log-transformed values of C(max) was 150% and, therefore, not within the acceptable 80% to 125% range. The concentration of the active metabolite of venlafaxine (O-desmethyl-venlafaxine [ODV]) was also significantly increased in the generic group (+43% higher in the generic group at 3 h; +48% higher at 5 h; p < .05). No differences were seen at steady state for either ODV or venlafaxine. Participants taking Novo-venlafaxine reported 3 times more side effects than those taking Effexor XR. Pill contents were identical in the 2 groups, but extraction of venlafaxine occurred more readily with the generic formulation than with the brand-name formulation, which required an additional sonication.

Conclusion

Gen-citalopram appeared to be bioequivalent to Celexa, whereas Novo-venlafaxine XR was not bioequivalent to Effexor XR. Consequently, the Novo-venlafaxine formulation released its active ingredient more rapidly and outside the acceptable norm.

### Citalopram (perrigo citalopram) [^fc6cb9be]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION - Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram HBr Tablets, for a description of the risks of discontinuation of Citalopram HBr Tablets).

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for Citalopram HBr Tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that Citalopram HBr Tablets are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^9ab2efba]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Another difficulty with imipramine dose equivalents is that researchers have used irregular dose groupings: imipramine doses of < 100, 100–199, 200–250, and > 250 mg/day. Introducing these groupings reduces sensitivity to detect dose-response differences, and gives greater weight to those patients that can tolerate higher doses. Imipramine dose equivalents are also based on arbitrary SSRI doses that cannot routinely be prescribed in clinical practice (eg, 45 mg citalopram, 125 mg sertraline, and 33.3 mg fluoxetine). However, other dose standardisation techniques have different limitations; for example, Braun et al compared non-equivalent low (potentially subtherapeutic) SSRI daily doses with standardised doses of the same compound (eg, ≤ 10 mg citalopram (equivalent to 5 mg escitalopram) v ≤ 9 mg escitalopram (equivalent to 18 mg citalopram)). Citalopram is a racemic 50:50 mixture of active S-enantiomer (escitalopram) and inactive R-enantiomer, such that 2 mg of citalopram contains 1 mg of S-citalopram (escitalopram) and 1 mg of R-citalopram. Conversely, Braun et al also categorised a wide range of doses as high in their study, which could have affected their findings — for example, ≥ 40 mg citalopram with ≥ 80 mg fluoxetine. But other systematic reviews have focused on individual SSRIs, using the actual drug dose — therefore, removing interclass and intraclass variations.

Few reviews focus on primary care (ie, general/family practice and outpatients). While some reviews combine primary and secondary care inpatient studies, most lack clarity regarding the study settings. Therefore, the inclusion of inpatient studies could limit the generalisability of their findings to wider primary care populations, as demonstrated by Cheng et al. Other methodological limitations include: inclusion of mild depression studies; non-placebo controlled studies; narrative reviews that might lack a systematic approach; use of data on file, which misses search strategies and misses references, preventing others from replicating the review; assessing and reporting on efficacy but not on adverse effects or dropout rates; and assessing response without reporting remission effects. However, even after considering the potential limitations of previous reviews, this systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis shows an overall consensus that SSRIs demonstrate a flat dose-response effect for efficacy, and poorer acceptability and tolerability as SSRI doses are increased for the treatment of depression.

### Efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the absence of side effects: a mega-analysis of citalopram and paroxetine in adult depression [^7e9c576a]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

It has been suggested that the superiority of antidepressants over placebo in controlled trials is merely a consequence of side effects enhancing the expectation of improvement by making the patient realize that he/she is not on placebo. We explored this hypothesis in a patient-level post hoc-analysis including all industry-sponsored, Food and Drug Administration-registered placebo-controlled trials of citalopram or paroxetine in adult major depression that used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and included a week 6 symptom assessment (n = 15). The primary analyses, which compared completers on active treatment without early adverse events to completers on placebo (with or without adverse events) with respect to reduction in the HDRS depressed mood item showed larger symptom reduction in patients given active treatment, the effect sizes being 0.48 for citalopram and 0.33 for paroxetine. In actively treated subjects reporting early adverse events, who also outperformed those given placebo, the severity of the adverse events did not predict response. Several sensitivity analyses, for example, including (i) those using change of the sum of all HDRS-17 items as effect parameter, (ii) those excluding all subjects with adverse events (that is, also those on placebo) and (iii) those based on the intention-to-treat population, were all in line with the primary analyses. The finding that both paroxetine and citalopram are clearly superior to placebo also when not producing adverse events, as well as the lack of association between adverse event severity and response, argue against the theory that antidepressants outperform placebo solely or largely because of their side effects.

### Citalopram (perrigo citalopram) [^9ec4a54f]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

In two long-term studies, depressed patients who had responded to Citalopram HBr Tablets during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment (fixed doses of 20 or 40 mg/day in one study and flexible doses of 20–60 mg/day in the second study) were randomized to continuation of Citalopram HBr Tablets or to placebo. In both studies, patients receiving continued Citalopram HBr Tablet treatment experienced significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 or 40 mg/day of Citalopram HBr Tablets. Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.

Comparison of Clinical Trial Results

Highly variable results have been seen in the clinical development of all antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, in those circumstances when the drugs have not been studied in the same controlled clinical trial(s), comparisons among the results of studies evaluating the effectiveness of different antidepressant drug products are inherently unreliable. Because conditions of testing (e.g., patient samples, investigators, doses of the treatments administered and compared, outcome measures, etc.) vary among trials, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a difference in drug effect from a difference due to one of the confounding factors just enumerated.

### Oral scopolamine augmentation in moderate to severe major depressive disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^edab6cf1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the antidepressant effect of oral scopolamine as an adjunct to citalopram.

Method

In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, patients were assessed in the outpatient clinics of 2 large hospitals from November 2011 to January 2012. Forty patients (18–55 years) with major depressive disorder (DSM-IV-TR criteria) and 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score ≥ 22 were randomly assigned to scopolamine hydrobromide (1 mg/d) (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) in addition to citalopram for 6 weeks. HDRS score was measured at baseline and days 4, 7, 14, 28, and 42. The primary outcome measure was HDRS score change from baseline to week 6 in the scopolamine group versus the placebo group. Response was defined as ≥ 50% decrease in HDRS score; remission, as HDRS score ≤ 7.

Results

Augmentation with scopolamine was significantly more effective than placebo (F(1,38) = 5.831, P = 0.021). Patients receiving scopolamine showed higher rates of response (65%, 13/20 at week 4) and remission (65%, 13/20 at week 6) than the placebo group (30%, 6/20 and 20%, 4/20, respectively; P = 0.027, P = 0.004, respectively). Patients in the scopolamine group showed higher rates of dry mouth, blurred vision, and dizziness than the placebo group.

Conclusions

Oral scopolamine is a safe and effective adjunct for treatment of patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder.

### Citalopram, QTc interval prolongation, and torsade de pointes. how should we apply the recent FDA ruling? [^ecbfa074]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, both the manufacturer of citalopram and the US Food and Drug Administration have warned health care providers and patients about new information implicating drug-induced QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes when using citalopram in doses > 40 mg/day. This warning is not placed in the context of either benefits or risks in real-world clinical practice, leaving clinicians with an untenable choice between depriving patients of high-dose citalopram or malpractice litigation. We reviewed the literature and found no cases of citalopram-induced sudden cardiac death among patients taking up to 60 mg/day of citalopram and free of risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. Because psychotropic drug-induced sudden cardiac death is an outlier in the absence of identified risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes, we do not believe current Phase 3 and Phase 4 studies provide sufficient information to limit current prescribing practices for citalopram (20 mg to 60 mg/day). We urge drug manufacturers and regulatory agencies to periodically publish full case reports of psychotropic drug-induced QTc interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, and sudden cardiac death so that clinicians and investigators may better understand the clinical implications of prescribing such drugs as citalopram.

### Citalopram [^442deb06]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Serotonin Syndrome

SSRIs, including citalopram tablets, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. MAOIs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)]. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome were noted in 0.1% of MDD patients treated with citalopram tablets in premarketing clinical trials.

Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of citalopram tablets with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate citalopram tablets in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking citalopram tablets, discontinue citalopram tablets before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)].

Monitor all patients taking citalopram tablets for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with citalopram tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of citalopram tablets with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

Healthcare settings

The majority (approximately half) of the CYP with a new SSRI prescription were present in primary care only (47.7%, 95% CI 46.5–49.0), and a third (36.6%, 95% CI 35.5%-37.8%) in outpatient psychiatric or pediatric secondary care settings around the time of the prescription. Incident Citalopram prescriptions were less likely to be associated with secondary care settings than Fluoxetine or Sertraline (Primary care only: Citalopram: 64.2% [95%, CI 61.4–67.0; n = 2028], Fluoxetine: 40.3% [95% CI 38.8–41.8; n = 2703], Sertraline: 41.5% [95% CI 39.1–44.0]; n = 1151]); online Supplementary Table S4).

Demographic variables

Females were more than twice as likely to have an antidepressant prescription with this difference largest for TCA's (IRR 3.3 [95% CI 3.0–3.6]). However, overall levels of TCA prescriptions remained low for both sexes. Incidence of Fluoxetine and Sertraline was more than twice as high and Citalopram more than three times as high in females than in males (IRRs Citalopram 3.1 [95% CI 2.9–3.4]; Fluoxetine 2.5 [95% CI 2.4–27]); Sertraline 2.2 [95% CI 2.0–2.4]; Table 3).

### Cardiotoxicity and late onset seizures with citalopram overdose [^fe92433a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A 31-year-old man ingested 400 mg of citalopram (Celexa) after an argument with his parents and girlfriend 13 h before presentation. Paramedics witnessed the patient having a generalized clonic seizure. The electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a wide QRS complex, prolongation of the QTc interval, and left bundle branch pattern. He was treated with sodium bicarbonate with resolution of these changes. The patient was continued on a sodium bicarbonate infusion and demonstrated no further EKG abnormalities. Sodium bicarbonate should be considered as a treatment modality in patients with EKG abnormalities of prolongation of QRS or QTc interval after citalopram overdose.

### A mega-analysis of fixed-dose trials reveals dose-dependency and a rapid onset of action for the antidepressant effect of three selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^ffa3e752]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

The possible dose-dependency for the antidepressant effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remains controversial. We believe we have conducted the first comprehensive patient-level mega-analysis exploring this issue, one incentive being to address the possibility that inclusion of low-dose arms in previous meta-analyses may have caused an underestimation of the efficacy of these drugs. All company-sponsored, acute-phase, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and conducted to evaluate the effect of citalopram, paroxetine or sertraline in adult major depression were included (11 trials, n = 2859 patients). The single-item depressed mood, which has proven a more sensitive measure to detect an antidepressant signal than the sum score of all HDRS items, was designated the primary effect parameter. Doses below or at the lower end of the usually recommended dose range (citalopram: 10-20mg, paroxetine: 10mg; sertraline: 50mg) were superior to placebo but inferior to higher doses, hence confirming a dose-dependency to be at hand. In contrast, among doses above these, there was no indication of a dose-response relationship. The effect size (ES) after exclusion of suboptimal doses was of a more respectable magnitude (0.5) than that usually attributed to the antidepressant effect of the SSRIs. In conclusion, the observation that low doses are less effective than higher ones challenges the oft-cited view that the effect of the SSRIs is not dose-dependent and hence not caused by a specific, pharmacological antidepressant action. Moreover, we suggest that inclusion of suboptimal doses in previous meta-analyses has led to an underestimation of the efficacy of these drugs.

### Application of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling in management of QT abnormalities after citalopram overdose [^d431c8c3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop guidelines for the management of QT prolongation after citalopram overdose, including decontamination with single-dose activated charcoal (SDAC) and cardiac monitoring.

Design

Simulation study using a previously developed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model which predicted the time-course of QT prolongation and the effect of citalopram dose and use of SDAC on QT prolongation.

Main Measures and Results

The previously developed PKPD model was used to address the following in patients following citalopram overdose: (1) Above what dose should patients be decontaminated? (2) Above what dose should patients have cardiac monitoring? (3) For what period of time should patients be monitored? The primary outcome was QT, RR combinations above an abnormal threshold as a surrogate predictor of torsades de pointes. Simulations were performed using MATLAB for an overdose patient with typical demographics: 30-year-old female with a heart rate of 79 bpm taking citalopram therapeutically. The simulations showed: (1) There was significant benefit associated with the administration of SDAC to patients following citalopram overdose ingesting > 600 mg; (2) With citalopram overdoses > 1,000mg it was advisable to give SDAC and cardiac monitor the patient; (3) The risk of developing future abnormal QT, RR combinations was less than 1% in patients with normal QT, RR combinations up to 13 h post-dose, so the minimum monitoring time for citalopram overdoses > 1,000mg should be 13h. Recommended dose levels for intervention should be lowered in older patients and patients with tachycardia, while men are less sensitive to QT prolongation.

Conclusions

Guidelines for the management of QT prolongation after citalopram overdose were developed. We believe the model will help clinicians to decide which patients to decontaminate and monitor.

### Antidepressant use and risk of adverse outcomes in people aged 20–64 years: cohort study using a primary care database [^8970caa3]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Antidepressant treatment during follow-up

The majority of patients in the cohort (209,476, 87.7%) were treated with antidepressants during follow-up. The median duration of treatment was 221 days (interquartile range 79–590 days), with 36.6% of treated patients having 1 or more years of treatment and 5.5% having 5 or more years of treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed antidepressant class (189,968 patients had 2,379,668 prescriptions), followed by tricyclic and related antidepressants (61,901 patients had 533,798 prescriptions), other antidepressants (33,631 patients had 422,079 prescriptions), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (156 patients had a total of 1791 prescriptions). There were 83,784 combined prescriptions where two or more different antidepressant drugs were prescribed on the same day.

The three most commonly prescribed antidepressants were citalopram (1,023,255 prescriptions; 31.5%), fluoxetine (778,285; 23.9%) and amitriptyline (236,416; 7.3%), out of a total of 3,252,633 prescriptions (with combined prescriptions counting as single prescriptions). Numbers of prescriptions overall and by prescribed daily dose category for the 11 most commonly prescribed antidepressants are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Prescribed doses tended to be lowest for tricyclic and related antidepressants, with the exception of lofepramine, which had the highest prescribed doses.

### Citalopram (perrigo citalopram) [^05f82328]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Maintenance Treatment

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Systematic evaluation of Citalopram HBr Tablets in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total). In one study, patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of Citalopram HBr Tablets (20–60 mg/day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase, while in the other study, patients were assigned randomly to continuation of Citalopram HBr Tablets 20 or 40 mg/day, or placebo, for maintenance treatment. In the latter study, the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the two dose groups (see Clinical Efficacy Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Based on these limited data, it is not known whether the dose of citalopram needed to maintain euthymia is identical to the dose needed to induce remission. If adverse reactions are bothersome, a decrease in dose to 20 mg/day can be considered.

Discontinuation of Treatment with Citalopram HBr Tablets

Symptoms associated with discontinuation of Citalopram HBr Tablets and other SSRls and SNRls have been reported (see PRECAUTIONS). Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate.

Switching Patients To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor

At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of Citalopram HBr Tablet therapy. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Citalopram HBr Tablets before starting an MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).

### Comprehensive review and meta-analysis of psychological and pharmacological treatment for intermittent explosive disorder: insights from both case studies and randomized controlled trials [^f2674e0b]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Fluoxetine is typically administered in oral capsules or liquid form, with initial doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg daily, and the dose can be gradually increased depending on the patient's response and tolerance (Sohel et al.). Other SSRIs, such as sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro), have also been used off‐label for IED (Edinoff et al; Sanchez, Reines, and Montgomery). These drugs share similar mechanisms of action as fluoxetine, but they differ in terms of adverse effect profiles and individual response rates. For instance, while all SSRIs enhance serotonergic transmission, the incidence of side effects such as nausea, insomnia or sexual dysfunction may vary across medications, and treatment decisions are often tailored to patient‐specific needs (Chu and Wadhwa).

In addition to SSRIs, mood stabilizers are another prominent class of drugs used in managing IED, particularly when impulsive aggression is severe or coexists with mood dysregulation (Gould, Chen, and Manji). Lithium, valproate (Depakote) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) are the most commonly used mood stabilizers in this context (Coccaro and McCloskey). Lithium, in particular, has been widely studied and is known to modulate neurotransmitter activity, specifically balancing dopamine and serotonin, which helps regulate mood swings and reduce aggression (Malhi et al.). However, lithium's use requires close monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic window and significant side effects, such as hand tremors, polyuria (Gitlin; Malhi et al.) and potential long‐term effects on the kidneys and thyroid (Boivin et al.). Regular blood tests are necessary to prevent toxicity, which could result in neurological complications (Gitlin).

### A comparison of the risk of QT prolongation among SSRIs [^990a016a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report QT prolongation potential in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in order to advise clinicians on safe use of SSRIs other than citalopram in light of citalopram warnings.

Data Sources

Primary literature and case reports were identified through a systematic search. Data from drug manufacturers, package inserts, and the ArizonaCERT database were also utilized.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language studies and case reports were included.

Data Synthesis

Studies demonstrate possible dose-related clinically significant QT prolongation with escitalopram. Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline at traditional doses demonstrate a lack of clinically significant increases in QTc in the majority of studies. Further, paroxetine monotherapy shows a lack of clinically significant QTc prolongation in all studies. However, case reports or reporting tools still link these SSRIs with QTc prolongation. Fluoxetine, escitalopram, and sertraline used in post-acute coronary syndrome patients did not demonstrate risk of QTc prolongation.

Conclusion

For clinicians who choose not to use citalopram due to recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations, other antidepressants within this class may be considered. When citalopram is not utilized based on risk factors for TdP, use of escitalopram is not likely the safest alternative. Based on current literature, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline appear to have similar, low risk for QT prolongation, and paroxetine appears to have the lowest risk. However, there are significant limitations in interpreting the studies, including varying definitions of significant QT prolongation. Therefore, choice of an alternative SSRI should be based on individual risk factors for arrhythmias and other patient-specific factors.

### Maintenance or discontinuation of antidepressants in primary care [^e2214042]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with depression who are treated in primary care practices may receive antidepressants for prolonged periods. Data are limited on the effects of maintaining or discontinuing antidepressant therapy in this setting.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving adults who were being treated in 150 general practices in the United Kingdom. All the patients had a history of at least two depressive episodes or had been taking antidepressants for 2 years or longer and felt well enough to consider stopping antidepressants. Patients who had received citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, or mirtazapine were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to maintain their current antidepressant therapy (maintenance group) or to taper and discontinue such therapy with the use of matching placebo (discontinuation group). The primary outcome was the first relapse of depression during the 52-week trial period, as evaluated in a time-to-event analysis. Secondary outcomes were depressive and anxiety symptoms, physical and withdrawal symptoms, quality of life, time to stopping an antidepressant or placebo, and global mood ratings.

Results

A total of 1466 patients underwent screening. Of these patients, 478 were enrolled in the trial (238 in the maintenance group and 240 in the discontinuation group). The average age of the patients was 54 years; 73% were women. Adherence to the trial assignment was 70% in the maintenance group and 52% in the discontinuation group. By 52 weeks, relapse occurred in 92 of 238 patients (39%) in the maintenance group and in 135 of 240 (56%) in the discontinuation group (hazard ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.56 to 2.70; P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes were generally in the same direction as the primary outcome. Patients in the discontinuation group had more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and withdrawal than those in the maintenance group.

Conclusions

Among patients in primary care practices who felt well enough to discontinue antidepressant therapy, those who were assigned to stop their medication had a higher risk of relapse of depression by 52 weeks than those who were assigned to maintain their current therapy.

### Antidepressant use and risk of cardiovascular outcomes in people aged 20 to 64: cohort study using primary care database [^b216ffb4]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a drug safety communication in 2011, stating that citalopram should not be prescribed at doses greater than 40 mg per day, based on findings of QT interval prolongation in a study of 119 participants who received different doses of citalopram. The European Medicines Agency issued a similar safety warning in 2011. Further studies have reported QT interval prolongation with citalopram and also with some other antidepressants such as escitalopram and amitriptyline.QT interval prolongation can lead to arrhythmias including potentially fatal torsades de pointes, but few studies have specifically assessed risk of arrhythmia for different antidepressant drugs. A cohort study in predominantly older men of two different selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants found significantly lower risks of arrhythmia for doses of citalopram over 40 mg/day compared with doses of 1–20 mg/day, with similar findings for sertraline. A cohort study based on claims data in the United States found no significant differences in risk of ventricular arrhythmia/sudden death for 20 types of antidepressant drug compared with paroxetine, except for a higher risk in mirtazapine users.

Few observational studies of cardiovascular effects have examined associations with individual drugs, so evidence for specific commonly prescribed antidepressants is lacking, especially in younger people, as is evidence in relation to duration and dose. We therefore carried out a cohort study in people aged 20 to 64 to investigate the associations between different antidepressant drugs and the risk of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and stroke/transient ischaemic attack and also examined both dose and duration of use.

Statistical analysis

Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate associations between each of the outcomes and antidepressant drug exposure, using robust standard errors to allow for clustering of patients within practices and excluding patients from the analysis if they had the outcome recorded at baseline. The main analyses were based on the first 5 years of follow-up after study entry. We selected 5 years of follow-up for the main analyses as this includes periods of long-term treatment and allows more events to accrue to increase the power of the study compared with a shorter period. Patients prescribed monoamine oxidase inhibitors at any time were excluded from the analyses due to small numbers.

The analysis calculated unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) by antidepressant class treated as a time-varying exposure to allow for patients starting and stopping and also changing between treatments during follow-up. The reference category for these analyses was no current use of antidepressant treatment. This category included both unexposed time in patients treated with antidepressants at other time points during follow-up, as well as unexposed time from the group of patients who did not receive any prescriptions for antidepressants during follow-up. In an additional analysis we used treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as the reference category. We used Wald's significance tests to identify significant differences between the antidepressant classes.

Analyses were also performed for antidepressant dose with separate dose categories within each class (≤ 0.5, > 0.5 and ≤ 1.0, and > 1.0 defined daily doses). We carried out tests for trend for each class using dose as a continuous variable. Analyses were performed for time-varying exposures of time since starting treatment (categorised as no use, 1–28 days, 29–84 days, 85 or more days) and since stopping (1–28 days, 29–84 days and 85–182 days after stopping treatment) within each antidepressant class. The 11 most commonly prescribed antidepressants were also analysed separately, first using periods of time with no antidepressant treatment as the reference category then using citalopram (the most commonly prescribed antidepressant) as the reference category, and we used Wald's significance tests to identify significant differences between these 11 drugs. We tested for interactions between antidepressant class and age and also for the upper gastrointestinal bleed outcome we tested for interactions between antidepressant class and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin. We assessed the proportional hazards assumption using log minus log plots.

Citalopram — adult dosing and duration, dosing limits, adverse effects, and cautions are summarized: 20–40 mg/d; titrate up at intervals of at least one week, with an adequate trial of 8–16 weeks. The maximum recommended dose in patients with hepatic impairment is 20 mg/d due to decreased clearance and risk of QT prolongation, and for patients > 60 years of age the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg/d due to risk of QT prolongation. Notable adverse effects include nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, suicidal ideation, serotonin syndrome, QTc prolongation, and discontinuation syndrome. Comments include that it is contraindicated with MAOIs and within 14 days of starting or stopping MAOIs and to avoid using citalopram with other QTc prolonging drugs.
