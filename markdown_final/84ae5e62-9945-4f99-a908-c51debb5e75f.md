---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), now termed fetal growth restriction (FGR), specifically seeking information on its definition, pathophysiology, clinical course, prognosis, and risk factors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the distinction between FGR and small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, especially placental insufficiency and its hemodynamic consequences. Next, I will review the clinical course, including early- versus late-onset phenotypes and surveillance paradigms. After that, I need to assess prognosis across perinatal, infant, and long-term outcomes. Finally, I will examine maternal and fetal risk factors and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable summary, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline nuances as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate FGR with SGA. FGR is best conceptualized as failure to achieve genetically determined growth potential due to a pathological process, most commonly placental dysfunction, whereas SGA is a statistical designation of size below a population percentile and may include constitutionally small but healthy fetuses; clinically, FGR is suspected when estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference is below the 10th percentile, with stronger suspicion and often definitive diagnosis when below the 3rd percentile or when accompanied by abnormal Doppler indices indicating placental disease [^115R5Wkh]. Wait, let me verify the Doppler point: multiple guidelines converge on integrating umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities with size criteria to improve diagnostic specificity for pathologic growth restriction rather than relying on size alone, which reduces false positives from constitutional smallness [^113HbiCm].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology, and I need to ensure I anchor it to placental disease. The dominant mechanism is placental insufficiency from impaired spiral artery remodeling, leading to high-resistance, low-flow uteroplacental circulation with ischemia–reperfusion injury and oxidative stress; this produces a cascade of fetal hemodynamic adaptations, including increased umbilical artery impedance, redistribution of blood flow to vital organs (brain-sparing), and eventual venous compromise with ductus venosus abnormalities as hypoxia worsens [^116hR3H9] [^114GKVAh] [^113jNFNQ]. Hold on, I should verify that this mechanistic link also explains the frequent co-occurrence with preeclampsia and abruption; yes, these entities cluster as ischemic placental disease, reflecting shared early placental pathology and recurrence across pregnancies [^112oMLMk].

> Next, I should review the clinical course and phenotypes, and I need to be precise about timing thresholds. Early-onset FGR, typically diagnosed before 32 weeks, is less common, more severe, and strongly associated with umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities and maternal vascular malperfusion on placental pathology; surveillance centers on serial Doppler and biophysical testing to time delivery before irreversible hypoxic injury [^113heSLZ]. Late-onset FGR, diagnosed at or after 32 weeks, is more prevalent, often milder, and frequently has normal umbilical artery Doppler; diagnosis relies more on growth velocity deceleration and cerebroplacental ratio abnormalities, with a risk of sudden decompensation that mandates vigilant surveillance and judicious timing of delivery [^113heSLZ] [^1154xUFg]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the late-onset threshold was uniformly > 32 weeks; some sources use ≥ 32 weeks, but the clinical distinction remains consistent across guidelines, so I should acknowledge both conventions while emphasizing phenotype differences rather than a rigid cutoff [^113heSLZ] [^1154xUFg].

> I should double-check the surveillance paradigm so I don't overstate any single test. Umbilical artery Doppler is the primary surveillance tool after diagnosis, with frequency tailored to severity; absent or reversed end-diastolic flow warrants intensified monitoring and consideration of delivery, while ductus venosus and middle cerebral artery Doppler add prognostic value, particularly in early-onset disease, though their routine use for late-onset FGR is more controversial and should be contextualized [^113tcJkc] [^111NSibE] [^116kxSFS]. Let me reconsider the role of cardiotocography; CTG complements Doppler and biophysical assessment but should not be the sole surveillance modality in suspected FGR, especially preterm, to avoid missing evolving hypoxia–acidosis [^116erE5H] [^116kxSFS].

> Now, prognosis — this is where I need to be careful to separate immediate from long-term risks. Perinatally, FGR confers markedly increased risks of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, polycythemia, and iatrogenic prematurity; the stillbirth risk rises steeply as birthweight percentile falls, with the highest risk below the 3rd percentile, and term FGR infants still have a several-fold increase in perinatal mortality compared with appropriately grown peers [^115YYTJe] [^115zywNX]. Long-term, growth-restricted infants face higher rates of neurodevelopmental impairment, including cognitive delays and cerebral palsy, and elevated risks of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, with rapid early catch-up growth amplifying cardiometabolic risk via developmental programming; maternal survivors of placenta-mediated FGR have increased future cardiovascular risk, reinforcing the intergenerational implications of placental disease [^112VK1dk] [^112vogxp] [^117TsKSP].

> Let me think about risk factors, and I should categorize them to avoid omissions. Maternal factors include hypertensive disease, chronic renal disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, smoking, advanced age, low BMI, and certain ethnic backgrounds; obstetric factors include prior FGR or SGA, prior stillbirth, short interpregnancy interval, and assisted reproduction; fetal and placental factors include congenital anomalies, aneuploidy, multiple gestation, and placental morphologic abnormalities; environmental contributors include undernutrition, infectious diseases such as malaria and HIV, and toxic exposures, with risk profiles varying by geography and resource setting [^114iM5p4] [^116kxSFS] [^113HnGMm]. Hold on, I should verify the recurrence risk framing; prior FGR increases recurrence risk, and severity, early onset, and placental pathology further stratify that risk, which is crucial for counseling and preventive planning in subsequent pregnancies [^115WG5g5].

> I should confirm preventive and counseling strategies so I don't overpromise. Low-dose aspirin initiated at or before 16 weeks reduces the incidence of FGR in high-risk women, likely via effects on placental development; lifestyle modification, especially smoking cessation, and optimization of maternal comorbidities are foundational, while routine third-trimester ultrasound for all pregnancies is not supported by high-quality evidence for improving outcomes, though it may increase detection of SGA in some settings [^116h9r6d] [^113sgT7R] [^1117oqkm]. But wait, what if the patient asks about bed rest or supplements; current guidance advises against routine dietary modifications or unproven therapies for FGR prevention, emphasizing evidence-based risk reduction and surveillance instead [^1169Mzqr] [^116h9r6d].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing critical is missing. FGR is pathologic growth failure most often due to placental insufficiency, presenting as early-onset disease with overt Doppler abnormalities and as late-onset disease with subtler cerebroplacental adaptations; outcomes hinge on gestational age at diagnosis, severity, and surveillance, with delivery timing balancing stillbirth risk against prematurity, and long-term risks spanning neurodevelopmental and cardiometabolic domains; comprehensive risk assessment, serial ultrasound with Doppler, and guideline-concordant delivery thresholds are essential to optimize outcomes and counsel families accurately [^116kxSFS] [^115zywNX].

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is defined as **failure to reach genetic growth potential** [^1122qxVu] due to pathological constraints, most often placental insufficiency, and is distinct from constitutional smallness. It affects **3–10% of pregnancies** [^116kxSFS] and is a major cause of stillbirth, neonatal morbidity, and long-term neurodevelopmental and metabolic sequelae [^115zywNX] [^112VK1dk].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

- **Definition**: IUGR is the failure of a fetus to achieve its genetically determined growth potential due to pathological factors, most commonly placental dysfunction [^1122qxVu] [^112uUD75].

- **Diagnostic criteria**: Commonly diagnosed when estimated fetal weight (EFW) or abdominal circumference (AC) is below the 10th percentile for gestational age [^116kxSFS]; severe IUGR is often defined as EFW or AC below the 3rd percentile [^116kxSFS].

- **Distinction from SGA**: Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) refers to size below a population percentile and may include constitutionally small fetuses; IUGR implies pathological growth restriction and requires clinical correlation and, often, Doppler evidence of placental insufficiency [^1122qxVu] [^113HbiCm].

---

## Pathophysiology

IUGR arises from **multiple maternal, placental, and fetal factors**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Maternal | - Hypertension <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Smoking <br/> - Malnutrition <br/> - Autoimmune disease [^114iM5p4] [^113HnGMm] |
| Placental | - Placental insufficiency <br/> - Placenta previa <br/> - Abruptio placentae <br/> - Cord abnormalities [^1122qxVu] [^1154jfim] |
| Fetal | - Chromosomal abnormalities <br/> - Congenital anomalies <br/> - Intrauterine infections <br/> - Multiple gestation [^116kxSFS] [^116B1BZQ] |

---

The primary mechanism is **placental insufficiency**, characterized by inadequate maternal spiral artery remodeling, reduced uteroplacental perfusion, and chronic hypoxia, leading to fetal growth restriction [^113jNFNQ] [^114GKVAh].

---

## Clinical course

- **Antenatal course**: IUGR is typically detected through serial ultrasound assessments of fetal growth, umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry, and maternal risk factor screening [^111G64ZY] [^115xyMiz].

- **Perinatal complications**: Increased risk of preterm birth, neonatal asphyxia, hypoglycemia, polycythemia, and neonatal intensive care unit admission [^115zywNX].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Higher risk of neurodevelopmental impairment, cognitive deficits, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and growth restriction persisting into childhood [^112VK1dk] [^112vogxp].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with **severity, gestational age at diagnosis, and underlying etiology**. Severe early-onset IUGR carries higher risks of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment, whereas mild late-onset IUGR may have more favorable outcomes with appropriate management [^116oPYAc] [^1148CZmW].

---

## Risk factors

Several maternal, fetal, and placental factors **increase the risk** of IUGR:

- **Maternal factors**: Hypertension, diabetes, smoking, alcohol/drug use, malnutrition, autoimmune disease, advanced maternal age, and low socioeconomic status [^114iM5p4] [^113HnGMm].

- **Fetal factors**: Chromosomal abnormalities, congenital anomalies, intrauterine infections, and multiple gestation [^116kxSFS] [^116B1BZQ].

- **Placental factors**: Placental insufficiency, placenta previa, abruptio placentae, and cord abnormalities [^1122qxVu] [^1154jfim].

---

## Management strategies

- **Antenatal surveillance**: Regular ultrasound monitoring of fetal growth, umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry, and maternal blood pressure monitoring [^111G64ZY] [^113tcJkc].

- **Timing of delivery**: Based on gestational age, severity of IUGR, and fetal surveillance results; early-onset severe IUGR may require preterm delivery, while mild late-onset cases may proceed to term with close monitoring [^116oPYAc] [^115dFNPy].

- **Preventive measures**: Aspirin prophylaxis in high-risk women, smoking cessation, and optimization of maternal health conditions [^116h9r6d] [^114SkTpN].

---

IUGR is a pathological growth failure with significant perinatal and long-term consequences; **early detection, surveillance, and timely intervention** are essential to optimize outcomes [^112uUD75].

### Intrauterine growth-restricted neonates born at term or preterm: how different? [^1148fEcX]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Late onset intrauterine growth restriction is a common form of growth restriction, mainly caused by placenta-vascular insufficiency. Whether the intrauterine or extrauterine environment offers a better long-term outcome for the growth-restricted fetus remains unclear. We compared the risk factors and long-term outcomes of late onset growth-restricted neonates delivered between 31–36 weeks of gestation vs those delivered at term. This prospective cohort study included 114 preterm and 193 term born growth-restricted neonates. They underwent a neurobehavioral examination (neonatal period), a neurodevelopmental assessment and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (age 2 years), and neuromotor assessment and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (age 6 years). Growth-restricted neonates born prematurely exhibited a significantly higher incidence of maternal hypertension, a maternal history of abortions and stillbirths, increased intrapartum and postnatal complication rates, and abnormal neonatal neurobehavioral scores than expected. Both preterm and term born growth-restricted groups, however, exhibited comparable long-term neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcomes at ages 2 and 6 years. Although prematurely born neonates undergo an earlier growth restriction process and exhibit a higher perinatal risk factor profile, their long-term outcomes are comparable to those of growth-restricted neonates born at term.

### Evaluation and management of suspected fetal growth restriction [^113exixv]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Impaired fetal growth owing to placental insufficiency is a major contributor to adverse perinatal outcomes. No intervention is available that improves outcomes by changing the pathophysiologic process. Monitoring in early-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR) focuses on optimizing the timing of iatrogenic preterm delivery using cardiotocography and Doppler ultrasound. In late-onset FGR, identifying the fetus at risk for immediate hypoxia and who benefits from expedited delivery is challenging. It is likely that studies in the next decade will provide evidence how to best integrate different monitoring variables and other prognosticators in risk models that are aimed to optimize individual treatment strategies.

5 EARLY PREDICTION AND PREVENTION OF FETAL GROWTH RESTRICTION

Early prediction of FGR is important as it can identify women at high risk of FGR who may benefit from preventive interventions and close monitoring during pregnancy. Box 4 lists the most common risk factors for FGR. While the predictive value of individual risk factors is low, clinical prediction models that are based on combinations of the risk factors outlined below can considerably improve the prediction of FGR. One important limitation of most of the studies on early prediction of FGR is the lack of a gold standard for the antenatal or postnatal diagnosis of FGR. As such, there is wide variation among studies regarding the outcomes being predicted, including either SGA (birth weight below the 10th or 3rd percentile) or adverse perinatal outcomes that are associated with (but are not specific to) FGR. As many SGA infants are constitutionally small and healthy, differentiating between healthy small fetuses and those that are small due to FGR is critically important. As a rule, the prediction of early‐onset severe FGR is better than of late‐onset FGR.

Box 4
Risk factors for fetal growth restriction.

5.1 History‐based risk factors

Several maternal factors influence fetal growth and the risk of FGR: advanced maternal age, racial/ethnic origin (e.g. South Asian), consanguinity, low body mass index, nulliparity, use of recreational drugs and alcohol, assisted reproductive technology, and medical disorders such as chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune conditions (Box 4). 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for FGR and reduces birth weight by an average of 200 g in a dose–response manner. 90 In a cohort of 33 602 pregnancies, maternal characteristics predicted 37% of women who subsequently delivered SGA neonates (birth weight < 5th percentile) at a false‐positive rate of 10%. 83

Some risk factors for FGR are especially relevant in low‐resource countries. In a recent review from Africa, the main risk factors reported were low maternal nutritional status, HIV infection, malaria, and hypertensive diseases. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that to a large extent FGR in Africa is preventable through established interventions for malaria, HIV, and maternal undernutrition. 42 In addition, exposure during pregnancy and lactation to toxic environmental chemicals and heavy metals has become a growing problem, especially in low‐resource countries. 91

### Routine third-trimester ultrasound assessment for intrauterine growth restriction [^1117oqkm]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine growth restriction significantly impacts perinatal outcomes. Undetected IUGR escalates the risk of adverse outcomes. Serial symphysis-fundal height measurement, a recommended strategy, is insufficient in detecting abnormal fetal growth. Routine third-trimester ultrasounds significantly improve detection rates compared with this approach, but direct high-quality evidence supporting enhanced perinatal outcomes from routine scanning is lacking. In assessing fetal growth, abdominal circumference alone performs comparably to estimated fetal weight. Hadlock formulas demonstrate accurate fetal weight estimation across diverse gestational ages and settings. When choosing growth charts, prescriptive standards (encompassing healthy pregnancies) should be prioritized over descriptive ones. Customized fetal standards may enhance antenatal IUGR detection, but conclusive high-quality evidence is elusive. Emerging observational data suggest that longitudinal fetal growth assessment could predict adverse outcomes better. However, direct randomized trial evidence supporting this remains insufficient.

4.2.2 Early‐ versus late‐onset FGR

It has been suggested that FGR should be broadly classified, based on gestational age at the time of diagnosis, into early‐onset FGR (< 32 weeks) and late‐onset FGR (≥ 32 weeks). The rationale underlying this classification is based on differences between these two phenotypes of FGR in severity, natural history, Doppler findings, association with hypertensive complications, placental findings, and management. 16, 17, 18

Early‐onset FGR has a prevalence of 0.5%–1%, is usually more severe, and is more likely to be associated with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler than late‐onset FGR. The underlying placental pathology is frequently similar to that observed in cases of early‐onset pre‐eclampsia (maternal vascular malperfusion), which explains the strong association of early‐onset FGR with pre‐eclampsia. Therefore, early‐onset FGR is usually easier to detect, and the natural history tends to follow a predictable sequence of Doppler changes in the umbilical artery and ductus venosus. The main challenge in cases of early‐onset FGR is management (i.e. timing of delivery), by attempting to determine the optimal balance between the opposing risks of stillbirth and prematurity. 19

Late‐onset FGR is more common than early‐onset FGR with a prevalence of 5%–10%. In contrast to early‐onset FGR, it is usually milder, is less likely to be associated with pre‐eclampsia, and is usually associated with normal umbilical artery Doppler. Therefore, the main challenge with regard to late‐onset FGR is diagnosis, while management (i.e. delivery) is relatively simple given that the diagnosis is commonly made during the late‐preterm or term periods, where the risks associated with delivery are relatively small. The diagnosis of late‐onset FGR mainly relies on adaptive changes in the cerebral circulation ("redistribution" or "brain‐sparing effect"), which is reflected by low resistance to flow in the middle cerebral artery thereby generating a low cerebroplacental ratio, as described in section 8.1.7. Given that the umbilical artery and ductus venosus Doppler studies are usually normal in cases of late‐onset FGR, the natural history in these cases is less predictable and there is a risk of sudden decompensation and stillbirth. 16, 19

### A practical approach to fetal growth restriction [^115z1f5f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Fetal growth restriction is one of the most complex problems encountered by obstetricians. Ultrasound-estimated fetal weight less than the 10th percentile for the gestational age is the most widely accepted diagnostic criterion. Management protocols vary from institution to institution. Doppler velocimetry provides valuable information about fetal status. We offer a practical approach to management and timing of delivery based on available data in the literature.

### The role of aspirin, heparin, and other interventions in the prevention and treatment of fetal growth restriction [^113jNFNQ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Fetal growth restriction and related placental pathologies such as preeclampsia, stillbirth, and placental abruption are believed to arise in early pregnancy when inadequate remodeling of the maternal spiral arteries leads to persistent high-resistance and low-flow uteroplacental circulation. The consequent placental ischaemia, reperfusion injury, and oxidative stress are associated with an imbalance in angiogenic/antiangiogenic factors. Many interventions have centered on the prevention and/or treatment of preeclampsia with results pertaining to fetal growth restriction and small-for-gestational-age pregnancy often included as secondary outcomes because of the common pathophysiology. This renders the study findings less reliable for determining clinical significance. For the prevention of fetal growth restriction, a recent large-study level meta-analysis and individual patient data meta-analysis confirm that aspirin modestly reduces small-for-gestational-age pregnancy in women at high risk (relative risk, 0.90, 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.00) and that a dose of ≥ 100 mg should be recommended and to start at or before 16 weeks of gestation. These findings support national clinical practice guidelines. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that low-molecular-weight heparin may prevent fetal growth restriction; however, evidence from randomized control trials is inconsistent. A meta-analysis of multicenter trial data does not demonstrate any positive preventative effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on a primary composite outcome of placenta-mediated complications including fetal growth restriction (18% vs 18%; absolute risk difference, 0.6%; 95% confidence interval, 10.4–9.2); use of low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of fetal growth restriction should remain in the research setting. There are even fewer treatment options once fetal growth restriction is diagnosed. At present the only management option if the risk of hypoxia, acidosis, and intrauterine death is high is iatrogenic preterm birth, with the use of peripartum maternal administration of magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection and corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity, to prevent adverse neonatal outcomes. The pipeline of potential therapies use different strategies, many aiming to increase fetal growth by improving poor placentation and uterine blood flow. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors that potentiate nitric oxide availability such as sildenafil citrate have been extensively researched both in preclinical and clinical studies; results from the Sildenafil Therapy In Dismal Prognosis Early-Onset Intrauterine Growth Restriction consortium of randomized control clinical trials are keenly awaited. Targeting the uteroplacental circulation with novel therapeutics is another approach, the most advanced being maternal vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy, which is being translated into the clinic via the doEs Vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy safEly impRove outcome in seveRe Early-onset fetal growth reSTriction consortium. Other targeting approaches include nanoparticles and microRNAs to deliver drugs locally to the uterine arterial endothelium or trophoblast. In vitro and in vivo studies and animal models have demonstrated effects of nitric oxide donors, dietary nitrate, hydrogen sulphide donors, statins, and proton pump inhibitors on maternal blood pressure, uteroplacental resistance indices, and angiogenic/antiangiogenic factors. Data from human pregnancies and, in particular, pregnancies with fetal growth restriction remain very limited. Early research into melatonin, creatine, and N-acetyl cysteine supplementation in pregnancy suggests they may have potential as neuro- and cardioprotective agents in fetal growth restriction.

### Monitoring and timing of delivery in suspected late fetal growth restriction at term [^1148CZmW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Infants affected by late fetal growth restriction are at risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, either due to placental insufficiency or the consequences of late iatrogenic prematurity. There is no randomized trial reporting the optimal timing of delivery, and recommending delivery at 37 weeks can cause harm. Antenatal ultrasound parameters can be used to risk-stratify these pregnancies into low-risk cases, which are associated with a lower likelihood of adverse outcomes and are thus suitable for full-term delivery, and high-risk cases, which may benefit from early-term delivery.

Objective

This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the performance of an antenatal risk stratification and management protocol in reducing severe adverse perinatal outcomes in fetuses with late fetal growth restriction.

Study Design

This was a prospective study of singleton pregnancies with nonanomalous fetuses at ≥ 32 weeks of gestation with suspected late fetal growth restriction managed between 2018 and 2022 at University College London Hospital, United Kingdom. Pregnancies with unknown outcome or diagnosis of a structural, chromosomal, or genetic abnormality were excluded (but women with placenta previa were included). At 36 weeks, fetuses were classified as low-risk if the estimated fetal weight was between the third and 10th centiles with normal Doppler findings and no abdominal circumference drop, or if the estimated fetal weight was > 10th centile with an abdominal circumference drop ≥ 50 centiles from previous scans and/or a cerebroplacental ratio below the fifth centile. The high-risk group included all fetuses with an estimated fetal weight below the third centile, fetuses of any size with an umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index > 95th centile, and fetuses with an estimated fetal weight between the third and 10th centiles with at least one of the following features: a mean maternal uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index > 95th centile, an abdominal circumference drop ≥ 50 centiles, or a cerebroplacental ratio below the 5th centile. Delivery was advised at 40 to 41 weeks of gestation in the low-risk group or 37 to 38 weeks in the high-risk group. The primary outcome was a composite of severe adverse perinatal outcomes (perinatal mortality and severe morbidity including acidosis at birth, mechanical ventilation, encephalopathy, use of inotropes, and infections). Based on expert consensus and targeting a clinically meaningful 5% difference between the 2 groups, our sample size calculation determined that 372 patients were required in each group (alpha, 0.05; power, 85%). Adverse maternal outcome was defined as operative delivery due to abnormal intrapartum fetal heart rate. Multiple logistic regression analysis and modeling to estimate the risk of severe adverse perinatal outcome at different gestational ages were performed.

Results

After exclusions, 1002 of the original 1065 patients were included (594 in the low-risk and 408 in the high-risk groups). There was a significant difference in gestational age at delivery between the low- and high-risk groups: 39 +4 (interquartile range, 38 +6 +3) vs 38 +0 (37 +2 +5) weeks (P < .001). Neonates from pregnancies classified as low-risk were less likely to have severe adverse perinatal outcomes (3.2% vs 8.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–3.9; p = 0.02). There was no difference in adverse maternal outcome between the low- and high-risk groups (20.5% vs 24.8%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.9–1.6, P = 0.23). There were no cases of extended perinatal mortality (including stillbirth, neonatal death, and infant death up to 6 months) in the low-risk group (4 cases in the high-risk group).

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that appropriate risk stratification of singleton nonanomalous fetuses with late fetal growth restriction enables conservative term management for pregnancies at low risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, with lower adverse perinatal outcomes compared with high-risk late fetal growth restriction cases, without an increase in perinatal mortality and maternal interventions.

5.5.2 Medical interventions

Most studies on early prevention of placental complications have focused on pre‐eclampsia, with the results often being extrapolated to FGR due to the common pathophysiology. However, to date, other than lifestyle modifications, no medical interventions to prevent FGR have been clearly established.

Aspirin is recommended for women at increased risk of pre‐eclampsia, but there is some evidence that it may also reduce the risk of FGR 130, 131 In a recent meta‐analysis of 45 trials that included 20 909 women at high risk of pre‐eclampsia, the administration of aspirin starting at less than or equal to 16 weeks of pregnancy reduced the risk of FGR by nearly half (RR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44–0.70), with higher dosages of aspirin associated with a greater reduction, favoring a dose of 100–150 mg. 132 A second individual patient data meta‐analysis also supported earlier initiation of aspirin for the prevention of FGR, with an RR of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.61–0.94) for women randomized before 16 weeks versus an RR of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.84–1.08) for women randomized at 16 weeks or beyond. 131 One randomized trial found that evening but not morning administration of aspirin is associated with reduction in the rate of pre‐eclampsia and FGR. 133 However, it should be emphasized that most of the available data on aspirin come from studies that focused on the prevention of pre‐eclampsia as the primary outcome in women at high risk of pre‐eclampsia, with the prevention of FGR considered only as a secondary outcome. Furthermore, in the largest trial to date on the use of aspirin for the prevention of pre‐eclampsia (ASPRE trial), aspirin was not associated with a reduction in the risk of SGA below the 10th, 5th, or 3rd percentile. 130 However, we believe that given the safety of aspirin and the overlap in the risk factors and pathogenesis of pre‐eclampsia and FGR, it is reasonable to recommend aspirin to women at high risk of FGR, using the same regimen of aspirin used for women at high risk of pre‐eclampsia. Most international guidelines recommend 100–150 mg aspirin to prevent FGR in women at high risk. 134

### Fetal growth restriction: ACOG practice bulletin, number 227 [^113HG87R]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction, also known as intrauterine growth restriction, is a common complication of pregnancy that has been associated with a variety of adverse perinatal outcomes. There is a lack of consensus regarding terminology, etiology, and diagnostic criteria for fetal growth restriction, with uncertainty surrounding the optimal management and timing of delivery for the growth-restricted fetus. An additional challenge is the difficulty in differentiating between the fetus that is constitutionally small and fulfilling its growth potential and the small fetus that is not fulfilling its growth potential because of an underlying pathologic condition. The purpose of this document is to review the topic of fetal growth restriction with a focus on terminology, etiology, diagnostic and surveillance tools, and guidance for management and timing of delivery.

### Evidence-based national guidelines for the management of suspected fetal growth restriction: comparison, consensus, and controversy [^113sgT7R]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Small for gestational age is usually defined as an infant with a birthweight < 10th centile for a population or customized standard. Fetal growth restriction refers to a fetus that has failed to reach its biological growth potential because of placental dysfunction. Small-for-gestational-age babies make up 28–45% of nonanomalous stillbirths, and have a higher chance of neurodevelopmental delay, childhood and adult obesity, and metabolic disease. The majority of small-for-gestational-age babies are not recognized before birth. Improved identification, accompanied by surveillance and timely delivery, is associated with reduction in small-for-gestational-age stillbirths. Internationally and regionally, detection of small for gestational age and management of fetal growth problems vary considerably. The aim of this review is to: summarize areas of consensus and controversy between recently published national guidelines on small for gestational age or fetal growth restriction; highlight any recent evidence that should be incorporated into existing guidelines; and identify future research priorities in this field. A search of MEDLINE, Google, and the International Guideline Library identified 6 national guidelines on management of pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction/small for gestational age published from 2010 onwards. There is general consensus between guidelines (at least 4 of 6 guidelines in agreement) in early pregnancy risk selection, and use of low-dose aspirin for women with major risk factors for placental insufficiency. All highlight the importance of smoking cessation to prevent small for gestational age. While there is consensus in recommending fundal height measurement in the third trimester, 3 specify the use of a customized growth chart, while 2 recommend McDonald rule. Routine third-trimester scanning is not recommended for small-for-gestational-age screening, while women with major risk factors should have serial scanning in the third trimester. Umbilical artery Doppler studies in suspected small-for-gestational-age pregnancies are universally advised, however there is inconsistency in the recommended frequency for growth scans after diagnosis of small for gestational age/fetal growth restriction (2–4 weekly). In late-onset fetal growth restriction (≥ 32 weeks) general consensus is to use cerebral Doppler studies to influence surveillance and/or delivery timing. Fetal surveillance methods (most recommend cardiotocography) and recommended timing of delivery vary. There is universal agreement on the use of corticosteroids before birth at < 34 weeks, and general consensus on the use of magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection in early-onset fetal growth restriction (< 32 weeks). Most guidelines advise using cardiotocography surveillance to plan delivery in fetal growth restriction < 32 weeks. The recommended gestation at delivery for fetal growth restriction with absent and reversed end-diastolic velocity varies from 32 to ≥ 34 weeks and 30 to ≥ 34 weeks, respectively. Overall, where there is high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, eg, use of umbilical artery Doppler and corticosteroids for delivery < 34 weeks, there is a high degree of consistency between national small-for-gestational-age guidelines. This review discusses areas where there is potential for convergence between small-for-gestational-age guidelines based on existing randomized controlled trials of management of small-for-gestational-age pregnancies, and areas of controversy. Research priorities include assessing the utility of late third-trimester scanning to prevent major morbidity and mortality and to investigate the optimum timing of delivery in fetuses with late-onset fetal growth restriction and abnormal Doppler parameters. Prospective studies are needed to compare new international population ultrasound standards with those in current use.

9.2 Maternal follow‐up

It is well established that women with a history of pregnancy complicated by FGR or other placenta‐mediated complications such as pre‐eclampsia are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular disease, especially in the presence of early‐onset disease. In a population‐based study that included more than 100 000 pregnancies and provided maternal follow‐up for 15–19 years, delivery of a low birth weight infant was associated with increased maternal risk of ischemic heart disease or death (aHR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5–2.4). 417 Moreover, a combination of FGR, pre‐eclampsia, and preterm delivery amplified the risk of disease seven‐fold. For a detailed review of the evidence supporting these associations, their underlying mechanisms, and recommendations on maternal follow‐up and prevention strategies please refer to the recently published FIGO postpregnancy initiative on long‐term maternal implications of pregnancy complications and follow‐up considerations. 4

9.3 Counselling regarding future pregnancies

The most frequent and relevant question that care providers are being asked by couples whose prior pregnancy was complicated by FGR relates to the likelihood of a similar complication in subsequent pregnancies. The answer to this question is often difficult and depends on several factors, namely the underlying etiology, severity and timing of onset, and the presence or absence of modifiable risk factors (e.g. maternal medical conditions or smoking). In cases of placenta‐mediated FGR, the results of the placental histopathological examination may provide valuable information that can assist care providers in counselling patients regarding the risk of recurrence, role of further investigation, and potential preventive interventions in subsequent pregnancies.

4.2 Terminology and definitions

FGR is defined as the failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor, most commonly placental dysfunction. Clinically, this is reflected by a drop in fetal size percentiles over the course of gestation. However, fetal growth potential is difficult to determine, and serial assessments of fetal size to detect a drop in fetal weight percentile are usually not available. Instead, care providers most commonly have only a "snapshot" of fetal weight estimation at a given point in time. Therefore, in clinical practice, small for gestational age (SGA), defined as estimated fetal weight (EFW) or abdominal circumference below a certain threshold such as the 10th or 3rd percentile, is most commonly used to suspect FGR.

The use of SGA as a proxy for FGR has several limitations that need to be recognized. First, most SGA fetuses are constitutionally healthy small fetuses, whose smallness is merely the result of their predetermined growth potential (i.e. false‐positive diagnosis of FGR). Second, some growth‐restricted fetuses, depending on their original growth potential and timing of insult, may remain above the percentile threshold described above and may thus not be SGA (i.e. false‐negative diagnosis of FGR). Third, the use of SGA as a proxy for FGR is limited by the accuracy of sonographic fetal weight estimation, which has an estimation error of up to ± 15%–20%. Finally, the diagnosis of SGA is highly dependent on the growth chart being used, which can therefore have a considerable effect on the proportion of fetuses or infants flagged as SGA in a given population.

It should be noted that there is inconsistency in the literature regarding the terminology described above, where some use the term FGR to describe a fetus with an estimated weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and the term SGA to describe an infant with birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age. However, for the purpose of this article, the term SGA is used to indicate an EFW or birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, and the term FGR to refer to a small fetus that has failed to achieve its growth potential because of a pathologic process.

9.3.4 Preconception counselling and management of future pregnancies

Given the considerable risk of recurrence of FGR, efforts should be made to decrease this risk in future pregnancies. 448 Modifiable risk factors for FGR such as smoking or poor nutritional status should be identified as early as possible and managed accordingly, as discussed in section 5.5.1.

There is some evidence that administration of aspirin can reduce the risk of FGR. However, as described in section 5.5.2 most available data focused on the prevention of pre‐eclampsia as the primary outcome in women at high risk of pre‐eclampsia, with the prevention of FGR being considered a secondary outcome. Data on the prevention of recurrence of FGR in women with a history of FGR are limited. 449 Therefore, some recommend that aspirin should be considered in women with past FGR only if they have risk factors for pre‐eclampsia at the time of the next pregnancy. 450 However, we believe that given the safety of aspirin and the overlap in pathogenesis of pre‐eclampsia and FGR, it is reasonable to recommend aspirin to women with a history of placenta‐mediated FGR in the previous pregnancy, using the same regimen of aspirin used for the prevention of pre‐eclampsia. This recommendation is shared by most professional societies. 134

Data on the role of LMWH to prevent recurrence of placenta‐mediated complications including FGR are conflicting, and this topic is reviewed in section 5.5.2. Based on available data, LMWH therapy should not be used in women with a past history of FGR except in a research setting.

Given the association of insufficient gestational weight gain with FGR, we recommend monitoring of weight gain and informing women about their target weight gain range, as described in section 5.5.1. Other interventions, such as bed rest or nutritional supplements are of unproven benefit and should not be routinely offered. 451, 452 The risk of recurrence can be further stratified in early pregnancy by means of prenatal screening with biochemical markers (PAPP‐A, beta hCG, alpha‐fetoprotein, and PlGF) as well as by uterine artery Doppler, as described in section 5. Due to the increased risk of recurrence, pregnant women with a history of FGR in a previous pregnancy should be managed in a high‐risk pregnancy clinic and should receive closer antenatal surveillance, including close monitoring of fetal growth and maternal blood pressure. 453

### Integrated testing and management in fetal growth restriction [^111di7hZ]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Growth-restricted fetuses are at higher risk for poor perinatal and long-term outcome than those who are appropriately grown. Multiple antenatal testing modalities can help document the sequence of fetal deterioration. The full extent of this compromise is best identified by a combination of fetal biometry, biophysical profile scoring, and arterial and venous Doppler. In the preterm growth-restricted fetus, timing of delivery is critically determined by the balance of fetal versus neonatal risks. In the near-term fetus, accurate diagnosis continues to be a challenge as unrecognized growth restriction contributes to a significant proportion of unexplained stillbirths. In this review, we present an integrated diagnostic and surveillance approach that accounts for these factors.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intrauterine growth restriction, more specifically with respect to uterine artery Doppler ultrasound, RCOG 2013 guidelines recommend to recognize that subsequent normalization of flow velocity indices in patients with an abnormal uterine artery Doppler at 20–24 weeks of gestation is still associated with an increased risk of a SGA infant and repeating uterine artery Doppler is therefore of limited value.

### Abnormal fetal growth: small for gestational age, fetal growth restriction, large for gestational age: definitions and epidemiology [^115CRdAi]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Abnormal fetal growth (growth restriction and overgrowth) is associated with perinatal morbidity, mortality, and lifelong risks to health. To describe abnormal growth, "small for gestational age" and "large for gestational age" are commonly used terms. However, both are statistical definitions of fetal size below or above a certain threshold related to a reference population, rather than referring to an abnormal condition. Fetuses can be constitutionally small or large and thus healthy, whereas fetuses with seemingly normal size can be growth restricted or overgrown. Although golden standards to detect abnormal growth are lacking, understanding of both pathologic conditions has improved significantly.

3 ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND GRADING OF STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATIONS

In assessing the quality of evidence and grading of strength of recommendations, the article follows the terminology proposed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. 5 This system uses consistent language and graphical descriptions for the strength and quality of the recommendations and the evidence on which they are based.

Recommendations are classified as strong or conditional (weak) (Table S1). 6 The strength of recommendation is dependent not only on the quality of evidence, but also on factors such as risk–benefit, cost, resource allocation, values, and preferences. Thus, some recommendations may be based on low‐quality evidence but still represent a benefit that outweighs the risks and burdens, and therefore may be strongly recommended.

The overall quality of evidence was assessed for each of the recommendations and expressed using four levels of quality: very low, low, moderate, and high (Table S2). 7 Considerations for quality of evidence include primarily the study design and methodology. As such, evidence based on randomized controlled trials is considered high‐quality evidence, observational studies provide moderate or low quality of evidence, and all others are very low. However, other parameters must be considered while assessing the level of evidence: risk of bias, study limitations, consistency of results, precision, publication bias, indirectness of evidence, and scarcity of evidence. For the quality of evidence, cross‐filled circles are used: ⊕○○○ denotes very low‐quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○ low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○ moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕ high‐quality evidence.

### Identification of key genes in pathogenesis of placental insufficiency intrauterine growth restriction [^1154jfim]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Intrauterine growth restriction is defined as a fetus that fails to achieve its genetically determined growth potential. Intrauterine growth restriction is generally diagnosed as an estimated fetal weight less than the 10th percentile for gestational age. Intrauterine growth restriction is a major cause of neonatal neurological/respiratory morbidities and perinatal mortality. Intrauterine growth restriction can be related to maternal, fetal, placental and environmental factors. Maternal risk factors associated with IUGR include maternal diabetes, pre-existing hypertension, cyanotic heart disease, and obesity. Intrauterine growth restriction is also associated with fetal genetic disorders such as chromosomal abnormalities, congenital abnormalities, and infection. Placental or umbilical cord abnormalities, such as placenta previa, placental tumors, and cord anomalies, are important etiological factors that can contribute to IUGR; IUGR with such kind of clinical symptoms is usually classified as placental insufficiency IUGR. To date, in normal obstetric practice, there has been little progress in detection, prevention, and treatment for placental insufficiency IUGR.

An estimated fetal weight less than the 10th percentile for gestational age, associated with an abnormal pulsatility index of the umbilical artery, is routinely used to diagnose IUGR and take measures to improve the outcome in the late stage of pregnancy. These diagnostic criteria are still based on non-specific index and symptoms, with difficulty in timely and accurately identifying and managing placental insufficiency IUGR. At the serum protein level, the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio has been shown to be useful for predicting the real risk of developing IUGR among patients with sensitivity 44.4%, but the ratio needs to be used jointly with maternal factors (for example hypertension, diabetes) and ultrasound biometries to increase the sensitivity (84.1%). The occurrence of placental insufficiency IUGR has been reported to be correlated with activation of genes such as TGFβ, NOD1, LEP. However, the development of placental insufficiency IUGR is a complex and progressive process, little is known about the exact molecular pathogenesis of placental insufficiency IUGR; therefore, it remains of great significance to clarify genes contributing to placental insufficiency IUGR.

### Prediction and prevention of ischemic placental disease [^112oMLMk]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and placental abruption are obstetrical conditions that constitute the syndrome of ischemic placental disease or IPD, the leading cause of indicated preterm birth and an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. While the phenotypic manifestations vary significantly for preeclampsia, IUGR, and abruption, these conditions may share a common underlying etiology as evidenced by: (1) shared clinical risk factors, (2) increased recurrence risk across pregnancies as well as increased co-occurrence of IPD conditions within a pregnancy, and (3) findings that suggest the underlying pathophysiologic processes may be similar. IPD is of major clinical importance and accounts for a large proportion of indicated preterm delivery ranging from the periviable to late preterm period. Successful prevention of IPD and resultant preterm delivery could substantially improve neonatal and maternal outcomes. This article will review the following topics: (1) The complicated research literature on aspirin and the prevention of preeclampsia and IUGR. (2) Research evidence on other medical interventions to prevent IPD. (3) New clinical interventions currently under investigations, including statins. (4) Current clinical recommendations for prevention of ischemic placental disease.

9.3.1 Risk of recurrence based on severity and onset

Most of the data on the risk of recurrence of placenta‐mediated complications come from studies evaluating hypertensive complications of pregnancy. In a recent individual patient data meta‐analysis of 22 studies, the overall risk of recurrence of hypertensive complications was 21%, and was higher in women who experienced early‐onset hypertensive complications. 418 Data on the recurrence of FGR are limited. 419, 420, 421, 422 In a population‐based study, the overall recurrence rate of FGR in women who gave birth to an infant with a birth weight below the 10th percentile was 24%, compared with 6% in women without a history of FGR (OR 3.9; 95% CI, 3.7–4.0). The risk of recurrence was related to the severity of FGR, and was nearly six‐fold when the infant birth weight was below the 5th percentile (OR 5.7; 95% CI, 5.4–6.0). 423 Thus, couples with FGR in the first pregnancy can be reassured that the overall chance of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is less than 25%. However, interpretation of the data is limited by the lack of distinction between constitutionally SGA infants and infants who were truly growth restricted, as much of the association described in that study may be driven by the recurrence of constitutional SGA. Therefore, counselling regarding the risk of recurrence should be further refined based on the risk factors of the individual patient, severity of FGR as reflected by timing of onset and Doppler findings, the co‐presence of pre‐eclampsia, and placental histopathological findings.

9.3.2 Risk of recurrence based on placental histopathology

The results of the placental histopathological examination are important for two main reasons. First, they may assist care providers in counselling couples regarding the most likely etiology of FGR, especially when the clinical presentation and Doppler findings were inconclusive. Second, placental findings may provide valuable information regarding the risk of recurrence, as certain types of placental pathologies are associated with a relatively high recurrence rate. The main types of placental pathologies, the clinical phenotypes associated with these pathologies, and their estimated risks of recurrence are summarized in Table 2. 424, 425, 426

4 FETAL GROWTH RESTRICTION: BACKGROUND, DEFINITION, ETIOLOGY, AND RISKS

4.1 Background

FGR is a common pregnancy complication that worldwide is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short‐ and long‐term neonatal morbidity. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The definition, diagnosis, and optimal management of FGR have generated controversy as clinicians strive for more harmonized care.

The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of the available evidence and provide recommendations regarding the early prediction and prevention, diagnosis, investigation, monitoring, and timing of delivery of pregnancies complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this pregnancy complication. Given the variation in resources and expertise available for the assessment and monitoring of pregnancies complicated by FGR in different countries or regions, we have included, in addition to the standard of care or "best" recommendations, specific recommendations for low‐resource settings, which are marked asin the recommendation tables. Management algorithms for women in high‐resource and low‐resource settings are summarized in Figure 1a, b, respectively.

9 POSTPARTUM ASSESSMENT AND COUNSELLING FOR FUTURE PREGNANCIES

9.1 Infant follow‐up

Growth‐restricted infants are at increased risk of both immediate and long‐term complications, and therefore require closer follow‐up than normally grown infants in the first years of life.

Growth‐restricted infants have lower survival rates compared with those appropriate for gestational age. 403 Although this may be attributed in part to prematurity that is often associated with FGR, birth weight has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for neonatal mortality, irrespective of gestational age. 404 In a population‐based cohort study, the mortality rate of term FGR neonates was approximately five‐fold higher compared with appropriate for gestational age neonates (0.3% vs 0.06%). 405

FGR can affect postnatal growth. In cases of mild FGR, infants tend to achieve normal height during the first year of life. 406 In cases affected by severe FGR, however, height in the late teens is lower than those born appropriate for gestational age (169.9 ± 1.5 vs 175.4 ± 0.8 cm; p < 0.0001 for boys; and 159.4 ± 1.3 vs 163.1 ± 0.8 cm; p < 0.0005 for girls). 407

FGR infants are also at increased risk of adverse long‐term neurodevelopmental outcomes. A systematic review of this topic found that FGR infants are at higher risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes measured up to 3 years of age; however, high levels of heterogeneity in primary outcomes were reported in the studies included in the review. 12 Of note, adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes may at least partly be related to coexisting increased prematurity rates. 408

In line with the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis, FGR has been associated, in both animal and human studies, with an increased risk of future noncommunicable diseases including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. 409, 410, 411 The risk is especially high in those infants who experience rapid catch‐up growth in the first few years of life. 412, 413 The mechanisms underlying these associations are not entirely clear. However, fetal programming by means of epigenetic changes as well as direct organ damage are thought to play a role. 414 Ongoing studies are investigating the optimal follow‐up and prevention strategies to decrease the risk of these complications. 415, 416

4.4 Risks associated with fetal growth restriction

The main short‐ and long‐term risks associated with FGR are listed in Box 3. It is associated with both fetal and obstetric complications. The most devastating complication is stillbirth, 51, 52, 53 and there is a well‐established inverse relationship between weight percentile and the risk of stillbirth, 54, 55, 56, 57 which is more pronounced in the early preterm period than at term. 58 FGR is an important cause of iatrogenic preterm birth, 59 as early delivery remains the main and perhaps only strategy for the prevention of stillbirth in cases of severe FGR. 16, 60 FGR is also an independent risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth. 61 Other obstetric complications associated with FGR include pre‐eclampsia and placental abruption, as the pathophysiology of these conditions is often closely related. 29, 30, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66

Box 3
Risks associated with fetal growth restriction.

Despite ongoing improvements in neonatal care, FGR is associated with increased neonatal mortality and short‐term morbidity. The risk of perinatal mortality in term FGR is reported to be five‐ to 10‐fold higher than in appropriately grown neonates. 57, 61, 67 The severity of FGR, Doppler abnormalities, and associated prematurity are independent predictors of neonatal complications. 68 Among preterm infants, the co‐presence of FGR further increases the risk of certain prematurity‐related complications such as respiratory morbidity, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and metabolic disorders. 57 Among term infants, FGR increases the risks of low cord artery pH, 69 low Apgar score, 69 and neonatal complications such as hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and jaundice. 70, 71, 72

Growth‐restricted infants are also at risk of long‐term complications including neurodevelopmental impairment 11, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 and noncommunicable diseases. 15, 79, 80, 81, 82 This is discussed in greater detail in section 9.1 (Infant follow‐up).

1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is defined as the failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor, most commonly placental dysfunction. Worldwide, FGR is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short‐ and long‐term morbidity. Ongoing advances in clinical care, especially in definitions, diagnosis, and management of FGR, require efforts to effectively translate these changes to the wide range of obstetric care providers. This article highlights agreements based on current research in the diagnosis and management of FGR, and the areas that need more research to provide further clarification of recommendations.

The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive summary of available evidence along with practical recommendations concerning the care of pregnancies at risk of or complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. To achieve these goals, FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) brought together international experts to review and summarize current knowledge of FGR.

This summary is directed at multiple stakeholders, including healthcare providers, healthcare delivery organizations and providers, FIGO member societies, and professional organizations. Recognizing the variation in the resources and expertise available for the management of FGR in different countries or regions, this article attempts to take into consideration the unique aspects of antenatal care in low‐resource settings (labelled "LRS" in the recommendations). This was achieved by collaboration with authors and FIGO member societies from low‐resource settings such as India, Sub‐Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.

Aspects of FGR addressed in this article include prediction, diagnosis, investigation, management, and postpartum counselling. The main recommendations are given below and are summarized in Table 1 (section 8) and in the management algorithms for high‐resource settings (Figure 1a) and low‐resource settings (Figure 1b) (section 4).

### Fetal growth restriction and subsequent pregnancy risks [^115CXkDi]. Seminars in Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Fetal growth restriction can result from a variety of intrinsic or extrinsic insults, resulting from maternal, fetal, and placental factors. Determining the underlying cause of poor fetal growth can be difficult but is essential for assessing potential risks for future pregnancies. Importantly, recurrence risks greatly depend on these underlying conditions. Understanding these risks can allow more appropriate patient counseling and may influence management strategies to optimize future pregnancies.

### Intrauterine growth restriction [^111BoCYb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Fetal intrauterine growth restriction presents a complex management problem for the clinician. The failure of a fetus to achieve its growth potential imparts a significantly increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Consequently, the obstetrician must recognize and accurately diagnose inadequate fetal growth and attempt to determine its cause. Growth aberrations, which are the result of intrinsic fetal factors such as aneuploidy and multifactorial congenital malformations, and fetal infection, carry a guarded prognosis. However, when intrauterine growth restriction is caused by placental abnormalities or maternal disease, the growth aberration is usually the consequence of inadequate substrates for fetal metabolism and, to a greater or lesser degree, decreased oxygen availability. Careful monitoring of fetal growth and well-being, combined with appropriate timing and mode of delivery, can best ensure a favorable outcome. Ultrasound evaluation of fetal growth, behavior, and measurement of impedance to blood flow in fetal arterial and venous vessels form the cornerstone of evaluation of fetal condition and decision making.

### Consequences of intrauterine growth and early neonatal catch-up growth [^1134JWh6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

The long-term consequences of small size at birth have been well described during the last 2 decades. It is important to assess the fetal growth velocity and to recognize that newborns may have growth restriction even with a normal birth weight. Intrauterine growth retardation suggests decreased growth velocity in the fetus as the result of a certain pathophysiologic process. An infant born after a short period of intrauterine growth retardation may not necessarily be small for gestation at birth. Several cohorts of adults born after a normal intrauterine growth have been followed for long term. Greater weight gain and fat mass early in life after thinness at birth are risk factors for overweight and cardiovascular diseases. Other risk factors include prematurity, bottle feeding, and tobacco exposure in utero. Early catch-up growth after fetal growth restriction replaces the organism on its growth trajectory with similar gain in weight and height.

### Guidelines on fetal growth restriction: a comparison of recent national publications [^116YxVWS]. American Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to compare recommendations from recently published national clinical guidelines for pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR).

Materials and Methods

Clinical guidelines informing best practice management of pregnancies with FGR issued by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the United Kingdom are reviewed together with the published literature on this topic.

Results

Each of the guidelines uses different terminology to describe pregnancies affected by suboptimal fetal growth; all of them agree that an estimated fetal weight < 10th centile should alert clinicians to small fetal size. All guidelines describe risk factor screening for improved detection of FGR and acknowledge the limited accuracy achieved with fundal height measurement. No agreement is reached over the value of fetal weight customization. All colleges have varied opinions regarding methods of Doppler surveillance, however agree that umbilical artery Doppler is beneficial as primary surveillance tool.

Conclusions

The results of this review relay significant inconsistencies and call for an urgent and practical international consensus on this important and common clinical topic. Current data were used to develop a clinical practice guideline for Ireland, which will be presented in context with this review.

### Overview of cervical insufficiency: diagnosis, etiologies, and risk factors [^112oY59A]. Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cervical insufficiency:

- **Definition**: Cervical insufficiency is defined by transvaginal ultrasound cervical length < 25 mm before 24 weeks in women with prior pregnancy losses or preterm births at 14–36 weeks, or by cervical changes detected on physical examination before 24 weeks of gestation.
- **Pathophysiology**: Potential causes of cervical insufficiency include occult uterine activity, uterine overdistension, congenital or acquired cervical insufficiency, decidual hemorrhage, infection/inflammation (amniotic fluid or fetal membranes), and biological or genetic variation.
- **Disease course**: Cervical insufficiency is associated with recurrent second- or early third-trimester fetal loss, following painless cervical dilation, prolapse or rupture of the membranes, and expulsion of a live fetus despite minimal uterine activity.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Preterm birth due to cervical insufficiency is associated with an infant mortality of 17.2%.

8.2 Timing of delivery

The timing of delivery in FGR is determined by gestational age, severity of FGR, findings of fetal monitoring tests, and maternal factors such as pre‐eclampsia (Table 1 and Figure 5). Delivery indications can be considered as absolute if they are independent of gestational age, and relative if the threshold to deliver based on the surveillance findings varies across gestational age.

8.2.1 Gestational age‐related risks in fetal growth restriction

With advancing gestational age there are several important changes in the relative risks of delivery versus ongoing surveillance that define the delivery thresholds.

From 24–28 weeks of gestation each day of pregnancy prolongation results in an estimated 2% decrease in neonatal death, as well as major neonatal complications including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, high‐grade intraventricular hemorrhage, and surgical necrotizing enterocolitis. The impact of prematurity, neonatal weight below 500 g, challenging resuscitation, and decreased tolerance for low Apgar scores results in average neonatal survival rates below 50% and intact survival below 50% until 26 weeks. 68, 298, 345, 346

Between 28 and 30 weeks of gestation the daily increment in survival is approximately 0.7%. After 30 weeks, neonatal survival rates exceed 90%, 68, 296, 297 and there is a significant decrease in major neonatal complications from approximately 35% at 30 weeks to less than 10% at 34 weeks, as well as a decrease in the risk of neurodevelopmental delay for neonates delivered after this time. FGR infants delivered prior to 30 weeks have a three‐fold higher rate of developmental abnormalities and an up to eight‐fold increased rate of cerebral palsy. 10, 295

From 34–38 weeks of gestation neonates are more likely to require admission to the intensive care nursery but have reduced risks of major neonatal complications. 347, 348 In SGA fetuses that remain undelivered after 38 weeks, the risk of stillbirth doubles every week and reaches 60/10 000 for pregnancies that continue beyond the due date. 349, 350

### Growth in congenital heart disease: outcome or predictor? [^111tcwyD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Considering first birth anthropometry, it is important to recognize that low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), and intrauterine growth restriction are distinct entities. Low birth weight refers to a cut point based solely on weight, irrespective of whether that weight is appropriate for gestational age or growth potential. Although SGA takes into account gestational age and sex, it is based on a distribution of a normative population with a distinct cut point at the 10th percentile, and does not account for an individual's or population's growth potential. Intrauterine growth restriction is conceptually straightforward but difficult to delineate clinically because it refers to an in utero environment that leads to a fetus failing to meet its growth potential; the complexity is in assessing "potential". Defining intrauterine growth restriction is even more perplexing in the population with CHD because growth potential may be debated, given the well‐described lesion‐specific differences in birth weight. 5, 6 Steurer and colleagues, in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), provide further evidence that CHD lesions are associated with lower birth weight for gestational age. 7 In their cohort of almost 7000 infants with critical CHD in the state of California, > 16% were SGA. Which of those individuals were growth restricted, however, is unknown. Their cohort included multiple Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery categories, and it is possible that if they filtered for higher‐risk lesions, the SGA percentage would be even greater. In a single institution cohort limited to infants requiring surgery before 60 days of age, the rate of SGA was 23% and was associated with an increased risk of 30‐day postoperative mortality. 8 Further narrowing down a cohort to single‐ventricle heart disease, a 41% incidence of SGA was reported for patients enrolled in the Pediatric Heart Network SVR (Single Ventricle Reconstruction) Trial. 9 In the California cohort, being born SGA was associated with a higher incidence of oligohydramnios, preeclampsia, and an underweight maternal body mass index, suggesting SGA birth may be the result of a more complex fetal course and, therefore, should be considered an outcome. But if a large percentage of SGA neonates had no maternal comorbidity, it is possible many attained an appropriate, albeit lower, growth potential, thereby making birth anthropometry simply a marker of risk; this possibility is supported by the known intrinsic placental pathological characteristics associated with various CHDs. 10, 11, 12, 13 Regardless, the pathophysiological characteristics for being SGA are varied, and teasing out which infants are not meeting their growth potential because of environmental insults is nearly impossible on the basis of birth weight and gestational age alone.

### Intrauterine growth restriction: new concepts in antenatal surveillance, diagnosis, and management [^115MM4AL]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) remains one of the main challenges in maternity care. Improvements have to start from a better definition of IUGR, applying the concept of the fetal growth potential. Customized standards for fetal growth and birthweight improve the detection of IUGR by better distinction between physiological and pathological smallness and have led to internationally applicable norms. Such developments have resulted in new insights in the assessment of risk and surveillance during pregnancy. Serial fundal height measurement plotted on customized charts is a useful screening tool, whereas fetal biometry and Doppler flow are the mainstay for investigation and diagnosis of IUGR. Appropriate protocols based on available evidence as well as individualized clinical assessment are essential to ensure good management and timely delivery.

### Treatment… [^114HpbEc]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction, previously called intrauterine growth restriction, is a condition in which a fetus does not achieve its optimal growth potential. It impacts up to 10% of pregnancies and has significant prenatal and postnatal consequences, including increased risk of perinatal death, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. 1–4 For fetuses affected by growth restriction, adverse outcomes such as intraventricular hemorrhage, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, and death are more common and severe when estimated fetal weight is below the third percentile, or the 10th percentile if uterine artery flow is abnormal.
5. Definition The term fetal growth restriction is recommended instead of intrauterine growth restriction. 1, 2, 6, 7 Fetal growth restriction is a pathologic process and indicates distress preventing the fetus from achieving its ultimate growth potential.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists defines a fetus with fetal growth restriction as having an estimated fetal weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age, 1 whereas the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommends an additional criterion of an abdominal circumference below the 10th percentile for gestational age. 1, 11–14 Placentation and umbilical cord abnormalities are the most common causes of fetal growth restriction. 1 Factors associated with fetal growth restriction include multiple gestation, structural anomalies including congenital heart disease and gastroschisis, and genetic abnormalities including trisomies 13, 18, and 21. 24 Early-onset fetal growth restriction results in deterioration of umbilical artery flow and perinatal death in 70% and 7% of affected pregnancies, respectively.

25, 26 Initial diagnosis of fetal growth restriction after 32 weeks' gestation is more common and tends to be milder in severity and progression, with abnormal umbilical artery flow occurring less than 10% of the time, and peri-natal death is rare. |Accelerated atherosclerosis Anxiety Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder Cardiovascular disease Chronic kidney disease Dyslipidemia Hypertension Hypofertility Impaired insulin sensitivity/type 2 diabetes mellitus Polycystic ovary syndrome Substance use disorders| Children affected by fetal growth restriction have an increased long-term risk of developing reproductive problems, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, impaired insulin resistance, and cognitive and neurodevelopmental impairments.

8.2.2 Gestational age‐related management strategy

The balance between fetal and neonatal risks defines the predominant management strategy at different gestational epochs. Accordingly, the goal of management shifts from gaining fetal viability at 26 weeks to a graded improvement in survival, neonatal morbidity, and neurodevelopment by delaying delivery until 34–36 weeks. The increase in stillbirth rate in undelivered fetuses increasingly favors delivery from 36 weeks onward.

Timing of delivery in FGR has been evaluated in three randomized trials. The growth restriction intervention trial (GRIT) randomized pregnancies that had abnormal fetal biometry and umbilical artery Doppler studies performed as part of clinical management into immediate delivery after completion of a course of steroids versus delivery when the managing physician was no longer comfortable with conservative management. 294, 295 The monitoring protocol and delivery criteria were not specified. The trial demonstrated that, in the absence of specific criteria, either management approach resulted in the same perinatal outcome. Delaying delivery increased the risk of stillbirth, while earlier delivery resulted in a higher degree of prematurity‐related complications that either led to neonatal death or an increased risk of developmental delay.

The disproportionate intrauterine growth intervention trial at term (DIGITAT) randomized SGA fetuses by several biometry criteria, independent of the umbilical artery Doppler pattern, to induction or expectant monitoring between 36 and 41 weeks of gestation. 347 The study demonstrated that, while elective induction did not affect neonatal or obstetric outcomes, deliveries prior to 38 weeks resulted in a higher rate of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit.

These trials demonstrate that the relative risk for neonatal complications requires definitive delivery indications until 38 weeks of gestation. After that time, delivery for indication of FGR is likely to prevent stillbirth in ongoing pregnancies. The continuous decrease in neonatal risks requires that delivery indications at early gestational ages occur at a higher threshold for fetal risks than after 30–32 weeks.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaGrowth disturbances-risk of fetal growth restriction [^116kzQyS]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction, or an estimated fetal weight of less than the 10th percentile, is associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Optimizing management for obtaining the most favorable outcome for mother and fetus is largely based on detailed ultrasound findings. Identifying and performing those ultrasound procedures that are most associated with adverse outcome is necessary for proper patient management. Transabdominal ultrasound is the mainstay of initial management and assessment of fetal growth. For those fetuses that are identified as small for gestational age, assessment of fetal well-being with biophysical profile and Doppler velocimetry provide vital information for differentiating those fetuses that may be compromised and may require delivery and those that are well compensated. Delivery of the pregnancy is primarily based upon the gestational age of the pregnancy and the ultrasound findings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

4.2.1 Consensus‐based definition of placenta‐related FGR

The major member societies of FIGO follow a definition using the 10th percentile as a means of diagnosing an SGA fetus, which then leads to further testing, assessment, and follow‐up. There are proposals to address the limitations of this definition, but their validity regarding reduction in adverse outcomes needs to be tested. For example, in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations described above, a consensus‐based definition for placenta‐mediated FGR has been proposed via a Delphi procedure. 1 To decrease the likelihood of false‐positive and false‐negative diagnosis of FGR, the consensus definition was based on a combination of measures of fetal size (fetal weight estimation and abdominal circumference) and abnormal Doppler findings in the umbilical, uterine, and middle cerebral arteries, as described in Box 1. The implementation of this definition is limited by the lack of a recommendation on which growth chart should be used to define the 10th and 3rd percentiles for EFW and fetal abdominal circumference. In addition, further research is needed to correlate this definition with adverse perinatal outcomes.

### Shared and disparate components of the pathophysiologies of fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia [^116hR3H9]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia differ in their association with maternal disease but share a similar placental pathology. Moreover, mothers who have had pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia or IUGR are at elevated later-life cardiovascular risk. Why, then, do some women develop IUGR and others develop preeclampsia? In this clinical opinion, based on a review of the literature, we hypothesize that both women experiencing preeclampsia and IUGR enter pregnancy with some degree of endothelial dysfunction, a lesion that predisposes to shallow placentation. In our opinion, preeclampsia develops when abnormal placentation, through the mediator of elevated circulating cytokines, interacts with maternal metabolic syndrome, comprised of adiposity, insulin resistance/hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and coagulopathy. IUGR develops in the absence of antenatal metabolic syndrome. Among these women, the baby is affected by shallow placentation but the mother does not develop clinically apparent disease. This conceptualization provides a testable framework for future etiologic studies of preeclampsia and IUGR.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 52: diagnosis and management of fetal growth restriction: (replaces clinical guideline number 3, April 2012) [^116kxSFS]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction can result from a variety of maternal, fetal, and placental conditions. It occurs in up to 10% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality. This complex obstetrical problem has disparate published diagnostic criteria, relatively low detection rates, and limited preventative and treatment options. The purpose of this Consult is to outline an evidence-based, standardized approach for the prenatal diagnosis and management of fetal growth restriction. The recommendations of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine are as follows: (1) we recommend that fetal growth restriction be defined as an ultrasonographic estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference below the 10th percentile for gestational age (GRADE 1B); (2) we recommend the use of population-based fetal growth references (such as Hadlock) in determining fetal weight percentiles (GRADE 1B); (3) we recommend against the use of low-molecular-weight heparin for the sole indication of prevention of recurrent fetal growth restriction (GRADE 1B); (4) we recommend against the use of sildenafil or activity restriction for in utero treatment of fetal growth restriction (GRADE 1B); (5) we recommend that a detailed obstetrical ultrasound examination (current procedural terminology code 76811) be performed with early-onset fetal growth restriction (< 32 weeks of gestation) (GRADE 1B); (6) we recommend that women be offered fetal diagnostic testing, including chromosomal microarray analysis, when fetal growth restriction is detected and a fetal malformation, polyhydramnios, or both are also present regardless of gestational age (GRADE 1B); (7) we recommend that pregnant women be offered prenatal diagnostic testing with chromosomal microarray analysis when unexplained isolated fetal growth restriction is diagnosed at < 32 weeks of gestation (GRADE 1C); (8) we recommend against screening for toxoplasmosis, rubella, or herpes in pregnancies with fetal growth restriction in the absence of other risk factors and recommend polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus in women with unexplained fetal growth restriction who elect diagnostic testing with amniocentesis (GRADE 1C); (9) we recommend that once fetal growth restriction is diagnosed, serial umbilical artery Doppler assessment should be performed to assess for deterioration (GRADE 1C); (10) with decreased end-diastolic velocity (ie, flow ratios greater than the 95th percentile) or in pregnancies with severe fetal growth restriction (estimated fetal weight less than the third percentile), we suggest weekly umbilical artery Doppler evaluation (GRADE 2C); (11) we recommend Doppler assessment up to 2–3 times per week when umbilical artery absent end-diastolic velocity is detected (GRADE 1C); (12) in the setting of reversed end-diastolic velocity, we suggest hospitalization, administration of antenatal corticosteroids, heightened surveillance with cardiotocography at least 1–2 times per day, and consideration of delivery depending on the entire clinical picture and results of additional evaluation of fetal well-being (GRADE 2C); (13) we suggest that Doppler assessment of the ductus venosus, middle cerebral artery, or uterine artery not be used for routine clinical management of early- or late-onset fetal growth restriction (GRADE 2B); (14) we suggest weekly cardiotocography testing after viability for fetal growth restriction without absent/reversed end-diastolic velocity and that the frequency be increased when fetal growth restriction is complicated by absent/reversed end-diastolic velocity or other comorbidities or risk factors (GRADE 2C); (15) we recommend delivery at 37 weeks of gestation in pregnancies with fetal growth restriction and an umbilical artery Doppler waveform with decreased diastolic flow but without absent/reversed end-diastolic velocity or with severe fetal growth restriction with estimated fetal weight less than the third percentile (GRADE 1B); (16) we recommend delivery at 33–34 weeks of gestation for pregnancies with fetal growth restriction and absent end-diastolic velocity (GRADE 1B); (17) we recommend delivery at 30–32 weeks of gestation for pregnancies with fetal growth restriction and reversed end-diastolic velocity (GRADE 1B); (18) we suggest delivery at 38–39 weeks of gestation with fetal growth restriction when the estimated fetal weight is between the 3rd and 10th percentile and the umbilical artery Doppler is normal (GRADE 2C); (19) we suggest that for pregnancies with fetal growth restriction complicated by absent/reversed end-diastolic velocity, cesarean delivery should be considered based on the entire clinical scenario (GRADE 2C); (20) we recommend the use of antenatal corticosteroids if delivery is anticipated before 33 6/7 weeks of gestation or for pregnancies between 34 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation in women without contraindications who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days and who have not received a prior course of antenatal corticosteroids (GRADE 1A); and (21) we recommend intrapartum magnesium sulfate for fetal and neonatal neuroprotection for women with pregnancies that are < 32 weeks of gestation (GRADE 1A).

### Non-placental causes of intrauterine growth restriction [^113HnGMm]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Placental insufficiency, in some form or fashion, is associated with the majority of cases of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). There are numerous causes of IUGR which are not caused primarily by placental insufficiency, but indirectly lead to it. The causes of IUGR can be subdivided into fetal and maternal etiologies. The fetal etiologies consist of genetic diseases, congenital malformations, infections, multiple gestations, and placental/cord abnormalities. The maternal etiologies are categorized as follows: (1) decreased uteroplacental blood flow, (2) reduced blood volume, (3) decreased oxygen carrying capacity, (4) nutrition status, (5) teratogens, and (6) miscellaneous causes such as short interpregnancy intervals, race, maternal age, and low socioeconomic status. Knowledge of the etiologies of fetal growth restriction is essential, so that future care can be targeted at prevention. There are several primary and secondary prevention strategies that can be adopted.

### Intrauterine growth restriction: postnatal monitoring and outcomes [^112VK1dk]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is an important cause of fetal, perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. IUGR occurs because of multiple reasons. Neonates with IUGR experience acute problems in the perinatal and early neonatal period that can be life-threatening. The unfavorable uterine environment causing growth restriction results in programming that predisposes IUGR infants to long-term health issues such as poor physical growth, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, neurodevelopmental impairment and endocrine abnormalities, warranting careful monitoring. It is imperative to strike the balance between achieving optimal catch-up to promote normal development, while preventing the onset of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in the long-term.

### Fetal growth restriction due to placental disease [^114GKVAh]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Normal fetal growth depends on the genetically predetermined growth potential and its modulation by the health of the fetus, placenta and the mother. Fetuses that are small because of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are at higher risk for poor perinatal and long-term outcome than those who are appropriately grown. Of the many potential underlying processes that may result in IUGR, placental disease is clinically the most relevant. Fetal cardiovascular and behavioral responses to placental insufficiency and the metabolic status are interrelated. The concurrent evaluation of fetal biometry, amniotic fluid volume, heart rate patterns, arterial and venous Doppler, and biophysical variables therefore allow the most comprehensive fetal evaluation in IUGR. In the absence of successful intrauterine therapy, the timing of delivery is perhaps the most critical aspect of the antenatal management. A discussion of the fetal responses to placental insufficiency and a management protocol that accounts for multiple Doppler and biophysical parameters as well as gestational age is provided in this review.

6.3 Is there a role for routine third‐trimester ultrasound to assess fetal growth?

In many countries, measurement of SFH is the primary screening tool for FGR in low‐risk pregnancies and ultrasound measurement of fetal biometry is performed only when indicated on the basis of risk factors or abnormal SFH. 134, 143, 172, 173, 174 However, this approach fails to identify the majority of FGR infants, 146 a concerning finding given that undetected FGR is associated with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome and stillbirth. 53, 175

An alternative approach is to perform a routine third‐trimester ultrasound for fetal weight estimation. However, a strategy for routine third‐trimester ultrasound in low‐risk pregnancies is not supported by available data and cannot be recommended. 176, 177, 178

### Short-and long-term implications of small for gestational age [^112vogxp]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction (FGR) describes a fetus' inability to attain adequate weight gain based on genetic potential and gestational age and is the second most common cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality after prematurity. Infants who have suffered fetal growth restriction are at the greatest risks for short- and long-term complications. This article specifically details the neurologic and cardiometabolic sequalae associated with fetal growth restriction, as well as the purported mechanisms that underlie their pathogenesis. We end with a brief discussion about further work that is needed to gain a more complete understanding of fetal growth restriction.

Background

An estimated 0.4% of pregnancies worldwide are complicated by severe early-onset (< 28 weeks gestation) fetal growth restriction (FGR) caused by placental insufficiency. This patient group utilises disproportionate amounts of obstetric care and has a high likelihood of premature birth, both for fetal and for secondary maternal indications such as the development of the maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia. As these growth-restricted infants are usually born very preterm, they carry additional significant risks of major and minor neonatal morbidity, and long-term health sequelae if they survive. These risks are not only related to gestational age at birth, but also to the degree of FGR. Survival proportions for severely growth-restricted fetuses very remote from term (< 28 weeks' gestation) vary between 7 and 33% and less than one third of these fetuses will survive their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay without significant neurodevelopmental sequelae.

The diagnosis of early onset FGR is often missed but even when diagnosed based on growth parameters below the normal range (< 10th, < 5th, or < 3rd centile) with or without evidence of abnormal fetal and maternal Doppler waveforms there are currently no specific evidence-based therapies available. Non-specific interventions may include lifestyle modifications such as reducing or stopping work, stopping aerobic exercise, rest at home, and hospital admission for rest and surveillance. These interventions are used in the belief that rest will reduce the steal from the utero-placental circulation to the glutei and quadriceps muscles but are not based on any good quality evidence. In the absence of proven therapeutic interventions, standard clinical management consists of counselling, intensive monitoring, and timely delivery once a fetus has reached a viable gestation and size but often results in extreme preterm birth.

8 MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCIES WITH FETAL GROWTH RESTRICTION

Management of pregnancies with FGR depends in part on the results of the investigation described in section 7. In cases of fetal abnormalities (genetic or infectious) the management (expectant versus pregnancy termination) should be individualized based on the nature of the disorder, the expected prognosis, gestational age, parental wishes, and local policies.

The most common underlying etiology for FGR is placental dysfunction. In early‐onset FGR (< 32 weeks), increased resistance in umbilical artery Doppler is the primary rate‐limiting step to subsequent deterioration of cardiovascular and biophysical parameters. 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292 The primary management challenge arises from the risk of fetal deterioration and stillbirth in pregnancies undergoing surveillance versus the neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with preterm delivery. 68, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297 In late‐onset FGR (≥ 32 weeks), cardiovascular deterioration in response to fetal hypoxia is predominantly confined to the cerebral circulation with little umbilical artery Doppler changes. 289, 291, 292, 298 Pregnancies complicated by late‐onset FGR are major contributors to adverse perinatal outcome attributable to FGR because of misdiagnosis and challenges in detecting deterioration during fetal surveillance. 299, 300

There is no effective antenatal treatment for placental dysfunction and therefore once FGR has been identified, the principal management steps are institution of fetal surveillance and determination of appropriate thresholds for delivery. Perinatal outcome in early‐onset FGR is improved when pregnancies are managed in a high‐level fetal medicine and neonatology unit utilizing a uniform management protocol. 301 Likewise, the optimal management setting for late‐onset FGR is a unit that has access and experience in interpretation of surveillance tests, together with an appropriate level neonatal unit. The recommendations for monitoring, timing and mode of delivery, and potential treatments for placenta‐mediated FGR are described below and summarized in Table 1 and Figure 5.

### Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR): biometric and Doppler assessment [^116x85Ee]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2002). Low credibility.

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication in pregnancy and influences morbidity and mortality at all stages of life. Historically, the management of IUGR has been dependent on antenatal biophysical testing and umbilical artery Doppler studies. With recent Doppler studies of the fetal central circulation, including intracardiac flows and the ductus venosus, better timing of delivery to minimize morbidity may be possible. This review will provide the reader with tools to diagnose IUGR, more accurately date the IUGR pregnancy with poor dating criteria, and better assess the condition of the IUGR fetus. A brief review of animal models of IUGR is presented to demonstrate research directions for answering human clinical questions and potentially carrying therapeutic intervention from the bench to the bedside.

### Fetal growth restriction and the risk of perinatal mortality-case studies from the multicentre PORTO study [^112TgPLD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Fetal growth restriction is the single most important contributor to perinatal mortality in non-anomalous fetuses. Significant research efforts have gone into improving the diagnosis and definition of IUGR, surveillance and antenatal management, however uncertainties regarding the optimal timing of delivery in IUGR persist.

Vigilance towards antenatal risk factors for poor pregnancy outcome is important for the optimal management of IUGR pregnancies. The focus of future research needs to urgently address how we can improve the antenatal detection of IUGR. Prenatal recognition of IUGR dramatically improves pregnancy outcomes allowing for close monitoring and timely delivery. Nevertheless, even if recognised, not all perinatal deaths can be prevented.

### Diagnosis and surveillance of late-onset fetal growth restriction [^1154xUFg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

By consensus, late fetal growth restriction is that diagnosed > 32 weeks. This condition is mildly associated with a higher risk of perinatal hypoxic events and suboptimal neurodevelopment. Histologically, it is characterized by the presence of uteroplacental vascular lesions (especially infarcts), although the incidence of such lesions is lower than in preterm fetal growth restriction. Screening procedures for fetal growth restriction need to identify small babies and then differentiate between those who are healthy and those who are pathologically small. First- or second-trimester screening strategies provide detection rates for late smallness for gestational age < 50% for 10% of false positives. Compared to clinically indicated ultrasonography in the third trimester, universal screening triples the detection rate of late smallness for gestational age. As opposed to early third-trimester ultrasound, scanning late in pregnancy (around 37 weeks) increases the detection rate for birthweight < 3rd centile. Contrary to early fetal growth restriction, umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry alone does not provide good differentiation between late smallness for gestational age and fetal growth restriction. A combination of biometric parameters (with severe smallness usually defined as estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference < 3rd centile) with Doppler criteria of placental insufficiency (either in the maternal [uterine Doppler] or fetal [cerebroplacental ratio] compartments) offers a classification tool that correlates with the risk for adverse perinatal outcome. There is no evidence that induction of late fetal growth restriction at term improves perinatal outcomes nor is it a cost-effective strategy, and it may increase neonatal admission when performed < 38 weeks.

Fetal growth restriction — risk of stillbirth by severity — indicates the most severely affected fetuses (weights less than the 2.5th percentile) are at greatest risk; the cumulative risk of stillbirth is approximately 1.5% at fetal weights less than the 10th percentile and increases to 2.5% at less than the fifth percentile for gestational age. Using U.S. data, risk was highest for estimated growth less than the third percentile (58.0 per 10,000 at risk), decreased for less than the fifth percentile (43.9 per 10,000 at risk), and was lowest for less than the 10th percentile (26.3 per 10,000 at risk).

### An integrated approach based on advanced CTG parameters and Doppler measurements for late growth restriction management [^111CdnoN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Fetal growth restriction (FGR), also known as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy that has been associated with a variety of adverse perinatal outcomes.

The prevalence is estimated to affect approximately 3–9% of all pregnancies, according to different definition used.

The key issue in the management of a pregnancy complicated by FGR is the timely identification of the fetus at greatest risk for adverse outcome. FGR evolves from a preclinical phase to clinically apparent growth delay and may ultimately progress to fetal deterioration. Although potential abnormalities in placental development may arise over the continuum of gestational age, common opinion distinguished the early-onset presenting before 32 weeks from the late-onset FGR presenting after 32 weeks.

Third trimester obstetrical ultrasound policies differ from country to country, usually women are not routinely scanned in late pregnancy but are selected for third trimester ultrasonography on the basis of pre-pregnancy risk factors, development of obstetric complications, and serial measurement of symphyseal-fundal height. This approach identifies a third of FGR infants or fewer and unidentified FGR is a common finding in perinatal deaths. The late-onset FGR condition represents the 70–80% of FGR cases. It is frequently associated with mild placental perfusion and moderate fetal Doppler Pulsatility Index (PI) abnormalities. Sometimes, it is possible to recognize a chronological evolution of fetal Doppler abnormalities with Umbilical Artery (UA) PI increase, Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) PI reduction or a co-occurrence of both events. Clinical evolution of fetal deterioration may include a reduction in amniotic fluid volume and non-reassuring cardiotocography (CTG).

### Intrauterine growth restriction: identification and management… [^1162wN78]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The mortality rate is 70 to 100 times higher in infants who weigh less than 1, 500 g. 5 Perinatal asphyxia involving multiple organ systems is one of the most significant problems in growth-restricted infants. 3 Timely diagnosis and management of IUGR is one of the major achievements in contemporary obstetrics. If the growth-restricted fetus is identified and appropriate management instituted, perinatal mortality can be reduced, 6, 7 underscoring the need for assessment of fetal growth at each prenatal visit. Symmetric and Asymmetric IUGR IUGR is usually classified as symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric growth restriction implies a fetus whose entire body is proportionally small. Asymmetric growth restriction implies a fetus who is undernourished and is directing most of its energy to maintaining growth of vital organs, such as the brain and heart, at the expense of the liver, muscle and fat.

This type of growth restriction is usually the result of placental insufficiency. A fetus with asymmetric IUGR has a normal head dimension but a small abdominal circumference, scrawny limbs and thinned skin. If the insult causing asymmetric growth restriction is sustained long enough or is severe enough, the fetus may lose the ability to compensate and will become symmetrically growth-restricted. Arrested head growth is of great concern to the developmental potential of the fetus. A controversy involves the timing of delivery to prevent intrauterine demise because of chronic oxygen deprivation. Preterm delivery is indicated if the growth-restricted fetus demonstrates abnormal fetal function tests, and it is often advisable in the absence of demonstrable fetal growth. The risks of prematurity must be weighed against the complications unique to IUGR.

The biophysical profile involves assessment of fetal well-being with a combination of the nonstress test and four ultrasonographic parameters. The use of Doppler flow velocimetry, usually of the umbilical artery, identifies the growth-restricted fetus at greatest risk for neonatal morbidity and mortality. In controlled trials, Doppler analysis has been associated with improved outcome. Outcome Most infants who had growth restriction in utero have normal rates of growth in infancy and childhood, although studies have demonstrated that at least one third of them never achieve normal height.

### Clinical opinion: the diagnosis and management of suspected fetal growth restriction: an evidence-based approach [^1142Efnh]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

This study reviewed the literature about the diagnosis, antepartum surveillance, and time of delivery of fetuses suspected to be small for gestational age or growth restricted. Several guidelines have been issued by major professional organizations, including the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. The differences in recommendations, in particular about Doppler velocimetry of the ductus venosus and middle cerebral artery, have created confusion among clinicians, and this review has intended to clarify and highlight the available evidence that is pertinent to clinical management. A fetus who is small for gestational age is frequently defined as one with an estimated fetal weight of < 10th percentile. This condition has been considered syndromic and has been frequently attributed to fetal growth restriction, a constitutionally small fetus, congenital infections, chromosomal abnormalities, or genetic conditions. Small for gestational age is not synonymous with fetal growth restriction, which is defined by deceleration of fetal growth determined by a change in fetal growth velocity. An abnormal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index reflects an increased impedance to flow in the umbilical circulation and is considered to be an indicator of placental disease. The combined finding of an estimated fetal weight of < 10th percentile and abnormal umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry has been widely accepted as indicative of fetal growth restriction. Clinical studies have shown that the gestational age at diagnosis can be used to subclassify suspected fetal growth restriction into early and late, depending on whether the condition is diagnosed before or after 32 weeks of gestation. The early type is associated with umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities, whereas the late type is often associated with a low pulsatility index in the middle cerebral artery. A large randomized clinical trial indicated that in the context of early suspected fetal growth restriction, the combination of computerized cardiotocography and fetal ductus venosus Doppler improves outcomes, such that 95% of surviving infants have a normal neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age. A low middle cerebral artery pulsatility index is associated with an adverse perinatal outcome in late fetal growth restriction; however, there is no evidence supporting its use to determine the time of delivery. Nonetheless, an abnormality in middle cerebral artery Doppler could be valuable to increase the surveillance of the fetus at risk. We propose that fetal size, growth rate, uteroplacental Doppler indices, cardiotocography, and maternal conditions (ie, hypertension) according to gestational age are important factors in optimizing the outcome of suspected fetal growth restriction.

### Fetal growth restriction before and after birth [^111RyPVv]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction, previously called intrauterine growth restriction, is a condition in which a fetus does not achieve its full growth potential during pregnancy. Early detection and management of fetal growth restriction are essential because it has significant clinical implications in childhood. It is diagnosed by estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference below the 10th percentile on formal ultrasonography. Early-onset fetal growth restriction is diagnosed before 32 weeks' gestation and has a higher risk of adverse fetal outcomes. There are no evidence-based measures for preventing fetal growth restriction; however, aspirin used for the prevention of preeclampsia in high-risk pregnancies may reduce the likelihood of developing it. Timing of delivery for pregnancies affected by growth restriction must be adjusted based on the risks of premature birth and ongoing gestation, and it is best determined in consultation with maternal-fetal medicine specialists. Neonates affected by fetal growth restriction are at risk of feeding difficulties, glucose instability, temperature instability, and jaundice. As these children age, they are at risk of abnormal growth patterns, as well as later cardiac, metabolic, neurodevelopmental, reproductive, and psychiatric disorders.

### Defining normal and abnormal fetal growth: promises and challenges [^111XZP6U]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Normal fetal growth is a critical component of a healthy pregnancy and influences the long-term health of the offspring. However, defining normal and abnormal fetal growth has been a long-standing challenge in clinical practice and research. We review various references and standards that are used widely to evaluate fetal growth and discuss common pitfalls of current definitions of abnormal fetal growth. Pros and cons of different approaches to customize fetal growth standards are described. We further discuss recent advances toward an integrated definition for fetal growth restriction. Such a definition may incorporate fetal size with the status of placental health that is measured by maternal and fetal Doppler velocimetry and biomarkers, biophysical findings, and genetics. Although the concept of an integrated definition appears promising, further development and testing are required. An improved definition of abnormal fetal growth should benefit both research and clinical practice.

### Consensus definition of fetal growth restriction in intrauterine fetal death: a Delphi procedure [^115d9JK8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

Fetal growth restriction is a risk factor for intrauterine fetal death. Currently, definitions of fetal growth restriction in stillborns are heterogeneous.

Objectives —

To develop a consensus definition for fetal growth restriction retrospectively diagnosed at fetal autopsy in intrauterine fetal death.

Design —

A modified online Delphi survey in an international panel of experts in perinatal pathology, with feedback at group level and exclusion of nonresponders. The survey scoped all possible variables with an open question. Variables suggested by 2 or more experts were scored on a 5-point Likert scale. In subsequent rounds, inclusion of variables and thresholds were determined with a 70% level of agreement. In the final rounds, participants selected the consensus algorithm.

Results —

Fifty-two experts participated in the first round; 88% (46 of 52) completed all rounds. The consensus definition included antenatal clinical diagnosis of fetal growth restriction OR a birth weight lower than third percentile OR at least 5 of 10 contributory variables (risk factors in the clinical antenatal history: birth weight lower than 10th percentile, body weight at time of autopsy lower than 10th percentile, brain weight lower than 10th percentile, foot length lower than 10th percentile, liver weight lower than 10th percentile, placental weight lower than 10th percentile, brain weight to liver weight ratio higher than 4, placental weight to birth weight ratio higher than 90th percentile, histologic or gross features of placental insufficiency/malperfusion). There was no consensus on some aspects, including how to correct for interval between fetal death and delivery.

Conclusions —

A consensus-based definition of fetal growth restriction in fetal death was determined with utility to improve management and outcomes of subsequent pregnancies.

### FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) initiative on fetal growth: best practice advice for screening, diagnosis, and management of fetal growth restriction [^112apkHt]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is defined as the failure of the fetus to meet its growth potential due to a pathological factor, most commonly placental dysfunction. Worldwide, FGR is a leading cause of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and short- and long-term morbidity. Ongoing advances in clinical care, especially in definitions, diagnosis, and management of FGR, require efforts to effectively translate these changes to the wide range of obstetric care providers. This article highlights agreements based on current research in the diagnosis and management of FGR, and the areas that need more research to provide further clarification of recommendations.

The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive summary of available evidence along with practical recommendations concerning the care of pregnancies at risk of or complicated by FGR, with the overall goal to decrease the risk of stillbirth and neonatal mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. To achieve these goals, FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) brought together international experts to review and summarize current knowledge of FGR.

This summary is directed at multiple stakeholders, including healthcare providers, healthcare delivery organizations and providers, FIGO member societies, and professional organizations. Recognizing the variation in the resources and expertise available for the management of FGR in different countries or regions, this article attempts to take into consideration the unique aspects of antenatal care in low-resource settings (labelled "LRS" in the recommendations). This was achieved by collaboration with authors and FIGO member societies from low-resource settings such as India, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.
