## Question

How should the new result for a 74-year-old male be interpreted: no monoclonal protein detected on serum protein electrophoresis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a new SPEP result showing no monoclonal protein detected in a 74-year-old male. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the analytic sensitivity and limitations of SPEP alone. Then, I should assess age-related pretest probability and how it influences post-test interpretation. Next, I will lay out guideline-concordant complementary testing to complete initial detection. After that, I should review clinical red flags that would escalate urgency. Then, I will synthesize likely scenarios and corresponding management. Finally, I need to consider age- and comorbidity-specific nuances and provide a concise interpretive statement with risk-stratified follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the test limitation: a negative SPEP simply means no visible monoclonal spike was identified, but that does not exclude a monoclonal gammopathy, especially low-level or light chain–only disease, so I should not jump to conclusions based on SPEP alone [^114s28h1] [^117RkPAf]. Wait, let me verify sensitivity tradeoffs: combining SPEP with a serum free light chain assay markedly increases detection; in a large study, SPEP plus sFLC achieved 100% sensitivity for plasma cell disorders, which clearly outperforms SPEP alone, reinforcing the need for a panel rather than a single test [^117F2xiY]. I should also remember that mass spectrometry methods like MASS-FIX can detect M-proteins missed by conventional electrophoresis and IFE in select cases, although they are not yet universal first-line tests in most settings [^112NnYuV].

> Next, I should review pretest probability because interpretation hinges on baseline risk. At age 74, the prevalence of MGUS is nontrivial in older adults and progression risk persists over time, so a negative SPEP is reassuring but cannot be considered definitive in this demographic without complementary testing, and I need to be careful not to undercall the residual risk in this age band [^112r1hTa]. Hold on, I should verify that this context argues for completing the initial panel rather than stopping after a single negative result, given the higher background prevalence in older patients and the potential clinical consequences of missed monoclonal gammopathies, including MGCS entities [^116We96T].

> I will now examine the guideline-recommended complementary tests to complete initial detection. Let me first confirm essentials: obtain a serum free light chain assay with κ/λ ratio to detect light chain MGUS or light chain–predominant disease, which SPEP can miss, and add a serum immunofixation electrophoresis to characterize small M-proteins near SPEP's detection limits, because IFE increases sensitivity around the threshold of visual detection [^117RkPAf] [^114s28h1] [^115vqgry]. I should double-check that these two tests, in conjunction with SPEP, constitute a high-sensitivity serum panel for initial evaluation in suspected monoclonal gammopathy, including light chain processes [^117F2xiY] [^111W1ktE].

> But wait, what about urine testing? I need to check when to add urine studies. Urine protein electrophoresis with urine IFE can detect Bence Jones protein that may be absent in serum studies, so if sFLC is abnormal, suspicion remains high, or AL amyloidosis is a concern, I should include urine testing up front because certain phenotypes are more readily detected in urine, and some guidelines emphasize urine IFE in amyloidosis workups, whereas routine urine in all cases is otherwise conditional rather than universal first-line outside those contexts [^114s28h1] [^112HUemF]. Hold on, I should verify one more point: a subset of cases show positivity only on urine IFE, so skipping urine in high-suspicion scenarios can lead to misses, which is why my threshold to add urine testing should remain low when clinical red flags are present or the sFLC ratio is abnormal [^1179j5p4].

> Next, I should review clinical "red flags" that would escalate urgency and broaden the workup. Let me think about SLiM-CRAB features, renal involvement, anemia, lytic bone pain, and biomarkers like an extreme sFLC ratio, because their presence would push me toward expedited bone marrow evaluation and cross-sectional skeletal imaging rather than a passive surveillance approach [^114T5mNA]. I also need to consider MGCS presentations such as unexplained proteinuria, neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, or skin changes, where even a low-burden clone can drive organ damage, prompting earlier involvement of hematology, nephrology, or cardiology and targeted tissue biopsy when indicated [^115cW2DQ] [^116We96T]. I should confirm this urgency step before concluding benignity on the basis of a negative SPEP alone [^114T5mNA].

> Let me now synthesize possible outcomes. If SPEP, sFLC with ratio, and serum IFE are all negative, I would interpret this as no detectable monoclonal gammopathy by current standard-of-care assays, provided sample quality and timing are adequate, and in the absence of red flags I would favor routine clinical follow-up rather than intensive surveillance, while remaining ready to re-evaluate if new symptoms or laboratory signals emerge; in highly selected, persistently suspicious cases, mass spectrometry can be considered to increase analytical sensitivity, though this is not universally required [^114s28h1] [^117RkPAf] [^112NnYuV]. Wait, I should verify that I haven't overlooked organ-specific clues; if MGCS is suspected despite negative conventional tests, targeted tissue evaluation may still be necessary because disease can be patchy or below serum detection thresholds [^115cW2DQ] [^116We96T].

> If the sFLC ratio is abnormal with a negative SPEP, I should consider light chain MGUS or an early light chain process. I need to quantify the involved and uninvolved chains to calculate dFLC, obtain urine IFE to assess for Bence Jones protein, and integrate clinical context; if the dFLC is markedly elevated, particularly approaching thresholds used in SLiM criteria, or if red flags are present, I should not delay bone marrow assessment and appropriate imaging because risk of progression or organ damage may be higher in these phenotypes [^114s28h1] [^114T5mNA]. Hold on, I should verify renal function and assay platform, as renal impairment and assay-to-assay differences can skew the ratio, which may necessitate renal-adjusted interpretation and consistent longitudinal use of the same sFLC method to avoid misclassification [^115cW2DQ].

> If serum IFE detects a small M-protein below SPEP's quantification threshold, the pattern is consistent with MGUS, and I should risk-stratify using established factors such as M-protein size, isotype, sFLC ratio, and immunoparesis to tailor follow-up intervals and decide whether additional baseline evaluations are indicated, recognizing that larger M-protein burden and abnormal ratios portend higher progression risk [^116SarbZ]. Let me confirm follow-up cadence: low-risk MGUS typically warrants repeat labs at 6 months then every 1–2 years, whereas higher-risk profiles merit at least annual follow-up and may be monitored in secondary care with formal risk re-assessment at defined intervals, aligning with BSH 2023 and EMN recommendations [^notfound] [^113DeVzE] [^113WDeFy] [^115RveHs]. I should double-check that any symptoms attributable to the clone would shift management from passive observation toward targeted evaluation and, where appropriate, therapy of MGCS rather than MGUS per se [^115cW2DQ].

> I should now consider age- and comorbidity-specific nuances. In a 74-year-old, I need to ensure that renal impairment is accounted for when interpreting the sFLC ratio, using renal-adjusted intervals where appropriate to avoid false positives, and I must use the same assay longitudinally for consistency, especially if the patient has CKD or fluctuating renal function that can independently alter light chain clearance [^116oz8hL] [^115cW2DQ]. Let me reconsider surveillance intensity: life expectancy, frailty, and competing comorbidities may limit the benefit of aggressive monitoring in low-risk states, and overdiagnosis can drive anxiety and unnecessary procedures, so right-sizing follow-up is essential and should be individualized after completing an appropriate initial evaluation [^115CTYvt] [^112r1hTa]. I should confirm that my plan balances diagnostic thoroughness with avoidance of low-yield testing in this age group [^115CTYvt].

> Final interpretation: Hold on, let me make sure nothing is missing. A negative SPEP in a 74-year-old male is an incomplete result that cannot alone exclude a monoclonal gammopathy; completing the initial panel with sFLC and serum IFE is guideline-concordant and materially improves sensitivity, with urine studies added when the sFLC ratio is abnormal, suspicion remains high, or amyloidosis is a concern [^114s28h1] [^117RkPAf] [^112HUemF]. If all complementary tests are negative and no red flags are present, routine clinical follow-up is appropriate with reassessment if new symptoms or laboratory abnormalities emerge; if an abnormality is detected, risk-stratify and follow standardized surveillance pathways, escalating to bone marrow and imaging when indicated by biomarker thresholds or clinical features, while integrating renal function and patient-centered factors into decision-making [^115CTYvt] [^114T5mNA] [^116SarbZ].

The absence of a monoclonal protein on serum protein electrophoresis in a 74-year-old male means **no M-protein detected** [^111W1ktE], so there is **no evidence of MGUS, multiple myeloma, or related plasma cell disorders** [^notfound]. This result **does not exclude low-level or light-chain–only disease** [^117F2xiY]; if clinical suspicion persists, order serum free light chains and immunofixation, and consider urine studies or mass spectrometry [^117RkPAf] [^114s28h1] [^112HUemF] or mass spectrometry [^116We96T] [^112NnYuV]. No **routine follow-up** is needed unless symptoms or lab abnormalities suggest a plasma cell disorder [^115CTYvt].

---

## Clinical significance of the result

- **No monoclonal protein detected**: This indicates no evidence of MGUS, multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia [^112zY9TQ], or other plasma cell dyscrasias [^115u7gBg] [^111W1ktE].

- **Normal polyclonal pattern**: The result suggests a normal polyclonal immunoglobulin pattern [^111W1ktE], typical of healthy individuals or reactive states.

- **No immediate concern**: There is no immediate evidence of a clonal plasma cell disorder or related malignancy.

---

## Limitations of serum protein electrophoresis

While SPEP is a useful screening tool, it has **limitations**:

- **Sensitivity**: SPEP may miss low-level monoclonal proteins [^117F2xiY], especially in early or smoldering disease.

- **Light-chain disease**: SPEP may not detect light-chain–only disease [^112HUemF], as free light chains may not produce a visible M-spike [^115cW2DQ].

- **Small clones**: Small or early clones may be below SPEP detection limits [^116YdtmV].

---

## Recommended follow-up and additional testing

Given the absence of a monoclonal protein, **routine follow-up for monoclonal gammopathy is not required** [^115u7gBg]. If clinical suspicion persists or the patient develops symptoms suggestive of plasma cell disorders (e.g. unexplained anemia, hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, bone pain), **additional testing may be warranted** [^112HUemF]:

- **Serum free light chain assay**: To detect light-chain–only disease [^114s28h1] or low-level monoclonal proteins [^115cW2DQ].

- **Immunofixation electrophoresis**: More sensitive than SPEP [^117RkPAf] for detecting small monoclonal proteins [^114s28h1].

- **Urine protein electrophoresis**: To detect Bence Jones proteins (monoclonal light chains) in urine [^112HUemF].

- **Mass spectrometry**: Highly sensitive for detecting low-level monoclonal proteins [^112NnYuV] [^116We96T].

---

## Clinical implications for patient management

No immediate **intervention or specific follow-up** [^115u7gBg] is required based on this SPEP result alone. Continue routine clinical care and monitor for symptoms or signs suggestive of plasma cell disorders. If clinical suspicion arises or symptoms develop, pursue additional testing [^112HUemF] as outlined above.

---

## Conclusion

The absence of a monoclonal protein on serum protein electrophoresis in a 74-year-old male indicates **no evidence of monoclonal gammopathy or related plasma cell disorders** [^117RkPAf]. No immediate clinical concern or intervention is required based on this result alone. If clinical suspicion persists or symptoms develop, consider additional testing — such as a serum free light chain assay, immunofixation electrophoresis, or mass spectrometry [^112HUemF] [^116We96T].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, particularly with respect to laboratory testing, AACC/ASCP/CAP 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum free light chain (sFLC), serum immunofixation electrophoresis, and urine immunofixation electrophoresis for the initial detection of M protein in all patients with suspected AL amyloidosis.

### Understanding and interpreting serum protein electrophoresis [^111W1ktE]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Serum protein electrophoresis is used to identify patients with multiple myeloma and other serum protein disorders. Electrophoresis separates proteins based on their physical properties, and the subsets of these proteins are used in interpreting the results. Plasma protein levels display reasonably predictable changes in response to acute inflammation, malignancy, trauma, necrosis, infarction, burns, and chemical injury.

A homogeneous spike-like peak in a focal region of the gamma-globulin zone indicates a monoclonal gammopathy. Monoclonal gammopathies are associated with a clonal process that is malignant or potentially malignant, including multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, solitary plasmacytoma, smoldering multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, plasma cell leukemia, heavy chain disease, and amyloidosis. The quantity of M protein, the results of bone marrow biopsy, and other characteristics can help differentiate multiple myeloma from the other causes of monoclonal gammopathy. In contrast, polyclonal gammopathies may be caused by any reactive or inflammatory process.

### The utility of MASS-FIX to detect and monitor monoclonal proteins in the clinic [^112NnYuV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

The detection and quantification of monoclonal proteins (M-proteins) are necessary for the diagnosis and evaluation of response in plasma cell dyscrasias. Immunoglobulin enrichment coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MASS-FIX) is a simple and inexpensive method to identify M-proteins, but its clinical generalizability has not yet been elucidated.

We compared MASS-FIX to protein electrophoresis (PEL), serum/urine immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), and quantitative serum free light chain (FLC) for the identification of M-proteins in different clinical diagnoses. Paired serum and urine samples from 257 patients were tested. There were six patients for whom serum IFE and FLC ratio were positive and serum MASS-FIX was negative. However, when serum and urine MASS-FIX results were combined, only one patient with light chain MGUS was missed.

Serum/urine MASS-FIX detected M-proteins in 18 patients with negative serum/urine PEL/IFE and serum FLC. Among these, 10 patients had multiple myeloma or AL amyloidosis, who were mistakenly thought to have complete hematologic response by serum/urine PEL/IFE and serum FLC. Nearly half of the AL amyloidosis patients had atypical spectra, which may prove to be a clue to the diagnosis and pathogenesis of the disease.

In conclusion, MASS-FIX has comparable sensitivity with PEL/IFE/FLC methods and can help inform clinical diagnosis.

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^112L9erX]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Plasma cells, both normal and clonal, secrete small amounts of kappa or lambda free light chains. These chains are quickly eliminated by the kidneys, resulting in relatively low levels of circulating serum free light chains. However, in the presence of clonal plasma cells, such as with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or multiple myeloma (MM), there is excess production of one type of light chain. This leads to a skewed ratio between the two light chains and overall increased levels. An abnormal serum free light chain ratio becomes more common as the disease progresses from MGUS to smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) and finally to active MM. A polyclonal elevation of both kappa and lambda serum free light chains can be observed in many individuals, not resulting in an abnormal free light chain (FLC) ratio, the etiology of which is not clear. It has been observed in the context of immune activation, as it can occur with chronic infections and inflammatory states.

We hypothesized that a polyclonal increase in serum free light chains may help identify individuals at higher risk of developing a monoclonal gammopathy. We undertook this study in a population-based cohort previously examined for the prevalence of MGUS to ascertain if increased polyclonal FLC levels were associated with an increased risk of MGUS and related disorders, including SMM, MM, or light chain amyloidosis.

### Performance comparison of capillary and agarose gel electrophoresis for the identification and characterization of monoclonal immunoglobulins [^115CoLdu]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

This study aimed to compare gel- and capillary-based serum protein electrophoresis methods for identifying and characterizing monoclonal immunoglobulins (M proteins). Five reviewers interpreted 149 consecutively ordered serum specimens following agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE), capillary electrophoresis (CE), immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), and subtraction immunotyping (IT).

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: As a screening test for detecting M proteins, AGE and CE displayed similar sensitivity (91% and 92%, respectively). However, CE was less specific (74%) than AGE (81%).

- **Interinterpreter agreement**: An analysis revealed that interpretations were more consistent using gel-based methods than capillary-based methods, with 80% of the gel interpretations being in complete (5/5) agreement compared to 67% of the capillary interpretations.

- **Testing volume**: After implementing the capillary-based methods, the number of tests per reportable result increased (from 1.58 to 1.73).

CE is an analytically suitable alternative to AGE, but laboratories implementing it will need to continue IFE testing to characterize all M proteins detected by CE.

### Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits: A unique case with a clinical course of over 46 years [^116kTHTe]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

The slow progression of disease in this patient, who did not receive immunosuppressive therapy, suggests that PGNMID may have a better prognosis than previously described. However, cases reported in the literature may not have been presented until later in the course of illness when the disease was more advanced, as PGNMID has only recently been described.

There are multiple limitations to this case report, including the lack of pathology data regarding the first biopsy and the lack of detailed clinical data after the first two biopsies. Furthermore, no other investigations were conducted to identify a potentially pathological clone except for serum and urine electrophoresis and serum free light chains, which are negative in the majority of patients with PGNMID. However, there is a low likelihood of detecting such a clone when no circulating paraprotein is found. As for treatment, even though no clone was detected, it has been previously shown that clone-directed therapy with agents such as bortezomib or rituximab may have a good response rate. In this case, the patient was aware of the lack of strong evidence to support any specific approach and, as a result, elected to be managed conservatively.

In conclusion, our case opens a window into the natural history of PGNMID, contradicting previous literature associating PGNMID with a poor prognosis. However, early diagnosis in this case did not affect the patient's overall outcome and is unlikely to change the course of the disease, especially since there is no established treatment course.

### Screening for antibody deficiencies in adults by serum electrophoresis and calculated globin [^111ws49c]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the correlation between calculated globulin (CG, total protein level minus albumin level) and the gamma globulin fraction (Gamma), obtained from serum protein electrophoresis with serum IgG levels in adults (≥ 18 years).

Using linear regression models, analyses of CG and Gamma levels correlation with IgG levels in adults were performed. Receiver-operator curves were created to determine cutoff values and the respective sensitivity and specificity measures.

A total of 886 samples were analyzed. CG and Gamma were positively and statistically correlated with IgG levels (r² = 0.4628 for CG, and = 0.7941 for Gamma, p < 0.0001 for both analyses). For the detection of hypogammaglobulinemia, i.e. IgG level below the reference value (6 g/L), a CG cutoff value of 24 g/L showed a sensitivity of 86.2% (95% CI 69.4–94.5) and a specificity of 92% (90.0–93.6). A Gamma cutoff value of 7.15 g/L yielded a sensitivity of 100% (88.3–100) and a specificity of 96.8 (95.3–97.8).

Both CG and Gamma levels determined by protein electrophoresis analysis may be used to screen for antibody deficiencies in adults, enabling earlier diagnosis of antibody deficiencies in a routine clinical setting.

### How I manage monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^112zY9TQ]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is, in many ways, a unique hematologic entity. Unlike most hematologic conditions in which the diagnosis is intentional and credited to hematologists, the discovery of MGUS is most often incidental and made by nonhematologists. MGUS is considered an obligate precursor to several lymphoplasmacytic malignancies, including immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Therefore, long-term follow-up is generally recommended.

Despite its high prevalence, there is surprisingly limited evidence to inform best clinical practice both at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. We present seven vignettes to illustrate common clinical management questions that arise during the course of MGUS. Where evidence is present, we provide a concise summary of the literature and clear recommendations on management. Where evidence is lacking, we describe how we practice and provide a rationale for our approach. We also discuss the potential harms associated with MGUS diagnosis, a topic that is rarely, if ever, broached between patients and providers, or even considered in academic debate.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS): Real-world data on outcomes and prognostic factors [^116heGxK]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is defined by a serum or urine monoclonal protein of less than 3 g/dL and 500 mg/24 h, respectively, and by less than 10% monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Currently, no treatment is indicated for MGUS outside of a clinical trial. The cumulative risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM) has been widely reported and is about 1% per year over 20 years.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is characterized by 10%–60% monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or ≥ 3 g/dL of monoclonal component in the serum or urine of ≥ 500 mg/24 h. In SMM, there is no organ damage, and treatment is indicated only in the context of a clinical trial. Three new criteria have been introduced to predict increased risk of progression from SMM to symptomatic MM within two years from diagnosis: bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%, free light chain (FLC) ratio > 100 (or if κ/λ ratio is used, ≥ 100 or ≤ 0.01), and ≥ 1 bone lesion detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — now defined as SLiM-CRAB.

However, both MGUS and SMM may be harmful in the absence of the usual SLiM-CRAB criteria. A newer term, monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS), indicates organ compromise secondary to the production of clonal paraprotein(s), which damages the kidney, eye, heart, liver, or neurological compartment. In addition to MGUS and SMM, this may also be a manifestation of small B-cell clones arising from lymphoproliferative diseases, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

### IgG4-related disease: What a hematologist needs to know [^115a7cbj]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately 70% of patients with IgG4-RD have an elevated serum IgG4 level. Serum IgG subclasses should be investigated in conjunction with serum protein electrophoresis to exclude a monoclonal paraprotein. Serum IgG4 level has a diagnostic sensitivity ranging from 83–97% and specificity from 60–85%, with a general cut-off of "above the upper limit of normal". Typically, 1.35 g/L is used as the biomarker cut-off for IgG4-RD, which corresponds to the upper limit of normal for one common commercial method but not another, without specifying the methodology. While mildly elevated serum IgG4 can be seen in many conditions, markedly elevated serum IgG4 (> 5 g/L) is approximately 90% specific for IgG4-RD. Aside from methodological differences, serum IgG4 levels in IgG4-RD can vary greatly depending on ethnicity and degree of organ involvement.

In the Boston cohort of patients (76% White), only 53 of 103 patients had elevated serum IgG4 levels. In contrast, in a cohort of 334 Japanese patients, more than 95% had elevated serum IgG4. In our multi-ethnic cohort, we found that Asians have a higher serum IgG4 than non-Asians (median 11.2 g/L versus 2.9 g/L, P = 0.0094), and elevated serum IgG4 had a sensitivity of 96% in Asians compared to 67% in non-Asians. Patients with multi-organ involvement or of Asian ethnicity typically have elevated serum IgG4, sometimes markedly so, such as the patient in this illustrative case. The serum IgG4/IgG ratio is typically > 0.2 in patients with IgG4-RD, although the ratio does not increase the diagnostic specificity.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, particularly in laboratory testing, AACC/ASCP/CAP 2022 guidelines recommend using total immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, or IgM) for the quantitation of M proteins in patients with intact M proteins outside the c region by SPEP. Consider obtaining the quantitation of a band in the b region by SPEP if the M protein is distinguished from background normal protein bands.

### Clinical applications of mass spectrometry in multiple myeloma [^116YdtmV]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is an emerging tool in multiple myeloma that detects and quantifies monoclonal proteins in the peripheral blood with sensitivity several orders of magnitude greater than conventional serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. Both intact light chain (top-down) and clonotypic peptide (bottom-up) MS approaches have demonstrated sensitivity comparable to — or even surpassing — bone marrow-based assessments using next-generation flow cytometry or sequencing. However, due to the delayed clearance of paraproteins, MS may be less informative for early response assessment, underscoring the need to define the optimal timing for evaluation. MS assays have now transitioned from research settings to commercial availability, addressing the clinical demand for sensitive, non-invasive monitoring tools that avoid reliance on bone marrow biopsies. This review provides an overview of MS and explores its growing role in clinical practice.

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^116BpJnY]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The process for identifying patients with monoclonal gammopathies is complex. Initial detection of a monoclonal immunoglobulin protein (M protein) in the serum or urine often requires compilation of analytical data from several areas of the laboratory. The detection of M proteins depends on the adequacy of the sample provided, available clinical information, and the laboratory tests used.

- **Objective**: To develop an evidence-based guideline for the initial laboratory detection of M proteins.

- **Design**: To develop evidence-based recommendations, the College of American Pathologists convened a panel of experts in the diagnosis and treatment of monoclonal gammopathies and the laboratory procedures used for the initial detection of M proteins. The panel conducted a systematic literature review to address key questions. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, recommendations were created based on the available evidence, strength of that evidence, and key judgments as defined in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Evidence to Decision framework.

- **Results**: Nine guideline statements were established to optimize sample selection and testing for the initial detection and quantitative measurement of M proteins used to diagnose monoclonal gammopathies.

- **Conclusions**: This guideline was constructed to harmonize and strengthen the initial detection of an M protein in patients displaying symptoms or laboratory features of a monoclonal gammopathy. It endorses more comprehensive initial testing when appropriate.

### Interference of M-protein on thrombin time test: A case report [^115ooJTR]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A case of interference of monoclonal protein (M-protein) on the thrombin time (TT) test in a 39-year-old Caucasian male patient is presented.

- **Methods**: Coagulation screening tests were performed, showing altered results only for the TT result (> 150 seconds) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) result (36 seconds). Further specific coagulation testing included measurement of individual coagulation factors FII, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, and FXII. Diagnostic steps for the detection and identification of monoclonal protein included serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation (both serum and urine specimens).

- **Results**: Monoclonal protein immunoglobulin G kappa detection and identification in serum and urine clarified the situation.

- **Conclusion**: Unexpectedly altered results of screening coagulation tests, without any appropriate clinical signs and symptoms in a patient without any anticoagulant therapy, need to be critically considered. Extended diagnostic steps are required to clarify the cause of pathological test results.

### New definition of light chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^116FQBWq]. JAMA Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question**: Can the definition of light chain (LC) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) be improved?

- **Findings**: In this cohort study of 75,422 individuals, standard reference intervals led to overdiagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies. Revised age-stratified reference intervals for free light chains (FLC) were calculated, and a new definition of LC-MGUS was proposed; the new definition decreased the prevalence of LC-MGUS by 82%.

- **Meaning**: A new definition of LC-MGUS can substantially decrease false-positive diagnoses and optimize care.

### Clinically unsuspected cryoglobulinemia: Cases that present as laboratory artifact [^113A37x8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Anecdotal instances of atypical laboratory findings have suggested the possibility of unsuspected cryoglobulinemia. We applied predetermined criteria to assess how often these findings predict clinically significant cryoglobulinemia. The laboratory criteria include:

- **Smeared M-spike (paraprotein)**: Observed in agarose gel serum protein electrophoresis.
- **Precipitated protein**: Noted at the serum application point of agarose electrophoresis gel.
- **Quantitative discrepancies**: Greater than 50% variation between densitometrically estimated M-spike and the corresponding serum immunoglobulin isotype concentration from the same specimen.
- **Smeared protein**: Observed on an agarose electrophoresis immunofixation gel.

We prospectively collected cases satisfying any of these criteria over two years. Brouet types and clinical findings were determined when cryoglobulins were subsequently identified and when clinical data were available. Among 83 patients with identified laboratory findings, 52 underwent cryoglobulin evaluations, and 14 of these 52 had cryoglobulinemia. Clinically significant cryoglobulinemia was indicated in 8 out of 10 patients with available follow-up clinical data.

### Monitoring residual myeloma: High-resolution serum/urine electrophoresis or marrow biopsy with immunohistochemical analysis [^111UYzk5]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Numerous methods exist for monitoring residual disease in multiple myeloma using peripheral blood, urine, and bone marrow (BM) techniques. This study was conducted in a cohort of 83 patients to compare residual disease detection using serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPE) with immunofixation with immunoperoxidase staining of BM tissue sections. Of the 83 patients, 49 had a positive SPE and/or UPE result, and all had BM involvement shown by immunohistochemical analysis. The results for SPE and UPE were negative in 17 patients, and all 17 had a negative immunohistochemical BM result for a negative predictive value for SPE/UPE of 100%. In addition, SPE and UPE detected residual disease in 17 patients with negative BM biopsy studies. SPE and UPE can be used to screen patients for residual disease, and negative results for both can obviate the need for BM biopsy for the detection of residual disease by immunohistochemical analysis.

### Replacing urine protein electrophoresis with serum free light chain analysis as a first-line test for detecting plasma cell disorders offers increased diagnostic accuracy and potential health benefit to patients [^117F2xiY]. American journal of clinical pathology (2013). High credibility.

To determine the most clinically effective diagnostic testing strategy for plasma cell disorders in the clinical laboratory, serum and urine samples from 2,799 patients with suspected plasma cell dyscrasias were tested. The alternative diagnostic testing strategies comprised serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) in combination with either urine protein electrophoresis (UPE) or serum free light chain (sFLC) analysis.

The combination of sFLC analysis and SPE demonstrated the greatest sensitivity (100%), successfully detecting abnormalities in all 124 patients diagnosed with plasma cell disorders. The routine use of sFLC testing has significant potential health benefits. For example, one patient, who had a markedly abnormal sFLC result, was diagnosed with light chain deposition disease through a renal biopsy, though no abnormality was detected by SPE or UPE. In another case, a patient diagnosed with multiple plasmacytomas following a lung tumor biopsy exhibited a grossly abnormal sFLC result, but only equivocal weak-positive results through SPE, and no urine sample was received by the laboratory for the patient.

In conclusion, our study suggests that the combination of SPE and sFLC analysis is the most clinically effective first-line diagnostic testing strategy for detecting plasma cell disorders in the clinical laboratory.

### Oligoclonal bands of immunoglobulins in serum leading to diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection [^115mBUru]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

To present a unique case where detection of oligoclonal bands in serum led to the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a 64-year-old man treated for hypertension for 11 years had laboratory tests ordered by his primary care physician, including serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and serum immunofixation electrophoresis.

The total serum protein concentration was elevated at 9.6 g/dL. The SPE showed an oligoclonal pattern of multiple discrete bands in the γ region; the concentration of one band was approximately 1 g/dL and that of two bands was approximately 0.5 g/dL each, with multiple smaller overlapping bands at approximately 0.1 g/dL each. All fractions by SPE were within reference intervals except for the γ fraction, which was elevated at 3.4 g/dL. The IFE demonstrated that this oligoclonal pattern was a mixture of multiple bands of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-λ and IgG-κ. The patient's HIV-1 antibody screen and HIV-1 Western blot were positive on three subsequent visits, with strongly positive HIV-1 antibody index values of more than 50 (cutoff value of 1.0 for reactivity).

The etiology of HIV-associated clonal immunoglobulin bands is hypothesized to result from chronic antigenic stimulation leading to B-cell hyperplasia. In this regard, hypergammaglobulinemia is a well-known consequence of HIV infection due to B-cell activation, associated with paraproteins, and can be seen at any stage of the disease.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance:

- **Follow-up recommendations**: BSH 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining appropriate blood tests — including CBC, creatinine, serum calcium, paraprotein, and serum free light chain levels — 6 months after diagnosis and annually thereafter in patients with newly diagnosed MGUS. Consider extending the interval for low-risk MGUS and reducing further investigations in patients with a short life expectancy.

### Prognosis of young patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) [^115BR9vy]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The size of M protein in our study is relatively small compared to those in previous studies. There are two potential explanations for this observation. First, our young MGUS patients were likely diagnosed at an earlier stage of their disease process, unlike older patients who had a longer history of undiagnosed MGUS until it was identified incidentally. The size of M protein gradually increases in the majority of patients over the course of the disease. It is possible that immune-related conditions are the early trigger for the development of plasma cell disorders, as the size of M protein was frequently reported as unquantifiable in the setting of immune-related conditions.

Second, the unquantifiable M protein in patients with immune-related conditions might not represent bona-fide MGUS, as some of them did not persist. There were 36 patients in whom we observed the disappearance of M protein. In a smaller number of patients, we could not ascertain the status of the M protein because these patients were lost to follow-up after the diagnosis of MGUS. We found that the M protein was more likely to resolve in the patients with immune-related conditions compared with those without these conditions. The patients with immune-related conditions also had a lower serum concentration of M protein. The pathophysiology behind the resolution of M protein is not clear. Murray et al. reported that unquantifiable M proteins were less likely to persist, as 30% of the unquantifiable M proteins disappeared in their study.

### Value of serum-free light chain measurements in response and progression assessment in multiple myeloma with monoclonal protein measurable by electrophoresis [^115vDdN7]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Low credibility.

This retrospective study included newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients evaluated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester between 2011 and 2021. Only patients with measurable levels of serum-free light chains (sFLC) by FLC assay and M-protein by either serum electrophoresis (sPEP) and/or 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis (uPEP) at baseline were included. We selected this population to compare changes in sFLC levels with those of M-protein measured by electrophoresis. According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), measurable disease in multiple myeloma (MM) is defined as follows: for serum FLC assay, involved FLC level ≥ 10 mg/dL with an abnormal serum FLC ratio; for serum M-protein, level ≥ 1 g/dL; and for urine M-protein, level ≥ 200 mg in a 24-hour urine collection. The data for the following three variables — the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chains (dFLC), serum M-protein by sPEP, and urine M-protein by uPEP — were collected longitudinally during the study in response to progression.

In the response set, available data for each biomarker were collected at baseline, after each cycle during induction therapy (4 cycles), and at the time of the best response. In the context of disease progression (PD), data for each biomarker were collected at three time points before the initiation of treatment and at the time of second-line therapy.

We excluded patients who did not have at least two serial measurements for each marker (dFLC, serum M-protein, and urine M-protein). All cohorts were stratified into different categories based on the presence of measurable M-protein.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, especially concerning risk assessment, the BSH 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining risk stratification, either in primary care or secondary care, using a validated published model. Preferably, models that do not involve a bone marrow examination should be used to optimize initial management and further follow-up in patients with newly diagnosed MGUS.

### Successful hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in multicentric Castleman disease complicated by POEMS syndrome [^117SPraQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

A 39-year-old male presented with pedal edema, pleural effusion, splenomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of a monoclonal protein. Histological examination of the spleen following splenectomy showed multifocal vascular proliferation and angiovascular lesions consistent with multicentric Castleman disease. He was treated with steroids and rituximab, but without improvement. The patient was found to have portal venous thrombosis and lower extremity arterial thrombosis. He then received combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone but developed a severe inflammatory polyneuropathy that left him disabled and wheelchair-bound. A diagnosis of multicentric Castleman disease with POEMS syndrome was made, and he then received high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by autologous peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation. Following transplantation, his nerve conduction studies improved and his serum protein electrophoresis normalized. He is currently ambulatory and does not need wheelchair assistance. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation may be a treatment option for patients with multicentric Castleman disease and POEMS syndrome.

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^114T5mNA]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The classification and differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies are based on clinical, biological, and radiological criteria but remain challenging in certain cases. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common malignant gammopathy and is associated with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. In the past decade, the treatment options for patients with MM have increased considerably. Together with improved supportive care, these new regimens significantly prolong the survival of both younger and older patients. The 2014 revision of the diagnostic criteria for MM allows the initiation of treatment in patients defined only by biomarkers, annotated as SLIM criteria [bone marrow (BM) infiltration > 60%, involved/uninvolved serum free light-chain (SFLC) ratio > 100 or > 1 focal lesion > 5 mm as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], without waiting for conventional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone disease) to occur. Given the recent evolution in diagnosis and response assessment, members of the European Myeloma Network (EMN) agreed to review and recommend diagnostic and response criteria to allow their discriminating use in daily practice and care of patients.

- **Differential diagnosis**: The differential diagnosis between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering myeloma, and multiple myeloma. The discrimination between these monoclonal gammopathies is based on: (i) the plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow, (ii) the presence of clinical symptoms.

### Measurement of monoclonal immunoglobulin protein concentration in serum protein electrophoresis: Comparison of automated vs manual/human readings [^113YXinj]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Protein concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulin in plasma-cell myeloma, also known as multiple myeloma, provides an estimate of the tumor mass and allows for monitoring of the response to treatment. Accurate and reproducible estimates of the monoclonal immunoglobulin concentration are important for patient care.

- **Objective**: To address the optimum method for the estimation of the concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulins.

- **Methods**: Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis were conducted using the Helena SPIFE Touch instrument. The estimation of the protein concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulin in the gamma region by computer-assisted reading was compared with the reading by technologists and pathology residents in 300 gels. The data were compared using t-testing and analysis of variance.

- **Results**: Computer-generated readings had a consistent positive bias. The correlation coefficient of the average reading by technologists and residents with the computer-generated value was 0.997. The average positive bias by the computer reading was 0.29 g per dL. The intercept on the regression analysis was 0.22 g per dL. The reading by the computer was significantly higher than each of the human-interpreted readings. The readings by the three human groups were not significantly different amongst themselves. The main reason for the higher reading by the computer was the inclusion of a greater area on the anodal side of the peak on the densitometric scan.

- **Conclusions**: Human- and computer-interpreted readings of the protein concentration of monoclonal immunoglobulin have a high degree of correlation.

### IgM monoclonal gammopathy with heavy-and-light-chain amyloidosis resembling fibrillary glomerulonephritis determined by tandem mass spectrometry: A case report [^111NtoR9]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

A 75-year-old man visited our hospital because of exacerbation of lower extremity edema that he had noticed 3 months before admission. He had received annual medical checks and had no specific medical history. His body weight had increased by 10 kg over the past 5 months, and his systemic edema was remarkable. Urinary protein was 9.9 g/day, no microscopic hematuria was detected, and his serum creatinine was 1.15 mg/dL on admission. The serum protein fractions showed an M peak at a high level, and serum IgM was 1657 mg/dL. Protein electrophoresis showed IgM κ type M proteinemia. Although his monoclonal IgM was increased, a bone marrow biopsy showed normal findings, with no infiltration of abnormal lymphocytes in plasma cells or chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting that this was a case of IgM monoclonal gammopathy rather than primary macroglobulinemia.

Because the patient did not agree to our proposal initially, a renal biopsy was performed 3 months after his first admission to elucidate the cause of his nephrotic syndrome. Thus, the etiology of his nephrosis was initially unknown due to the lack of renal biopsy. Considering his background, the possibility of membranous nephropathy was high; consequently, we administered 30 mg of oral prednisolone first. Three months after his first admission, the patient agreed to receive a renal biopsy.

Under light microscopy, the biopsy sample largely consisted of renal cortex and contained 34 glomeruli. Marked enlargement of the mesangial region and strong periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive deposits were observed.

### The evaluation of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance: A consensus report of the International Kidney and Monoclonal Gammopathy Research Group [^115cW2DQ]. Nature Reviews. Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Another critical test is the serum free light-chain assay, which detects unbound free light chains. This assay measures κ and λ free light chains independently and can be used to determine the κ:λ free light-chain ratio. Clonality can be inferred from an abnormal κ:λ free light-chain ratio: a high ratio indicates a κ clone, whereas a low ratio indicates a λ clone. Because free light chains are cleared by the kidney, impaired renal function alters the free light-chain concentration.

The 'normal' free light-chain ratio, 0.26–1.65, can rise to 0.34–3.10 in patients with severe renal impairment (CKD stage 5 or greater), but small declines in renal function can also impair free light-chain clearance. Knowing which serum free light-chain assay is being used by the laboratory is extremely important, as at least two major assays are currently on the market. Not only are the results of these assays mathematically inconvertible, but the effects of renal impairment differ between these assays; the evidence suggests that the N Latex assay is less affected than the FreeLite assay by impaired renal function. Thus, the same assay must be used to monitor a particular patient throughout their treatment.

Moreover, given that the two assays have different performance characteristics, free light-chain levels might need to be checked using the other assay if the first result is negative. In addition, serum immunofixation might be more helpful than serum free light-chain assays in diseases associated with an intact monoclonal immunoglobulin, such as PGNMID.

### Prognosis of young patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) [^116zUvnr]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is defined as the presence of monoclonal (M) protein ≤ 3 g/dL in the peripheral blood, plasma cells < 10% in the bone marrow, and the absence of end-organ damage or CRAB features related to M protein or clonal plasma cells. MGUS is perceived as a premalignant entity of multiple myeloma and lymphoplasmacytic malignancies in patients older than 50 years. The progression rate of MGUS in these patients to malignant disorders is about 1% per year. The prevalence of MGUS in young patients (age < 40 years) is < 0.3%, representing about 2% of all patients with MGUS. The clinical course of young MGUS patients remains largely unknown.

A variety of risk factors have been associated with the risk of progression from MGUS to other plasma cell disorders, but their impact has not been specifically evaluated in younger patients with MGUS. Specifically, the impact of immune-related conditions, including autoimmune, infectious, and inflammatory disorders occurring in the context of monoclonal gammopathy, has not been studied. Lindqvist et al. reported in a large case-control study that the risk of MGUS was higher in patients with all categories of immune-related conditions. Similar relations were highlighted regarding multiple myeloma (MM) by Brown et al, who found that patients with immune-related conditions were 15–29% more likely to develop MM. Autoimmune diseases have been associated with an increase in the risk of MGUS and MM. In patients with autoimmune diseases, the age of onset of MM is earlier. Constant stimulation to the immune system may lead to this increased risk.

### What about (MG)US? Towards tailored testing in monoclonal gammopathies [^116We96T]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

A further layer of complexity in monoclonal gammopathies is the existence of very rare, non-malignant, albeit severely disabling entities, such as light-chain amyloidosis or renal, neurological, or myopathic disease for which the abbreviation "MGCS" (monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance) was coined. These entities are typically characterized by their underlying low-burden plasma cell dyscrasias and a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms. This highlights the need for more sensitive laboratory tests with respect to both confirming the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy and monitoring treatment response.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry has the potential to identify even small amounts of monoclonal proteins that go unrecognized by serum protein electrophoresis and serum immunofixation. A large study has proven its superiority in detecting monoclonal gammopathies in a defined screening cohort. Mass spectrometry could, in the future, replace serum immunofixation, resulting in greater accuracy in detecting gammopathies and excluding false-positive cases on immunofixation. The incremental benefit of this advanced technology is most likely to occur in low-level conditions. From a diagnostic perspective, certain "red flags" may serve as initial clues to the underlying clonal B-/plasma cell proliferation. Awareness is a prerequisite to allow for a timely diagnosis.

### Performance of the Sebia CAPILLARYS 2 for detection and immunotyping of serum monoclonal paraproteins [^115oxqTm]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

We evaluated the performance of the CAPILLARYS 2 (Sebia, Norcross, GA) capillary electrophoresis system for detection and identification of monoclonal proteins in serum samples. We analyzed 104 serum specimens by Sebia Hydragel serum protein electrophoresis, using agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE)/immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), and CAPILLARYS 2 capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)/immunosubtraction. AGE and CZE had sensitivities of 90% and 81%, respectively, based on IFE as the "gold standard", with all bands detected confirmed by IFE (100% specificity). AGE and CZE agreed 91% of the time on serum protein electrophoresis results.

In the population tested, IgG was detected in 29% of samples by IFE and 30% using immunosubtraction. Similarly, IgA was detected in 9% of cases by IFE and 8% by immunosubtraction. IgM and light chains were detected in 6% and 3% of cases, respectively, by IFE, whereas CZE/immunosubtraction did not detect any IgM or light chains. In our hands, AGE and CZE had the same specificity for detection of monoclonal proteins; however, CZE/immunosubtraction seems to be less sensitive than IFE for the detection of IgM and, possibly, serum light chains.

### Are renal reference intervals required when screening for plasma cell disorders with serum free light chains and serum protein electrophoresis [^116oz8hL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Renal impairment and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia may abnormally increase the serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio, giving false-positive results with reference intervals. We measured sFLCs with concomitant serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) in 281 patients. Results were interpreted relative to renal function, based on serum creatinine concentrations, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Overall, 78 plasma cell disorders (PCDs) were detected with the serum panel of SPEP/sFLC, compared to 76 with SPEP/UPEP.

In 13 samples with negative SPEP/UPEP, mildly increased ratios up to 3.1 (normal range: 0.26–1.65) were observed: 10 were associated with increased serum creatinine, 1 with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and 2 were unassociated with either condition. In 2 samples, decreased kappa/lambda ratios were identified that were clinically significant despite normal SPEP/UPEP. Two monoclonal gammopathies were identified with UPEP and sFLC, but samples were normal with SPEP. Screening for PCDs with a serum panel consisting of SPEP and the sFLC assays is a highly sensitive approach that could eliminate the need for UPEP. A mildly increased kappa/lambda ratio up to 3.1 was observed with increased serum creatinine and/or polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, consistent with pathophysiologic changes. Therefore, renal reference intervals are recommended.

### Monoclonal immunoglobulin mediates complement activation in monoclonal gammopathy associated-C3 glomerulonephritis [^113kfbKN]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old Chinese man presented with microscopic haematuria for 2 years and oedema for 8 months. The patient had a past medical history of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), hypertension, angina pectoris, and hypothyroidism.

On admission, the physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, a temperature of 36.5 °C, a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. Severe bilateral symmetrical lower extremity oedema was noted.

Urine dipstick showed blood (3+) and protein (3+), and urinalysis revealed 80–90 RBCs/HPF with a majority of dysmorphic RBCs. Laboratory findings included a serum albumin concentration of 20 g/L and proteinuria of 8.06 g/d. His serum creatinine level rose from 1.41 mg/dL to 2.96 mg/dL over 10 months and decreased to 1.81 mg/dL following diuretic therapy.

His haemoglobin level was 77 g/L (normal range: 130–175 g/L) and platelet count was 212 × 10⁹ cells/L (normal range: 125–350 × 10⁹ cells/L). The C3 level was low at 0.356 g/L (normal range: 0.6–1.5 g/L), the C4 level was normal at 0.162 g/L (normal range: 0.12–0.36 g/L), and plasma CFH level was normal at 392.9 μg/mL (normal range: 247–1010.8 μg/mL). His serum IgG level was 9.89 g/L (normal range: 7.23–16.85 g/L), IgA level was 2.38 g/L (normal range: 0.69–3.82 g/L), and IgM level was 0.78 g/L (normal range: 0.63–2.77 g/L).

Both serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal IgGλ. A bone marrow puncture was performed, leading to a diagnosis of plasma cell dyscrasias.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of increasing significance: Time to screen [^116jBpqH]. Haematologica (2023). Low credibility.

Is monoclonal gammopathy harmful enough to warrant screening? The mechanisms by which different types of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) cause organ dysfunction and morbidity are incompletely understood. Although MG can lead to malignant transformation and paraprotein-mediated tissue damage, it has also been repeatedly associated with an increased occurrence of other diagnoses, known as monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). The biological explanation for MGCS is even less well understood; it is possible that the mechanisms leading to cancerous and non-cancerous consequences overlap.

### Value of serum-free light chain measurements in response and progression assessment in multiple myeloma with monoclonal protein measurable by electrophoresis [^117NnG88]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). High credibility.

All measurements of monoclonal components (serum and urine M-protein) were prospectively performed and collected from the electronic medical records. Serum and urine M-protein were quantified by serum and urine electrophoresis (sPEP/uPEP). The serum FLC assay was performed using FREELITE (The Binding Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom). This assay measures two distinct components, kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) free light chain, quantifying the concentration of each element separately and providing a ratio within a normal range of 0.26–1.65. In this study, the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chains (dFLC) was considered a primary variable of interest for comparison with serum and urine M-protein levels, measured by electrophoresis.

- **Response and progression definition**: Response and progression assessments for each marker were classified according to the IMWG guidelines. We applied the IMWG response and progression criteria for MM with measurable serum and urine M-protein disease quantified by electrophoresis. FLC response and progression were evaluated based on changes in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels, as established by the IMWG response criteria for the FLC measurable disease. FLC responses were outlined as follows: Very good partial response (VGPR) as a reduction of 90% or more of dFLC, partial response (PR) as a reduction of more than 50%, and less than 90% of dFLC. FLC progression is defined as a 25% increase in dFLC and an absolute increase in involved FLC of at least 10 mg/dL.

### What do the elevated protein levels mean in my patients with myeloma, amyloidosis, and related disorders [^115uLPTN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma, light chain amyloidosis, and other plasma cell dyscrasias are characterized, in part, by abnormal production of paraproteins that are often responsible for the sequelae of these diseases. These paraproteins are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins produced by clonal antibody-secreting cells, usually plasma cells, but occasionally B lymphocytes. Significant heterogeneity exists in the presentation of these diseases, ranging from incidental detection of a monoclonal protein in an asymptomatic patient to life-threatening manifestations that require urgent diagnostic confirmation and intervention. Successful management of such scenarios requires a fundamental understanding of the laboratory assays at one's disposal, their role in the workup of paraproteinemias, and their interpretation. This review broadly covers these assays and their roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of these diseases.

### Consensus recommendations for standard investigative workup: Report of the International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel 3 [^112HUemF]. Blood (2011). High credibility.

A panel of members of the 2009 International Myeloma Workshop developed guidelines for the standard investigative workup of patients with suspected multiple myeloma. Both serum and urine should be assessed for monoclonal protein. Measurement of monoclonal protein, both by densitometer tracing and nephelometric quantitation, is recommended, and immunofixation is required for confirmation. The serum-free light chain assay is recommended in all newly diagnosed patients with plasma cell dyscrasias. Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy, along with demonstration of clonality of plasma cells, are necessary. Serum β(2)-microglobulin, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase are necessary for prognostic purposes. Standard metaphase cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization for 17p, t(4;14), and t(14;16) are recommended. The skeletal survey remains the standard method for imaging screening; however, magnetic resonance imaging frequently provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. Most of these tests are repeated during follow-up or at relapse.

### Screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is contraindicated [^1179j5p4]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Even with evidence of the lack of usefulness of the κ/λ ratio as a diagnostic marker for MGUS, patients are being subjected to additional testing, including bone marrow biopsy without the benefit of urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIFE). A particularly problematic sentiment has been expressed by the authors of the iStopMM study, namely, "To address this, we recently described the first screened cohort of LC-SMM and proposed an updated definition consisting of abnormal FLC levels together with > 10% PC in the bone marrow (BM), and overcomes the inconvenience and ineffectiveness of using urine measurements of monoclonal proteins".

This sentiment suggests that UIFE is more inconvenient than a trephine bone biopsy, which is clearly contrary to most patients' perceptions of urinalysis versus invasive bone biopsy. In addition, UIFE is not ineffective; in fact, in a large study, a positive UIFE was the only evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy in about 3% of cases.

Serum free light chain (SFLC) assay and κ/λ ratio have limited usefulness in MGUS and other disorders. Documented utility for SFLC is limited to monitoring light chain MM and the diagnosis of light chain predominant multiple myeloma (LCPMM). Other diagnostic criteria based on SFLC have been contested. For example, involved light chain level and ratio of involved to uninvolved light chain level in diagnosing myeloma-defining condition have a sensitivity of < 16%. It is possible that had the criterion been based on light chain-specific levels, it might have been more useful for diagnosing MM.

### Noninfectious mixed cryoglobulinaemic glomerulonephritis and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a coincidental association [^115SBVUw]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy is diagnosed when monoclonal immunoglobulin (mIg) secreted into the circulation by a proliferating clone of plasma cells or B cells is detected through serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), immunofixation (SIFE), free light chain assays (SFLC), or urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) or immunofixation (UIFE). Further evaluation is often required for one or other of the malignant clonal disorders, which include multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia, B cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, in most patients, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or another pre-malignant condition is diagnosed.

Previous studies have established a clear association of type 1 cryoglobulinaemic glomerulonephritis (CGN) not only with malignant clonal disorders but also with MGUS. This has led to the inclusion of type 1 CGN within the disease classification of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). This term recognizes that certain renal lesions may be the result of nephrotoxic monoclonal immunoglobulin produced by small (i.e. pre-malignant) plasma cell or B cell clones, with confirmation in many cases based on light chain-restricted renal staining.

### Screening and diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies: An international survey of laboratory practice [^1122V2W2]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Serum tests used for the screening and diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies include serum protein electrophoresis (SPE; agarose gel or capillary zone), immunofixation (IFE), immunosubtraction capillary electrophoresis, serum free light chains, quantitative immunoglobulins, and heavy/light-chain combinations. Urine protein electrophoresis and urine IFE may also be used to identify Bence-Jones proteinuria.

- **Objective**: To assess laboratory practice for monoclonal gammopathy testing.

- **Design**: In April 2016, a voluntary questionnaire was distributed to 923 laboratories participating in a protein electrophoresis proficiency testing survey.

- **Results**: Seven hundred seventy-four laboratories from 38 countries and regions completed the questionnaire (83.9% response rate; 774 of 923). The majority of participants (68.6%; 520 of 758) used agarose gel electrophoresis as their SPE method, whereas 31.4% (238 of 758) used capillary zone electrophoresis. The most common test approaches used in screening were SPE with reflex to IFE/immunosubtraction capillary electrophoresis (39.3%; 299 of 760); SPE only (19.1%; 145 of 760); SPE and IFE or immunosubtraction capillary electrophoresis (13.9%; 106 of 760); and SPE with IFE, serum free light chain, and quantitative immunoglobulins (11.8%; 90 of 760). Only 39.8% (305 of 767) of laboratories offered panel testing for ordering convenience. Although SPE was used by most laboratories in diagnosing new cases of myeloma, when laboratories reported the primary test used to follow patients with monoclonal gammopathy, only 55.7% (truncated).

### Comparison of serum free light chain and urine electrophoresis for the detection of the light chain component of monoclonal immunoglobulins in light chain and intact immunoglobulin multiple myeloma [^1167jwUT]. Haematologica (2016). Low credibility.

Response criteria for multiple myeloma are based on changes in monoclonal protein levels quantified using serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis. The latter lacks sensitivity at low monoclonal protein levels, and since 2001, the serum free light chain test has been available and its clinical utility proven. However, guidelines have not recommended it as a replacement for urine assessment. Herein, we evaluated responses using serum free light chain measurements and serum and urine electrophoresis after 2 and 4 cycles of therapy and after stem cell transplantation in 25 light chain and 157 intact immunoglobulin myeloma patients enrolled in the IFM 2007–02 MM trial.

All 25 light chain patients had measurable disease by serum free light chain and urine methods at presentation. By contrast, 98 out of 157 intact immunoglobulin patients had measurable disease by serum free light chain, compared to 55 out of 157 by urine electrophoresis. In all patients, there was substantial agreement between predicate (serum/urine protein electrophoresis) and test (serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chain) methods for response assessment (Weighted Kappa = 0.83).

Urine immunofixation became negative in 47% of light chain and 43% of intact immunoglobulin patients after 2 cycles of therapy. At this time, the serum free light chain ratio normalized in only 11% and 27% of patients, respectively. In summary, we found good agreement between methods for response assessment, but the serum free light chain test provided greater sensitivity than urine electrophoresis for monitoring. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis demonstrating the enhanced sensitivity of serum free light chain measurements in the context of multiple myeloma response evaluation.

### Value of serum-free light chain measurements in response and progression assessment in multiple myeloma with monoclonal protein measurable by electrophoresis [^113dt7xS]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Low credibility.

According to IMWG guidelines, serum-free light chain (sFLC) is included in the multiple myeloma (MM) response assessment to define stringent complete response (sCR). Serial sFLC measurements are indicated only for evaluating response and progression in patients without measurable M-protein in the serum or urine, as defined by IMWG response criteria, with at least 1 g/dL and 200 mg/24 h in the serum and urine, respectively. M-protein should be measured using serum protein electrophoresis (sPEP) and/or urine protein electrophoresis (uPEP) at each assessment in these patients. If urine M-protein is not measurable at baseline, urine M-protein is not required to document partial or minor responses; however, it is necessary for complete and very good partial responses. Nevertheless, 24-hour urine assessments remain burdensome for patients, resulting in inadequate adherence and failure to assess disease response, especially in the setting of clinical trials.

Recent studies have suggested that sFLC may be used in place of 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis in most situations. This study was designed to determine how serial measurements of sFLC correlate with those of serum and urine-based assessments in monitoring response and progression in MM with serum and/or urine-measurable disease using standard electrophoretic methods. Additionally, we evaluated whether serial measurements of sFLC can replace the 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis as a measure of disease response in this cohort.

### Abnormalities of serum-free light chain in patients with primary antibody deficiency in the absence of B lymphocyte clonality [^114FTVuQ]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

A review of practice was conducted to determine whether serum-free light chain (SFLC) assays are helpful in detecting underlying clonal B-cell disorders or amyloidosis in patients with primary antibody deficiency (PAD) and reinfection.

- **Methods**: SFLC were assayed by nephelometry (BN2 nephelometer, Siemens; FREELITE assay, Binding Site). We reviewed SFLC test results recorded in our regional laboratory over a 4-year time period. Twenty adults with PAD were identified as having been tested on at least two occasions.

- **Results**: Of 20 patients, 4 with PAD had abnormal serum-free kappa/lambda (K/L) ratios but no evidence of B-cell clonality. We also found extremely low levels of kappa and/or lambda (below the limits of reliable detection) in 19 out of 20 PAD cases (mostly common variable immunodeficiency), such that in many, ratios were not calculable.

- **Conclusions**: The data suggest that the abnormal ratios are generated by an inability to produce and/or secrete SFLCs, particularly kappa FLC. In this small initial study, we seek to highlight PAD cases where a suspicious K/L ratio, typically with very low absolute quantities of SFLCs, most likely points to B-cell dysfunction, rather than to B lymphocyte clonality.

### Audit of use and overuse of serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis and serum free light chain assay in tertiary health care: A case for algorithmic testing to optimize laboratory utilization [^115HmH3h]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Overuse of laboratory tests is a persistent issue. We examined the use and overuse of serum immunofixation electrophoresis and serum free light chain assays to develop an algorithm for optimizing utilization.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of all tests, for the investigation of monoclonal gammopathies, was carried out for all patients who had any of these tests done from April 24, 2014, through July 25, 2014. The test orders were categorized as warranted or not warranted according to criteria presented in the article.

- **Results**: A total of 237 patients were tested, and their historical records included 1,503 episodes of testing for one or more of the following: serum protein electrophoresis, serum immunofixation electrophoresis, and serum free light chain assays. Only 46% of the serum immunofixation and 42% of the serum free light chain assays were warranted. Proper utilization at our institution alone would have obviated $64,182.95/year in healthcare costs, reduced the laboratory cost of reagents alone by $26,436.04/year, and put $21,904.92/year of part B reimbursement at risk.

- **Conclusions**: Fewer than half of the serum immunofixation and serum free light chain assays added value. The proposed algorithm for testing should improve utilization. Risk to part B billing may be a disincentive to reducing test utilization.

### Reflexing suspicious β-region findings on capillary serum protein electrophoresis to immunofixation or immunosubtraction for detecting monoclonal proteins [^1165reep]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

Monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-proteins) that migrate in the β region on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) are often cloaked by this region's normal constituents. The present study interrogates the utility of using both quantitative and qualitative alterations in β-region bands for detection of β-migrating M-proteins.

- **Methods**: Consecutive SPEP cases analyzed by capillary electrophoresis were searched to identify the initial workup on 1,841 patients with increased total β regions, suspicious β-region findings resulting in reflex immunofixation (IFE) or immunosubtraction (ISUB). To augment quantitative information, separate β1 and β2 measurements were established and retrospectively used to evaluate their sensitivity for M-protein detection.

- **Results**: We identified M-proteins in 205 (11.1%) cases, including immunoglobulin A (IgA) (54%), IgG (24%), IgM (13%), and free light chain (9%) isotypes. Of the 15 cases flagged by separate β1 and β2 measurements that were not identified by total β-region measurement, 1 progressed to myeloma. Of the 56 β-migrating M-proteins identified by qualitative features but without increase in any of the β-region measurements, 1 progressed to myeloma.

- **Conclusions**: A combination of separate measurements for β1 and β2 regions together with detection of β-region distortions increase sensitivity for identifying β-migrating M-proteins via reflex IFE or ISUB.

### Interference of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies with routine serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation in patients with myeloma: Frequency and duration of detection of daratumumab and elotuzumab [^111kX81Z]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

We investigated the frequency and pattern of detection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (t-mAbs) daratumumab and elotuzumab by routine serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IF) in treated patients with myeloma.

Detection of t-mAb was assessed in 22 patients by retrospective review of SPE/IF ordered prior to, during, and after 26 individual courses of therapy.

- **Detection results**: t-mAb was distinguishable from M-protein in 16 of 26 courses, with daratumumab detected in nine of nine and elotuzumab in six of seven patients. t-mAb was detected on the first follow-up SPE/IF in 12 patients, with the earliest detection 7 days after therapy initiation and the latest detection 70 days after therapy. t-mAb persisted throughout induction therapy in most patients, with loss of detection during maintenance daratumumab.

When distinguishable from M-protein, t-mAbs are detectable in 93% of treated patients as soon as 7 days after the initial dose and are consistently observed throughout induction therapy, warranting increased monitoring and careful interpretation of SPE/IF.

### Value of serum-free light chain measurements in response and progression assessment in multiple myeloma with monoclonal protein measurable by electrophoresis [^111qXh3E]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). High credibility.

We evaluated the correlation between responses and survival outcomes. The study compared the impact of achieving a very good partial response (VGPR) based on difference in free light chains (dFLC), serum M-protein by serum protein electrophoresis (sPEP), and urine M-protein by urine protein electrophoresis (uPEP) on progression-free survival (PFS) after four cycles of induction treatment for all cohorts, as well as by splitting into groups based on measurable monoclonal protein. This analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in PFS between VGPR responses assessed by dFLC, sPEP, and uPEP in all patients and within subgroups (p = 0.538).

- **Median progression-free survival (PFS)**: According to VGPR achievement, assessed by serum-free light chain (dFLC), serum/urine M-protein by electrophoresis (sM-protein/uM-protein).
	- A: Median PFS in patients achieving VGPR by serum-free light chain (sFLC), serum, and urine M-protein by electrophoresis (sM-protein/uM-protein), after the fourth cycle of induction therapy (all cohort).
	- **B**: Median PFS in patients achieving VGPR by serum-free light chain (sFLC), serum, and urine M-protein by electrophoresis (sM-protein/uM-protein), after the fourth cycle of induction therapy (splitting by measurable M-protein).

### A rare case of proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG2 kappa deposit: a case report [^113UtNMp]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

A 78-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with mild proteinuria, lower extremity edema, and worsening renal function. His serum creatinine level was 1.22 mg/dL just before referral to our hospital. His type 2 diabetes mellitus was well-controlled for several years (hemoglobin A1c 6.2–7.4%), and there was no family history of kidney disease.

On admission to our hospital, his blood pressure was 132/48 mmHg, pulse rate 78 beats/min, and body temperature 36.9 °C. Physical examination revealed no significant systolic heart murmur on auscultation. Examination of the lungs, abdomen, and central and peripheral nervous systems found no abnormalities. However, mild edema was observed in the lower extremities.

- **Patient's laboratory data**:
	- **Urinalysis**: Markedly elevated proteinuria (protein excretion, 6.37 g/day) and hematuria (10–19 red blood cells/high-powered field).
	- **Serum levels**: Albumin was 3.1 g/dL, creatinine was 1.68 mg/dL (reference range, 0.65–1.07 mg/dL), with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 56 mL/min/1.73 m².
	- **White blood cell count**: 8.62 × 10⁻³ cells/μL (reference range, 3.3 × 10⁻³–8.6 × 10⁻³ cells/μL).
	- **Hemoglobin level**: 10.5 g/dL (reference range, 13.7–16.8 g/dL).
	- **Platelet count**: 22.4 × 10⁴ cells/μL (reference range, 15.8 × 10⁴–34.8 × 10⁴ cells/μL).
	- **Immunoglobulin levels**: IgG was 1120 mg/dL (reference range, 861–1747 mg/dL), IgA was 222 mg/dL (reference range, 93–393 mg/dL), IgM was 28 mg/dL (reference range, 33–183 mg/dL).

### Screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is contraindicated [^112r1hTa]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is contraindicated as it is currently performed due to causing harm without providing benefit. MGUS is commonly found in elderly individuals, with a prevalence of 3.2% in people over 50 years of age. There is no treatment for this disorder. The diagnosis of MGUS can generate as much mental anguish and trauma as a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, partly due to the frequent re-evaluations to which patients are subjected.

- **Neoplastic disorders of plasma cells**: MGUS, asymptomatic/smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), and multiple myeloma (MM). MM is a malignant disorder that, while treatable, is not curable. MGUS and SMM are pre-malignant disorders. Patients with MGUS develop MM at a rate of 1–2% per year.

- **Spontaneous resolution and investigation**: A proportion of MGUS cases, especially kappa chain MGUS, resolve spontaneously. In cases where MGUS is discovered incidentally, additional investigation may be appropriate for symptomatic patients and particularly those with monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance. However, it is inappropriate to subject patients with just an abnormal κ/λ ratio to repeated monitoring and investigations. Notably, only 4% of patients with a κ/λ ratio greater than 1.65 had detectable monoclonal light chains in urine, and there was no other evidence of a monoclonal lesion. Subjecting individuals with abnormal κ/λ ratios — of whom 96% have pseudo-MGUS — to the surveillance protocol results in harm without providing benefit.

### Data analytics improves the diagnostic accuracy of serum free light chain results for detecting monoclonal gammopathy [^116bWCmU]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). High credibility.

The time period for sample inclusion was chosen randomly, with the goal of maximizing the number of samples that met our eligibility criteria; no sample size calculation was performed. Therefore, all consecutive clinical samples with a PE or immunofixation result reported between 2010 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion. Samples were categorized by the presence or absence of a single monoclonal component, according to the reported immunofixation interpretation result, outlined in Figure 1 and in the Supplementary Materials.

Only "first-occurrence" specimens (i.e. the first time a particular monoclonal component was identified for that patient) were included in the analyses to eliminate the effects of repeated testing of individuals with known monoclonal components and to limit bias introduced when a patient's previously identified monoclonal component was already known. Samples with indeterminate oligoclonal banding were not included in our data set. All quality control, research, and proficiency testing specimens were excluded from the analyses, as were specimens without medical record number information.

- **Figure 1**: Data analysis flowchart and descriptive characteristics of included specimens. Serum electrophoresis/immunofixation and SFLC data from 95,609 specimens tested over a 10-year period were filtered to yield a subset of 8178 first-occurrence specimens with conSFLC results for analysis. Specimens were grouped according to their respective immunofixation interpretations, and descriptive characteristics.

### Axial myopathy due to primary amyloidosis [^112S8Xrw]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old man presented with progressive weakness involving only his back muscles. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy. A muscle biopsy of affected muscles demonstrated amyloid light chain deposition surrounding individual muscle fibers as well as in the walls of blood vessels, in association with vasculitis. Selective involvement of axial muscles in isolated amyloid myopathy has not been previously described. We report the occurrence of axial myopathy with associated vasculitis as a presenting feature of primary (AL) amyloidosis. Amyloidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of focal myopathies, since the condition may be responsive to chemotherapy.

### Tixagevimab plus cilgavimab does not affect the interpretation of electrophoretic and free light chain assays [^112ijtaM]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). High credibility.

There is concern that the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, used as pre-exposure prophylaxis in patients with multiple myeloma, may appear as a detectable monoclonal protein by electrophoretic methods, resulting in misinterpretation or inability to measure therapeutic responses in some patients. In this pilot study, we characterize the effect of tixagevimab plus cilgavimab (Evusheld; T+C) on the interpretation of serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), and serum free light chain (sFLC) assays.

- **Methods**: We performed spiking experiments with T+C at serum maximum concentration following a 300-mg dose (1× Cmax) and at 10 times the concentration of Cmax (10× Cmax) with pooled serum samples. SPE and IFE technical procedures were performed on the SPIFE 3000, and sFLC and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subtype quantitation were performed on the Optilite.

- **Results**: T+C-associated interference was not visible as an M-spike in normogammaglobulinemic pooled samples. Hypogammaglobulinemic pooled samples at 10× Cmax demonstrated an M-spike in SPE and an immunoglobulin Gκ pattern in IFE. No increases were noted in the results of sFLC or IgG1 levels.

- **Conclusions**: This study indicates that T+C at pharmacologic Cmax is unlikely to interfere with SPE, IFE, sFLC, or IgG1 analyses when spiked into patient serum samples, but further evaluation of recently injected patients may be warranted.
