## Question

Show me HOMA -IR labs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about HOMA-IR labs — how to interpret and apply HOMA-IR, including when to order it, how to calculate it, how to handle units, which thresholds to use in different populations, how assays and preanalytical factors affect interpretation, how to act on results, and when to avoid using HOMA-IR altogether. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what HOMA-IR measures and why we use it. Then, I should verify the exact formulas and unit conversions. Next, I will review population-specific cutoffs and how they were derived. After that, I need to check the limitations and sources of variability, including assay issues and clinical context. Finally, I will outline a practical decision framework and a cautious, reference-supported approach to action and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the construct and clinical rationale. HOMA-IR is a surrogate index of hepatic insulin resistance calculated from a single fasting glucose and insulin, assuming steady-state physiology; higher values indicate that more insulin is required to maintain fasting glycemia, which tracks with metabolic risk even before overt dysglycemia, and this is precisely why HOMA-IR can identify early insulin resistance missed by glucose-only screening [^113ZJGRY] [^111YTyPC].

> Wait, let me verify the formulas and units before anything else. The classic equation is HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin in μU/mL × fasting glucose in mg/dL) / 405, and the metric form is HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin in μU/mL × fasting glucose in mmol/L) / 22.5; both yield identical results when units are correct, and the 22.5 constant reflects normal insulin × glucose products in a healthy reference state, so I need to ensure the insulin is in μU/mL and glucose is in the intended unit before I proceed.

> Hold on, I should verify the unit conversions to avoid errors. If glucose is reported in mmol/L, multiply by 18.0182 to get mg/dL; if insulin is reported in pmol/L, divide by 6 to get μU/mL; some sources use 6.9, but I need to be explicit about which conversion factor the local lab uses because assay calibrations vary and that can bias the HOMA estimate by up to 15% if I am not careful [^11137G2Q] [^117Beop1].

> Next, I should review thresholds and not jump to a single universal cutoff. Many adults use HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5 as a pragmatic marker of insulin resistance, and a European consensus endorses this level to flag early systemic metabolic disease, but population-based percentiles often set higher cutoffs around the 90th percentile, for example 3.46 in a Spanish cohort, and thresholds optimized for metabolic syndrome can be lower, such as 2.05 in the same study; thus, I need to align the cutoff with the clinical question and population [^113ZJGRY] [^116esCCZ] [^11483PJN].

> I will now examine adolescents and children because puberty complicates interpretation. During puberty, transient physiologic insulin resistance emerges and HOMA-IR peaks around Tanner 3, so age- and puberty-specific cutoffs are essential; in a large Chinese cohort, 95th percentile cutoffs were about 2.6 prepubertal and 3.2 pubertal, while a U.S. guideline cited HOMA-IR > 3.49 for adolescents; moreover, contemporary Korean data show mean HOMA-IR peaks exceeding 5 during puberty, underscoring why adult thresholds cannot be transplanted to youth [^11774sdY] [^11483PJN] [^112134YJ].

> Let me consider pregnancy, and I should confirm that trimester and diagnostic timing matter. In gestational diabetes cohorts, HOMA-IR around 1.29 at diagnosis has signaled predominant insulin resistance, 1.92–2.89 associated with declining beta-cell compensation, and > 2.89 linked to more severe disease where combined insulin and metformin may be appropriate; I need to ensure gestational week and pre-pregnancy BMI are considered when interpreting these values [^116uybJa] [^115rMptz] [^113hynBq].

> But wait, what if I am in a different ethnic group or using a nonstandard assay. Population means vary, with an Iranian healthy cohort averaging HOMA-IR around 2.11, and assays for insulin lack full standardization, leading to up to twofold variation in HOMA estimates across platforms; I should double-check that the lab's insulin assay is appropriate for HOMA and, when possible, compare locally derived percentiles or ROC-derived cutoffs rather than importing external thresholds wholesale [^112wzt1r] [^117Beop1] [^11699Rcy].

> Next, I should review the limitations and avoid overinterpreting a single number. HOMA-IR assumes steady-state fasting physiology and does not capture dynamic insulin clearance or peripheral versus hepatic resistance; in older adults or those with impaired glucose tolerance, HOMA-IR correlates poorly with clamp-measured insulin resistance, and HOMA-β can be driven largely by the glucose term, limiting its interpretability; thus, I need to confirm that results are interpreted alongside BMI, waist, lipids, blood pressure, and glycemic markers, and avoid diagnosing isolated insulin resistance solely on HOMA-IR [^113w1p8f] [^117YMmWf] [^113ZJGRY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical action before context is set. In adults at risk, HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5 supports intensifying lifestyle therapy, and reductions in HOMA-IR accompany improvement in insulin sensitivity with exercise and weight loss; in adolescents with HOMA-IR ≥ 3.16, structured aerobic, HIIT, or concurrent training yields clinically meaningful HOMA-IR reductions; in GDM, higher HOMA-IR may justify earlier pharmacotherapy escalation; in PCOS, values above roughly 2.6–3.2 align with higher metabolic risk and can guide counseling, though fasting insulin alone may miss some hyperinsulinemic phenotypes and an OGTT may be needed when suspicion is high [^113ZJGRY] [^115GbN8R] [^116uybJa] [^115dXKq2] [^115qqeNv].

> I need to ensure preanalytical rigor to avoid misclassification. Samples should be truly fasting for at least 8–12 hours, insulin assays should be chosen for specificity and local comparability, and when values are borderline or decisions are high-stakes, repeating fasting insulin and glucose can reduce variability; also, I should confirm the lab's insulin unit and conversion factor, and consider that serum and heparinized plasma can differ by about 15% in some assays, which can shift HOMA by a similar proportion [^117Beop1] [^11137G2Q] [^11699Rcy].

> Let me reconsider pediatric use, because I almost recommended routine HOMA-IR screening in all children with obesity. The Endocrine Society advises that fasting insulin and HOMA-IR are optional and not necessary to diagnose the need for weight management in youth, and they lack universal pediatric cutoffs; therefore, I should avoid ordering HOMA-IR reflexively in children and instead use it selectively when it will change management or as part of a research protocol, while still acknowledging that higher HOMA-IR tracks with worse metabolic profiles during puberty [^116svJYu] [^11483PJN] [^112134YJ].

> I should double-check alternatives and complementary tests when HOMA-IR is indeterminate or insulin assays are unreliable. The triglyceride–glucose index is a simple, insulin-independent surrogate that correlates with HOMA-IR and cardiovascular risk, QUICKI or 1/HOMA-IR offer log-transformed sensitivity metrics, and in children or selected phenotypes, whole-body indices derived from OGTT may outperform fasting-only surrogates; in older adults or those with IGT, I should be cautious about relying on HOMA-IR and consider dynamic testing when results are discordant with phenotype [^1147SKNp] [^115ti1LQ] [^113xZbHT] [^113w1p8f].

> In summary, I need to ensure the right question is being asked, the right population is being assessed, and the right thresholds are being used before I label someone insulin resistant. HOMA-IR is a useful, widely available marker of hepatic insulin resistance that can detect early metabolic disease, but it is not a standalone diagnostic test; interpretation must be population- and assay-aware, embedded in clinical context, and confirmed with repeat measures or complementary indices when results are borderline or decisions are consequential [^113ZJGRY] [^117YMmWf] [^117Beop1].

---

HOMA-IR is a simple, widely used index of insulin resistance [^113ZJGRY] calculated from fasting glucose and insulin, with **≥ 2.5 indicating insulin resistance** in adults and ≥ 3.0 in adolescents. It is not a lab test itself; you must order fasting glucose and insulin separately, then calculate HOMA-IR using the formula: **(fasting insulin [μU/mL] × fasting glucose [mmol/L]) / 22.5** or **(fasting insulin [μU/mL] × fasting glucose [mg/dL]) / 405**. Interpret values in clinical context, as cutoffs vary by age, sex, and ethnicity [^11774sdY] [^112iWzdV] [^1147SKNp].

---

## Laboratory tests required for HOMA-IR calculation

HOMA-IR requires two fasting tests, **fasting plasma glucose (FPG)** and **fasting serum insulin**; it is not a single assay. Ensure the patient has fasted for at least 8 hours before sampling.

---

## Calculation of HOMA-IR

HOMA-IR is calculated using one of the following formulas:

| **Formula** | **Units** |
|-|-|
| HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin [μU/mL] × fasting glucose [mmol/L]) / 22.5 | Insulin: μU/mL; Glucose: mmol/L |
| HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin [μU/mL] × fasting glucose [mg/dL]) / 405 | Insulin: μU/mL; Glucose: mg/dL |

---

These formulas are mathematically equivalent, differing only in glucose units; use the version that matches your lab's reporting [^117QNGwV].

---

## Interpretation of HOMA-IR values

HOMA-IR interpretation depends on population and clinical context; general adult guidance uses **≥ 2.5 as insulin resistance**, while pediatric and adolescent thresholds are higher [^113ZJGRY] [^112UwMeJ].

| **Population** | **Homa-ir cutoff** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults (general) | ≥ 2.5 | Insulin resistance |
| Adolescents | ≥ 3.0 | Insulin resistance |
| Children (prepubertal) | ≥ 2.6 | Insulin resistance |
| Children (pubertal) | ≥ 3.2 | Insulin resistance |

---

These cutoffs are commonly used in clinical practice and research [^113ZJGRY] [^117YMmWf].

---

## Clinical significance of HOMA-IR

HOMA-IR is a surrogate marker of insulin resistance, correlating with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular risk. Higher values reflect greater insulin resistance and higher cardiometabolic risk [^113ZJGRY] [^1175Jx8x].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: Insulin assays vary; use the same assay and lab for serial measurements [^112mbEQu].
- **Physiological variability**: HOMA-IR reflects hepatic, not peripheral, insulin resistance; consider dynamic tests (e.g. OGTT) when needed [^112naxdW].
- **Population-specific cutoffs**: Interpret using population- and context-specific thresholds [^112By7wv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

HOMA-IR is endorsed as a practical surrogate for insulin resistance in adults and adolescents, especially in obesity and metabolic syndrome. It is not diagnostic for diabetes but helps identify insulin resistance and guide risk stratification and management [^113ZJGRY] [^11483PJN].

---

HOMA-IR is a calculated index from fasting glucose and insulin, with **≥ 2.5 indicating insulin resistance** in adults. It is a useful clinical tool for assessing insulin resistance and guiding management, but results should be interpreted in context and with awareness of assay and population variability.

Value of HOMA-IR as an early marker of poorer metabolic health

Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are advanced stages of the dysglycemia-based chronic disease continuum associated with an increased risk of CVD. Yet both the development of SA and frequently the first clinical events, occur earlier and at HbA1c levels below the diagnostic thresholds. The question thus remains of whether we are properly addressing primary prevention of CVD by only screening for and treating diabetes and hyperlipidemia while ignoring the early onset of insulin resistance.

The HOMA-IR ratio captures early abnormalities in systemic glucose homeostasis by testing how much insulin is needed to keep fasting glycemia low. For instance, a fasting plasma insulin of 5 mU/L is needed for a healthy individual to maintain fasting plasma glucose at 81 mg/dL, and this results in HOMA-IR = 1 when using the original formula: HOMA- IR = fasting insulin (mU/L) x fasting plasma (mg/dL) / 405. In this highly regulated mechanism, insulin resistance occurs when a higher than normal insulin concentration is required to obtain a quantitatively normal response in target tissues, and, among other parameters, HOMA-IR values start to increase. During this initial compensatory phase of early insulin resistance, higher HOMA-IR values, among other insulin resistance surrogates such as the triglyceride-glucose index, are associated with markers of ectopic fat accumulation and metabolic syndrome, including elevated circulating triglycerides, adipose tissue dysfunction, increased secretion of free fatty acids (FFAs) and pro-inflammatory adipokines, and elevated liver production of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles in the presence of visceral fat and hepatic fat. Additionally, HOMA-IR levels are elevated in patients with heart failure, a condition often accompanied by comorbidities such as obesity and hypertension, and have been identified as predictor of adverse clinical events in non-diabetic individuals experiencing decompensated heart failure. In this regard, it is not surprising that in our study, higher HOMA-IR values were associated with a cluster of unfavorable anthropometric, metabolic, and inflammatory markers (p < 0.001, Table 1) in individuals with low-to-moderate and high CVD risk (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^112By7wv]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance (IR) is a feature of disorders such as diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and is also implicated in obesity, hypertension, cancer or autoimmune diseases. Insulin resistance (IR) has been proposed, more than a primary cause, as a sort of final common pathway for negative environmental factors, which interact with the individual genetic background to cause metabolic and hemodynamic alterations and is associated with inflammation.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) definition is widely used as a practical tool to describe a cluster of clinical signs (central obesity, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose metabolism, and elevated blood pressure) that regardless of cause, identifies individuals at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), and DM2. The worldwide prevalence of these factors has risen dramatically in recent decades.

The Homeostasis Model Assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) has proved to be a robust tool for the surrogate assessment of IR. However, there is great variability in the threshold HOMA-IR levels to define IR. Population based studies for defining cut-off values of HOMA-IR for the diagnosis of IR had been conducted in different geographic areas. Table 1 shows the cut-off values, as can be seen in most of cases the cutoff point's determination were made on the percentile criterion (80 or 90 according to studies) of values in the general population. However, no studies have examined the ability of proposed cutoff points to identify risk of clinically relevant outcomes. In addition, in these studies the results have been reported without taking into account the possible effects of covariates on test results. However, it is well known that a biomarker's performance and, by extension, its discriminatory capacity can be affected by covariates.

The clinical calculator "Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)" for polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) estimates insulin resistance based on fasting plasma glucose and fasting plasma insulin levels. It is widely used to assess metabolic health, particularly in studies of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) offers insights into an individual's insulin sensitivity using two key measurements: fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. These inputs are required to evaluate insulin resistance and can be provided in different units.

For fasting glucose, you can use:

- mg/dL, with a range from 50 to 400
- mmol/L, with a range from 2.78 to 22.2

For fasting insulin, the options are:

- uIU/mL, with a range from 1 to 100
- pmol/L, with a range from 6 to 600

If the measurements are given in mmol/L or pmol/L, conversions will be necessary. Convert fasting glucose from mmol/L to mg/dL by multiplying by 18.0182. For insulin, convert from pmol/L to uIU/mL by dividing by 6.

After standardizing the units, the HOMA-IR score is calculated using the formula:

HOMA-IR Score = (fasting insulin in uIU/mL * fasting glucose in mg/dL) / 405

The result, rounded to two decimal places, determines the level of insulin resistance:

- Scores less than 1 indicate normal insulin sensitivity.
- Scores from 1 to just under 2 suggest mild insulin resistance.
- Scores from 2 to just under 3 imply moderate insulin resistance.
- Scores of 3 or more reflect severe insulin resistance.

These interpretations help contextualize how the body's insulin management might be impacting health, signaling the potential risk for conditions associated with insulin resistance.

### HOMA-IR mean values in healthy individuals: a population-based study in Iranian subjects [^112wzt1r]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Homeostasis Model Assessment-estimated Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) is an important indicator of insulin resistance. In this population-based investigation, we sought to report the mean value of HOMA-IR in different subgroups of a large population-based database of Iranian healthy subjects.

Methods

This study recruited adult healthy individuals between the ages of 18 to 70 years old to Massoud Medical Laboratory, Tehran, Iran. Fasting insulin was measured by using the Electro Chemiluminescence method using Roche Cobas 6000 e601/602 instrument.

Results

The mean ± SD value of the HOMA-IR index in the studied population was 2.11 ± 0.99 (2.5–97.5% percentiles: 0.66–4.50). In addition, the mean ± SD of HOMA-IR index in male and female groups were 2.351.0 (2.5–97.5 percentile: 0.57–4.37) and 2.05 ± 1.0 (2.5–97.5 percentiles: 0.53–4.35), respectively. Interestingly, it was observed a significant increment for the HOMA-IR index in the male group compared with the female group in all age subgroups (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Our findings showed the mean value of 2.11 ± 0.99 HOMA-IR in the Iranian healthy population. Considering the large sample size in our study, more clinical investigations in terms of ethnicity should be done to provide a precise standardized HOMA-IR index in the Iranian population.

### Are HOMA-IR and HOMA-B good predictors for diabetes and pre-diabetes subtypes? [^116MTAQ7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Definitions

Diabetic patients included those with FBS ≥ 126 mg/dl or BS2hpp ≥ 200 mg/dl at the beginning or during the study or those who received antidiabetic therapy. Subjects with BS2hpp < 140 mg/dl and FBS < 100 mg/dl were considered as free of diabetes, isolated impaired fasting glucose (iIFG) was considered in cases with FBS between 100 and 125 mg/dl and BS2hpp < 140 mg/dl, isolated impaired glucose tolerance (iIGT) included FBS < 100 mg/dl and BS2hpp between 140 and 199 mg/dl, combined impaired fasting glucose & impaired glucose tolerance (CGI) was defined as FBS between 100 and 125 mg/dl and BS2hpp between 140 and 199 mg/dl. Pre-defined cut-offs from the previous statement from the Iranian National Committee of Obesity report were used to define binary metabolic syndrome variables. HOMA-IR was calculated using the formula FBS(mmol/L)*FI(Mu/ml)/22.5, and HOMA-B was calculated using the formula 20*FI(Mu/ml)/[FBS(mmol/L)-3.5].

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^116carkH]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Fasting plasma glucose was 5.2 ± 0.5 mmol/l, and median serum insulin (measured by 11 insulin assays) was 59 (IQR 38–78) pmol/l in normoglycemic subjects, 6.2 ± 0.4 mmol/l and 117 (54–142) pmol/l for subjects with pre-diabetes, and 8.4 ± 2.2 mmol/l and 86 (46–142) pmol/l for type 2 diabetic subjects. A P value of 0.07 was obtained from a Kruskal-Wallis test for insulin across the groups. HOMA-β was highest in those with pre-diabetes at 109% (71–149), lower in those with normoglycemia at 85% (64–128), and lowest in those with type 2 diabetes at 63% (38–88) (P = 0.0002). HOMA-IR was 1.30 (0.84–1.65) in normoglycemic subjects, highest in subjects with pre-diabetes at 2.58 (1.24–3.12), and slightly lower in diabetic subjects at 2.13 (1.19–3.54) (P = 0.022). Values for HOMA-S were 82% (67–137) for normoglycemic subjects, 40% (33–84) in those with pre-diabetes, and 50% (29–93) in those with diabetes (P = 0.025).

Percentage of patients with data outside input limits for HOMA calculators

All glucose values obtained were appropriate for the HOMA calculator version 2.2. However, 4.3% of insulin results (55 in total) were < 20 pmol/l, and 1% (12 in total) were > 300 pmol/l and, therefore, were not accepted. The actual numbers of insulin values outside limits for each assay can be seen in supplemental Table 2 (available in the online appendix). HOMA estimates are presented in Fig. 1; both inclusion of participants with insulin values set to HOMA limits if outside these limits and exclusion if outside limits are shown.

Choice of HOMA calculator

For illustrative purposes only, the RIA calculator rather than SI calculator was used with assays specific for insulin; estimates of HOMA-β differed by 11% (P < 0.0001) and of HOMA-IR by 15% (P < 0.0001).

### Insulin sensitivity in prepubertal caucasian normal weight children [^117LyyuX]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Determining whether or not a child is insulin resistant is becoming a matter of fundamental interest even in childhood, as the incidence of metabolic complications of insulin resistance is rising. Thus reference values are needed.

Aim

To set percentiles for HOMA-IR and WBISI in Caucasian normal weight prepubertal children.

Population

238 normal weight prepubertal Caucasian children (126 males/112 females).

Methods

After physical examination including anthropometric measurements all children underwent an oral glucose tolerance test from which HOMA-IR and WBISI were calculated.

Results

HOMA-IR values above the 95th percentile (2.03) and WBISI values below the 5th percentile (5.67) represent the cut-off values for the determination of insulin resistance.

Conclusion

These reference values are useful to easily detect insulin resistance within the prepubertal Caucasian population representing a helpful tool for clinicians to target such children in order to improve insulin sensitivity.

### Percentiles of fasting serum insulin, glucose, HbA1c and HOMA-IR in pre-pubertal normal weight European children from the IDEFICS cohort [^114QMKfg]. International Journal of Obesity (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study is to present age- and sex-specific reference values of insulin, glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the homeostasis model assessment to quantify insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) for pre-pubertal children.

Methods

The reference population consists of 7074 normal weight 3- to 10.9-year-old pre-pubertal children from eight European countries who participated in at least one wave of the IDEFICS ('identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants') surveys (2007–2010) and for whom standardised laboratory measurements were obtained. Percentile curves of insulin (measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay), glucose, HbA1c and HOMA-IR were calculated as a function of age stratified by sex using the general additive model for location scale and shape (GAMLSS) method.

Results

Levels of insulin, fasting glucose and HOMA-IR continuously show an increasing trend with age, whereas HbA1c shows an upward trend only beyond the age of 8 years. Insulin and HOMA-IR values are higher in girls of all age groups, whereas glucose values are slightly higher in boys. Median serum levels of insulin range from 17.4 and 13.2pmoll(-1) in 3- < 3.5-year-old girls and boys, respectively, to 53.5 and 43.0pmoll(-1) in 10.5- < 11-year-old girls and boys. Median values of glucose are 4.3 and 4.5mmoll(-1) in the youngest age group and 49.3 and 50.6mmoll(-1) in the oldest girls and boys. For HOMA-IR, median values range from 0.5 and 0.4 in 3- < 3.5-year-old girls and boys to 1.7 and 1.4 in 10.5- < 11-year-old girls and boys, respectively.

Conclusions

Our study provides the first standardised reference values for an international European children's population and provides the, up to now, largest data set of healthy pre-pubertal children to model reference percentiles for markers of insulin resistance. Our cohort shows higher values of Hb1Ac as compared with a single Swedish study while our percentiles for the other glucose metabolic markers are in good accordance with previous studies.

### Glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance: prevalence, gender differences and predictors in adolescents [^115g9kva]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

HOMA-IR thresholds associated with cardiometabolic risks

In both genders, HOMA-IR gradually increased with increasing number of parameters derived from metabolic syndrome definition. HOMA-IR of 3.6 for girls and of 4.4 for boys were identified as cut-off values that corresponded to increased cardiometabolic risks defined as a presence of three components of metabolic syndrome (Table 2). These HOMA-IR values represent the 84.0 and 87.0 percentile in girls and boys of general population, respectively.

### Insulin resistance in euglycemic cirrhosis [^112rkR4Q]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

IR measurement

IR was assessed by the Homeostasis Model Assessment method for the evaluation of IR (HOMA-IR). HOMA was first developed in 1985 by Matthews et al. It is a method used to quantify IR and β-cell function from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin concentrations. HOMA is a model of the relationship of glucose and insulin dynamics that predicts fasting steady-state glucose and insulin concentrations for a wide range of possible combinations of IR and β-cell function. HOMA-IR = (glucose × insulin)/22.5; insulin concentration is reported in μU/L and glucose in mmol/L. The constant of 22.5 is a normalizing factor; i.e., the product of normal fasting plasma insulin of 5 μU/mL, and the normal fasting plasma glucose of 4.5 mmol/L typical of a "normal" healthy individual = 22.5. Value of HOMA-IR more than 1.64 implied the presence of abnormally high IR. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), as an alternative surrogate marker of IR, computed as 1/ [log insulin (μU/mL) + log fasting blood sugar (FBS) (mg/dL)]. Value < 0.35 is suggestive for IR. QUICKI is an empirically-derived mathematical transformation of FBS and plasma insulin concentrations that provides a consistent and precise index of insulin sensitivity with better positive predictive power. HOMA-β a parameter reflecting the insulin secretion ability of pancreatic β-cells, was calculated as [360 × insulin (μU/mL)]/FBS (mg/dL) -63]. Estimation with the help of HOMA-β model parallels equally with that of the euglycemic clamp method (r = 0.88).

Statistical analysis

HOMA calculator 2.2 was used to calculate the HOMA IR and HOMA-β values while QUICKI values were calculated with a scientific calculator. Parametric data are expressed as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) and categorical variables as percentages. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used for the comparison of dichotomous variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. Whenever more than 2 continuous variables were present, ANOVA one-way analysis was used for calculating the P values. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Spearman and Pearson's coefficient correlation were used to compare the regression coefficient between the two groups. All data were analyzed using the SAS 8.0 statistical package.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^112UwMeJ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile for healthy reference population

The mean, standard deviation and HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile for a healthy reference population according to gender, age and pubertal status are given in Table 3. HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile for the total of healthy reference population (normal-metabolic subjects) is 3.0. We find no significant gender difference in HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile. In prepubertal stage, HOMA-IR cut-off value from 95th percentile is 2.6 and so are 3.2 in the pubertal period. Insulin sensitivity reduces in Tanner stage V and almost completely recovered by pubertal completion. The similar result is found in different age ranges. When age is below 10, most of children are in prepubertal stage, the HOMA-IR cut-off value from 95th percentile is 2.1. However, the HOMA-IR threshold above 95th percentile is rapidly increased to 3.2 when age is up 10 years and most children go into puberty.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^116esCCZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance has been associated with metabolic and hemodynamic alterations and higher cardio metabolic risk. There is great variability in the threshold homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels to define insulin resistance. The purpose of this study was to describe the influence of age and gender in the estimation of HOMA-IR optimal cut-off values to identify subjects with higher cardio metabolic risk in a general adult population.

Methods

It included 2459 adults (range 20–92 years, 58.4% women) in a random Spanish population sample. As an accurate indicator of cardio metabolic risk, Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), both by International Diabetes Federation criteria and by Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, were used. The effect of age was analyzed in individuals with and without diabetes mellitus separately. ROC regression methodology was used to evaluate the effect of age on HOMA-IR performance in classifying cardio metabolic risk.

Results

In Spanish population the threshold value of HOMA-IR drops from 3.46 using 90th percentile criteria to 2.05 taking into account of MetS components. In non-diabetic women, but no in men, we found a significant non-linear effect of age on the accuracy of HOMA-IR. In non-diabetic men, the cut-off values were 1.85. All values are between 70th-75th percentiles of HOMA-IR levels in adult Spanish population.

Conclusions

The consideration of the cardio metabolic risk to establish the cut-off points of HOMA-IR, to define insulin resistance instead of using a percentile of the population distribution, would increase its clinical utility in identifying those patients in whom the presence of multiple metabolic risk factors imparts an increased metabolic and cardiovascular risk. The threshold levels must be modified by age in non-diabetic women.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^11483PJN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — insulin resistance (IR) assessment states that fasting insulin is an optional test to quantify IR by calculation of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or by noting fasting insulin is more than 2 sd above the mean for the laboratory doing the test. HOMA-IR is defined as HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin in μU/ml × fasting glucose in mmol/liter) divided by 22.5, and in nondiabetic children HOMA correlates as high as 0.91 with clamp measures. Based on a study of 1,802 adolescents aged 12–19 yr from the 1999–2002 NHANES, a HOMA-IR > 3.49 was recommended as evidence of IR; using that criterion, roughly 46–52% at a BMI in at least the 95th percentile, roughly 11–16% at least the 85th but below the 95th percentile, and 4% below the 85th percentile were insulin resistant. In Mexican children aged 10–14 yr, similar results were reported with 3, 12, and 47% insulin resistant at BMIs below the 85th percentile, at least the 85th but below the 95th percentile, and at least the 95th percentile, respectively. The use of any index of IR is complicated by concerns about the lack of standardized measures for the quantification of insulin and the need to be assured that the blood sample is obtained in a truly fasting state.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^112iWzdV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The AUC in non-diabetic women presents a plateau, with values greater than 0.7, until patients are in their fifties. Recent studies reported marked gender differences with regard to degrees of IR and body composition. The age effect found in non-diabetic women in our study may reflect the effect of menopausal changes (decreased estrogens levels and increased visceral adipose tissue, VAT) on HOMA-IR performance, with a higher utility to identify cardio metabolic risk below age 50.

Insulin resistance increases atherogenesis and atherosclerotic plaque instability by inducing proinflammatory activities on vascular and immune cells. HOMA-IR is a robust surrogate method to estimate IR in epidemiologic or clinical setting. However, there is great variability in their threshold levels; as can be seen in Table 1, usually the cut-off values of HOMA-IR were defined by population-based percentiles criteria. Furthermore, these cut-off values are different according to ethnicity, clinical methods of estimation, and metabolic conditions of populations studied. To increase the clinical utility of HOMA-IR values, we study its ability to classify those individuals with multiple metabolic risk factors. In Spanish population the threshold value of HOMA-IR drops from 3.46 using 90th percentile criteria to 2.05 take into account MetS components.

Our HOMA-IR cut-off levels are relatively low compared to those reported in a study of healthy Italian patients with a value of 2.77, and in a Spanish non-diabetic population, with a value of 3.8. Both studies used the 80th or 90th percentile as cut-off selection criteria. On the other hand, our values are slightly higher than those reported in an Iranian population-based study with 1.77, using YI as cut-off selection criteria, but in this case the value was estimated pooled in men and women.

The prevalence of MetS (15% for IDF and 12.7% for MetS ATPIII) was quite similar to that found in northwest Spain (18.3% for MetS IDF and 15.0% for MetS ATPIII) and in other European population-based studies. On the other hand, it is significantly lower compared with the NHANES study, 23.7%, and SuRFNCD-2007 study, 33.6%, probably because of the higher prevalence of obesity and other metabolic alterations in US and eastern Asia compared to the Spanish population.

### Trends in HOMA-IR values among South Korean adolescents from 2007–2010 to 2019–2020: a sex-, age-, and weight status-specific analysis [^112134YJ]. International Journal of Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

An increase in obesity prevalence may lead to an increase in the HOMA-IR value. This study aimed to investigate changes in age- and sex-specific homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values among South Korean adolescents, using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) IV, V, and VIII conducted between 2007–2010 and 2019–2020.

Subjects/Methods

Overall, 4621 adolescents aged 10–18 years were evaluated, including 3473 from the 2007–2010 dataset and 1148 from the 2019–2020 dataset. The mean HOMA-IR values and percentile curves were evaluated by age, sex, and weight status.

Results

The mean HOMA-IR values peaked at puberty in both sexes and further increased during puberty in the 2019–2020 dataset (boys 5.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.16–6.26; girls 5.21, 95% CI 3.09–7.33) compared with the 2007–2010 dataset (boys 3.25, 95% CI 3.04–3.47; girls 3.58, 95% CI 3.31–3.85). Both groups (with normal-weight and overweight/obesity) exhibited a peak HOMA-IR value during puberty in both sexes and both datasets, although the group with overweight/obesity had a higher and wider peak age range. While the mean HOMA-IR values did not change in adolescents with normal-weight, they increased during puberty and post-puberty in boys with overweight/obesity.

Conclusions

HOMA-IR values should be interpreted considering sex, weight status, and pubertal stages. In particular, during the pubertal period, insulin resistance (IR) can coexist not only due to weight-related factors but also as a result of the distinct hormonal changes characteristic of puberty. Over the 10-year period, the mean HOMA-IR values increased in the group with overweight/obesity during puberty and post-puberty, highlighting the need for active intervention to prevent metabolic complications in adolescents with overweight/obesity.

### Prevalence of insulin resistance in Korean women with polycystic ovary syndrome according to various homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance cutoff values [^115dXKq2]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the various homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cutoff values in a large population of healthy controls and to evaluate the prevalence of IR in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Case control study.

Setting

Reproductive endocrinology center.

Patient(S)

Women with (n = 699) and without PCOS (n = 572).

Intervention(S)

Blood tests.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The upper 75th and 95th percentiles of HOMA-IR in lean controls (n = 522) and the HOMA-IR cutoff that indicates metabolic risk in all participants.

Result(S)

HOMA-IR cutoffs of 1.82 and 3.16 were defined as above the 75th and 95th percentiles in lean controls, and the prevalence of IR in patients with PCOS was 60.7% and 24.5%, respectively. The optimal HOMA-IR for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was 2.64; thus, metabolic risk was increased at a lower level of HOMA-IR compared with the 95th percentile cutoff. At HOMA-IR cutoff of 2.64, 34.8% of patients with PCOS had evidence of IR. Metabolic features significantly differed between patients with PCOS with and without IR, and patients with PCOS without IR showed similar or more favorable metabolic features compared with controls. Overweight/obese patients are the most high-risk group, but lean patients also showed a similarly elevated prevalence of IR as overweight/obese controls. A positive correlation was observed between BMI and HOMA-IR in both patients and controls, but the magnitude was significantly greater in patients than in controls.

Conclusion(S)

Although IR is common in women with PCOS, it does not seem to be universal, and patients without IR had reassuring metabolic features.

### Trends in HOMA-IR values among South Korean adolescents from 2007–2010 to 2019–2020: a sex-, age-, and weight status-specific analysis [^112uTaJr]. International Journal of Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

The HOMA-IR value of adolescents has several characteristics. First, HOMA-IR varies according to age, especially during puberty, as IR develops during this stage. In puberty, IR is associated with changes in sex steroid levels and GH/IGF-1 as well as increases in adiposity, with insulin sensitivity decreased by approximately 25–30%. Moran et al. also reported that peak IR was related to the pubertal growth spurt in each sex. Second, the HOMA-IR values in girls reach their peak earlier than those in boys. Third, the HOMA-IR value in girls is higher than that in boys. These observed differences in HOMA-IR values between sexes can be attributed to the earlier onset of puberty in girls, as well as a higher degree of IR exhibited in girls than in boys. In accordance with previous studies, this study demonstrated that the HOMA-IR values reach their peak during puberty and then decline toward adulthood. Furthermore, it was observed that HOMA-IR values peak at an earlier age and are higher in girls than in boys, despite slightly elevated blood glucose levels in boys as compared with girls. Notably, these characteristics of the HOMA-IR values in adolescents were found to be consistent across both the 2007–2010 and 2019–2020 datasets. These findings indicated that the normative HOMA-IR values in adolescents should consider not only sex but also their pubertal stage. To analyze the HOMA-IR values stratified by sex and pubertal status, the current study presents the HOMA-IR values for three distinct age groups in both sexes as follows: 10–12 years (from thelarche to menarche), 13–15 years (from menarche to Tanner stage 5), and 16–18 years (post-pubertal age) for girls and 10–11 years (pre-gonadarche), 12–14 years (from gonadarche to Tanner stage 5), and 15–18 years (post-pubertal age) for boys. The data derived from this current study is expected to provide insights into the occurrence of IR in adolescents, as influence by pubertal hormonal characteristics and overweight/obesity. Furthermore, it is expected to contribute to the appropriate interpretation of HOMA-IR values based on specific categories.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^115qGNL1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

The fasting insulin is an optional test to quantify IR by calculation of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or by noting that the fasting insulin is more than 2above the mean for the laboratory doing the test. There is growing evidence for the association of IR with the development of T2DM in children. Most of these children and adolescents are obese. Identification of children with IR has been proposed as a strategy for identifying high-risk children for targeted diabetes prevention. The gold standard for measuring IR, the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, is labor intensive and expensive and, therefore, not recommended for clinical use. A surrogate marker of IR is the HOMA-IR index, based on the measurement of fasting insulin and glucose with higher levels representing greater degrees of IR [HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin in μU/ml × fasting glucose in mmol /liter) divided by 22.5]. In nondiabetic children, HOMA-IR correlates as high as 0.91 with clamp measures. Based on a study of 1,802 adolescents aged 12–19 yr from the 1999–2002 NHANES, a HOMA-IR > 4.39 was recommended as evidence for IR. On the basis of that criterion, roughly 46–52% of the adolescents with a BMI in at least the 95th percentile were insulin resistant; roughly 11–16% of those with a BMI in at least the 85th percentile but below the 95th percentile were insulin resistant; and only 4% of those with a BMI below the 85th percentile were insulin resistant. In a study of Mexican children aged 10–14 yr, very similar results were obtained, with 3, 12, and 47% of the children insulin resistant at BMIs below the 85th percentile, at least the 85th but below the 95th percentile, and at least the 95th percentile, respectively. In a study of Australian children aged 6–13 yr, increasing BMI z-score was continuously associated with complications of overweight in children. Even in the healthy weight range, there was a continuous linear or curvilinear association between increasing BMI z-score and comorbid risk factors. But there was a subset of children in whom there was no evidence of hyperinsulinism, even at BMI z-scores of +1 to +3. Conversely, some children had evidence for hyperinsulinism although their BMI z-scores ranged from −2 to 0.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^11774sdY]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study is to assess the association between the degree of insulin resistance and the different components of the metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and adolescents. Moreover, to determine the cut-off values for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at MS risk.

Methods

3203 Chinese children aged 6 to 18 years were recruited. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured. Metabolic syndrome (MS) was identified by a modified Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) definition. HOMA-IR index was calculated and the normal reference ranges were defined from the healthy participants. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to find the optimal cutoff of HOMA-IR for diagnosis of MS.

Results

With the increase of insulin resistance (quintile of HOMA-IR value), the ORs of suffering MS or its related components were significantly increased. Participants in the highest quintile of HOMA-IR were about 60 times more likely to be classified with metabolic syndrome than those in the lowest quintile group. Similarly, the mean values of insulin and HOMA-IR increased with the number of MS components. The present HOMA-IR cutoff point corresponding to the 95th percentile of our healthy reference children was 3.0 for whole participants, 2.6 for children in prepubertal stage and 3.2 in pubertal period, respectively. The optimal point for diagnosis of MS was 2.3 in total participants, 1.7 in prepubertal children and 2.6 in pubertal adolescents, respectively, by ROC curve, which yielded high sensitivity and moderate specificity for a screening test. According to HOMA-IR > 3.0, the prevalence of insulin resistance in obese or MS children were 44.3% and 61.6% respectively.

Conclusions

Our data indicates insulin resistance is common among Chinese obese children and adolescents, and is strongly related to MS risk, therefore requiring consideration early in life. As a reliable measure of insulin resistance and assessment of MS risk, the optimal HOMA-IR cut-off points in this cohort were developed with variation regarding puberty. HOMA-IR may be useful for early evaluating insulin resistance in children and teenagers and could have a long-term benefit of preventive and diagnostic therapeutic intervention.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^112JhNnW]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using SAS with SI and RIA calculators (version 2.2, 30 June 2004;) for HOMA estimates. HOMA version 2 was recalibrated to give HOMA-β and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) of 100% in normal young adults when assays available then were used for insulin, specific insulin, or C-peptide. In this study, the SI calculator was used for 10 assays quoted as specific for insulin and the RIA calculator was used for one assay stated to cross-react with proinsulin. As HOMA is based on steady-state physiology, the model includes limits for glucose. Values outside these limits, 3–25 mmol/l for both calculators (30 June 2004;), are considered non–steady state and HOMA is considered to be inappropriate. Input limits for insulin for the SI calculator are 20–300 pmol/l and for RIA calculator are 20–400 pmol/l. For Table 2, insulin values outside these ranges were set to the values of the appropriate limit. Corresponding results for HOMA estimates when these results are excluded are found in supplemental Table 1 (available in an online appendix at). Median score tests, i.e. median one-way nonparametric ANOVA, were used in Table 2 to test the significance of differences in a HOMA estimate derived from different insulin assays in serum for a particular glycemic state.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^116gSmpw]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Although HOMA-IR is wildly used in population-based studies, many factors involved in the inconsistencies of HOMA-IR should be stressed. Firstly, it is expected to be different in prepubertal and pubertal children as we show in this study. A transient insulin resistance develops in children during puberty. This insulin resistance emerging during pubertal maturation is accepted as a physiological condition rather than pathologic. Some cross-sectional studies have shown that insulin resistance increases with the onset of puberty, makes a peak at Tanner stage 3 and recedes to prepubertal levels at the end of puberty. Longitudinal studies have found a 30% decrease in insulin sensitivity between Tanner stages I and V. However, this decrease was found to return to normal at the end of puberty. In our study, while no difference for gender was detected in HOMA-IR cut-off values, it was higher in the pubertal period than that in the prepubertal period. A similar result was found in the different age phases; the HOMA-IR threshold is rapidly increased when children reach the age of 10 years, when most commence puberty. Therefore, it is important that, in the evaluation of insulin resistance in children and adolescents, different threshold values should be used according to puberty stage or age. Secondly, Different cut-off points might be selected to optimize sensitivity versus specificity depending on the study purpose. We defined a HOMA cutoff point for diagnosis of MS of 1.7 in prepubertal stage yielding a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 67% in the ROC curve. In pubertal population, the HOMA cutoff point of 2.6 produced a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 67%. A screening test requires high sensitivity and moderate specificity, whereas a diagnostic test requires a much higher specificity. In our study, the 95th percentile of HOMA-IR for normalsubjects in prepubertal stage was 2.6 and the sensitivity and the specificity of this point in the ROC analysis are were 54% and 85% respectively. The 95th percentile of HOMA-IR for pubertal adolescents of 3.2 leaded to a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 80%. Due to the fact that our sample size was large, we are able to propose precise cut-off limits based on the results of this study. This may be useful for different purposes, such as early intervention or early diagnose of insulin resistance in clinic. Thirdly, HOMA-IR is a function of both insulin and glucose, and glucose is included in the unified criteria of MS. However, insulin assays have not yet to be standardized and assessment methods differ between laboratories. This makes comparison with different studies difficult.

### Insulin resistance in adolescents [^116o4PW3]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the relationship of other body mass index (BMI) ranges with Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), a surrogate marker for insulin resistance in adolescents.

Study Design

Cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample of 1837 nondiabetic, nonpregnant 12 to 19 year old persons from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2002. The main outcome measurement of insulin resistance was calculated as HOMA-IR > 3.16.

Results

Having a BMI ≥ 75th percentile is associated with a high HOMA-IR levels. As the BMI percentile increases, the odds of high HOMA-IR levels increase (BMI percentile 75–84.9, OR 4.277, 95% CI 2.090–8.752; BMI percentile 85–94.9, OR 4.299, 95% CI 2.158–8.563; BMI ≥ 95th percentile, OR 17.907, 95% CI 11.360–28.228).

Conclusion

Adolescents with BMI percentile of 75 to 84.9, which represents approximately 1.2 million US adolescents, have not previously been identified as having higher HOMA-IR levels.

### Prognostic performance of metabolic indexes in predicting onset of type 1 diabetes [^114o6gj2]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The optimal cutoff value of 114 mg/dl for OGTT 2-h glucose was notably less than the value currently used to define the lower range of impaired glucose tolerance (140 mg/dl). The hazard ratio for those with 2-h glucose equal to or in excess of the optimal cutoff value (114) compared with those less than the optimal cutoff was 2.96 (95% CI 1.67–5.22) after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI. The 5-year risk for those with baseline values equal to or in excess of the optimal 2-h glucose cutoff level was 46% compared with 17% for those with baseline values less than the optimal cutoff. The hazard ratio for those under the optimal cutoff level of the FPIR-to–HOMA-IR ratio (< 49.22) compared with those equal to or in excess of the optimal cutoff level of the FPIR-to–HOMA-IR ratio (≥ 49.22) was 2.94 (1.62–5.35) after adjustment for age, sex, and BMI. The 5-year risk for those with baseline values equal to or in excess of the optimal FPIR-to–HOMA-IR ratio cutoff level was 41 with to 17% for those with baseline values less than the optimal cutoff. Kaplan-Meier curves (supplementary Figs. A1 and A2, available in an online appendix at) illustrate the risk of diabetes over the study period by the level of OGTT 2-h glucose (P < 0.001) and the level of IVGTT FPIR-to–HOMA-IR ratio (P < 0.001).

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^116uybJa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that the degree of insulin resistance at the diagnosis of GDM is a marker of GDM severity and pathophysiological heterogeneity.

HOMA-IR values of ≥ 1.29 at diagnosis may indicate insulin resistance to be the key pathophysiologic mechanism in GDM in the studied population of women. These HOMA-IR values justify aggressive treatment of insulin resistance as a method adequate to the pathophysiologic background of GDM in this population of Caucasian women. Decreased beta-cell function in HOMA-IR values between 1.92–2.89 is associated with decreased insulin secretion. Introduction of insulin treatment in combination with dietary control seems to be more appropriate in treating this subpopulation of women than the administration of oral drugs. HOMA-IR value of > 2.89 suggests an inefficient compensation, thus indicating the need for metformin treatment combined with insulin therapy.

Further studies are needed to resolve the problem of optimal treatment strategies, which still remain controversial in this specific, high risk group of women.

### Challenges in the diagnosis of insulin resistance: focusing on the role of HOMA-IR and tryglyceride / glucose index [^1147SKNp]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Metabolic Syndrome (MS) prevalence is increasing worldwide in line with the growing prevalence of obesity. The underlying mechanism of MS is insulin resistance which can be diagnosed by measuring Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and Triglyceride/Glucose (TyG) Index. This review will focus on comparing studies assessing the HOMA-IR and TyG index cut-off points.

Methods

We carried out a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, Scopus, Research Gate, and Google Scholar in the month of October 2020.

Results

There is a high degree of variability in determining threshold levels of HOMA-IR for defining insulin resistance. The distribution of the HOMA-IR varies according to the demographic characteristics of the subjects, such as age, sex, and race, making it difficult to estimate the optimal cut-off point. Another simpler method without requiring the use of insulin assays is TyG Index. Similar to HOMA-IR, the TyG Index cut-off point from existing data shows varying results.

Conclusion

The HOMA-IR and the TyG index are simple and widely used methods for determining insulin resistance. However, an issue that arises is determining the insulin resistance cut-off point for both methods. Further studies are needed to assess the cut-off point of insulin resistance for various ethnicities associated with the risk of developing MS later in life.

### Insulin sensitivity variations in apparently healthy arab male subjects: correlation with insulin and C peptide [^1147P1R3]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

The glucose disposal rate, as reflected by the M value, was negatively correlated with both fasting insulin level and AUC of the insulin response to OGTT. This illustrates that maintenance of normoglycemia in subjects with low insulin sensitivity requires high insulin secretion. However, the measured insulin level in the peripheral blood reflects both insulin secretion and insulin clearance. Interindividual variations in hepatic clearance of insulin play an important role in determining the level of peripheral insulin.

The difference in HOMA2-IR levels among the three groups was at the limit of significance (p = 0.056). HOMA-IR is a good indicator of insulin resistance in a large cohort that includes a range of euglycemia, pre-diabetes and diabetes. However, in our cohort, all subjects were selected to be normoglycemic by all three criteria: normal fasting blood glucose, normal 2-hour plasma glucose after 75 g glucose challenge and normal HbA1c; in addition, all had BMI below 28. It is therefore plausible that HOMA-IR variations may not be sensitive to reflect different levels of insulin sensitivity in such a homogenous cohort.

Potential of HOMA-IR as a marker of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD

In clinical practice, HOMA-IR is often used as an indicator of metabolic syndrome, a condition characterized by a clustering of risk factors indicative of poor metabolic health but for which clinical utility beyond its individual components is still disputed. In our study population, the HOMA-IR category (< 2, 2 to 3, and ≥ 3) showed a direct correlation with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (3.0%, 27.1%, and 49.3%) (Table 1) and hepatic steatosis (0.8%, 21.9%, and 59.3%) (p < 0.001, Supplementary Tables 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). An exploratory analysis showed that individuals meeting NAFLD diagnostic criteria had increased odds of multiterritorial SA (OR = 1.45 (95%CI: 1.05 to 2.00), p = 0.023) and CACS (OR = 2.32 (95%CI: 1.59 to 3.40), p < 0.001) independently of all other CVRFs evaluated, including HOMA-IR. Although all these parameters are highly related and share common pathophysiological pathways, in clinical practice, HOMA-IR offers the potential to detect and monitor a common root cause of both conditions - insulin resistance and insulin hypersecretion - with a convenient measure obtained from a blood test. HOMA-IR could be particularly useful for the early detection of NAFLD, a condition whose prevalence is projected to increase in the coming decades, often goes undetected until its later stages, and for which there is currently no approved effective treatment.

The gold standard for evaluating insulin resistance, namely the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique, is impractical for regular large-scale clinical practice. Hence, surrogate markers for insulin resistance have been proposed, the best known of which is the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), calculated using the formula: [fasting plasma insulin (mU/L) × plasma fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/22.5. A value of 2.5 or higher is considered to indicate insulin resistance. Additional surrogate markers include the triglyceride-glucose indexand triglyceride to HDL-cholesterol ratio, both of which are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease independent of LDL-cholesterol.

Pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes can be diagnosed by measuring (i) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), (ii) fasting plasma glucose, or (iii) plasma glucose 2 h after an OGTT (Figures 4 and 5). The OGTT consists of a fasting glucose blood test followed by the consumption of a 75 g glucose drink and a diagnostic glucose blood test at 120 min. This test provides information about the pancreatic reserve to compensate for insulin resistance.

In the context of obesity, pre-diabetes is an easily measurable clinical manifestation of insulin resistance. However, it is important to note that insulin resistance can exist in the absence of dysglycaemia, and therefore, some individuals at an early stage of SMD will not be identified when using pre-diabetes as a proxy for insulin resistance. Therefore, we recommend using HOMA-IR in addition to HbA1c to determine whether an individual is at an early stage of SMD.

### Comparison of triglyceride glucose index and other insulin resistance indexes in children with overweight and obesity [^112naxdW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

IR indexes reflect the basal insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells and the hepatic insulin sensitivity/resistance due to the fact that fasting induces a steady basal state where insulin and glucose plasma levels should be maintained in the normal ranges in a healthy human. However, these indexes carry disadvantages such as insensitivity, changes in β-cell function over time, lack of standardization, and lack of universal cut-off points for IR.

HOMA-IR is widely used for detection of IR and related diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, MS, cardiovascular diseases, and MASLD. Similarly, TyG index has been known to excellent marker for detection of IR-related diseases, even better than HOMA-IR. Matsuda uses parameters derived from OGTT to calculate the whole body insulin sensitivity index and the index has been validated for children with a high correlation with HEGC. OGTT does not indicate whether elevated glucose levels depend on IR or β-cell dysfunction, but HOMA can estimate both insulin sensitivity and β-cell function.

Although the insulin indexes have been well defined in adults and different studies have tried to identify HOMA cut-off values for children and adolescents, appropriate reference values are still lacking. Shashai et al. conducted a study on children and adolescents to define the specific percentiles of HOMA-IR in relation to age, gender, and BMI and to establish reliable cut-offs to distinguish between low and high cardiometabolic risk. They stated that the values higher than 1.68 in normal-weight children defined as "nonphysiological state" and the cut-off rised to 3.42 in children with overweight/obesity A higher value of HOMA-IR corresponds to a more severe IR. Shashaj et al. reported that children with overweight/obesity had higher HOMA-IR levels compared with normal-weight peers at any age. Similarly, our children with overweight or obesity had significantly higher HOMA-IR levels than the normal-weight children.

Results

Table 2 summarizes anthropometric, clinical, and biochemical characteristics of the study sample. In the overall data set, the MetS prevalence was 15% for MetS IDF (19.2% in men vs. 12.1% in women, P < 0.0001) and 12.7% for MetS ATPIII (14.9% in men vs. 11.1% in women, P = 0.006). In non-diabetic individuals, but not in diabetic individuals, we found significant differences by gender in components of MetS (data no shown). The percentage of men with positive MetS components of higher triglycerides, blood pressure, and glycemia were significantly higher than women (23% vs. 9.6% (P < 0.001), 32% vs. 19% (P < 0.001) and 21% vs. 13% (P < 0.001)). In contrast, women with positive MetS component of larger waist circumference were significantly higher than men (43.6% vs. 29.8%, ATPIII criteria, P < 0.0001 and 52.7% vs. 35.1%, IDF criteria, P < 0.001).

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^11137G2Q]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

HOMA is widely used as a research tool in epidemiological studies in which invasive techniques for modeling such as intravenous glucose tolerance testing are not practical. HOMA is not applicable for individual patient care as insulin results from different laboratories may vary. We have compiled a checklist of procedures to follow when HOMA is used (Table 3). In this study, the first five were fulfilled but only one blood sample was collected. For the original model, three blood samples were collected 5 min apart to account for insulin pulsatility, although HOMA estimates have been published subsequently from one sample in large research or epidemiological studies.

When HOMA estimates from this study are compared with those reported previously, it is important to note that they reflect the population studied, i.e. a small sample size with participants being mostly white Caucasian, being older than those recruited for HOMA (version 2), and having higher BMI. From an analytical point of view, differences in conversion factors quoted for an insulin assay, ranging from 6.0 to 7.46, will also contribute to variation. The HOMA calculator version 2.2 accepts international or molar units for insulin and uses a conversion factor of 6.9 (microunits per milliliter to picomoles per liter). The American Diabetes Association Working Group recommends a factor of 6.0. The study does not address the question of long-term stability of assays as insulin was measured over a very short period using a particular batch of reagents and calibrator.

### Prognostic performance of metabolic indexes in predicting onset of type 1 diabetes [^1138r5nq]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical utility of the FPIR-to–HOMA-IR ratio must be considered in the context of the predictive accuracy found in a standard index derived from an OGTT, a test that is both less burdensome to the patient and, in some instances, may be administered at lower cost. The FPIR-to–HOMA-IR ratio is actually a composite of three measures: two from an IVGTT to determine FPIR and a fasting status measurement to determine HOMA-IR. In contrast, the relatively simplistic 2-h postprandial glucose test from an OGTT maintained the largest ROC AUC and the greatest degree of both sensitivity and specificity at the optimal cutoff value compared with all other metabolic indicators evaluated in this investigation. In addition, when compared at the same NPV, 2-h glucose retained a higher estimated PPV than the FPIR-to–HOMA-IR, although this difference was not statistically significant. However, because HOMA-IR does not require an IVGTT, future research may indicate that insulin resistance can be incorporated as a part of a composite to increase predictive value.

The OGTT is the gold standard method to diagnose type 1 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. A standard 2-h glucose tolerance test contributes substantial predictive accuracy beyond screening for the underlying risk factors. This result is consistent with the findings by Sosenko et al. who determined that the accuracy of 2-h glucose was 0.66 for the combined study population of subjects with and without impaired glucose tolerance at baseline. The prognostic accuracy of this index is probably due to 2-h glucose being influenced by insulin production and insulin resistance, two important factors that modulate the progression of this disease. This finding is evidenced by an observed level of prognostic accuracy similar to the FPIR-to–HOMA-IR ratio. Because a principal objective of this investigation was to examine metabolic indexes to provide clinical guidance for selecting individuals at high risk for progression to disease despite the absence of clinical metabolic abnormality, we have determined the optimal cutoff point for the metabolic index with the largest ROC AUC, 2-h glucose at 114 mg/dl. This threshold derived from standard OGTT diagnostics may provide cost-effective guidance for clinicians and researchers for selecting patients likely to progress to disease if not provided preventative care, even among those presenting with normal glucose tolerance, in future prevention trials.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^11699Rcy]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Differences in HOMA estimates due to sample type and calculator version are small compared with the twofold difference in extremes of values reported by insulin assays. Difference plots for an insulin assay versus the mean of assays (as no reference measurement procedure [RMP] was available) showed offsets or positive or negative concentration-dependent differences. This has been confirmed by a recent study comparing immunoassays to isotope dilution, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. A corresponding pattern of differences in HOMA estimates was found in this study with the direction depending on the nature of the transform required for the particular estimate (supplemental material available in the online appendix). Ranking of insulin results was maintained in the different insulin assays (r 2 0.983–0.997) with this level of ranking broadly maintained for HOMA estimates in this study.

All insulin assays were quoted as being calibrated using International Reference Preparation (IRP) 66/304, but differences in calibration procedures and IRP commutability, assay format, specificity, and conversion factors may have contributed to assay bias. In the absence of an RMP, various tactics have been introduced to reduce variation, e.g. using a central laboratory with the same methodology throughout, sample exchanges, and ranking HOMA estimates from different assays, although these have limited applicability. To achieve standardization for insulin, an RMP and commutable reference material or certified serum calibrator producing traceable results to a defined measurand expressed in SI units are required. Progress has been made with publication of an isotope dilution, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method for serum insulin. However, establishment of traceability for HOMA has yet to be attained.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^111BTyH7]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

In common with other means of assessing insulin resistance or β-cell function, comparison among studies is problematic. Estimates cannot be compared if different insulin assays are involved nor can cut points be established across populations. In addition, they are affected by sample type and calculator version. The SI calculator recommended for assays that do not cross-react with proinsulin includes a factor to account for physiological actions of proinsulin. Not all immunometric assays demonstrate this degree of specificity. The RIA calculator should be used for assays that cross-react 100% with proinsulin whatever the assay architecture. Although direct comparison of numerical results of HOMA estimates may not be valid, it is valid to look at relative changes or to compare their distribution across populations.

In summary, until a new HOMA version based on an insulin assay traceable to an RMP with appropriate standards for serum and plasma is developed, this study provides the most reliable information on estimates from different sources. Selection of the appropriate HOMA calculator for the insulin assay is essential.

### The effects of carbohydrate, unsaturated fat, and protein intake on measures of insulin sensitivity: results from the omniHeart trial [^115ti1LQ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Indices of insulin sensitivity

We assessed insulin sensitivity by calculating the QUICKI (quantitative insulin check index) measure of insulin sensitivity. The equation for QUICKI, 1/{[log(fasting insulin µU/mL) + log(fasting glucose mg/dL)]}, uses log transformations of fasting glucose and insulin measurements and is a steady-state measure with a high correlation with the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp. In a sensitivity analysis, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), an alternate assessment of insulin sensitivity, was also calculated and reported as 1/HOMA, calculated as 1/[glucose (mmol/L) × insulin (μIU/L)/22.5]. As the linear slopes of HOMA change in relation to varying insulin sensitivities, the reciprocal and log transformation of HOMA inherent in QUICKI make it a more flexible measure, usable in normal weight, overweight, and the insulin-resistant state of obese individuals, and more appropriate for the range of BMI in our population (,–). A higher numerical value for 1/HOMA or QUICKI reflects greater insulin sensitivity.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^112mbEQu]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) is widely used to calculate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and β-cell function (HOMA-β), from concomitant glucose and insulin (or C-peptide) in fasting subjects. There is growing recognition that interpretation of HOMA estimates may not be appropriate in some circumstances because insufficient information is available on effects of preanalytical factors, insulin assays, or version of HOMA calculator selected. These parameters are defined within studies and are therefore stable but may differ between studies, making application of HOMA to individuals and comparison of research studies problematic.

The current HOMA specific insulin (SI) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) calculators (version 2.2) evolved from computer models that replaced equations derived from the original computer model published in 1985 (Table 1). The HOMA RIA calculator was originally developed for immunoassays not specific for insulin, whereas the HOMA SI calculator is recommended for use with assays specific for insulin, although no limits on any cross-reactivity with proinsulin(s) are specified.

A twofold difference in results from insulin assays was reported in 1996 and confirmed recently in the U.K. and U.S. with newer insulin assays. The U.K. study found that insulin values from one specific insulin assay were 15% lower in heparinized plasma than in serum. Heparinized plasma was collected for the HOMA database and is frequently used for research; however, serum is more commonly used in practice for insulin measurement. There is no advantage in the use of C-peptide rather than insulin measurements for HOMA, as results from different C-peptide assays vary and C-peptide is not stable when stored. In this study, HOMA estimates from 97 fasting subjects with normoglycemia, pre-diabetes, or type 2 diabetes were compared using 11 insulin assays to establish the extent to which the type of blood sample collected, insulin assay selected, or version of HOMA calculator used affect HOMA estimates.

### Use and abuse of HOMA modeling [^117YMmWf]. Diabetes Care (2004). Low credibility.

Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is a method for assessing beta-cell function and insulin resistance (IR) from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin or C-peptide concentrations. It has been reported in > 500 publications, 20 times more frequently for the estimation of IR than beta-cell function. This article summarizes the physiological basis of HOMA, a structural model of steady-state insulin and glucose domains, constructed from physiological dose responses of glucose uptake and insulin production. Hepatic and peripheral glucose efflux and uptake were modeled to be dependent on plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Decreases in beta-cell function were modeled by changing the beta-cell response to plasma glucose concentrations. The original HOMA model was described in 1985 with a formula for approximate estimation. The computer model is available but has not been as widely used as the approximation formulae. HOMA has been validated against a variety of physiological methods. We review the use and reporting of HOMA in the literature and give guidance on its appropriate use (e.g., cohort and epidemiological studies) and inappropriate use (e.g., measuring beta-cell function in isolation). The HOMA model compares favorably with other models and has the advantage of requiring only a single plasma sample assayed for insulin and glucose. In conclusion, the HOMA model has become a widely used clinical and epidemiological tool and, when used appropriately, it can yield valuable data. However, as with all models, the primary input data need to be robust, and the data need to be interpreted carefully.

### Correction of metabolic acidosis improves insulin resistance in chronic kidney disease [^114WjZVi]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance measurement and HOMA test

Insulin resistance was assessed indirectly by the Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index as suggested by Wallace and coworkers. Briefly, the HOMA index is a mathematical model that allows to calculate insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) and evaluate ß pancreatic cell function (HOMA-%B) from fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels. It is a simple test, appropriate to perform in large epidemiological studies that nicely correlates with experimental data obtained with direct measurement techniques such as the euglycemic clamp.

To perform the HOMA test, blood samples are drawn twice (30 min apart) in 3 consecutive days. Patients are kept at rest, in a fasting status for at least 8 h before the blood sampling. Tobacco use is forbidden for the 12 h before blood tests. The presented values for HOMA test at baseline and study completion are the mean values of the three consecutive blood samples. For HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B calculation, the following formulas are used:
HOMA-IR = (FPI * FPG)/22.5;
HOMA-%B = (20 * FPI)/(FPG - 3.5)

where FPI stands for fasting plasma insulin concentration (mU/l) and FPG stands for fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l) (FPG conversion factor from mg/dl to mmol/l: 10.018).

HOMA-IR estimates of insulin resistance. Normal values are < 0.25. Values greater or equal than 5.5 indicate insulin resistance typical of early stages of Diabetes Mellitus. HOMA-B% estimates ß pancreatic cells function. It's value ranges from 0% (no pancreatic cell function) to 100% (all pancreatic cell functioning). FPI and FPG measurements were performed centrally at P.O. "A Landolfi" – Solofra (AV), Italy, via COBAS 6000 or COBAS C 501 (Roche Diagnostics) and IMMULITE 2000 (Siemens Healthcare Global), respectively.

Study objective and endpoint

Current analyses aim at testing the impact of metabolic acidosis correction in CKD 3b-4 diabetic patients with serum bicarbonate < 24 mEq/l on insulin resistance evaluated via the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) test. The HOMA was performed at study inception and after 12 months of treatment with either oral sodium bicarbonate (treatment group) or conventional therapy for CKD (control group).

### Are insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance all equally strongly related to age? [^1143JEv6]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance (IR) has been considered an underlying cause of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Whether IR increases with age has been debated. We investigated the age-associated deterioration in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of IR and in glucose metabolism.

Methods

Ten (nine including women) European studies contributed data on 6314 men and 6393 women aged 30–88 years. The cohort- and sex-specific top 25% of HOMA of IR in non-diabetic subjects was used to define HOMA-IR.

Results

Compared with subjects aged 50–59 years, the cohort- and body mass index-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HOMA-IR was 0.83 (0.64, 1.08), 0.87 (0.74, 1.03), 1.20 (1.02, 1.42) and 1.45 (1.10, 1.92) in men and 0.84 (0.62, 1.14), 0.91 (0.77, 1.09), 1.38 (1.19, 1.62) and 1.71 (1.35, 2.17) in women, respectively, aged 30–39, 40–49, 60–69 and ≥ 70 years (P < 0.0001 for trend test). The same increasing trend was also observed for IFG. In contrast, the corresponding odds ratios for IGT increased linearly and more strongly with age, being 0.37 (0.22, 0.63), 0.67 (0.52, 0.87), 1.55 (1.24, 1.92) and 2.96 (2.13, 4.13) in men and 0.51 (0.31, 0.85), 0.66 (0.52, 0.86), 1.92 (1.57, 2.35) and 3.85 (2.89, 5.12) in women, respectively.

Conclusions

Age is more strongly associated with IGT than with HOMA-IR or IFG in non-diabetic European populations.

### Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and the reciprocal index of homeostasis model assessment in normal range weight and moderately obese type 2 diabetic patients [^111a9RhP]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) and the reciprocal index of homeostasis model assessment (1/HOMA-IR) derived from fasting plasma glucose and insulin level are excellent surrogate indices of insulin resistance in both normal range-weight and moderately obese type 2 diabetic and healthy subjects.

Research Design and Methods

The association between QUICKI or 1/HOMA-IR and insulin resistance index assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (clamp-IR) was investigated in 121 type 2 diabetic and 29 healthy subjects recruited from among 120 (age 55 ± 11, 48 ± 15, and 52 ± 15 years [means ± SD], respectively). Type 2 diabetic subjects were divided into groups of 76 normal range-weight and 45 moderately obese subjects (BMI 21.4 ± 2.3 vs. 27.2 ± 2.2 kg/m(2), P < 0.0001).

Results

QUICKI and 1/HOMA-IR were significantly lower in the moderately obese group than in the normal range-weight type 2 diabetic and healthy groups (n = 120) (QUICKI, 0.338 ± 0.030, 0.371 ± 0.037, and 0.389 ± 0.041, respectively, P < 0.0001; 1/HOMA-IR, 0.50 ± 0.33, 0.92 ± 0.55, and 1.24 ± 0.82, P < 0.0001). QUICKI was strongly correlated with clamp-IR in normal range-weight, moderately obese type 2 diabetic, and healthy subjects (r = 0.641, 0.570, and 0.502, respectively; all subjects, r = 0.608, P < 0.01) and 1/HOMA-IR exhibited correlations comparable to those of QUICKI with clamp-IR (r = 0.637, 0.530, and 0.461, respectively; all subjects, r = 0.589, P < 0.001). In multiple regression models including QUICKI or 1/HOMA-IR as an independent variable, the estimation formula accounted for 55% of the variability of clamp-IR for the group of all type 2 diabetic subjects (R(2) = 0.547 and 0.551, respectively, P ≤ 0.0001).

Conclusions

QUICKI and 1/HOMA-IR were highly correlated with clamp-IR, with comparable coefficients in both normal range-weight and moderately obese type 2 diabetic patients and nondiabetic subjects. The latter can probably be applied clinically in view of its convenience.

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^115YtSYj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Our findings are in discordance with several up to day published data performed in the small populations of Caucasian GDM women as well as in Japanese women. In these studies minimal increase in insulin secretion assessed by HOMA B in the range of 80–130 to 170–180 or by OGTT- derived indices of beta cell function fail to compensate for increased insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR index between 1–1.8 to 2,3 contributed to the development of gestational diabetes. In contrast, we show that basal insulin secretion decrease in the range of HOMA-IR between 1 to 2,39. On the other hand, these results my support our current suggestion that there is a major need for a treatment aimed at improving tissue insulin sensitivity at low insulin resistance index-HOMA-IR values. In another observations, beta-cell activity assessed by median of HOMA-B was equal 154 at the diagnosis of GDM and 200 alongside with the HOMA-IR- 2.1 and 2.4 respectively.

Interestingly, most of these estimates of beta cell activity are lower than those reported in our current study. We suggest that the relatively early week of gestation at the time of diagnosis of GDM as well as a younger age of studied subjects in our data compared with most of other studies are partly responsible for these differences. These discrepancies may be due to the small size of populations studied as well as may reflect the differences in diagnostic procedures, severity of glucose intolerance, or anthropometric and ethnical characteristics. In the another study of large size population of GDM women basal insulin secretion assessed by mean of HOMA-B in whole population was equal 200 + −300 while the insulin sensitivity index derived from-OGTT was reduced by 42% versus than in women with normal glucose regulation. These results are in accordance with basal insulin secretory capacity values derived from our current study and suggest pathophysiologic heterogeneity of the studied population of GDM women with respect to this pathophysiological parameter. It is suggested that results from HOMA-B a measure of basal insulin secretory capacity should be interpreted alongside with insulin sensitivity measure by HOMA-IR.

### Insulin resistance as estimated by the homeostatic method at diagnosis of gestational diabetes: estimation of disease severity and therapeutic needs in a population-based study [^115rMptz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

The first important observation resulting from our study is that significant differences occur in the studied population of women in terms of the severity of insulin resistance evaluated using the HOMA-IR index at the time of GDM diagnosis. According to the International Diabetes Federation criteria, the HOMA-IR cut-off point to differentiate between low and high insulin resistance is 2.38, and HOMA-IR values range from 0.34 to 1.29 in the lowest quartile, whereas in the 4th quartile these values range from 2.89 to 20.39. Such differences in the HOMA-IR indicate a significant pathophysiological variation in the severity of insulin resistance at the diagnosis of GDM in the studied population.

Consistent with our results, several previous studies performed on smaller populations have demonstrated that HOMA-IR index assessed at diagnosis of GDM ranged from 1.6 to 25.

Interestingly 1/4 of the women in our study (the first quartile), exhibited a low degree of insulin resistance, while chronic insulin resistance is present in most of the GDM women, and it progresses in the course of pregnancy.

It is also worth of noticing that the highest rate of insulin resistance (fourth quartile) occurred in 1/4 of our female patients, while most women with this type of diabetes exhibit a mild degree of insulin resistance.

The results of our study clearly indicate a pathophysiological and clinical variation of GDM in respect to HOMA-IR values. The value of HOMA-IR index higher than > 1.29 is associated with a higher value of the pre-pregnancy body mass index, fasting glucose level, insulin level, and severity of GDM. Values of HOMA-IR in the range of 1.92–2.89 are specifically associated with reduced insulin secretion, while values of > 2.89 are additionally associated with a higher HbA1c level and an unchanged beta cell function, suggesting insufficient compensation for metabolic demands. It should be emphasised that there were no statistically significant differences between the HOMA-IR quartiles in terms of age, parity and time of diagnosis of GDM.

### Insulin resistance in obesity can be reliably identified from fasting plasma insulin [^112JPMMz]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Insulin resistance is the major contributor to cardiometabolic complications of obesity. We aimed to (1) establish cutoff points for insulin resistance from euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps (EHCs), (2) identify insulin-resistant obese subjects and (3) predict insulin resistance from routinely measured variables.

Subjects/Methods

We assembled data from non-obese (n = 112) and obese (n = 100) men who underwent two-step EHCs using [6,6-(2)H2]glucose as tracer (insulin infusion dose 20 and 60 mUm(-2)min(-1), respectively). Reference ranges for hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were calculated from healthy non-obese men. Based on these reference values, obese men with preserved insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance were identified.

Results

Cutoff points for insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) and insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance rate (Rd) were 46.5% and 37.3μmolkg(-)(1)min(-)(1), respectively. Most obese men (78%) had EGP suppression within the reference range, whereas only 12% of obese men had Rd within the reference range. Obese men with Rd < 37.3μmolkg(-1)min(-1) did not differ from insulin-sensitive obese men in age, body mass index (BMI), body composition, fasting glucose or cholesterol, but did have higher fasting insulin (110 ± 49 vs 63 ± 29pmoll(-1), P < 0.001) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (4.5 ± 2.2 vs 2.7 ± 1.4, P = 0.004). Insulin-resistant obese men could be identified with good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (75%) from fasting insulin > 74pmoll(-1).

Conclusions

Most obese men have hepatic insulin sensitivity within the range of non-obese controls, but below-normal peripheral insulin sensitivity, that is, insulin resistance. Fasting insulin (> 74pmoll(-1) with current insulin immunoassay) may be used for identification of insulin-resistant (or metabolically unhealthy) obese men in research and clinical settings.

### Defining insulin resistance from hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps [^114VUTGq]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The question of what is a normal and clinically relevant M value derived from clamps using other insulin infusion doses, such as 120 mU/m 2 ⋅ min, is unknown. As such, it is difficult for clinicians to explain the importance of the results from these clamps to research participants. The 120 mU/m 2 ⋅ min insulin was chosen for this analysis for two major reasons: 1) endogenous glucose production is likely to be fully suppressed, and 2) a shorter time is needed to reach steady-state conditions with a higher infusion rate, thus making this insulin dose more cost-effective while also reducing participant burden. Moreover, although the clamp technique is the gold standard for directly assessing insulin resistance in humans, it is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and overall expensive. Therefore, the ability to predict results of the clamp from other clinical data, which are both easier to obtain and less expensive to measure, is important.

In the current study, we assembled data from clamp studies performed under standard operating procedures at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC; Baton Rouge, LA), between 2001 and 2011, with an insulin infusion rate of 120 mU/m 2 ⋅ min. Our aims were to 1) determine a cutoff point for identifying insulin resistance for hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies performed at 120 mU/m 2 ⋅ min in a white population and 2) generate equations from commonly measured clinic and blood variables for predicting insulin sensitivity (M values derived from the clamp).

### Assessment of insulin resistance using surrogate markers in patients of metabolic syndrome [^117EgYiy]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance is defined as situation where there is insufficient biological or metabolic response to normal plasma levels of insulin. For precise quantification of insulin sensitivity, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp may be used, but it is expensive, invasive and used mainly in research settings. HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance) and ISI 0,120 (Insulin Sensitivity Index) are indirect markers of insulin resistance. The present study evaluated the usefulness of the surrogate markers for evaluation of Insulin resistance in clinical settings.

Method

This study was carried out on 120 subjects. Of these, 60 subjects presenting with two or more features of metabolic syndrome (Hypertension, Obesity, Dyslipidemia, altered glucose tolerance) were included in the study group. Sixty age and sex matched healthy controls were selected with normal Body mass index. All the subjects underwent a standard Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. Plasma glucose and serum insulin were estimated using Glucose oxidase and ELISA principle respectively. HOMA-IR and ISI 0,120 were calculated using relevant formulae.

Result

The HOMA-IR values were significantly raised in suspected Insulin resistant subjects (6.74 ± 1.24) as compared to healthy controls (0.82 ± 0.017) (p = 0.001). ISI 01,20 was significantly low in insulin resistant subjects (3.13 ± 0.17) as compared to controls (20.60 ± 0.37) (p < 0.001). Insulin sensitivity index showed a significant negative correlation with HOMA-IR. A significant negative correlation was observed between serum cholesterol, serum LDL-cholesterol and ISI 0,120 indicating that dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome may result from a decrease in Insulin sensitivity.

Conclusion

HOMA-IR and ISI 0,120 are simple, convenient and sensitive estimates of insulin resistance adaptable for use in clinical practice as well as large-scale epidemiological studies.

### Is waist-to-height ratio a useful indicator of cardio-metabolic risk in 6–10-year-old children? [^114U4Y2Q]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Laboratory evaluation

At the first clinical evaluation, parents or guardians of all children were instructed to take their children to the CRTCA to get their blood drawn after 12-hour overnight fasting for the measurement of fasting glycemia, total cholesterol (TC), LDL, TG, HDL, insulin, CRP and leukocyte count. The assays were run in the Municipal Hospital of Guarus, in Campos. LDL was calculated using Friedewald's formula. Lipid profile values were established according to the 1st Brazilian Guidelines on the prevention of atherosclerosis in childhood and adolescence which consider normal levels to be TC < 150 mg/dl, LDL < 100 mg/dl, TG < 100 mg/dl and HDL ≥ 45 mg/dl. The cut-off value for the Homeostatic Model of Assessment – Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was ≥ 2.5 based on the study of Madeira. Glycemia and lipid profiles were determined by the colorimetric enzymatic method using a kit for the Hitachi–Roche modular system. Insulin was measured by chemiluminescence using a Bayer kit, and CRP by immunonephelometry with a Dade Behring kit (Bayer). Leukocyte count was determined using an automated data processing system (Pentra 180 ABX).

Statistical analysis

BP values and metabolic parameters were compared among groups using Student's t -test for continuous variables with a normal distribution and the Mann–Whitney test for those without a normal distribution. BMI z scores were calculated according to the 2007 WHO standard using Anthro Plus software. The sensitivity and specificity of BMI z score for the detecting changes in BP or HOMA-IR were calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The most sensitive WHtR cut-off value for the detection of cardio-metabolic changes was also determined using a ROC curve. Correlation analysis was conducted using Pearson or Spearman coefficients; the latter were used when the data were not normally distributed. Insulin and HOMA-IR values were not normally distributed on the Kolmogorov–Smirnof test and it was necessary to transform them into logarithms to evaluate their correlation with WHtR. Medcalc version 12.1.0.0, GraphPad Instat version 3.00 and Graph Pad Prism 5 version 5.04 were used for statistical analysis.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^114pJ9CN]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Childhood obesity has experienced an important increase all over the world. It has been associated with the rising prevalence of many metabolic complications, such as hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and high blood pressure. Many of them are already present during childhood and tend to persist into adulthood or further develop into metabolic syndrome (MS), and therefore increase the risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Insulin resistance is the primary metabolic disorder associated with obesity and appears to be the primary mediator of MS. Identification of children with insulin resistance has been proposed as a strategy for identifying high-risk children for targeting MS interventions. The gold-standard technique for assessment of insulin sensitivity is the hyperinsulin-emiceuglycemic clamp; and another accepted method is the minimal-model analysis frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT). These tests are invasive, labor intensive, and expensive, which can be used for research purposes only. As a more convenient method to measure insulin resistance, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was therefore developed and widely used in clinical and epidemiologic studies.

In children and adolescents, HOMA-IR has been validated as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance in several studies, showing high correlations with clamp or FSIVGTT measures. However, it is more difficult to define HOMA-IR cut-off points for diagnosis of insulin resistance in youths than in adults, because there is lack of longitudinal evidence in youths for risk prediction of cardiovascular outcomes. Alternatively, in most studies, cut-off points for diagnosis of insulin resistance have been defined based on HOMA-IR distribution in reference population, but due to the influence factors such as puberty development and ethnic difference, values varied obviously from 1.8, 2.5, 3.2, to > 4 according to the different reference population. On the other hand, presence of pediatric MS, as a risk for future CVD, has been considered alternatively for defining cut-off values of HOMA-IR, but population-based studies are limited and there even exists debates on how and to what extent IR is associated with MS and its components.

In this context, our study aims are to evaluate the association of IR with each of the components of MS and to determine HOMA-IR cut-off values of different pubertal status regarding the diagnosis of MS based on a large cohort of Chinese schoolchildren. To our knowledge, there is lack of this kind of study in population- based samples of Chinese children.

### Are HOMA-IR and HOMA-B good predictors for diabetes and pre-diabetes subtypes? [^112C7hGj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Odds ratios of incidence of diabetes and pre-diabetes for HOMA-IR and HOMA-B

Model (1): crude model, Model (2): Adjusted for gender and age, smoking, level of education, and family history of type 2 diabetes, Model (3a): Adjusted for model 2 in addition to metabolic syndrome variables including waist circumference, blood pressure, triglyceride, and HDL, as binary variables, model (3b): Adjusted for model 2 in addition to metabolic syndrome variables including waist circumference, systolic & diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, and HDL as continuous variables

The main missing variable in our dataset was the insulin data (other missing variables were < 5%). The supplementary data represent comparisons between subjects with missing and non-missing data for insulin (Table S 1) and subjects who followed and did not follow (Table S 2). As there were some differences, we also did a sensitivity analysis considering multiple imputations (with the assumption of missing at random, i.e. the missing values depend on the measured variables), and the results changed negligibly (Table S 3).

The area under the HOMA-IR curve (AUC) for pre-diabetes/diabetes was 59% (CI: 57–62%), and the best cut-off point based on Youden's index was 2.22 (with 39% sensitivity and 76% specificity); also, the value for HOMA-B was 51% (CI: 49–54%) (Fig. 3) which was not statistically significant. The AUC of HOMA-IR and HOMA-B for iIFG (58 and 48%, respectively) and iIGT (56 and 52%, respectively) are also shown in Fig. 3, where the results are not meaningfully different from the analysis for the combined outcome.

### Failure of the homeostatic model assessment calculation score for detecting metabolic deterioration in young patients with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115qqeNv]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To verify whether the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) test is a suitable method for the identification of metabolic deterioration in normal-weight patients affected by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Prospective clinical study.

Setting

Academic clinic and research environment in Cagliari, Italy.

Patient(S)

Forty-nine PCOS normal-weight adolescent subjects, and 50 eumenorrheic, normal-weight, nonhirsute controls matched for age and body mass index (BMI).

Intervention(S)

History and physical examination, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and blood sampling, ultrasound.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The HOMA score and integrated secretory area under the curve of insulin values (I-AUC) during the OGTT were calculated.

Result(S)

Normal insulin sensitivity was defined as upper control 95th percentile by HOMA values < 65.6, I-AUC at 180 minutes < 16,921, and I-AUC at 120 minutes < 11,817. When applying the calculated I-AUC cutoff, 27 PCOS patients were classified as normoinsulinemic and 22 as hyperinsulinemic, whereas using the calculated HOMA cutoff, only 9 PCOS patients could be classified as insulin resistant (IR). Thirteen of the 40 non-IR PCOS patients presented with hyperinsulinemia; fasting glucose and insulin levels and HOMA scores were not sufficient to identify these subjects. Thus, the HOMA test displayed a low sensitivity (41%) and specificity (100%) in the diagnosis of the metabolic disorder disclosed by I-AUC. Moreover, analysis of I-AUC after 120 and 180 minutes revealed how the shorter evaluation period did not suffice for identification of all hyperinsulinemic subjects, implying an unrecognized condition in 11 of 22 subjects.

Conclusion(S)

In young, normal-weight patients with PCOS, the prevalence of hyperinsulinemia is not detectable by HOMA studies. The prevalence of IR was 18% according to HOMA evaluation, whereas hyperinsulinemia was found in 44% of subjects examined by I-AUC. Normal-weight, young PCOS patients should undergo a 3-hour OGTT to detect early metabolic abnormalities.

### Impact of insulin resistance on subclinical left ventricular dysfunction in normal weight and overweight / obese Japanese subjects in a general community [^112W4TkA]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Laboratory testing and classification of glucose metabolism

Venous blood samples were drawn in the fasting condition on the same day as the echocardiographic examination. Fasting serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein were measured in all participants. HOMA-IR was calculated from the following validated formula; HOMA-IR = fasting insulin (µU/ml) × fasting blood glucose (mg/dl)/405. Participants without DM were classified into 2 groups according to HOMA-IR; participants with insulin resistance as HOMA-IR ≥ 1.5 and those without insulin resistance as HOMA-IR < 1.5, which is based on the cut-off value carrying increased risk of incident heart failure from ARIC Study as mentioned above. Overall, glycemic profiles were categorized into 3 groups: (1) normal HOMA-IR group (no DM and HOMA-IR < 1.5); (2) abnormal HOMA-IR group (no DM and HOMA-IR ≥ 1.5); and (3) DM group.

### Changes in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in relation to the glycemic outcomes in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance in the Indian diabetes prevention programme-1 (IDPP-1) [^115qpdrh]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Table 2
Outcome of glucose tolerance at 3rd year in relation to the status of baseline HOMA-IR and ΔI/G

Table 3 shows the baseline and follow-up values of HOMA-IR and ΔI/G in the control and in the total intervention group in relation to glucose tolerance status at the follow-up. The pattern of changes in insulin resistance and ΔI/G were similar in individual intervention groups, but minor statistical variations were seen due to smaller sample sizes (data not shown). Development of diabetes occurred mostly in individuals who had higher values of insulin resistance and lower values of ΔI/G at the baseline. On follow-up, both functions deteriorated further. On the other hand, subjects who reverted to NGT showed improvement in insulin sensitivity, and secretion of insulin remained in normal ranges.

Table 3
Status of insulin resistance and insulinogenic index in relation to the glucose tolerance status in the control and intervention groups

Cox regression analyses adjusted for baseline age, BMI, and waist circumference showed that lower 120-min plasma glucose (β = −0.029, hazard ratio [HR] 0.972, P = 0.011), lower HOMA-IR (β = −0.167, HR 0.846, P = 0.008), and higher ΔI/G (β = 0.016, HR 1.016, P = 0.002) at baseline and reduction in HOMA-IR (β = −0.152, HR 0.859, P = 0.005) and improved ΔI/G (β = 0.015, HR 1.015, P = 0.001) improved glucose tolerance from IGT to NGT. For diabetes, the risk was higher in those with lower 120-min insulin values (β = −0.006, HR 0.994, P = 0.007), higher HOMA-IR (β = 0.172, HR 1.187, P < 0.0001), and lower ΔI/G (β = −0.015, HR 0.985, P = 0.003) at baseline and an increase in HOMA-IR (β = 0.118, HR 1.126, P < 0.0001), and a reduction in ΔI/G (β = −0.016, HR 0.984, P = 0.001) increased the hazard for diabetes.

### Associations between insulin resistance and adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes mellitus: a retrospective study [^113hynBq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of GDM with IR

In this study, it was found that the HOMA-β value is increased in GDM women with IR. which is considered that IR promotes pancreatic β-cells to produce and secrete more insulin. This compensatory hyperinsulinemic response of β-cells can initially control blood glucose within the normal range; however, long-term exposure to excessive glucose and lipids will eventually lead to β-cell dysfunction and / or cell death, leading to overt diabetes. The protection of pancreatic β-cell function is closely related to the reduction of endogenous insulin demand. Therefore, women with insulin resistance to GDM are likely to benefit from insulin sensitization therapy, providing a new approach for the individualized treatment of GDM. This view is similar to that of a study in Poland, in which Sokup suggested that GDM women with HOMA > 1.29 should be treated with improved tissue sensitivity to insulin, while GDM women with HOMA > 2.89 should be treated with metformin combined with insulin.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116svJYu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — plasma insulin measurement and insulin resistance: Although commonly obtained, insulin measurements do not add to diagnosis and are not recommended; attempts to diagnose insulin resistance by measuring plasma insulin concentration or any surrogate in clinical settings have no merit because they have no diagnostic value, there is no well-defined cutoff or universally accepted numeric expression, adult studies show fasting insulin explains no more than 5% to 50% of variability in insulin sensitivity and proposed cutoffs vary by 2.5-fold, fasting insulin can be similar in obese youths with normal versus impaired glucose tolerance, and therefore measuring plasma insulin concentrations remains a research tool with no clinical value for evaluation of obesity.

### Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) cut-off values and the metabolic syndrome in a general adult population: effect of gender and age: EPIRCE cross-sectional study [^116bwxN4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

However, in non-diabetic men the AUC progressively decreases with age, without statistical significance (P = 0.16, Figure 1). Thus AUC value, 0.69 (0.65, 0.74) for MetS IDF and 0.71 (0.66, 0.76) for MetS ATPIII, was estimated without covariates (Table 3).

On the other hand, in diabetic individuals there was no statistically significant effect of age on the accuracy of HOMA-IR. The AUC show an acceptable performance of HOMA-IR in diabetic men, 0.7 (0.6, 0.8), but not in diabetic women 0.54 (0.44, 0.64) (Table 3).

Cut-off values of HOMA-IR

Table 4 shows gender distribution of HOMA-IR cut-off values, with their corresponding sensitivity and specificity both in diabetic and non-diabetic populations. In non-diabetic individuals we found significantly differences by gender. Figure 2 depicts the estimated HOMA-IR cut-off values by age in non-diabetic women for MetS ATPIII and MetS IDF respectively. For MetS ATPIII the optimal HOMA-IR cut-off values ranged from 2.07 (sensitivity, 0.72; specificity, 0.71) at 50 years to 2.47 (sensitivity, 0.44; specificity, 0.74) at 70 years when using YI criteria. Very similar values were found for MetS IDF. On the other hand, in non-diabetic men, for MetS ATPIII the optimal HOMA-IR cut-off was 1.85 (sensitivity, 0.78; specificity, 0.57) when YI criteria were used and 2.27 (sensitivity, 0.61) with fixed specificity criteria. Moreover, for MetS IDF the optimal HOMA-IR cut-off was higher, 2.05 (sensitivity, 0.65; specificity, 0.64), when YI criteria were used.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^117Beop1]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE — We investigated how β-cell function and insulin sensitivity or resistance are affected by the type of blood sample collected or choice of insulin assay and homeostatis model assessment (HOMA) calculator.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Insulin was measured using 11 different assays in serum and 1 assay in heparinized plasma. Fasting subjects with normoglycemia (n = 12), pre-diabetes, i.e. impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (n = 18), or type 2 diabetes (n = 67) were recruited. Patients treated with insulin or those who were insulin antibody–positive were excluded. HOMA estimates were calculated using specific insulin (SI) or radioimmunoassay (RIA) calculators (version 2.2).

RESULTS — All glucose values were within model (HOMA) limits but not all insulin results, as 4.3% were < 20 pmol/l and 1% were > 300 pmol/l. β-Cell function derived from different insulin assays ranged from 67 to 122% (median) for those with normoglycemia (P = 0.026), from 89 to 138% for those with pre-diabetes (P = 0.990), and from 50 to 81% for those with type 2 diabetes (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, insulin resistance ranged from 0.8 to 2.0 (P = 0.0007), from 1.9 to 3.2 (P = 0.842), and from 1.5 to 2.9 (P < 0.0001), respectively. This twofold variation in HOMA estimates from the various insulin assays studied in serum may be significant metabolically. Insulin was 15% lower in heparinized plasma (used in the original HOMA study) compared with serum, which is now more commonly used. β-Cell function differed by 11% and insulin resistance by 15% when estimates derived from specific insulin were calculated using the RIA rather than the SI calculator.

CONCLUSIONS — To enable comparison of HOMA estimates among individuals and different research studies, preanalytical factors and calculator selection should be standardized with insulin assays traceable to an insulin reference method procedure.

### Update on the effects of physical activity on insulin sensitivity in humans [^115jpVzd]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The comparison of results between research studies into the effects of a physically active lifestyle and/or exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control are problematic due to differences in the methods of assessment of outcome variables. While the precise protocols vary, the general methods for assessing insulin sensitivity/glycaemic control include: (1) measuring fasting insulin concentrations, with elevated fasted (insulin) > 25 mIU/L indicating poor insulin sensitivity, as the pancreas endeavours to compensate for the lack of peripheral insulin sensitivity by secreting greater amounts of insulin, thereby resulting in hyperinsulinaemia; (2) oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), which involves the ingestion of a standard glucose bolus (75 g), followed by blood glucose monitoring for the subsequent 2 hours. Blood glucose concentrations of > 7.8 mmol/L and < 11.0 mmol/L at 2 hours are indicative of impaired glycaemic control, and > 11.0 mmol/L indicates diabetes; (3) hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, in which the participant is infused with insulin at a known rate, creating a hyperinsulinaemic state (~100 µU/ml), while simultaneously blood glucose levels are monitored and adjusted by a variable-rate infusion to maintain glycaemia (5.0–5.5 mmol/L). A high rate of glucose infusion indicates insulin sensitivity as the glucose is being rapidly taken up by the cells of the body, while a low rate of glucose infusion indicates a loss of insulin sensitivity, as the glucose is remaining in the blood rather than being taken up by the cells of the body;(4) hyperglycaemic clamp, in which plasma glucose levels are initially increased to ~125mg/dl above basal values and then maintained at this hyperglycaemic level, through the infusion of glucose. High infusion rates indicate good insulin sensitivity, while low infusion rates indicate insulin resistance (IR).; (5) homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), which uses fand is calculated as (glucose mmol/L x insulin)/22.5, with a relatively low score indicating well regulated fasting glucose that is being maintained through relatively low concentrations of insulin, hence good insulin sensitivity, whereas an elevated HOMA-IR value, such as > 2.5 indicates IR. In the updated homoeostatic model, HOMA2-IR, values > 1.5 suggest IR; (6) HOMA-β is a measure of β cell function derived from fasting values using the equation (20 x insulin)/(glucose mmol/L−3.5) %, with this measure indicating the extent to which a deficient β cell function, as opposed to IR, contributes to hyperglycaemia in the fasting state; (7) Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI), which is an index of insulin sensitivity, calculated as QUICKI = 1/(log (fasting plasma insulin µU/ml) + log (fasting blood glucose mg/dL)).

### Insulin sensitivity and albuminuria: the RISC study [^114fjrvC]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Accumulating evidence suggests an association between insulin sensitivity and albuminuria, which, even in the normal range, is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. We evaluated whether insulin sensitivity is associated with albuminuria in healthy subjects.

Research Design and Methods

We investigated 1,415 healthy, nondiabetic participants (mean age 43.9 ± 8.3 years; 54.3% women) from the RISC (Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease) study, of whom 852 participated in a follow-up examination after 3 years. At baseline, insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, expressed as the M/I value. Oral glucose tolerance test-based insulin sensitivity (OGIS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were determined at baseline and follow-up.

Results

Microalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g) was present in fewer than 2% at either study visit. After multivariate adjustments, there was no cross-sectional association between UACR and any measure of insulin sensitivity. Neither OGIS nor HOMA-IR was significantly associated with follow-up UACR, but in a multivariate regression analysis, baseline M/I emerged as an independent predictor of UACR at follow-up (β-coefficient -0.14; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

In healthy middle-aged adults, reduced insulin sensitivity, assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, is continuously associated with a greater risk of increasing albuminuria. This finding suggests that reduced insulin sensitivity either is simply related to or might causally contribute to the initial pathogenesis of albuminuria.

Type 2 diabetes remission — complications and insulin resistance consensus states that preventing the long-term known microvascular and macrovascular complications related to diabetes are paramount in managing T2D, even in the absence of remission; insulin resistance can be measured using HOMA-beta (homeostatic model assessment for assessing beta-cell function) and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for assessing insulin resistance) to assess progress with therapy and to define expectations; and remission of T2D is accompanied by reversal or improvement of insulin resistance.

### Assessment of insulin resistance in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^1137HA4Z]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether serum levels of potential markers could detect insulin resistance (IR) in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Methods

Serum levels of fasting glucose, insulin, intact proinsulin, resistin, and adiponectin were measured in 50 women with PCOS and known homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR values (≥ 2 indicating IR). The women were all younger than 25 years.

Results

Of the 50 women, 49 had undetectable levels of resistin, 50 had intact proinsulin levels within the normal range, and 50 had adiponectin levels of 8.4 ± 3.3 mg/L, just below the normal range. When groups were compared, however, the 26 women (52%) with IR (HOMA-IR values ≥ 2) had significantly higher intact proinsulin levels (3.2 ± 2.0 pmol/L vs 1.8 ± 1.0 pmol/L; P < 0.005) and significantly lower adiponectin levels (7.2 ± 2.9 mg/L vs 9.7 ± 3.3 mg/L; P < 0.01), than the 24 women (48%) without IR.

Conclusion

Serum levels of intact proinsulin, resistin, or adiponectin were not detectors of IR in individual young women with PCOS.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^114tVouw]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Ethics approval was obtained from the South East Wales Local Research Ethics Committee, and the study complied with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave written informed consent. A comparison of measurements from different insulin assays in 150 samples from fasting (n = 99) and nonfasting subjects to reflect the range for insulin in patients with diabetes has been published previously.

Fasting subjects (n = 99), not stratified by age or sex, were recruited over 12-weeks with two excluded as their glucose results at the time of the study did not match designated glycemic status. Participants with type 2 diabetes were either being seen for a routine clinic appointment or diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test. Those with pre-diabetes or normoglycemia were identified from patient records or with the oral glucose tolerance test.

Blood samples were collected from fasting subjects, aged 18–75 years, either nondiabetic (n = 12; 12%), with pre-diabetes, i.e. impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (n = 18; 19%), or with type 2 diabetes (n = 67; 69%) defined by the 1999 World Health Organization criteria. Patients requiring insulin treatment or known to be insulin antibody–positive were excluded. Anonymized demographic data were collected.

### Dietary interventions to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with a goal of remission: an expert consensus statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^116aKUsS]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission — expert consensus definition and historical criteria are detailed as follows: Remission was defined as HbA1c < 6.5% for at least 3 months with no surgery, devices, or active pharmacologic therapy for the specific purpose of lowering blood glucose. The 2021 ADA consensus similarly defined remission as a return of HbA1c to < 6.5% (< 48 mmol/mol) that persists for at least 3 months in the absence of usual glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy. Historical categorizations included "partial" remission (HbA1c not diagnostic of diabetes [< 6.5%], fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dl [5.6–6.9 mmol/l]) and "complete" remission (HbA1c < 5.7%, fasting glucose < 100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l]), each requiring at least 1 year's duration; "prolonged" remission lasted more than 5 years. Earlier ABCD/PCDS criteria required confirmation on two occasions separated by at least 6 months and complete cessation of all glucose-lowering therapies, but the panel did not consider "weight loss" to be a necessary criterion. The panel recommended that remission should be deemed a realistic and achievable goal for many adults with T2D using diet as a primary intervention, while noting remission may be harder to achieve in long-standing disease (8 years or more). The panel reached consensus that insulin resistance can be measured using HOMA-beta and HOMA-IR to assess progress with therapy and to define expectations.

### Thyroid functions and insulin resistance in pregnant Sudanese women [^1142kCaR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of insulin resistance by homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)

Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) is a method for assessing β-cell function and peripheral insulin resistance from fasting insulin and fasting glucose concentrations. Matthews et al. first used HOMA-IR to assess IR. It is a mathematical model for assessing insulin resistance.

The HOMA-IR equation is as follows:

Fasting plasma glucose [mg/dL] × fasting insulin [µU/mL] / 405.

The physiological value of the index was 1.0. Higher values are indicative of insulin resistance. Low HOMA-IR indicates good insulin sensitivity. A small amount of insulin is sufficient to maintain glucose homeostasis, while a higher HOMA-IR denotes more IR. The healthy IR range is 0.5–1.4; < 1.0 indicates optimal insulin sensitivity; > 1.9 indicates early IR; and > 2.9 indicates significant IR.

Sample size calculation

A sample size of 127 women was calculated depending on the significant minimum level (0.25) for correlations between the serum insulin, glucose levels, and thyroid function hormones (TSH, FT3, and FT4) variables. This sample had 80% power and a difference of 5% at α = 0.05.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science software for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA, version 22.0). All Continuous variables were checked for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous data were expressed as median (interquartile range), as they were not normally distributed. Spearman's correlation was used to investigate the correlation between HOMA-IR score, insulin levels, plasma glucose, and thyroid profile. A Spearman's correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination were reported. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.

### Biological variation of homeostasis model assessment-derived insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes [^113jAzMc]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Individuals with type 2 diabetes are particularly vulnerable to cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance is a major determinant of this increased risk and is a potential therapeutic target. This study was undertaken to establish the natural biological variation of insulin resistance in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

The biological variation of insulin resistance was assessed by measuring insulin resistance at 4-day intervals on 10 consecutive occasions in 12 postmenopausal women with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes and in 11 weight- and age-matched postmenopausal women without type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance was derived using the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) method.

Results

The distribution of HOMA-IR was log Gaussian in the type 2 diabetic study group and Gaussian in the control group. The HOMA-IR in the type 2 diabetic group was significantly greater than that of the control group (mean ± SD: 4.33 ± 2.3 vs. 2.11 ± 0.79 units, P = 0.001). After accounting for analytical variation, the mean intraindividual variation was also substantially greater in the type 2 diabetic group than in the control group (mean 1.05 vs. 0.15, P = 0.001). Consequently, at any level of HOMA-IR, a subsequent sample must increase by > 90% or decrease by > 47% to be considered significantly different from the first.

Conclusions

HOMA-IR is significantly greater and more variable for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, this inherent variability needs to be accounted for in studies evaluating therapeutic reduction of HOMA-IR in this group.

### Limited value of the homeostasis model assessment to predict insulin resistance in older men with impaired glucose tolerance [^113w1p8f]. Diabetes Care (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Insulin resistance (IR) in older individuals is associated with risk factors for coronary artery disease. The glucose clamp measures IR directly, but the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of IR, referred to here as HOMA-IR, is based on fasting glucose and insulin and is less invasive and labor intensive. This method requires validation in the elderly.

Research Design and Methods

We assessed the validity of HOMA-IR as an index of IR by comparing it to glucose infusion rates (GIRs) measured by a glucose clamp (600 pmol x m(-2) x min(-1)) in 45 obese men (61 ± 8 years of age, mean ± SD) with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (n = 21) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (n = 24). We also evaluated relationships between body composition, exercise capacity, and IR.

Results

Subjects with NGT had lower BMI (28 ± 3 vs. 31 ± 3 kg/m2), waist circumference (97 ± 9 vs. 105 ± 9 cm), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (0.93 ± 0.06 vs. 0.97 ± 0.05), and percent body fat (25 ± 6 vs. 30 ± 6) than subjects with IGT. Subjects with NGT also had lower areas above basal during the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test for glucose (274 ± 95 vs. 419 ± 124 mmol x min/l) and insulin (38,142 ± 18,206 vs. 58,383 ± 34,408 pmol x min/l) and lower HOMA-IR values (2.2 ± 0.8 vs. 4.2 ± 2.6) than subjects with IGT. GIR (micromol x kg(-1) FFM x min(-1)) was higher in subjects with NGT than in subjects with IGT (53 ± 11 vs. 43 ± 14). HOMA-IR correlated with GIR in subjects with NGT (r = -0.59), but not in subjects with IGT (r = -0.13). GIR correlated with VO2max in subjects with NGT (r = 0.58) and IGT (r = 0.42), but with WHR only in subjects with NGT (r = -0.53). HOMA-IR correlated with VO2max (r = -0.57) and waist circumference (r = 0.54) in subjects with NGT, but with percent body fat in subjects with IGT (r = 0.54).

Conclusions

These findings indicate that HOMA-IR should not be used as an index of IR in older individuals who may be at risk for IGT, and suggest that lifestyle changes that increase VO2max and decrease body fat may reduce IR in older people.

### Utility of homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function in predicting diabetes in 12, 924 healthy Koreans [^1136H244]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) is an index of insulin secretory function derived from fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. It has been used to predict diabetes development in nondiabetic individuals in four studies, and the conclusion in each instance was that a decrease in insulin secretory function, as estimated by HOMA-β, predicted the development of diabetes and/or impaired glucose tolerance. However, because it was also shown in these studies that baseline glucose concentration was higher in individuals who developed diabetes, it could be argued that the lower values for HOMA-β may only be reflecting the difference in glucose concentration. The current analysis was initiated to see if HOMA-β provided a more sensitive assessment of the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes than did knowledge of individual fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations.

### Comparison between HOMA-IR and ISI-gly in detecting subjects with the metabolic syndrome [^113xZbHT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

To verify whether, as index of insulin resistance, ISI-gly (insulin sensitivity index) is more efficient than HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment) or QUICKI (quantitative insulin sensitivity check index) in detecting patients with the metabolic syndrome.

Methods

Excluding patients with known diabetes, endocrine, liver and kidney diseases, we enrolled 553 subjects who were screened for metabolic abnormalities. After 5 days of a balanced weight maintenance diet, we performed an OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) and measured fasting and 2-h postload blood sugar and insulin, from which we calculated ISI-gly, HOMA-IR and QUICKI, stratifying patients in tertiles. Statistical comparisons were performed for a number of metabolic variables between tertiles of the same index, as well as between tertiles of different indexes presumably expressing identical insulin resistance.

Results

All variables reflecting the metabolic syndrome were significantly more altered in the top as compared to the intermediate and the lowest tertile for HOMA-IR, the opposite for ISI-gly. Comparing homologous measurements of the top tertile of HOMA-IR with the lowest tertile of ISI-gly (presumably expressing identical insulin resistance), fasting glucose and insulin were significantly higher, while 2-h OGTT values were significantly lower. The opposite occurred comparing the lowest HOMA-IR to the highest ISI-gly tertile, the diagnostic predictive values of the latter in detecting metabolic derangements being also higher. Data from QUICKI 1st to 3rd tertiles exactly matched those obtained from HOMA-IR 3rd to 1st tertile.

Conclusions

ISI-gly, which includes postload glucose and insulin concentrations, provides a more accurate estimate of whole-body insulin sensitivity than HOMA-IR or QUICKI, derived from fasting measurements only, thus constituting a more sensitive tool for screening and preventing metabolic abnormalities.

### Identification of individuals with insulin resistance using routine clinical measurements [^112Q5gH9]. Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Insulin resistance is a treatable precursor of diabetes and potentially of cardiovascular disease as well. To identify insulin-resistant patients, we developed decision rules from measurements of obesity, fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, and blood pressure and family history in 2,321 (2,138 nondiabetic) individuals studied with the euglycemic insulin clamp technique at 17 European sites; San Antonio, Texas; and the Pima Indian reservation. The distribution of whole-body glucose disposal appeared to be bimodal, with an optimal insulin resistance cutoff of < 28 micromol/min. kg lean body mass. Using recursive partitioning, we developed three types of classification tree models: the first, based on clinical measurements and all available laboratory determinations, had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (aROC) of 90.0% and generated a simple decision rule: diagnose insulin resistance if any of the following conditions are met: BMI > 28.9 kg/m(2), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) > 4.65, or BMI > 27.5 kg/m(2) and HOMA-IR > 3.60. The fasting serum insulin concentrations corresponding to these HOMA-IR cut points were 20.7 and 16.3 microU/ml, respectively. This rule had a sensitivity and specificity of 84.9 and 78.7%, respectively. The second model, which included clinical measurements but no laboratory determinations, had an aROC of 85.0% and generated a decision rule that had a sensitivity and specificity of 78.7 and 79.6%, respectively. The third model, which included clinical measurements and lipid measurements but not insulin (and thus excluded HOMA-IR as well), had a similar aROC (85.1%), sensitivity (81.3%), and specificity (76.3%). Thus, insulin-resistant individuals can be identified using simple decision rules that can be tailored to specific needs.

### Effects of weight loss and insulin reduction on arterial stiffness in the SAVE trial [^116pxFWV]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

In a separate model, we adjusted for SAVE intervention assignment; however, the randomized treatment had no effect on the reported relationships and is not reported here. In sensitivity analyses, we reassessed each model of PWV with HOMA-IR change as a predictor in place of insulin change, and found insulin levels to be a stronger predictor of changes in PWV than HOMA-IR. All models presented in this paper report changes in insulin levels. Insulin is reported as the primary predictor because it explained more of the variance in PWV measures than HOMA-IR in the SAVE trial of individual with fasting glucose levels within the normal range. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software release 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC).

### Changes in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in relation to the glycemic outcomes in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance in the Indian diabetes prevention programme-1 (IDPP-1) [^1153o24d]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Plasma glucose was measured using the glucose-oxidase peroxidase method on a Hitachi autoanalyzer 912 with the reagents supplied by Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). A1C was estimated by the immunoturbidimetric method (Roche Reagents). The cutoff value for normal was 6.0%.

Plasma insulin was measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy). The assay had a sensitivity of < 24 pmol/l, and the intra- and interassay coefficient of variations were < 10%. Insulin resistance was calculated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). The insulinogenic index (ΔI/G) was calculated using the difference in the values of 30-min and fasting plasma insulin (picomoles per liter) divided by the 30-min glucose value (millimoles per liter). Cutoff values for normal HOMA-IR were < 4.1 and ≥ 28 for ΔI/G.

The relative risk reduction in the incidence of diabetes compared with that in the control group was similar in the three intervention groups. Hence, the present analysis was done in the control group versus all intervention groups combined.

All of the relevant data for this analysis were available for 437 subjects of the 502 subjects followed up for a median of 30 months. Comparative analyses of baseline and 3rd-year data were done for subjects with NGT and IGT. For the diabetic group, the baseline data were compared with the corresponding values recorded at the time of diagnosis of diabetes. The numbers of subjects with NGT, IGT, and diabetes were 93, 150, and 194, respectively.

Variables included in the analysis were BMI, waist circumference, plasma glucose, plasma insulin values (0, 30, and 120 min during an OGTT), HOMA-IR values, and ΔI/G. These baseline variables in the subgroup of 437 analyzed were similar to those of the original cohort of 531 subjects. The differences at the 3rd year from the baseline value were calculated. Data were computed for control and intervention groups.

Changes in plasma glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and ΔI/G were analyzed annually in the total group (control and intervention) in relation to their glucose tolerance status. In addition, annual HOMA-IR and ΔI/G were compared with the respective baseline values for each intervention group.

### HOMA indices as screening tests for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes [^1126iU4x]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We assessed the diagnostic performances of homeostasis model assessment indices (HOMA) of β-cell function (HOMA-%β) and of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) for cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) screening.

Methods

Data were collected from a prospective cohort of 228 patients with CF (117 adults and 111 children). Fasting insulin and glucose levels were measured to calculate HOMA-%β and HOMA-IR. HOMA-%β < 100 indicated insulin secretion deficiency and HOMA-IR > 1 insulin resistance. Both were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV). Two-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (2h-OGTT) defined CFRD. Analyses were conducted separately for children and adults. Performances of HOMA-%β and HOMA-IR were calculated at inclusion, for each year of follow-up and for pooled data over the follow-up period.

Results

Sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV were respectively: 88%, 45%, 98% and 11% for HOMA-%β and 42%, 48%, 91% and 6% for HOMA-IR in the pooled data of children; and 83%, 18%, 90% and 10% for HOMA-%β, and 39%, 80%, 92% and 18% for HOMA-IR in the pooled data of adults. Combining HOMA-%β and HOMA-IR did not improve performances.

Conclusion

Within both age groups, HOMA-%β < 100 provided good sensitivity and NPV. HOMA-IR > 1 had low sensitivity. Calculation of the HOMA-%β could be an interesting first-line screening approach to exclude CFRD and thus avoid unnecessary OGTT in patients for whom value is ≥ 100. However, HOMA-%β < 100 does not support the diagnosis of CFRD and should be complemented by OGTT.

### Utility of homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function in predicting diabetes in 12, 924 healthy Koreans [^111qt88X]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In contrast to other studies, we did not find a lower HOMA-β to be associated with the development of diabetes when individuals had relatively similar glucose concentrations. Indeed, if anything, individuals who developed diabetes tended to have higher HOMA-β, reflecting the inadequacies of the HOMA-β calculation.

In an attempt to understand this fundamental disparity between the current findings and previous studies, we believe it useful to begin by examining the basis of the HOMA-β calculation. The HOMA calculation is derived from a computer-solved model that assumes certain relationships between basal plasma glucose and insulin concentration. Although values of both fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are used to solve the equation, the degree of glycemia is often the major determinant. In Table 1, for example, as glucose increases, insulin concentrations also increase, but HOMA-β declines. In fact, for individuals with IFG-110 to have similar HOMA-β as individuals with NFG, insulin concentrations would have to be ∼120 pmol/l or double the actual insulin concentration.

When examined in this light, it is easy to see why our results differ from others. There have been four prospective studies that have evaluated the role of HOMA-β in predicting diabetes. They all concluded that a lower HOMA-β was predictive of future diabetes. In three of the studies that provided results by diabetes status, baseline glucose was also higher in individuals who developed diabetes. In one of the studies, the baseline glucose was only different by 0.5 mmol/l, and the baseline HOMA-β was not significantly different. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, HOMA-β also did not predict the development of diabetes when adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio (odds ratio 0.93 [95% CI 0.69–1.26]). However, when they added HOMA-IR to the model, HOMA-β became significant (0.34 [0.21–0.55]). The authors therefore concluded that a higher HOMA-β was protective against the development of diabetes and emphasized the importance of adjusting for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) when evaluating insulin secretion. While this has biological basis, it should be noted that HOMA-IR and insulin concentration were nearly perfectly correlated (r = 0.98); therefore, adding HOMA-IR to the model merely adjusts for insulin concentration and isolates the effect of glucose concentration on diabetes risk.

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^113ypTFk]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated how beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity or resistance are affected by the type of blood sample collected or choice of insulin assay and homeostatis model assessment (HOMA) calculator (http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk).

Research Design and Methods

Insulin was measured using 11 different assays in serum and 1 assay in heparinized plasma. Fasting subjects with normoglycemia (n = 12), pre-diabetes, i.e., impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance (n = 18), or type 2 diabetes (n = 67) were recruited. Patients treated with insulin or those who were insulin antibody-positive were excluded. HOMA estimates were calculated using specific insulin (SI) or radioimmunoassay (RIA) calculators (version 2.2).

Results

All glucose values were within model (HOMA) limits but not all insulin results, as 4.3% were < 20 pmol/l and 1% were > 300 pmol/l. beta-Cell function derived from different insulin assays ranged from 67 to 122% (median) for those with normoglycemia (P = 0.026), from 89 to 138% for those with pre-diabetes (P = 0.990), and from 50 to 81% for those with type 2 diabetes (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, insulin resistance ranged from 0.8 to 2.0 (P = 0.0007), from 1.9 to 3.2 (P = 0.842), and from 1.5 to 2.9 (P < 0.0001), respectively. This twofold variation in HOMA estimates from the various insulin assays studied in serum may be significant metabolically. Insulin was 15% lower in heparinized plasma (used in the original HOMA study) compared with serum, which is now more commonly used. beta-Cell function differed by 11% and insulin resistance by 15% when estimates derived from specific insulin were calculated using the RIA rather than the SI calculator.

Conclusions

To enable comparison of HOMA estimates among individuals and different research studies, preanalytical factors and calculator selection should be standardized with insulin assays traceable to an insulin reference method procedure.

### Insulin resistance determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) and associations with metabolic syndrome among Chinese children and teenagers [^116Ya8Tv]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The correlation between HOMA-IR and M-clamp had been validated in diverse adult populations. Furthermore, two studies have described the pediatric information on its validation about clamps. Although it is more difficult to define HOMA-IR cut-off points for diagnosis of insulin resistance in youths than that in adults due to lack of longitudinal evidence in youths for risk prediction of cardiovascular outcomes, there were a few studies on HOMA-IR utility in pediatric populations and some methods for defining cutoff values of HOMA-IR. In most studies, cut-off points for diagnosis of insulin resistance have been defined based on HOMA-IR distribution in reference population. Values based on the 95th percentile, lower boundary of the top quintile ortertile of HOMA-IR obtained from population studies or non-obese subjects with no metabolic disorders have been used previously. In other studies, presence of pediatric MS, as a risk for future CVD, also has been considered for defining cut-off values of HOMA-IR by using ROC statistical method. Youden index and the distance from the top left corner of the ROC curve are two methods commonly used in previous work to determine the best HOMA-IR cut-off. In our study, the present HOMA-IR cutoff point corresponding to the 95th percentile of our healthy reference children was 3.0 for whole referent and 2.6 for children in prepubertal stage and 3.2 in pubertal period, respectively. The optimal point for diagnosis of MS was 2.3 in total referent, 1.7 in prepubertal stage and 2.6 in pubertal period in ROC curve analysis.

### Defining the optimum HOMA-IR cut-off value for insulin resistance among ARV-treated HIV patients in Indonesia [^116ngGPA]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

HIV-infected patients who are treated with anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs are prone to develop insulin resistance. This study aims to determine the cut-off value of HOMA-IR score in ARV-treated HIV patients in Indonesia.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 234 adults with HIV who received ARV therapy in HIV Integrated Care Unit of Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National General Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. The duration of HIV diagnosis, duration of ARV therapy, metabolic syndrome status, and calculated HOMA-IR were obtained in this study. HOMA-IR cut-off point was calculated using ROC curve analysis, along with the specificity, sensitivity and likelihood ratio (LR).

Results

Among 234 subjects, 58% of subjects were on second-line ARV therapy. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 23.9%. The obtained HOMA-IR cut-off value was 2.705 with sensitivity and specificity approaching 70%, PPV 40.9%, NPV 87.6%, with positive LR of 2.15 and negative LR of 0.48. The insulin resistance prediction from the obtained HOMA-IR cut-off value was at moderate strength. Based on this cut-off value, 39.7% of the subjects experienced insulin resistance.

Conclusions

Using the new proposed HOMA-IR cut-off point for HIV patient in Indonesia, the prevalence of insulin resistance among HIV-infected patients treated with ARV in Indonesia using optimum HOMA-IR cut-off value of 2.705 was 39.7%.

### Measuring and estimating insulin resistance in clinical and research settings [^114GmW5Y]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Cutoff values for surrogate fasting indexes

Among the best predictors of peripheral IR measured with the clamp (M values) are fasting glucose and plasma insulin concentrations, BMI, waist circumference, and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Fasting glucose and plasma insulin are used in many surrogate fasting indexes (Table 2). The most used is the HOMA‐IR index that was first proposed in 1985 and then updated in 1998. Stern et al. analyzed a large cohort (2,138 without and 193 with diabetes) studied with a 40 mU/min·m 2 EHC and defined presence of IR if any of the following conditions were met: (1) HOMA‐IR > 4.65, (2) BMI > 28.9 kg/m 2, or (3) HOMA‐IR > 3.60 and BMI > 27.5 kg/m 2. Tam et al. analyzed White participants (116 without and 51 with diabetes) studied with a 120 mU/min·m 2 EHC and defined presence of IR if HOMA‐IR > 5.9 or if HOMA‐IR > 2.8 when high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) < 51 mg/dL. Isokuortti et al. determined that HOMA‐IR > 2.0 identified participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This low cutoff for HOMA‐IR also defined IR in studies on general populations involving both Caucasian and Asian participants.

### Insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome in a Chinese population [^112eUJQs]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Our study aimed to investigate glucose and lipid level as well as insulin resistance (IR) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Methods

In a case-control study, 426 patients with PCOS were diagnosed according to Rotterdam criteria, and they were conducted in the morning after a 10-h fast. Participants received standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Plasma glucose and insulin levels were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. They also received the lipid evaluation; 95 healthy women with normal menstrual cycles served as controls. Thus, by modifying the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with the use of individual time-course values of glucose and insulin plasma levels, we developed a new assessment method, HOMA-Mx.

Results

In our study, 23.71% of patients had abnormal glucose metabolism. With further impairment in glucose metabolism, the glucose and lipid level gradually increased (P < 0.05), while the impaired glucose regulation (IGR) group showed greater insulin response than a type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) group. Compared with healthy controls, both lean and obese PCOS patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) had a higher body mass index (BMI), and higher serum glucose, insulin, and lipid values. Additionally, the insulin value peaked at 30 min and 60 min in the lean and obese groups, respectively. HOMA-M30 proved to be the best predictive parameter (cutoff: 20.36, area under the curve [AUC]: 0.753) for assessment of IR in normal-weight patients and HOMA-IR (cutoff: 32.17, AUC: 0.868) was optimal in obese PCOS patients.

Conclusions

A new assessment method was developed for these groups: HOMA-M30 for lean PCOS patients and HOMA-M60 for obese patients, in order to focus on peak insulin values for early detection of IR.

### Utility of current obesity thresholds in signaling diabetes risk in the james bay cree of eeyou istchee [^116pgyou]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Our analyses are limited by their cross-sectional nature; in an ideal study, potential thresholds would be examined in terms of ability to predict the development of prediabetes and diabetes. Given the limitations of the available data, we opted to use an HOMA-IR above 2 as the diabetes risk indicator against which current obesity thresholds were evaluated, and performed a sensitivity analysis using an HOMA-IR of above 2.7. Although the HOMA IR has been extensively tested against other measures of insulin resistance, it is a surrogate marker, and there may be differences between the assays used to derive the HOMA IR equation and the assays of insulin resistance used in our study. However, at the HOMA-IR of > 2, there is a clinically important increase in odds of prediabetes or diabetes, as confirmed by our logistic regression analyses (see online supplementary table S1).

### Differences in homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) values and insulin levels after vitamin D supplementation in healthy men: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^115XTvAY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is thought to play a role in glucose metabolism. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on markers of insulin sensitivity and inflammation in men without diabetes with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. In this 1-year double-blind randomized controlled trial, 130 men aged 20–65 years (mean age 47.52 ± 11.84 years) with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels < 50 nmol/l (mean 38.89 ± 8.64 nmol/l) were randomized to treatment (100 000 IU vitamin D bimonthly) or placebo. Anthropometric measurements, demographic questionnaires, and blood indices (fasting glucose, insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipids) were collected and repeated after 6 and 12 months. The compliance rate was 98.5%. Multivariate models, adjusted for baseline levels, age, body mass index, sun exposure, physical activity and LDL, showed significant differences in insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values between groups. Levels of insulin and HOMA-IR values remained steady during the study period in the treatment group but increased by 16% in the control group (p = 0.038 and p = 0.048, respectively). Vitamin D supplementation administered for 12 months in healthy men maintained insulin levels and HOMA-IR values relative to the increase in the control group. Further studies are needed to establish the long-term effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of diabetes.

### Metabolic risk and health behaviors in minority youth at risk for type 2 diabetes [^115Lt7xR]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Metabolic measures

Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed with a standard glucose load (1.75 g glucose/kg body wt up to a maximum of 75 g) (Trutol 100; NERL Diagnostics, East Providence, RI). Insulin resistance was estimated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) using the equation, HOMA-IR = fasting insulin (microunits per milliliter) × fasting glucose (millimoles per liter)/22.5. A value > 2.2 is indicative of insulin resistance. Fasting A1C levels were determined using the DCA 2000 Analyzer (Bayer, Tarrytown, NY). The normal range is < 6.5%. Lipids, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured (Cholestech LDX system; Cholestech, Hayward, CA). LDL cholesterol was calculated using the formula, LDL cholesterol = (total cholesterol − HDL cholesterol) − (triglycerides/5). Those who had laboratory values within the prediabetes range were referred to their primary care providers for further evaluation and follow-up.

### Insulin resistance predicts progression of de novo atherosclerotic plaques in patients with coronary heart disease: a one-year follow-up study [^114AmdB2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Laboratory studies and the assessment of insulin resistance

After fasting for 12 hours, blood samples were drawn from the patients at 8 AM, including both fasting glucose and insulin concentration, HbA1c, hsCRP, liver function tests, lipid panel, BUN, creatinine and urine acid. In addition, OGTT and insulin concentrations were also obtained 2 hours after oral ingestion of 75 mg glucose by the central lab in the hospital without the knowledge of the study. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m 2). We estimated insulin resistance by using the homeostasis model assessment index of IR (HOMA-IR) developed by Mathew, which was believed to have a close correlation with euglycemic clamp for use in cross-sectional studies. We used the following formula HOMA-IR = baseline insulin concentration (U/mL) × baseline glucose concentration (mmol/L)/ 22.5. We obtained HOMA-IR values from 284 individuals and subsequently defined the cutoff value for insulin resistance as the upper quartile of HOMA-IR obtained from all the subjects involved in the study, which equals 3.458 in our study. Also glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated by adopting the Cockcroft-Gault equation (for men: (140 − age × weight)/(72 × serum creatinine); for women: (140 − age × weight) / (72 × serum creatinine × 0.85)).

### Exercise and insulin resistance markers in children and adolescents with excess weight… [^115GbN8R]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

A, Fasting glucose. B, Fasting insulin. C, HOMA-IR. The size of the nodes is proportional to the number of participants randomized to each intervention, and nodes are colored according to the proportion of studies with low, moderate, and high indirectness. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. Results. The effect size of HOMA-IR increased when we analyzed participants with levels of 3. 16 or greater at baseline. A small-study effect size was observed for fasting glucose and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance, but not for fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. Similarly, for HOMA-IR, a minimal exercise dosage of approximately 1200 MET-min/wk was required to achieve the identified MD of −0.
87. Higher doses continued to contribute to marker improvements. After studies that included children and adolescents with a HOMA-IR of 3. 16 or greater were selected, 79 this dose response significantly increased. Furthermore, the NMA estimates suggested that aerobic training, concurrent training, HIIT, and HIIT/resistance training substantially diminished HOMA-IR levels compared with the control intervention. We considered a meaningful clinical difference in fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR to be −0. 28 mg/dL, −4. 38 μU/mL, and −0. 87, respectively, based on MDs observed in traditional meta-analyses. Overall, only 2 of 15 comparisons for fasting glucose, 5 of 15 for fasting insulin, and 4 of 15 were considered to have a high confidence rating.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on oral glucose tolerance among obese adolescents… [^1129vREX]. ClinicalTrials (2013). Low credibility.

Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Oral Glucose Tolerance Among Obese AdolescentsClinicalTrials. gov ID. The investigators' prior studies have shown that daily 4, 000 IU vitamin D therapy is a safe and effective method of improving insulin resistance based on a calculation called the HOMA-IR. The next step in identifying whether vitamin D truly improves insulin resistance is to use oral glucose tolerance testing, which is a better real-life measure of insulin resistance compared to the previously used HOMA-IR. They will have an IV placed in the arm by a nurse experienced with working with children. The subjects will have blood drawn from the IV checking for vitamin D level, insulin, glucose, and c-peptide level. The subject will then be asked to drink a 75 gram glucose solution. Additional blood will be drawn from the IV site to check for glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes.

A total of 30 mL of blood will be drawn that day. The subject will have the IV removed and will be discharged to then take two 2, 000 IU vitamin D3 pills daily for six months.

### Identifying metabolic syndrome in African American… [^1136ZFAy]. stacks.cdc.gov (2011). Low credibility.

Identifying Metabolic Syndrome in African American Children Using Fasting HOMA-IR in Place of Glucose Supporting Files Public Domain Apr 15 2011 File Language: English. Details Journal Article: Preventing Chronic Disease Personal Author: Description: Introduction Metabolic syndrome is increasing among young people. We compared the use of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance with the use of fasting blood glucose to identify MetS in African American children. Results We found that HOMA-IR is a stronger indicator of MetS in children than blood glucose. Using HOMA-IR as 1 of the 5 components, we found a 38% prevalence of MetS in this sample of African American children and the proportion of false negatives decreased from 94% with blood glucose alone to 13% with HOMA-IR. The prevalence of MetS was higher in obese than overweight children and higher among girls than boys.

Conclusion Using HOMA-IR was preferred to fasting blood glucose because insulin resistance was more significantly interrelated with the other 4 MetS components.
