## Question

What are the common causes of primary thrombocytosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common causes of primary thrombocytosis, with explicit reasoning steps and self-verification language preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining primary thrombocytosis and distinguishing it from secondary causes. Then, I should verify the major disease categories that account for primary thrombocytosis. Next, I will examine the molecular drivers and their frequencies. After that, I need to check the role of bone marrow morphology and diagnostic criteria. I will then consider special populations such as children and familial cases. Finally, I should review epidemiology and synthesize a concise, prioritized list of the most common causes with supporting data [^112k81Zq] [^115Xrj6g].

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate entities. Primary thrombocytosis refers to clonal, autonomous overproduction of platelets, most commonly due to myeloproliferative neoplasms, and must be differentiated from secondary (reactive) thrombocytosis and spurious counts; the diagnostic threshold for sustained thrombocytosis in essential thrombocythemia is platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L, and clonality is typically established by driver mutations or marrow features when mutations are absent [^112k81Zq] [^1121uisV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the major disease categories. The predominant causes of primary thrombocytosis are the Philadelphia chromosome–negative myeloproliferative neoplasms: essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis, with ET being the archetypal platelet-predominant disorder; rare hereditary forms also exist and should be considered in young patients or those with family history [^114YVDNR] [^1141UaUZ].

> I will now examine the molecular drivers, because they anchor modern diagnosis. JAK2 V617F is the most frequent mutation across MPNs, present in about 55–60% of ET, 95–98% of PV, and 55–65% of PMF; CALR mutations account for roughly 20–25% of ET and PMF; MPL W515L/K accounts for about 3–4% of ET and 6–7% of PMF; importantly, these driver mutations are largely mutually exclusive, and about 10–15% of ET cases are triple-negative, necessitating marrow morphology for classification [^112k81Zq] [^114L4rPN] [^1138kUKN] [^115dDsfD].

> Wait, let me verify the role of morphology because molecular testing alone is insufficient. Bone marrow examination is required to distinguish ET from prefibrotic PMF and other myeloid neoplasms; ET typically shows age-appropriate cellularity with increased mature-appearing megakaryocytes in loose clusters and minimal reticulin, whereas prefibrotic PMF shows hypercellularity with atypical megakaryocytes and often higher JAK2 allele burden, which can mislead if morphology is not integrated with molecular data [^1121uisV] [^117FNaus] [^1138kUKN].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In children, primary thrombocytosis is rare and most cases are reactive; when clonal disease is present, JAK2/CALR/MPL frequencies differ and pediatric-specific guidance emphasizes rigorous exclusion of secondary causes before diagnosing ET, with some reports noting spontaneous remissions that complicate classification and caution against overtreatment [^1128Rs92] [^114uHrPC] [^114BiGYv]. Familial thrombocytosis can result from germline mutations in THPO, MPL, or JAK2 and should be suspected in young patients with a family history or early-onset disease, prompting targeted genetic evaluation [^1141UaUZ] [^115oeen5].

> I should double-check epidemiology to contextualize "common". ET has an incidence around 1.1–2.0 per 100,000 person-years, PV around 0.5–4.0, and PMF around 0.3–2.0; ET comprises roughly one third of MPNs and is the most frequent cause of clonal thrombocytosis, with median survival often exceeding 18–20 years and even longer in younger patients, underscoring its indolent nature relative to PMF [^113xeG5h] [^112k81Zq] [^114Tr8Tr].

> But wait, what if thrombocytosis is the first clue to another MPN phenotype? Isolated thrombocytosis can be the initial manifestation of PV or prefibrotic PMF, and distinguishing these requires integration of hemoglobin/hematocrit, marrow architecture, and mutation allele burden; higher JAK2 allele burden (> 40%) is uncommon in ET and should prompt reconsideration of masked PV or prefibrotic PMF, which carry different prognoses and management implications [^1138kUKN] [^1121uisV].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy of common causes so the clinical takeaway is clear. The most common cause of primary thrombocytosis is essential thrombocythemia, followed by polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis within the MPN spectrum; collectively, these account for the vast majority of clonal thrombocytosis in adults, with hereditary thrombocytosis representing a smaller but important subset, particularly in younger patients or those with a suggestive pedigree [^114YVDNR] [^1141UaUZ].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is explicit. Evaluation should start with confirmation of persistent thrombocytosis, exclusion of reactive causes, and testing for JAK2, CALR, and MPL; if driver mutations are absent or if the phenotype is atypical, bone marrow biopsy with attention to megakaryocyte morphology and reticulin grading is essential to distinguish ET from prefibrotic PMF and other myeloid neoplasms, aligning with WHO/ICC and NCCN frameworks [^115Xrj6g] [^1135p6CY] [^117FNaus].

Primary thrombocytosis is most commonly due to **myeloproliferative neoplasms** (MPNs), particularly essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) [^114YVDNR]. These clonal disorders are driven by **JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations** [^1121uisV], which lead to autonomous megakaryocyte proliferation and thrombocytosis [^112k81Zq]. Less common causes include hereditary thrombocytosis from germline THPO, MPL, or JAK2 variants [^1141UaUZ] [^115oeen5], and rare cases of triple-negative ET without identifiable driver mutations [^115dDsfD]. Accurate diagnosis requires molecular testing and bone marrow examination to distinguish MPNs from reactive thrombocytosis and other myeloid neoplasms [^115Xrj6g] [^111wX5ew].

## Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs)

MPNs are the **most common cause of primary thrombocytosis**, characterized by clonal hematopoiesis and overproduction of platelets [^114Tr8Tr].

Key characteristics of essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis:

| **Aspect** | **Essential thrombocythemia (ET)** | **Polycythemia vera (PV)** | **Primary myelofibrosis (PMF)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Definition | Clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes causing sustained thrombocytosis (≥ 450×10⁹/L) [^112k81Zq] | Clonal erythroid proliferation with frequent thrombocytosis [^114AKcVC] | Clonal myeloproliferation with marrow fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis [^113UG6fQ] |
| Mutations | JAK2 V617F (~55%), CALR (~20%), MPL (~4%); ~20% are triple-negative [^112k81Zq] [^1121uisV] | JAK2 V617F or exon 12 in ~98% of cases [^117G6xmz] [^111dyEHL] | JAK2, CALR, MPL; additional mutations (ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1/2, SRSF2, TP53) affect prognosis [^114YhLgR] |
| Clinical features | Thrombosis, bleeding, vasomotor symptoms, and risk of progression to myelofibrosis or AML [^112k81Zq] [^115m4yjF] | Erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and high thrombotic risk [^112dALDk] [^116UaRBV] | Anemia, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, and risk of leukemic transformation [^114Tr8Tr] [^111LzkdD] |

---

## Hereditary thrombocytosis

Hereditary thrombocytosis results from **germline mutations** causing increased thrombopoiesis [^1121uisV].

| **Gene** | **Mutation** | **Mechanism** | **Inheritance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| THPO | Promoter mutations | Increased TPO production | Autosomal dominant |
| MPL | Germline mutations | Constitutive TPO receptor signaling | Autosomal dominant |
| JAK2 | Germline variants (e.g. R564Q) | Increased JAK-STAT signaling | Autosomal dominant |

---

These mutations cause **familial thrombocytosis** with polyclonal hematopoiesis and high platelet counts [^115oeen5].

---

## Triple-negative essential thrombocythemia

Triple-negative ET lacks JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations; it is diagnosed by **bone marrow morphology** and exclusion of other causes [^115dDsfD]. Additional mutations (e.g. ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, SF3B1, TP53) may be present and influence disease behavior [^112k81Zq].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Accurate diagnosis requires:

- **Molecular testing**: JAK2, CALR, MPL, BCR-ABL1 to exclude CML [^115dDsfD].
- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Distinguish ET, PV, PMF, and reactive thrombocytosis [^114YVDNR].
- **Exclusion of reactive causes**: Infection, inflammation, iron deficiency, malignancy [^114jAcbW].

---

Primary thrombocytosis is most often due to **MPNs (ET, PV, PMF)** driven by JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations, with hereditary forms and triple-negative ET as less common causes.

### Primary thrombocytosis in children [^1131ih5H]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are uncommon disorders in children, for which we have limited understanding of the pathogenesis and optimal management. JAK2 and MPL mutations, while common drivers of myeloproliferative neoplasms in adult patients, are not clearly linked to pediatric disease. Management and clinical outcomes in adults have been well delineated with defined recommendations for risk stratification and treatment. This is not the case for pediatric patients, for whom there is neither a standard approach to workup nor any consensus regarding management. This review will discuss thrombocytosis in children, including causes of thrombocytosis in children, the limited knowledge we have regarding pediatric primary thrombocytosis, and our thoughts on potential risk stratification and management, and future questions to be answered by laboratory research and collaborative clinical study.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytosis? [^115dVSvN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

### Primary and secondary thrombocytosis in childhood [^1128Rs92]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

This review summarizes current data on the pathomechanisms and clinical aspects of primary and secondary thrombocytosis in childhood. Primary thrombocytosis is extremely rare in childhood, mostly diagnosed at the beginning of the second decade of life. As in adults, the criteria of the Polycythemia Vera Group are appropriate to diagnose primary thrombocytosis. The pathomechansims of non-familial forms are complex and include spontaneous formation of megakaryopoietic progenitors and increased sensitivity to thrombopoietin (Tpo). Familial forms can be caused by mutations in Tpo or Tpo receptor (c-mpl) genes. These mutations result in overexpression of Tpo, sustained intracellular signalling or disturbed regulation of circulating Tpo. Treatment of primary thrombocytosis is not recommended if platelet counts are < 1500/nl and bleeding or thrombosis did not occur in patient's history. In severe cases, decision on treatment should weigh potential risks of treatment options (hydroxyurea, anagrelide) against expected benefits for preventing thrombosis or haemorrhage. Secondary thrombocytosis is frequent in children, in particular in the first decade of life. Hepatic Tpo production is stimulated in acute response reaction to a variety of disorders. Thrombosis prophylaxis is not required, even at platelet counts > 1000/nl, except for cases with additional prothrombotic risk factors.

### Thrombocytosis and thrombosis [^114YVDNR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to discuss current diagnostic approaches to, and classification of, patients presenting with thrombocytosis, in light of novel information derived from the discovery of specific molecular abnormalities in chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD), which represent the most common cause of primary thrombocytosis. The JAK2V617F and the MPLW515L/K mutations have been found in patients with essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis, and less frequently in other myeloproliferative disorders complicated by thrombocytosis. However, neither mutation is disease specific nor is it universally present in patients with elevated platelet counts due to a CMPD; therefore, distinguishing between reactive and primary forms of thrombocytosis, as well as among the different clinical entities that constitute the CMPD, still requires a multifaceted diagnostic approach that includes as a key step the accurate evaluation of bone marrow histology. The role of elevated platelet counts in thrombosis, which represent the predominant complication of CMPD, significantly affecting prognosis and quality of life as well as, paradoxically, in the pathogenesis of the hemorrhagic manifestations, will be discussed. Established and novel potential risk factors for thrombosis, including the clinical relevance of the JAK2V617F mutation, and current management strategies for thrombocytosis are also briefly discussed.

### Primary myelofibrosis and the myeloproliferative neoplasms: the role of individual variation [^114Tr8Tr]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

The classic myeloproliferative neoplasms — essential thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis — are acquired, clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by an overproduction of mature blood cells, bone marrow hypercellularity, extramedullary hematopoiesis, a tendency for thrombosis, and, rarely, leukemic transformation. Despite being classified as neoplastic diseases, the myeloproliferative neoplasms are often characterized by longevity, with survival measured in decades, even in the absence of treatment. Primary myelofibrosis is the rarest of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, is the most obscure with regard to its pathophysiology, and carries the least favorable although highly variable natural history. The identification of molecular lesions specific to the myeloproliferative neoplasms, in particular JAK2 V617F, has broadened understanding of the common features within these disorders and has advanced diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools. This article highlights the challenges inherent in the management of primary myelofibrosis and presents an opportunity to address the basis of individual variation within a rare and complex disorder.

### Management of MPN beyond JAK2 [^111qoYsh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis has a large number of potential underlying causes, but the dominant group of hematological conditions for consideration in this setting are the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In this chapter, we consider several key linked questions relating to the management of thrombocytosis in MPNs and discuss several issues. First, we discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis, which myeloid disorders to consider, and practical approaches to the discrimination of each individual MPN from other causes. Second, there have been several major advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of these conditions and we discuss how these findings are likely to be practically applied in the future. Third, we consider whether there is evidence that thrombocytosis contributes to the complications known to be associated with MPN: thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to leukemia and myelofibrosis. Last, we review current ideas for risk stratification and management of essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera as the 2 entities within the MPN family that are most frequently associated with thrombocytosis.

### Thrombocytosis in the NICU [^114qxXds]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

An elevated platelet count may occur during care of neurology/neurosurgical patients and is usually due to reactive or secondary thrombocytosis (ST) caused by inflammation or infection. Primary (clonal) thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia associated with myeloproliferative disorders is usually known before or during early patient assessment. Rarely, paraneoplastic causes of thrombocytosis may be discovered. Although no single test differentiates primary from secondary etiologies, laboratory tests that show increased acute phase responses, such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6, may be useful in diagnosing ST. Thrombosis due to ST is rare in any platelet count. ST, however, should be considered within the overall risk assessment for thromboembolism in any patient. If treatment is initiated, low-dose aspirin is sufficient.

### The ITP syndrome: pathogenic and clinical diversity [^112YkSbf]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is mediated by platelet autoantibodies that accelerate platelet destruction and inhibit their production. Most cases are considered idiopathic, whereas others are secondary to coexisting conditions. Insights from secondary forms suggest that the proclivity to develop platelet-reactive antibodies arises through diverse mechanisms. Variability in natural history and response to therapy suggests that primary ITP is also heterogeneous. Certain cases may be secondary to persistent, sometimes inapparent, infections, accompanied by coexisting antibodies that influence outcome. Alternatively, underlying immune deficiencies may emerge. In addition, environmental and genetic factors may impact platelet turnover, propensity to bleed, and response to ITP-directed therapy. We review the pathophysiology of several common secondary forms of ITP. We suggest that primary ITP is also best thought of as an autoimmune syndrome. Better understanding of pathogenesis and tolerance checkpoint defects leading to autoantibody formation may facilitate patient-specific approaches to diagnosis and management.

2 DISCUSSION

Thrombocytosis is a common finding in routine blood exams and a common cause of referral to the hematologist for further investigation. From a physiopathological point of view, thrombocytosis can be categorized into primary (i.e. depending on the true hematological disease), secondary (i.e. reactive), and spurious (Table 1). As reactive thrombocytosis is more frequent than primary thrombocytosis, it is widely accepted in common clinical practice to search, at first, for causes of secondary thrombocytosis. Thus, blood tests and any other complementary examinations to search for reactive causes (e.g. iron deficiency, infection, inflammatory disease, and hemolysis) should be performed. In addition, a detailed medical history should be obtained, with particular emphasis on the present and past illness and recent surgical intervention (thrombocytosis secondary to malignancy, postoperative thrombocytosis). In addition, a comprehensive and updated list of current medications (including prescription medications, herbals, and over‐the‐counter drugs) should be noted (thrombocytosis caused by administration of corticosteroids, adrenaline, and thrombopoietin mimicking drugs).

### Classification and molecular biology of polycythemias (erythrocytoses) and thrombocytosis [^115FS2K1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, polycythemic disorders are classified based on the current understanding of biology of erythropoieses and divided into primary and secondary polycythemias. Special emphasis is given to recently uncovered molecular bases of newly described congenital polycythemic disorders. This clarification of the pathophysiology of some of the congenital polycythemic states has obvious utility for more accurate diagnosis and rational prognostic determination. The molecular basis of congenital thrombocytoses is only beginning to be uncovered. In contrast, the molecular bases of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia remain unknown, thus their diagnostic criteria are imprecise and their treatment remains largely empirical. The central premise of this article is that deciphering the molecular basis of human diseases leads to improved understanding of hematopoiesis, precise diagnosis, and the potential for development of a specific therapy.

### Inherited thrombocytopenia: when a low platelet count does not mean ITP [^111drvmc]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital thrombocytopenias, once considered rare and obscure conditions, are today recognized with increasing frequency, especially due to the measurement of platelet number as part of routine blood testing. The clinical spectrum of congenital thrombocytopenia ranges from severe bleeding diatheses, recognized within the first few weeks of life, to mild conditions that may remain undetected even in adulthood. For the latter group of diseases, distinguishing between inherited (primary) and acquired (secondary) thrombocytopenia, especially immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), is essential to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments. In this review, the congenital thrombocytopenia syndromes are discussed with specific attention focused on diagnostic criteria, clinical presentations, genetic etiology, and current medical management. The mutated genes responsible for each syndrome are reviewed as well as the potential implications for using gene therapy or gene repair in the future.

### The immune thrombocytopenia syndrome: a disorder of diverse pathogenesis and clinical presentation [^115yEaCU]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article presents a brief history of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) from the first clinical description written in 1735, through years of controversy about the nature and causes of what was first known as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, then immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and, finally, ITP. Current understanding of ITP's primary and secondary forms and the effect of diverse defects in immune self tolerance that result in the development of antiplatelet antibodies is described. This overview is followed by a narrative list of other articles in this issue on topics ranging from a comprehensive review of the role of antiplatelet antibodies in platelet destruction and production to a review of classic treatment modalities and newer approaches to initial treatment.

### Comparison of the mutational profiles of primary myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocytosis [^114rsMHw]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocytosis (ET) are common Philadelphia chromosome–negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), characterized by cytoses, splenomegaly, and hypercellular bone marrows with proliferation of myeloid, erythroid, and/or megakaryocytic lineages. In early stage disease, PMF usually presents with leukocytosis, PV with increased hemoglobin level, and ET with thrombocytosis. However, it is a challenge to distinguish between ET and prefibrotic/early myelofibrosis, as well as initial cases of PV from ET or even PMF. The differential diagnosis at the intermediate stage is easier but could still be a pathologic challenge. The relevance of differentiating between these entities lies beyond an academic exercise given the different natural histories and treatment approaches for each. Survival is longest in ET (median survival of 20 years), intermediate in PV (14 years), and shortest in PMF (6 years). The goal of therapy in PV and ET is aimed more at supportive care and prevention of thrombocytosis than curing disease. In contrast, for patients with genetically and clinically high-risk PMF, stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice. Different prognostic systems are also used for these three identities. Therefore, there is clinical utility in identifying unique nonmorphologic features that may help to distinguish between these three entities. As these diseases progress, they all may potentially develop diffuse bone marrow fibrosis and present with cytopenia(s). At the terminal fibrotic stage, marrow morphologies can be very similar between advanced PMF and post-ET/PV myelofibrosis, making them hard to distinguish and posing a real and common diagnostic challenge to the pathologist. However, the prognosis and the treatment may be similar between these entities at this stage.

### Is it primary myelofibrosis or chronic megakaryocytic leukemia? [^111bPdEc]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

One could ask whether essential (primary) thrombocythemia is not, also, a chronic megakaryocytic leukemia? It is one in the sense that it is a clonal disorder originating in a primitive multipotential hematopoietic cell in which its principal expression is exaggerated neoplastic megakaryo-cytopoiesis and elevated platelet counts, but the term thrombocythemia captures the central issue. It is, in effect, an indolent myelogenous leukemia if one uses the term "myelogenous leukemia" to designate the spectrum of neoplasms that originate in a mutated multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell, as we do for the overwhelming majority of those disorders. Moreover, primary thrombocythemia is never associated with leukemic blast cells in blood or marrow. Indolent myelogenous leukemia is a counterpoint to acute (polyblastic) and subacute (oligoblastic) myelogenous leukemias and is not meant to imply the absence of morbidity. It, too, carries a risk of clonal evolution to a more severe myeloid neoplasm, notably acute myelogenous leukemia. I do not suggest changing its name, as the term "leukemia" has come to mean something to the laity with which the patient with thrombocythemia should not be confronted, as is the case with polycythemia vera, another neoplasm of the multi-potential progenitor cell (an indolent myelogenous leukemia with a risk of evolution to acute myelogenous leukemia). In the case of polycythemia, indolent leukemia is characterized by differentiation of the mutant hematopoietic multipotential cell, such that it provides clonal platelets, neutrophils, other granulocytes and red cells that are phenocopies of normal cells and highly functional. The distinction of thrombocythemia from chronic megakaryocytic leukemia (primary myelofibrosis in the WHO classification) is a profound one, as noted by the markedly longer life expectancy on average of a patient with thrombocythemia (median survival of 20 years) at the time of diagnosis as compared to a patient with primary myelofibrosis who has a median survival of 5 years after diagnosis. Thus, the nosological grouping (chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms) of polycythemia vera, thrombocythemia and so-called primary myelofibrosis has a genetic basis but primary myelofibrosis (chronic mega-karyocytic leukemia) has a strikingly different course, management and prognosis. In 1942, amidst the Nazi occupation of France, and at a time in which there was a primitive understanding of multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell neoplasms, Chevallier discussed the "odoleukemias". He chose the Greek word, odo, meaning threshold, to highlight disorders that are on the threshold of overt leukemia. Chevallier proposed "leucoses" as the generic term for "leucémie" so that marked variations in white cell and blast counts and other presenting features would not engender inappropriate terminology.

### The new WHO classification for essential thrombocythemia calls for revision of available evidences [^115KJpRQ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Compared with the 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET)in the 2016 revised version, diagnostic features of pre-fibrotic primary myelofibrosis (pre-PMF) were stringently defined and this entity was recognized as a separate category, distinct from "true" ET –, mainly based on scrutinized evaluation of bone marrow (BM) biopsy features. –. This was a major advancement that significantly modified the diagnostic landscape and deserves practical implications. Furthermore, owing that the majority of cases currently falling in the pre-PMF category were diagnosed as ET in the past, one may question about the need to critically re-evaluate the results of epidemiologic, clinical, and molecular studies, as well as the results of clinical trials, in the context of the two entities.

In this work, we collected and reviewed the most-relevant information on this matter, aiming at providing a comprehensive evaluation of the issue at hand.

### New advances in the pathogenesis and therapy of essential thrombocythemia [^112P3XKV]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a hematopoietic disorder that manifests clinically as thrombocytosis, and patients with ET are at increased risk for developing thrombosis, myelofibrosis, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Although ET was recognized as a distinct clinical syndrome more than 6 decades ago and was classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) by William Dameshek in 1951, the molecular pathogenesis of ET remained unknown until 2005, when activating mutations in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) were identified in a significant proportion of patients with ET, polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In addition, subsequent studies have identified gain-of-function mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) in a subset of patients with JAK2V617F-negative ET, suggesting that JAK2 activation by distinct mechanisms contributes to the pathogenesis of ET. Despite these important observations, important questions remain regarding the role of JAK2/MPL mutations in ET pathogenesis, the etiology of JAK2/MPL negative ET, the factors that distinguish ET from other MPNs with the JAK2V617F mutation, and the role of JAK2-targeted therapies for the treatment of these MPNs.

### Essential thrombocythemia [^112k81Zq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on essential thrombocythemia:

- **Definition**: ET is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes leading to sustained thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L). The disease most often results from driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and manifests with increased thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk, vasomotor symptoms, and, less frequently, progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: ET results from constitutive activation of cytokine signaling, most frequently through the JAK2V617F mutation, found in about 60% of patients, or through CALR or MPL mutations, found in about 20–25% and 3–4%, respectively. These driver mutations stimulate uncontrolled megakaryocytic proliferation and platelet production. Additional mutations in genes such as ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, SF3B1, or TP53 can influence disease behavior and risk of progression. Abnormal interactions between activated platelets and the vascular endothelium contribute to thrombotic events, while very high platelet counts may cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome and bleeding.
- **Epidemiology**: ET has an incidence of about 1.5–2 cases per 100,000 persons each year and is most common in older adults, though up to one fifth of patients are diagnosed before the age of 40. Women are slightly more often affected than men. It accounts for about one third of all myeloproliferative neoplasms. About 10–15% of patients lack detectable mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and are referred to as triple-negative.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factors for ET include age and genetic predisposition.
- **Disease course**: The disease often remains stable for many years but can be interrupted by vascular complications. Thrombosis is the most frequent cause of morbidity, occurring in about 15–20% of patients, especially in those > 60 years or carrying a JAK2 mutation. Hemorrhagic events may occur, particularly in the setting of extreme thrombocytosis. Progression to post-ET myelofibrosis occurs in about 5–10% of cases, and transformation to acute leukemia in less than 2% over ten years. Median survival is about 18–20 years overall and exceeds 30 years in younger individuals. Prognostic models such as the triple A system, which considers age, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, or mutationally enhanced models that include adverse mutations, help stratify outcomes. Triple-negative disease generally has the most favorable prognosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Life expectancy in ET is somewhat reduced compared with the general population but remains substantially better than in other myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis. Median survival is approximately 18 years but can exceed 35 years in younger patients. Adverse prognostic factors include advanced age, leukocytosis, abnormal karyotype, and mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, or TP53. Patients with CALR type 2 mutations or triple-negative status have the lowest risk of thrombosis and longest survival, whereas those with CALR type 1 or MPL mutations are more prone to fibrotic transformation. The major therapeutic focus remains prevention of thrombosis and close monitoring for disease progression.

The annual incidence of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is 0.4–1.4 per 100,000 population and shows a predilection for older males, although younger patients can be affected. Of the MPNs, PMF is the least common but is associated with poorer survival, approximately 2 to 5 years upon diagnosis and symptom onset. Patients may be asymptomatic and present following detection of incidental radiological findings or through discovery of anaemia, thrombocytosis, or thrombocytopaenia. In symptomatic patients, the clinical presentation varies from constitutional symptoms to cardiovascular complications related to severe anaemia and thromboembolic events. Up to 10% of patients experience a thromboembolic event, most commonly venous thromboembolism. Splenomegaly is an inevitable outcome and may lead to splenic infarction, haemorrhage, splanchnic vein thrombosis, portal hypertension, or mass effect symptoms. There is also a small risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia.

### Pathogenesis and management of essential thrombocythemia [^1135tvqw]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The last four years have seen an explosion in our understanding of the myeloproliferative neoplasms. Important and often unexpected insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for these disorders have been accompanied by the development of new diagnostic tests and by an improved understanding of the relationship between the different disease entities. This review will focus on recent developments in the pathogenesis and management of essential thrombocythemia with a particular emphasis on its phenotypic overlap with polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis.

### Neonatal thrombocytosis following G-CSF treatment [^113UVCzN]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is defined as an elevation of the platelet count to more than 500,000/mm(3). Primary thrombocytosis rarely occurs in the pediatric age group and is usually caused by a clonal bone marrow disorder. The more common phenomenon is secondary thrombocytosis which is a reactive process. Table 1 lists the main causes of secondary thrombocytosis. Complications of severe thrombocytosis include bleeding and thromboses. Unless additional risk factors are present, secondary thrombocytosis is not associated with a significant risk of thromboembolic events, regardless of the degree of elevation of the platelet count. The aim of this case report is to add a new possible cause of neonatal thrombocytosis.

### Immune thrombocytopenia [^115jWFtE]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common hematologic disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia. ITP presents as a primary or a secondary form. ITP may affect individuals of all ages, with peaks during childhood and in the elderly, in whom the age-specific incidence of ITP is greatest. Bleeding is the most common clinical manifestation of ITP. The pathogenesis of ITP is complex, involving alterations in humoral and cellular immunity. Corticosteroids remain the most common first line therapy for ITP. This article summarizes the classification and diagnosis of primary and secondary ITP, as well as the pathogenesis and options for treatment.

### Extreme thrombocytosis is associated with critical illness and young age, but not increased thrombotic risk, in hospitalized pediatric patients [^117W5qbk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Extreme thrombocytosis (EXT, platelet count > 1000 × 10³/μL) is an uncommon but potentially clinically significant finding. Primary EXT in the setting of myeloproliferative disorders is linked to thrombotic and/or bleeding complications more frequently than secondary EXT, which typically occurs in reaction to infection, inflammation, or iron deficiency. However, comorbidities have been reported in adults with secondary EXT. Clinical implications of EXT in children are not well defined, as prior studies targeted small and/or specialized pediatric populations.

Objectives

Our objectives were to determine etiologies and sequelae of EXT in a hospitalized general pediatric patient population.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed EXT cases from a single-center pediatric cohort of ~80 000 patients over 8 years.

Results

Virtually all cases (99.8%) were secondary in nature, and most were multifactorial. Many cases of EXT occurred in children under 2 years old (47%) and/or during critical illness (55%). No thrombotic or bleeding events directly resulted from EXT, confirming a paucity of clinical complications associated with EXT in pediatric patients. There were indications that neonatal hematopoiesis and individual genetic variation influenced some cases, in addition to certain diagnoses (eg, sickle cell anemia) and clinical contexts (eg, asplenia).

Conclusion

Our findings confirm that thrombotic events related to EXT are rare in pediatric patients, which can inform the use of empiric anti-platelet therapy.

### How I treat polycythemia vera [^116UaRBV]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Since its discovery, polycythemia vera (PV) has challenged clinicians responsible for its diagnosis and management and scientists investigating its pathogenesis. As a clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder, PV is a neoplasm but its driver mutations result in overproduction of morphologically and functionally normal blood cells. PV arises in an HSC but it can present initially as isolated erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or any combination of these together with splenomegaly or myelofibrosis, and it can take years for a true panmyelopathy to appear. PV shares the same JAK2 mutation as essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis, but erythrocytosis only occurs in PV. However, unlike secondary causes of erythrocytosis, in PV, the plasma volume is frequently expanded, masking the erythrocytosis and making diagnosis difficult if this essential fact is ignored. PV is not a monolithic disorder: female patients deregulate fewer genes and clinically behave differently than their male counterparts, while some PV patients are genetically predisposed to an aggressive clinical course. Nevertheless, based on what we have learned over the past century, most PV patients can lead long and productive lives. In this review, using clinical examples, I describe how I diagnose and manage PV in an evidence-based manner without relying on chemotherapy.

### Genetic origins and clinical phenotype of familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^114yaJm9]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

Familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis are characterized by myeloid lineage hyperproliferation, which is either single or multi-lineage in origin. The single lineage disorders exhibit Mendelian inheritance with polyclonal hematopoiesis and often arise from a single genetic defect. In contrast, the multi-lineage disorders exhibit complex patterns of inheritance with multi-genetic origins and clonal hematopoiesis. They have the potential to acquire JAK2 somatic mutations, but this is not the primary event. Identification of the disease-causing genes will enable better classification of familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis. Furthermore, it will provide an insight into the mechanisms regulating myeloid cell proliferation.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^114SfPTB]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are operationally classified as BCR-ABL1 -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). All three are believed to originate from a genetically transformed stem cell, which leads to clonal myeloproliferation. Neither the disease-initiating nor leukemia-promoting events in BCR-ABL1 -negative MPN are known, although the majority of the patients harbor JAK2 V617F or other secondary somatic mutations. In terms of diagnosis, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for hematopoietic tumors considers clonal erythrocytosis as being specific to PV, and uses bone marrow morphology to distinguish between ET and PMF.

### Adolescents and young adults with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia [^116Sw9Qe]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by increased platelet destruction and impaired production. Most textbooks and practice guidelines describe pediatric ITP as acute and profound but self-limiting, with a low risk of life-threatening bleeding in the majority of patients. In contrast, adult ITP is a chronic disease with an insidious onset of bleeding that is sometimes diagnosed incidentally. Adult ITP carries a high risk of severe bleeding in patients with a platelet count of < 20–30×10⁹/L, with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients aged > 60 years. Platelet-enhancing therapy is usually advised for adults with severe thrombocytopenia, especially the elderly or those with comorbidities. In contrast, a watch-and-wait strategy is recommended for children with non-severe bleeding. Recently, comparative studies in children and adults demonstrated unexpected similarities in the clinical and laboratory findings of both groups, particularly at disease onset, although differences in long-term prognosis and some aspects of patient management have been confirmed.

Adolescents and young adults (AYAS) are recognized as a specific age group with symptoms, disease course, treatment goals, side effects, needs, and expectations that differ from children and adults. AYAS are of particular interest in oncology and transition medicine. Characteristic features of AYAS include a high disease burden and poor compliance. The disease and treatment may negatively affect their personal development. Some treatment difficulties in this age group can be partly attributed to their physiological development. Adolescents have rapid hormonal, behavioral, and social changes, all of which can potentially modify the disease or symptoms. There is no international consensus on the definition of AYAS. In the literature, age differs from 12–16 years at the lower and 25–40 years at the upper limit.

AYAS are poorly studied in ITP-related literature, and clinical studies in this specific age group are lacking. Recommendations for AYAS with ITP are usually not covered by practice guidelines; therefore, the institutions providing care guide treatment options, are often designed exclusively for children or adults. However, in most ITP studies, the median age of patient cohorts is > 40–50 years for adults, and < 10 years for children. Thus, treatment goals and guidelines for AYAS are biased.

### Proposals and rationale for revision of the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis: recommendations from an ad hoc international expert panel [^111GiDB3]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

The Janus kinase 2 mutation, JAK2617V > F, is myeloid neoplasm-specific; its presence excludes secondary polycythemia, thrombocytosis, or bone marrow fibrosis from other causes. Furthermore, JAK2617V > F or a JAK2 exon 12 mutation is present in virtually all patients with polycythemia vera (PV), whereas JAK2617V > F also occurs in approximately half of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Therefore, JAK2 mutation screening holds the promise of a decisive diagnostic test in PV while being complementary to histology for the diagnosis of ET and PMF; the combination of molecular testing and histologic review should also facilitate diagnosis of ET associated with borderline thrombocytosis. Accordingly, revision of the current World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for PV, ET, and PMF is warranted; JAK2 mutation analysis should be listed as a major criterion for PV diagnosis, and the platelet count threshold for ET diagnosis can be lowered from 600 to 450 x 10(9)/L. The current document was prepared by an international expert panel of pathologists and clinical investigators in myeloproliferative disorders; it was subsequently presented to members of the Clinical Advisory Committee for the revision of the WHO Classification of Myeloid Neoplasms, who endorsed the document and recommended its adoption by the WHO.

### What's in a number? Examining the prognostic and predictive importance of platelet count in patients with essential thrombocythemia [^114FueTC]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal overproduction of platelets and an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Patients are risk stratified by driver mutation, age, and thrombotic history and treated to reduce the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The significance of platelet number as a risk factor or treatment goal is unclear. Despite the preponderance of data failing to demonstrate an association, there exists a pervasive belief that higher platelet counts correlate with an increased thrombotic risk. In fact, the association between thrombocytosis and bleeding is more clearly supported. Variability in regional consensus guidelines contributes to the uncertainty. This article reviews the data that shed light on the importance of platelet count in patients with ET.

### Essential thrombocythemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^114YhLgR]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The term myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) typically refers to essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF); in addition, some patients with ET or PV might in time progress into a PMF-like post-ET or post-PV myelofibrosis. As a group, ET, PV, and PMF share three mutually exclusive "driver" mutations, including JAK2, CALR, and MPL. The most frequent driver mutation is JAK2 V617F, found in ~99% of patients with PV, 55% ET, and 65% PMF. The driver mutation distributions in ET and PMF are similar with 50–65% of the patients being JAK2 V617F mutated, 15–30% being CALR mutated, and 4–8% being MPL mutated, while 10–20% of the patients might not express any one of the three mutations (i.e. are triple-negative).

### How common are myeloproliferative neoplasms? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114BeWrY]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary(idiopathic) myelofibrosis (PMF). In this systematic review, we provide a comprehensive report on the incidence and prevalence of MPNs across the globe. Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) were searched from their inception to August 2012 for articles reporting MPN incidence or prevalence rates. A random effects meta-analysis was undertaken to produce combined incidence rates for PV, ET, and PMF. Both heterogeneity and small study bias were assessed. Thirty-four studies were included. Reported annual incidence rates ranged from 0.01 to 2.61, 0.21 to 2.27, and 0.22 to 0.99 per 100,000 for PV, ET, and PMF, respectively. The combined annual incidence rates for PV, ET, and PMF were 0.84, 1.03, and 0.47 per 100,000. There was high heterogeneity across disease entities (I² 97.1–99.8%) and evidence of publication bias for ET and PMF (Egger test, P = 50.007 and P ≤ 0.001, respectively). The pooled incidence reflects the rarity of MPNs. The calculated pooled incidence rates do not reflect MPN incidence across the globe due to the high unexplained heterogeneity. Improved, widespread registration of MPNs would provide better information for global comparison of the incidence and prevalence of MPNs.

### The new WHO classification for essential thrombocythemia calls for revision of available evidences [^113rZEpD]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

In the 2016 revised classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms pre-fibrotic primary myelofibrosis (pre-PMF) was recognized as a separate entity, distinct from essential thrombocythemia (ET). Owing that the majority of cases falling in the pre-PMF category were previously diagnosed as ET, one may question about the need to re-evaluate the results of epidemiologic, clinical, and molecular studies, and the results of clinical trials in the two entities. Based on a critical review of recently published studies, pre-PMF usually presents with a distinct clinical and hematological presentation and higher frequency of constitutional symptoms. JAK2V617F and CALR mutations in pre-PMF patients are superimposable to ET, whereas non-driver high-risk mutations are enriched in pre-PMF compared with ET. Thrombosis is not significantly different, whereas bleeding is more frequent in pre-PMF. Median survival is significantly shorter in pre-PMF and 10-year cumulative rates progression to overt myelofibrosis is 0–1% vs. 10–12%, and leukemic transformation is 1–2% vs. 2–6%, in ET and pre-fibrotic-PMF, respectively. Most patients fall in the lower prognostic IPSS group in which observation alone can be recommended. Patients at intermediate risk may require a symptom-driven treatment for anemia, splenomegaly or constitutional symptoms while cytoreductive drugs are indicated in the high-risk category.

### Thrombocytosis [^111E9wqA]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Major progress in understanding the pathogenesis in patients with thrombocytosis has been made by identifying mutations in the key regulators of thrombopoietin: the thrombopoietin receptor MPL and JAK2. Together, these mutations can be found in 50% to 60% of patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis and in 10% to 20% of hereditary thrombocytosis. A decrease in expression of the Mpl protein can cause thrombocytosis even in the absence of mutations in the coding sequence, due to a shift in the balance between stimulation of signaling in megakaryopoiesis and removal of thrombopoietin by receptor mediated internalization in platelets. When present in a heterozygous state the JAK2-V617F mutation preferentially stimulates megakaryopoiesis and in most cases manifests as essential thrombocythemia (ET), whereas homozygous JAK2-V617F reduces megakaryopoiesis in favor of increased erythropoiesis, resulting in polycythemia vera and/or myelofibrosis. In 30% to 40% of patients with ET or primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and in 80% to 90% of pedigrees with hereditary thrombocytosis the disease-causing gene remains unknown. Ongoing genetic and genomic screens have identified genes that, when mutated, can cause thrombocytosis in mouse models. A more complete picture of the pathways that regulate megakaryopoisis and platelet production will be important for finding new ways of controlling platelet production in patients with thrombocytosis.

### A critical review of anagrelide therapy in essential thrombocythemia and related disorders [^112ihog9]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2005). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem and it represents either a primary myeloid disorder (a clonal process) or a reactive phenomenon. While reactive thrombocytosis is often inconsequential, clonal thrombocytosis may require cytoreductive therapy to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In this regard, a controlled clinical trial has previously demonstrated the efficacy of hydroxyurea in reducing the risk of thrombosis in high-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Despite the absence of similar evidence for clinical benefit, the platelet-lowering agent anagrelide has been widely used in both ET and polycythemia vera (PV) and recent reports of serious side-effects suggest that such practice might be detrimental to patients. In the current review we provide basic drug information as well as a critical assessment of anagrelide treatment in ET and related disorders.

### Clinical insights into the origins of thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^1161t3iV]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis, are hematopoietic stem cell disorders that are defined by activating mutations in signal transduction pathways and are characterized clinically by the overproduction of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils, significant burden of disease-specific symptoms, and high rates of vascular events. The focus of this review is to critically reevaluate the clinical burden of thrombosis in MPNs, to review the clinical associations among clonal hematopoiesis, JAK2V617F burden, inflammation, and thrombosis, and to provide insights into novel primary and secondary thrombosis-prevention strategies.

### Applied genomics in MPN presentation [^111dyEHL]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are grouped together as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) because of shared clinical, pathologic, and molecular features. The 2005 discovery of the driver mutation JAK2V617F, found in more than 70% of individuals with MPNs and 98% of those with PV, has transformed the diagnosis and management of MPNs. Although PV is the most common phenotype associated with JAK2V617F, roughly 60% of individuals with ET or PMF also have the mutation, and JAK2V617F is now recognized as a common lesion in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). JAK2V617F+ CH and MPN are indolent disorders that evolve over time, with transitions to different disease phases, transformation to bone marrow failure or leukemia, and high thrombosis rates. Genomic assessment has taken center stage as an important tool to define disease phenotype, disease burden, prognosis, and even thrombosis risk of MPNs. Genomics has also unveiled the causes and factors that modify the risk of acquiring and expanding CH and MPNs and points to new pathways for targeted therapies to treat and ultimately prevent them. Genomic assessment of patients with MPNs, like other cancers, enables the clinician to capitalize on large population data sets to inform the individual patient of risk, identify treatment, and improve outcomes.

### One thousand patients with essential thrombocythemia: the florence-CRIMM experience [^112ocnEk]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET), first described by Epstein and Goedel in 1934, is one of the classic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), along with polycythemia vera (PV), prefibrotic and overtly fibrotic stage primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and MPN unclassifiable (MPN-U)/not otherwise specified (MPN-NOS) according to the latest International consensus (ICC) and World Health Organization (WHO) classification systems. Furthermore, ET may develop a fibrotic phenotype over time, referred to as post-ET myelofibrosis (MF).

ET is mainly characterized by the proliferation of abnormal megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (BM), resulting in an increased number of circulating platelets. Clinical manifestations include vasomotor symptoms such as erythromelalgia, migraine, and paresthesia, constitutional symptoms, and complications from thrombosis, both arterial and venous, and bleeding; mild (< 5 cm from left costal margin) splenomegaly can be seen in about 15–20% of the cases, while hepatomegaly is rare.

Rates of complications are relatively high. Of note, the incidence of thrombotic complications ranges from 9% to 84% at diagnosis and from 7% to 32% during long-term follow-up in various settings and using different definitions of events. For bleeding, the respective rates range from 4% to 63% and from 8% to 14%. However, approximately 40% to 50% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, and thrombocytosis is an incidental finding on routine blood testing. Overall, ET has the most favorable prognosis among MPN but presents considerable clinical heterogeneity, and a minority of patients who develop progression to MF or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), referred to as blast-phase (BP) MPN, have a much poorer outcome.

Diagnosis of ET is made on the basis of patterns of histopathology in the BM, which is typically normocellular for patients' age and has an increased number of mostly mature-appearing megakaryocytes, either sparse and constituting loose clusters and reticulin fibrosis < grade 1; demonstration of clonality and/or the absence of a clear secondary cause of thrombocytosis, and exclusion of other hematologic disorders with thrombocytosis, are required diagnostic criteria. Among conditions associated with secondary/reactive thrombocytosis, the most frequent are infections, iron deficiency, chronic inflammation, drugs and splenectomy.

### How we diagnose and treat essential thrombocythaemia [^115xfPuR]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

The approach to the diagnosis and management of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is steadily changing, influenced by advances in molecular biology, data from clinical trials and retrospective analyses of patient cohorts. In the past decade options for clinical management largely remain unchanged, but who we treat, and with what target in mind, is evolving. A further area of change is recognition of symptoms that may be associated with ET, as well as other myeloproliferative neoplasms, and that potential options for their management are becoming available. Judicious and careful diagnosis is increasingly a fundamental key to successful management followed by cytoreductive therapy in a subset of patients. In this review we demonstrate our management strategies for ET using a case-based format.

### Can polycythaemia vera disease be predicted from haematologic parameters? A machine learning-based study [^114AKcVC]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Absolute erythrocytosis is divided into three subclasses: primary erythrocytosis caused by an intrinsic defect in the precursor cells of the haematopoietic series, secondary erythrocytosis caused by extrinsic stimuli such as erythropoietin (EPO) and idiopathic erythrocytosis in which no aetiological cause is identified. The prototype of primary erythrocytosis is PV. PV is defined as an acquired stem cell disease characterised by uncontrolled clonal production of precursor cells with normal morphology of erythrocytes, platelets (PLT) and leukocytes in the absence of any stimulus and extramedullary haematopoiesis. Although the aetiology of the disease has not been fully elucidated, the incidence is 5–17/million in the United States and Europe. PV is more frequently seen in people older than 60 years of age, but is extremely rare in people younger than 40 years of age. Although the incidence is similar in men and women, it is slightly higher in men. At the time of diagnosis, splenomegaly is found in 70% of patients and hepatomegaly in 30%. Therefore, PV patients usually have mild to moderate leucocytosis and thrombocytosis. Leucocytosis is found in 60% of patients with PV, and thrombocytosis in half of the patients. Serum EPO level is frequently low in PV. The V617F point mutation in exon 14 of JAK2 is present in 95% of patients with PV. Currently, the diagnostic criteria of the updated International Consensus Classification (ICC) are used for PV. The diagnostic criteria for PV require either all three major criteria or the first two major criteria and minor criteria to be met. These major criteria are as follows: HGB > 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women; HCT > 49% in men, > 48% in women, bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity for age with trilineage enlargement (panmyelosis) including marked erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic proliferation with pleomorphic, mature megakaryocytes (size differences) and presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation. Minor criteria are subnormal serum EPO level (normal range of EPO in adults: 4.1–19.5 mU/mL). Major criterion 2 (bone marrow biopsy) may not be necessary in cases with persistent absolute erythrocytosis (persistent absolute erythrocytosis is defined as HGB levels higher than 18.5 g/dL in men or 16.5 g/dL in women or HCT higher than 55.5% in men and 49.5% in women). Accordingly, three major criteria or the first two major criteria plus minor criteria must be present for the diagnosis of PV.

### Complex management of a patient with refractory primary erythromelalgia lacking amutation [^116SuivH]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erythromelalgia (EM) is a rare neurovascular disorder characterized by swelling, erythema, and burning in the extremities in a stocking-glove distribution, which is relieved by exposure to cold but worsened by heat stimuli. Based on its etiology, EM is classified into two types: primary and secondary EM. Primary EM may be either hereditary with mutations in SCN9A resulting in defective Na V 1.7 sodium channels or idiopathic with spontaneous gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A or other genes. Secondary EM is associated with hematological disorders involving thrombocytosis, certain immunological disorders, and some vasoactive medications. Despite the discovery of underlying Na V 1.7 channel dysfunction in inherited EM, these patients often course through many different treatment modalities with inconsistent therapeutic responses. This report describes a case of refractory late-onset primary EM and raises key questions about its diagnosis, treatment, and the utility of genetic testing.

The second most frequent mutations in MPN involve the CALR- gene located on chromosome 19p13.2. With the exception of isolated reports, CALR mutations are absent in PV, whereas their frequencies are estimated at 20–25% in ET and PMF; therefore, CALR mutations appear to be relatively specific to ET and PMF. The third MPN-specific mutation involves the myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL; located on chromosome 1p34) and has been described in 3% of patients with ET and 7% of those with PMF, and only rarely in PV. JAK2, CALR and MPL mutations are often mutually exclusive, although concurrent occurrence has been reported, likely as the result of concurrent individual mutated clones. Taken together, approximately 99% of PV patients are expected to harbor JAK2 mutations, whereas 80–90% of patients with ET or PMF carry one of the three 'MPN-driver' mutations: JAK2, CALR or MPL. It was therefore appropriate to suggest that the upcoming revision of the WHO system in addition to JAK2 includes CALR and MPL mutation screening (Tables 1–4) in the diagnostic process for JAK2 -unmutated ET and PMF. Once again, BM examination is often necessary for accurate diagnosis since JAK2 / CALR / MPL mutation screening, by itself, cannot distinguish masked PV from JAK2 -mutated ET, WHO-defined ET from prefibrotic/early PMF or triple-negative ET from other causes of thrombocytosis. The latter stems from the fact that about 10–15% of patients with ET or PMF lacks all three MPN driver mutations and are referred to as being 'triple-negative'. In JAK2 / CALR / MPL -mutated patients, mutant allele burden is sometimes helpful in further clarifying the specific diagnosis; for example, higher than 40% JAK2 mutant allele burden is unusual in ET and suggests either masked PV or prefibrotic/early PMF.

Concluding remarks

The main objectives of the current perspective are to underscore the prognostic relevance of distinguishing WHO-defined ET from early/prefibrotic MF and to increase awareness regarding the relatively high risk of residual thrombosis in certain group of patients with WHO-defined ET. We believe that these issues constitute actionable challenges and need to be ultimately evaluated in prospective controlled studies. Our recommendations outlined in Figure 1 are neither binding nor absolute. They are simply there to assist those who seek our opinion.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms include 3 diseases: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). PV and ET are dominated by a high risk of thrombosis and a late risk of clonal evolution into secondary MF and acute myeloid leukemia. Patients with PMF may encounter many complications associated with disease progression or with PMF evolution. This article defines factors that determine prognosis in these 3 diseases.

### Rationale for revision and proposed changes of the WHO diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis [^1146fRtN]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The 2001/2008 World Health Organization (WHO)-based diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were recently revised to accomodate new information on disease-specific mutations and underscore distinguishing morphologic features. In this context, it seems to be reasonable to compare first major diagnostic criteria of the former WHO classifications for myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and then to focus on details that have been discussed and will be proposed for the upcoming revision of diagnostic guidelines. In PV, a characteristic bone marrow (BM) morphology was added as one of three major diagnostic criteria, which allowed lowering of the hemoglobin/hematocrit threshold for diagnosis, which is another major criterion, to 16.5g/dl/49% in men and 16g/dl/48% in women. The presence of a JAK2 mutation remains the third major diagnostic criterion in PV. Subnormal serum erythropoietin level is now the only minor criterion in PV and is used to capture JAK2-unmutated cases. In ET and PMF, mutations that are considered to confirm clonality and specific diagnosis now include CALR, in addition to JAK2 and MPL. Also in the 2015 discussed revision, overtly fibrotic PMF is clearly distinguished from early/prefibrotic PMF and each PMF variant now includes a separate list of diagnostic criteria. The main rationale for these changes was to enhance the distinction between so-called masked PV and JAK2-mutated ET and between ET and prefibrotic early PMF. The proposed changes also underscore the complementary role, as well as limitations of mutation analysis in morphologic diagnosis. On the other hand, discovery of new biological markers may probably be expected in the future to enhance discrimination of the different MPN subtypes in accordance with the histological BM patterns and corresponding clinical features.

Essential thrombocythemia in the realm of myeloproliferative neoplasms

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) belongs to the group of BCR-ABL1 -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms, which also includes polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis. Myeloproliferative neoplasms are hematopoietic stem-cell disorders that are characterized by the presence of mutually exclusive driver mutations of the downstream kinase JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone CALR (calreticulin) or the thrombopoietin receptor MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene), which are associated with constitutive activation of hematopoietic pathways. In ET, the most frequent mutation is JAK2 V617F (present in about 55% of cases), followed by CALR mutations (about 20%) and MPL mutations (about 4%); no known mutation is detected in about 20% of ET patients. Isolated thrombocytosis may be the first manifestation of polycythemia vera or primary myelofibrosis. It is indispensable to distinguish ET from pre-fibrotic primary myelofibrosis or other myeloid neoplasms, mostly by means of morphological examination of the bone marrow. Rare cases have been described of hereditary, familial thrombocythemia associated with germline mutations of JAK2, MPL or the thrombopoietin gene (THPO). Major criteria for a diagnosis of ET are: (i) platelet count > 450 × 10⁹/L, (ii) bone marrow megakaryocyte proliferation and loose clusters, (iii) not meeting World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for other myeloid neoplasms, and (iv) mutated JAK2/ CALR/MPL. Minor criteria include the presence of other clonal markers and no evidence of reactive thrombocytosis. All four major or three major plus one minor criteria are required to make the diagnosis.

### Narrative review: thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, and JAK2 mutations: the phenotypic mimicry of chronic myeloproliferation [^1176sgyq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The myeloproliferative disorders polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, and primary myelofibrosis are clonal disorders arising in a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, causing an unregulated increase in the number of erythrocytes, leukocytes, or platelets, alone or in combination; eventual marrow dominance by the progeny of the involved stem cell; and a tendency to arterial or venous thrombosis, marrow fibrosis, splenomegaly, or transformation to acute leukemia, albeit at widely varying frequencies. The discovery of an activating mutation (V617F) in the gene for JAK2 (Janus kinase 2), a tyrosine kinase utilized by hematopoietic cell receptors for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, provided an explanation for the shared clinical features of these 3 disorders. Constitutive JAK2 activation provides a growth and survival advantage to the hematopoietic cells of the affected clone. Because signaling by the mutated kinase utilizes normal pathways, the result is overproduction of morphologically normal blood cells, an often indolent course, and (in essential thrombocytosis) usually a normal life span. Because the erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptors are all constitutively activated, polycythemia vera is the potential ultimate clinical phenotype of the JAK2 V617F mutation and, as a corollary, is the most common of the 3 disorders. The number of cells expressing the JAK2 V617F mutation (the allele burden) seems to correlate with the clinical phenotype. Preliminary results of clinical trials with agents that inhibit the mutated kinase indicate a reduction in splenomegaly and alleviation of night sweats, fatigue, and pruritus.

Myelofibrosis (MF), either appearing de novo (primary MF, PMF) or after a previous diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia or of polycythemia vera, is a progressive disease burdened by symptomatic splenomegaly, debilitating systemic symptoms, ineffective hematopoiesis, and overall reduced survival. Patients often present worsening cytopenias, including thrombocytopenia, secondary to progression of the disease as well as to cytoreductive treatment. Patients with MF and thrombocytopenia have few therapeutic options and there is limited information regarding the management of disease in these settings. This article reviews current evidence for the management of patients with MF and thrombocytopenia, in the era of JAK inhibitors.

### Diagnostic workflow for hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^1141UaUZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

In the patient presenting with an elevated blood count who does not have an acquired clonal disorder causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm, hereditary erythrocytosis or hereditary thrombocytosis needs to be considered as a possible explanation. A young patient and/or those with a family history of myeloproliferative neoplasm should specifically raise this possibility. Among the causes of hereditary erythrocytosis are mutations in the genes in the oxygen sensing pathway and high-affinity hemoglobins. Hereditary thrombocytosis has been shown to be accounted for by mutations in THPO, MPL, and JAK2 genes. In those who have a possible hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, the investigative pathway includes specific investigation to rule out the more common acquired clonal disorders, and, if indicated, other secondary causes, measurement of specific cytokines as indicated, and search for specific identified molecular lesions that have been shown to cause these hereditary disorders. There remain individuals who appear to have a hereditary disorder in whom a genetic lesion cannot currently be identified.

Introduction

Myelofibrosis is a chronic clonal stem cell disorder, alongside other myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia, and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Myelofibrosis commonly demonstrates well-described characteristic imaging features, namely diffuse osteosclerosis, massive splenomegaly, and extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH).

### Comparison of different criteria for the diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis reveals limited clinical utility for measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase [^111CM9Xf]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Primary myelofibrosis shows histological and pathogenetic overlap with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. Several diagnostic classifications have been proposed for primary myelofibrosis, although little is known about their clinical utility. In a comparison of three recent classifications, overall concordance was 79%. Inclusion of raised serum lactate dehydrogenase categorized 9% of patients as primary myelofibrosis when other criteria were not met. Although mean serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in patients with primary myelofibrosis, levels were also increased in the majority of patients with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera, and significant overlap was observed. A positive correlation with higher leukocyte and platelet count, and disease duration in primary myelofibrosis, suggests that serum lactate dehydrogenase is a biomarker for disease bulk and/or cellular proliferation. In conclusion, raised lactate dehydrogenase lacks specificity for primary myelofibrosis, consistent with the concept of a phenotypic continuum between essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis.

### Pathogenesis in immune thrombocytopenia: new insights [^113XATNi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a common autoimmune disorder resulting in isolated thrombocytopenia. ITP can present either alone (primary) or in the setting of other conditions (secondary) such as infections or altered immune states. ITP is associated with a loss of tolerance to platelet antigens and a phenotype of accelerated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production. Although the etiology of ITP remains unknown, complex dysregulation of the immune system is observed in ITP patients. Antiplatelet antibodies mediate accelerated clearance from the circulation in large part via the reticuloendothelial (monocytic phagocytic) system. In addition, cellular immunity is perturbed and T-cell and cytokine profiles are significantly shifted toward a type 1 and Th17 proinflammatory immune response. Further clues into immune dysregulation in ITP may be gleaned from studies of secondary ITP. Some infections can induce antiplatelet Abs by molecular mimicry, and there may be common elements involved in breaking tolerance with other autoimmune disorders. There is also evidence for a genetic predisposition to both ITP and responsiveness to therapy, which may in part lie within immune-related genes. Lastly, treatment with immunomodulatory agents remains the mainstay of ITP therapies.

### Epidemiology of the Philadelphia chromosome-negative classical myeloproliferative neoplasms [^113xeG5h]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) comprise the BCR-ABL-negative classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These clonal myeloid diseases are principally driven by well-described molecular events; however, factors leading to their acquisition are not well understood. Beyond increasing age, male sex, and race/ethnicity differences, few consistent risk factors for the MPNs are known. PV and ET have an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0 and 1.1 to 2.0 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively, and predict similar survival. PMF, which has an incidence of about 0.3 to 2.0 cases per 100,000 person-years, is associated with the shortest survival of the MPNs.

### Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of familial thrombocythaemia [^115oeen5]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Familial thrombocytosis can be divided into two broad categories. The first includes inherited syndromes that affect only the megakaryocytic lineage with Mendelian inheritance, high penetrance and polyclonal haematopoiesis. The second category includes inherited predisposition to true Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and is characterized by low penetrance, clonal haematopoiesis and presence of somatic mutations such as JAK2 V617F. It must be underlined that these two categories represent two well separate entities, with different patterns of proliferation and different transmission modalities. This review will focus on the molecular pathogenesis of hereditary thrombocytosis, underlining those clinical pictures that are specifically associated with mutations in the genes of thrombopoietin or in its receptor. Moreover, we propose an approach for the diagnosis and therapy of these syndromes.

### Comparison of the mutational profiles of primary myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocytosis [^114L4rPN]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

With rapid progress in the sequencing technology due to next-generation sequencing (NGS), somatic mutations in growing numbers of genes, with pathogenetic and prognostic significance, have been identified in myeloid neoplasms. Key MPN-specific driver mutations have been well characterized — namely, JAK2, CALR, and MPL — and these are usually mutually exclusive. JAK2 is the most frequent mutation in Philadelphia chromosome–negative MPN, with frequencies of approximately 95% to 98% in PV, 50% to 60% in ET, and 55% to 65% in PMF. CALR and MPL mutations are typically absent in patients with PV with rare exception. CALR mutations are present in approximately 20% to 25% of ET or PMF cases, while MPL mutations are present in 3% to 4% of ET cases and 6% to 7% of PMF cases.

It has been previously shown that an MPN can be initiated from a single hematopoietic stem cell expressing the canonical JAK2 V617 mutation. Furthermore, JAK2 inhibitors have shown promising activity in controlling constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly in PMFand PV but have not been shown to be disease modifying. Patients with CALR mutations have been reported to have lower risk of thrombosis in ET and better overall survival in PMF compared with JAK2- mutated patients. Among patients with ET, those with MPL mutations show significantly inferior overall survival.

Of note, approximately 10% to 15% of patients with PMF or ET do not express any of the three (JAK2, CALR, MPL) mutations. However, with the widespread research and clinical application of NGS, mutations in additional genes and other nondriver mutations have been identified in MPN, and their clinical and prognostic significance is under intensive studies. Given the growing body of genomic data, it has been suggested that MPNs may better be categorized based on their mutational bases rather than morphologic differences with regard to clinical outcomes.

In this study, we analyzed the mutational profiles and cytogenetic abnormalities of 135 patients with PMF, PV, or ET with the aim of uncovering molecular and/or cytogenetic profiles that may facilitate the distinction between and understanding of these three entities.

### Essential thrombocythemia: a review of diagnostic and pathologic features [^1164HjFn]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD) characterized predominately by thrombocytosis and abnormal megakaryocyte proliferation. The current diagnostic criteria require a combination of clinical, histologic, and cytogenetic data. The diagnosis relies largely on exclusion of other causes of thrombocytosis.

Objective

Describe historical, clinical, and laboratory features of ET in order to understand, clarify, and more accurately diagnose this entity.

Data Sources

Review contemporary and historical literature on ET and other causes of thrombocytosis.

Conclusions

ET is a relatively indolent and often asymptomatic CMPD that is characterized primarily by a sustained elevation in platelets ≥ 600 × 10³/microL (≥ 600 × 10⁹/L), proliferating enlarged and hyperlobated megakaryocytes, and minimal to absent bone marrow fibrosis. Significant changes and revisions to the diagnostic requirements and criteria for ET have occurred during the last 30 years. Recently, a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene has been found in a significant number of cases of ET and other CMPDs. In up to 57% of ET cases, a mutation in the JAK2 gene can be detected. In the absence of a JAK2 mutation and features of another CMPD, the diagnosis of ET remains a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of thrombocytosis have been excluded.

### An agenda for future research projects in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia [^111j8uTM]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Can we improve the prevention and treatment of post-myeloproliferative neoplasms-acute myeloid leukemia?

Leukemia transformation of PV and ET is part of the natural history of these diseases. The risk of leukemic transformation is highest in PMF, but a sizeable proportion of PV and ET patients are involved, with an estimated risk of 3% and 1% at 10 years, respectively. It is likely that, in these patients, the unrestricted proliferation of bone marrow progenitors lasting for many years may itself favor the leukemic transformation, and, not surprisingly, older age, leukocytosis, and massive thrombocytosis represent significant risk factors in both PV and ET. Most importantly, biologic characteristics such as abnormal karyotype, presence of SRSF2 or IDH2 mutations are emerging risk factors in PV. In ET, anemia, older age, leukocytosis, and presence of TP53 or EZH2 mutations have been reported as risk factors. Therefore, NGS-based molecular profile performed at diagnosis and during the course of the disease may provide important information to identify patients at higher risk of disease progression and leukemia transformation.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

We herein report on a 26‐year‐old Caucasian female who was referred to our outpatient clinic with a history of abnormal blood count, including thrombocytosis and monocytosis known for the last 7 years. No family history of hematological disorders was reported. Her past medical history was significant for a papillary thyroid carcinoma that was treated with surgery and radioiodine therapy, obtaining a complete remission; the patient is currently taking levothyroxine. Her physical exam was normal and no signs and/or symptoms of infection were noticed.

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 450 × 10⁹/L, is a common finding in routine blood tests and a common cause of referral to hematologists for further investigation. Causes of thrombocytosis can be grouped into primary, secondary, and spurious (Table 1). To find out the etiology of the thrombocytosis, the clinical hematologist should take into consideration data from familial and medical history, physical examination, results of hematological exams, clonal genetic abnormalities and bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy for morphological features, flow cytometric data, and cytogenetic and molecular markers of clonality.

TABLE 1
Causes of thrombocytosis

During the visit, we performed additional blood tests. A complete blood count revealed the following values: Hemoglobin 150 g/L, hematocrit 42.8%, mean cell volume 88 fL, white blood cell count 10.23 × 10⁹/L, and platelet count 582 × 10⁹/L. Differential white blood cell count revealed a normal absolute neutrophil count and a slightly increased number of monocytes (1.2 × 10⁹/L). Morphological examination of peripheral blood smear confirmed the higher‐than‐normal platelet count with no significant platelet clumping and also showed several target cells, acanthocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies within red blood cells (Figure 1 A). C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results within the normal range. Serum levels of iron, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were normal. Serum level of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was within the normal range. A chest X‐ray revealed no abnormalities attributable to pulmonary infection. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of infection and reported limited visualization of the spleen. The BCR‐ABL rearrangement was absent in peripheral blood. No mutations of JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes were found in DNA from peripheral blood granulocytes.

### Thrombocytosis and megakaryocyte changes associated with PRCA [^113DSJVb]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Acquired pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare hematological disorder that results from failure of erythropoiesis, and can be distinguished from other bone marrow failure disorders by reticulocytopenia, normal granulopoiesis, and megakaryopoiesis. PRCA is often idiopathic and likely due to cytotoxic T-cell–mediated destruction of early erythroid precursors. Indeed, it can be associated with conditions such as T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell dyscrasia, thymoma, immunodeficiency, and infections.,

Thrombocytosis refers to an abnormal elevation in platelet count of > 450000 × 10⁹/L. This condition can be related to a primary process, usually associated with a myeloproliferative neoplasm known as essential thrombocythemia, but it more commonly presents as an epiphenomenon of other causes that include iron deficiency, chronic inflammatory conditions, and asplenia. Thrombocytosis has not been associated with PRCA. Herein, we report a cohort of patients with PRCA and thrombocytosis that have not been defined in the literature.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on patient records diagnosed with PRCA at the University of Texas Southwestern and Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 2000 and 2022. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The primary objective was to investigate the presence of thrombocytosis and/or megakaryocyte changes in these PRCA cases. Clinical, laboratory, and molecular data were abstracted, adhering to the guidelines established by the Declaration of Helsinki and the respective participating institutions.

Among a total of 90 patients, comprehensive analysis of 27 cases were identified as having acquired PRCA with thrombocytosis and/or megakaryocyte changes noted on bone marrow biopsies (Table 1) examined. To assess treatment efficacy, hemoglobin and platelet count before and after resolution of PRCA were compared. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality. For normally distributed data, a paired t test was performed. For nonnormally distributed data, a Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was performed. For all relevant comparisons, a P value < .05 was used to set statistical significance.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a diagnostic and management challenge with emerging areas for exploration [^1161c2nN]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite published algorithms for approaching the work-up of erythrocytosis, a significant proportion of patients are left with uncertainty as to its aetiology and prognosis. The term 'idiopathic erythrocytosis' (IE) is applied when known primary and secondary aetiologies have been ruled out. However, the assignment of secondary aetiologies is not always straightforward or evidence based, which can lead to misdiagnosis and heterogeneity in cohort studies. Furthermore, new studies have identified germline or somatic mutations that may affect prognosis. Epidemiological and cohort data are inconsistent as to whether IE increases the risk for complications such as arterial and venous thromboembolism, clonal transformation or comorbid conditions. Randomized trials assessing the role of phlebotomy for long-term management of IE have not been performed, so treatment remains a vexing problem for clinicians. Standardization of terminology and testing strategies, including comprehensive genetic screening in clinical research, are key to refining our understanding of IE.

### Essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis: current management and the prospect of targeted therapy [^112KaA77]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

The recent discovery of JAK2 and/or MPL mutations in polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) has had a major impact on how we diagnose and treat these disorders. For instance, the presence of a JAK2 mutation is now considered conditio sine qua non for the diagnosis of PV and the World Health Organization classification system has recently revised its diagnostic criteria for PV, ET, and PMF to include JAK2 and MPL mutations as clonal markers. From the standpoint of treatment, JAK-STAT is now identified as a legitimate target pathway for drug development in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Herein, I will first outline my views regarding current management in ET, PV, and PMF and then discuss emerging data on preclinical and clinical activity of anti-JAK2 small molecule drugs. Am. J.

### The spectrum of JAK2-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms [^1144fPEc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation triggered an unexpected flowering of basic and clinical studies in the field of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), resulting after just a few years in an exceptional amount of new information. One important consequence of those new findings was the modification of the World Health Organization classification and diagnostic algorithms for these diseases, which is still based on the original concept developed by William Dameshek in 1951 and keeps distinct entities under the umbrella of classical Philadelphia-negative MPNs. These MPNs are essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis. Could a new molecular classification be a better tool to manage MPN patients? Several studies have shown that essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis can be divided into distinct subtypes based on the presence of the JAK2V617F mutation. Can we now define JAK2-positive diseases to depict a distinct entity from JAK2-negative MPNs? This chapter reviews the significance of JAK2 mutation positivity in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of MPNs.

### One thousand patients with essential thrombocythemia: the mayo clinic experience [^115m4yjF]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is one of four JAK2 mutation-prevalent myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and is characterized by a mandatory but not specific thrombocytosis (platelet count ≥ 450 × 10⁹/L) that is proven or presumed to be clonal and not associated with another myeloid neoplasm, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The latter two share common molecular and morphologic traits with ET, including JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations (also known as MPN driver mutations); these mutations are mutually exclusive, for the most part, and their frequencies in ET are ~60% for JAK2, 25% for CALR, and 3% for MPL; of note, these three driver mutations might not be detected in ~10–15% of patients with ET, henceforth referred to as triple-negative ET.

Prognosis in ET is generally favorable with consistent risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications and disease progression into myelofibrosis (post-ET MF) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), also known as "blast phase MPN". Survival in ET approximates that of the general population with median estimated to exceed 30 years in patients younger than 40 years of age. The recently introduced "triple A (AAA)" survival model in ET employs age, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count, in order to risk-stratify patients into high, intermediate-2, intermediate-1, and low-risk groups, with respective median survivals of 8, 13.5, 20.7, and 47 years. In addition, abnormal karyotype and high molecular risk (HMR-ET; SF3B1, TP53) mutations independently predict inferior survival in ET. Current drug therapy has not been shown to modify the natural history of the disease, and its use is primarily directed at the prevention of thrombosis, guided by thrombosis risk models that are based on thrombosis history, age, and presence of JAK2 mutation.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^113fRm4W]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

In view of the persistent thrombocytosis (platelet count was 532 × 10⁹/L at the next blood count), we performed a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy to search for hematological causes. Histological examination (Figure 1 B) revealed a cellularity of 40% and a slightly reduced number of erythroid precursors with a preserved ratio of myeloid to erythroid precursors and a normal number of megakaryocytes without significant abnormalities. The number of CD34+ precursors was also normal (2%–3% of the total nucleated cells). No significant bone marrow reticulin fibrosis was detected (grade 0 according to the WHO grading system). Bone marrow flow cytometric analysis and cytogenetic analysis were also normal.

Bone marrow biopsy is not usually required to investigate a secondary thrombocytosis. However, in absence of a reactive etiology, we performed a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy to search for hematological disorders associated with thrombocytosis.

The most common hematological malignancies associated with thrombocytosis are chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR‐ABL1 positive, and the so‐called Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (i.e. polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis). In our case, all of these entities were ruled out because of the absence of their typical molecular markers (searched on peripheral blood, see the previous paragraph) associated with normal findings on bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy examination. The diagnosis of a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (e.g. atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR‐ABL1 ‐negative, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis) was also excluded by cytomorphological examination of the bone marrow aspirate. The absence of a clonal marker at cytogenetics also supported the nonclonal etiology of the thrombocytosis.

### European bone marrow working group trial on reproducibility of World Health Organization criteria to discriminate essential thrombocythemia from prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis [^116tfRMj]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms discriminates between essential thrombocythemia and the prefibrotic phase of primary myelofibrosis. This discrimination is clinically relevant because essential thrombocythemia is associated with a favorable prognosis whereas patients with primary myelofibrosis have a higher risk of progression to myelofibrosis or blast crisis.

Design and Methods

To assess the reproducibility of the classification, six hematopathologists from five European countries re-classified 102 non-fibrotic bone marrow trephines, obtained because of sustained thrombocytosis.

Results

Consensus on histological classification defined as at least four identical diagnoses occurred for 63% of the samples. Inter-observer agreement showed low to moderate kappa values (0.28 to 0.57, average 0.41). The percentage of unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms rose from 2% to 23% when minor criteria for primary myelofibrosis were taken into account. In contrast, the frequency of primary myelofibrosis dropped from 23% to 7%, indicating that the majority of patients with a histological diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis did not fulfill the complete criteria for this disease. Thus, over 50% of cases in this series either could not be reproducibly classified or fell into the category of unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Conclusions

World Health Organization criteria for discrimination of essential thrombocythemia from prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis are poorly to only moderately reproducible and lead to a higher proportion of non-classifiable myeloproliferative neoplasms than histology alone.

Epidemiology

Only a few papers considered epidemiological data specifically for the MPN population and, it was sometimes difficult to assess the presence or absence of chronic myelogenous leukemia among the cases described. Furthermore, there was great variability in the incidence of MPN between countries (United Kingdom, Denmark, Europe, Japan), in the timing of the observation (from 1980 to 2010) and in the age of the patients (below 14 to below 25 years old).

Overall, we found that the global incidence of MPN, in children and young adults, can be estimated to be around 0.82/100,000 patients/year (range, 0.1 to 2.25): the incidence of ET is around 0.6/100,000 patients/year (range, 0.004 to 0.9), against 0.18 for PV and 0.53 for primary myelofibrosis (range, 0.003 to 1.5).

### Peripheral-blood cytopenia, an early indicator of inborn errors of immunity [^11285AhP]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

The pathogenic mechanisms of cytopenia in IEI are multifactorial. They are commonly attributed to cell‐mediated and humoral immune dysfunction or dysregulation, driving autoimmunity and autoinflammation. However, non‐immune causes should also be considered. B‐ and T‐cell responses have a complex interdependent relationship, primary defects resulting in altered maturation and regulation with subsequent decreased number and function. Haemophagocytosis is an important cause of cytopenia, particularly in the paediatric population, and may herald an underlying primary aetiology. Secondary factors such as splenic sequestration and bone‐marrow infiltration by malignancy or infection are non‐immune causes that should not be overlooked (Figure 1).,

FIGURE 1
Mechanisms contributing to cytopenia in inborn errors of immunity (IEI). (A) The pathogenic mechanisms of cytopenia are multifactorial and include: humoral and cell‐mediated immune dysfunction and/or dysregulation, haemophagocytosis, splenic sequestration (secondary to abnormal lymphoproliferation), bone‐marrow dysfunction including ineffective maturation, myelodysplasia, primary bone‐marrow failure and myelosuppression due to secondary infections and bone‐marrow infiltration.(B) Cytoskeletal dysfunction with megakaryocyte dysfunction, increased apoptosis and splenic platelet destruction. Contributory causes of non‐immune thrombocytopenia in IEI include: increased clearance and apoptosis; myelosuppression by infections, myelofibrosis/bone‐marrow malignancy, cytotoxic drugs or transplant are also contributory.(C) Defective myeloid cell differentiation or release of granulocytes from the bone marrow, enhanced apoptosis and increased destruction of peripheral‐blood granulocytes are the main physiological mechanisms underlying chronic severe or intermittent neutropenia in primary immunodeficiency patients.(D) Lymphopenia driven by B‐ and T‐cell‐intrinsic defect with abnormal maturation and defective function, negative selection of autoreactive T lymphocytes in the thymus as well as defects in the number or function of regulatory T‐cells, impaired apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, loss or breakage of tolerance, increased lymphoid production and cytokine secretion which likely also drives the immune dysregulation and associated autoimmune cytopenia.

Primary myelofibrosis, its clinical manifestations and common mutations

Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders arising from clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are the main Philadelphia chromosome negative MPNs. The clinical presentation of each of these disorders varies, although all have the potential for leukemic transformation and thrombohemorrhagic events.

PMF is described as either pre-fibrotic PMF (prePMF) or overt PMF according to the 2016 WHO diagnostic criteria. Compared to the 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria, the 2016 WHO criteria make a distinction between prePMF and overt PMF (Table 1). This distinction is especially important because prePMF can present similarly and be mistaken for ET. Making the correct diagnosis is important given the poorer prognosis, increased mortality and leukemic transformation rate for prePMF compared to ET.

Although a substantial number of patients with polycythemia vera and ET are asymptomatic at presentation, patients with PMF commonly complain of fatigue and symptoms due to splenomegaly. Hallmarks of PMF include expansion of the megakaryocytic lineage, bone marrow (BM) fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoesis (EMH), which occurs predominantly in the liver and spleen, but can manifest anywhere. Patients with PMF can also have portal hypertension primarily through increased splenic blood flow, hepatic EMH and sinusoidal fibrosis. Overall survival for PMF is significantly lower than for polycythemia vera and ET, and one study showed PMF patients were also more likely to have leukemic transformation.

Several somatic mutations have been identified in PMF, including in JAK2, MPL, CALR and several other genes. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase engaged with numerous intracellular signaling pathways involving receptors for erythropoetin, thrombopoetin, interleukin-3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor. A single acquired somatic point mutation at V617F in JAK2 causes MPN in patients. JAK2V617F is found in 95% polycythemia vera patients and detected in ~60% of ET and PMF patients. The JAK2V617F mutation affects the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 and makes JAK2 constitutively active.

### Spontaneous resolution of extreme thrombocytosis in 2 children [^114BiGYv]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is rare in children, sometimes difficult to be distinguished from secondary thrombocytosis. This report concerns 2 children with extreme thrombocytosis of 4100 × 10(9)/L and 1644 × 10(9)/L with partial and complete remission at 3 months and 4 years from diagnosis, with a follow-up of 4 and 17 years, respectively, with no cytoreduction therapy. Diagnosis of ET was suggested according to accepted criteria. However, spontaneous remission of the thrombocytosis argues for the diagnosis of secondary thrombocytosis. These patients highlight the complexity of distinguishing childhood ET from secondary thrombocytosis and the need for cautious personalized decision on cytoreduction therapy.

Consensus guidelines have helped to standardize the care of patients with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, focusing on reducing the risk of thrombosis, mitigating symptoms, and avoiding therapies that may accelerate disease progression. However, many unmet needs still exist ranging from the roll of antiplatelet therapy in ET to medications that reduce disease progression. Retrospective studies suggest an improvement in myelofibrosis-free survival for treatment with interferons; new agents are looking to also enact disease modification.

Mutations and their diagnostic and prognostic utility

From 2005 onwards, more than 20 somatic mutations have been described in MPN. The first mutation described (that is, JAK2 V617F), which is also the most frequent, involves Janus kinase 2 (JAK2 located on chromosome 9p24). JAK2 V617F mutational frequency is estimated at 97% in PV, 50–60% in ET and 55–65% in PMF. However, JAK2 V617F is not specific to MPN and is also seen in less than 5% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and other myeloid malignancies. Of note, JAK2 V617F mutational frequency as high as 50% has been reported in the MDS/MPN overlap syndrome of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis. Subsequent to the discovery of JAK2 V617F, other JAK2 mutations (for example, JAK2 exon 12 mutations) were described in JAK2 -unmutated PV and characterized by predominantly erythroid myelopoiesis. JAK2 mutations are not present in the normal control population and in patients with non-clonal erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis. Accordingly, JAK2 mutation screening was adopted, as a useful clonal marker, by the WHO system of hematopoietic tumor classification, in its 2008 revised document. In routine clinical practice, the absence of a JAK2 mutation makes the diagnosis of PV unlikely but its presence cannot, by itself, distinguish PV from ET or PMF, thus the need for BM examination. Rare cases of JAK2 -unmutated 'PV' have been associated with LNK.

### Histological and genetic characterization and follow-up of 130 patients with chronic triple-negative thrombocytosis [^115dDsfD]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic thrombocytosis may be reactive in nature, be driven by inherited genetic characteristics (e.g. THPO, MPL, JAK2 mutations) or be caused by an acquired myeloid malignancy (mainly myeloproliferative neoplasm [MPN]). The diagnostic workup of isolated thrombocytosis therefore requires testing for inflammation/iron deficiency, consideration of a family history, a bone marrow examination and the search for "classical" MPN driver mutations (BCR-ABL1, JAK2 V617F, CALR exon 9, MPL W515L/K). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the diagnosis of essential thrombocytosis (ET) requires typical histological features. In the absence of a driver mutation, histological characterization is the only element allowing classification of thrombocytosis as ET. However, a number of patients with a clinical presentation of "triple-negative" acquired thrombocytosis do not display the characteristic histological features of ET or of MPN, raising the question of appropriate therapeutic management. Indeed, in the presence of "high-risk" features (age > 60 years, a history of thrombosis), cytoreductive therapy has been demonstrated to reduce the thrombotic risk in MPN patients; however, when the diagnosis of MPN is uncertain because of the lack of typical histological features, it is not known whether patients would benefit from cytoreductive treatment. Previous studies have shown that next-generation sequencing (NGS) could detect variants in 12 to 73% of cases of triple-negative thrombocytosisVariants can be acquired in genes frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies or may be identify as germline variants in genes involved in megakaryocytic proliferation, even in the absence of a familial history of thrombocytosis (mainly JAK2, MPL). Efforts at finding a common genetic alteration in triple-negative ET have, in fact, reinforced the idea that this group of patients is heterogeneous, with clonal or non-clonal hematopoiesis and identification of additional acquired as well as constitutive JAK2, MPL or SH2B3 variants, but no common recurrent anomaly.

Polycythemia vera

The key diagnostic issue in PV is which red cell parameters (Hb, Hct) may be more conveniently used as a surrogate of an increased red cell mass as measured by the isotope test. According to the 2007/2008 updated WHO classification, the first major diagnostic criterion requires one of the following four components: Hb level > 18.5 g/dl in men and > 16.5 g/dl in women or red cell mass that is > 25% above mean normal predicted, or Hb level > 17 g/dl in men (> 15 g/dl in women) associated with a sustained increase of ⩾2 g/dl from baseline that cannot be attributed to correction of iron deficiency. Altogether it has been argued that application of these criteria may result in an underdiagnosis of PV by excluding patients with actual red cell mass that is 25% above mean predicted value, but whose Hb and Hct levels are below the WHO guidelines. Recently, the term masked PV (mPV) was re-introducedfor JAK2 -mutated patients with latent (initial, occult pre-polycythemic) disease manifestations who present with a BM morphology consistent with PV and display persistently raised Hb levels between 16.0 and 18.5 g/dl for men and 15.0 and 16.5 g/dl for women. Subsequently, a Hb level of 16.5 g/dl in men and 16.0 g/dl for women or in accordance with the BCSH criteria, a Hct level of 49% in men and 48% in women was determined to be the optimal cutoff levels for distinguishing JAK2 -mutated ET from mPV. These data were entered in the new proposal for the WHOand accordingly shown in Table 1. The clinical relevance of recognizing mPV was demonstrated in a recent study on 66 JAK2 -mutated patients younger than 40 years who revealed a higher risk of thrombosis compared with a control group of 97 cases with overt PV due to the less frequent use of phlebotomies or cytoreductive treatment. Altogether based on these clinical findings and the fact that BM morphology is superimposable to that of overt PV, according to the original 2008 criteria, it makes little sense that the term mPV is maintained, because it may be argued that this entity is in fact fully consistent with PV. Finally, the use of the endogenous erythroid colony growth assay was discarded as a minor diagnostic criteriondue to limited practicability (time consuming, no standardization, restricted to specialized institutions, costly).

### Thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms: a viewpoint on its impact on myelofibrosis, mortality, and solid tumors [^116jbpEz]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The classic chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). These disorders are characterized by a high incidence of arterial and venous thrombotic events, potential progression to post-PV and post-ET myelofibrosis, and acute leukemia. Understanding of the pathophysiology of MPNs has improved significantly with the identification of common genetic mutations, most notably the JAK2 V617F mutation, which is found in over 95% of PV and approximately 60–70% of ET and PMF cases. Therapy is aimed at reducing the incidence of thrombosis, which is a major cause of death and severe disability in some patients.

Recent reports suggest that the occurrence of thrombosis, particularly arterial events during the course of PV and ET, may pose additional risks such as progression to myelofibrosis, increased mortality, and the development of secondary solid tumors. These risks arise from disease-related clonal hematopoiesis and subsequent chronic systemic inflammation, leading to thrombosis and genetic instability.

In our large databases of patients with MPN, we investigated the incidence and risk factors of thrombosis that may explain this association, culminating in an increased risk of mortality. This Viewpoint presents our findings with the goal of clarifying the current clinical evidence regarding key events that influence disease severity and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. This work is not intended to be a systematic review of the literature, but rather a perspective to stimulate interest and further research into these critical issues.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs; formerly chronic myeloproliferative disorders) are a class of myeloid hematologic malignancies that represent a stem cell-derived expansion of 1 or more hematopoietic cell lineages. The current 2008 World Health Organization system recognizes 8 types of MPN: chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, polycythemia vera, primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, mastocytosis, and myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable. This review summarizes the salient characteristics of the MPNs, with emphasis on recent developments in the molecular pathophysiology and therapeutic monitoring of these disorders.

Introduction

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders involving excessive proliferation of terminally differentiated myeloid cells of one or more lineage. The classical Philadelphia chromosome (BCR::ABL1) -negative MPNs are polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PM), which are associated with increased risk of thrombosis, systemic symptoms related to increased cytokine production such as aquagenic pruritus, risk of progression to myelofibrosis (in the case of PV and ET), and potential for leukemic transformation. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is defined by the BCR::ABL1 fusion protein resulting from t(9;22)(q34; q11), which is required for diagnosis according to 5 th edition WHO classifications. Other MPNs include chronic neutrophilia leukemia (CNL), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/MPN overlap neoplasms. Here, we focus on the classical BCR::ABL1 -negative MPNs.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms and vascular complications

Vascular complications are the most common clinical sequelae and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in MPN patients. The incidence and the characteristic clinical presentations of vascular events in MPN patients are summarized in Table 1.

Thrombotic events are often the initial manifestation of an MPN or may precede the diagnosis of the MPN. Thrombosis appears to be more common among patients with polycythemia vera than in those with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis both at diagnosisand during follow up(Table 1). Bleeding episodes are less frequent than thrombotic events in MPN patients; and, contrary to thrombosis, occur primarily after the diagnosis of the MPN has been established(Table 1).

### Incidence of cancer among adults with thrombocytosis in Canada… [^117AXX7q]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

The discovery that spontaneous thrombosis was often followed by a diagnosis of cancer was made in 1865 by Armand Trousseau. 1 The onset of venous thromboembolism has been seen with several types of cancer. 2–4 Patients with newly diagnosed cancer often have concomitant thrombocytosis, which is typically defined as a platelet count greater than 450 × 10⁹/L.
5. A high platelet count was associated with greater RRs for kidney and cervical cancer during the first 6 months after diagnosis of thrombocytosis; however, the absolute risk of these cancers was small. In this retrospective cohort study, we found a statistically significant association between a high platelet count and the development of a solid tumor within 5 years of the detection of thrombocytosis.

The relative risks were most pronounced for lung cancer, ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, and gastrointestinal malignant tumors. The relative risk was greatest during the 6-month period after the diagnosis of thrombocytosis and decreased rapidly thereafter. This finding suggests that thrombocytosis may be a clinical marker for the presence of an existing cancer rather than being a factor associated with increased cancer risk and that cancer may lead to thrombocytosis rather than thrombocytosis being associated with the risk of developing a new cancer. The primary analysis focused on thrombocytosis, using the definition of a platelet count greater than 450 × 10⁹/L. In a sensitivity analysis, we defined thrombocytosis as a platelet count greater than 400 × 10⁹/L. The findings were comparable with those of the primary analysis.

This cohort study found that an increased platelet count among individuals with normal platelet levels in the prior 2 years was associated with an increased risk of cancer. Increased risk of a solid-tumor diagnosis was predominant among lung, ovarian, kidney, and gastrointestinal malignant tumors. The findings suggest that individuals with unexplained thrombocytosis should be offered screening for several common cancers.
