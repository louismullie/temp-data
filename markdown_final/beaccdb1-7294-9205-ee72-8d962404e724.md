## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which factor(s) the speed of sound in air depends on, with options including temperature, frequency, wavelength, loudness, source, wind direction, all, or none. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental physics relationship for the speed of sound in a gas. Then, I should verify which parameters in that equation are variables versus constants in air. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that framework. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and select the best option, making sure I don't overstate dependencies that aren't supported by the physics.

> Let me first confirm the core relationship. The speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by v = √(γRT/M), where γ is the adiabatic index, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and M is the molar mass of the gas. In air at typical conditions, γ and M are essentially constant, so the speed of sound varies with the square root of the absolute temperature, which means it increases as temperature rises and decreases as temperature falls [^d7c0e709].

> Wait, let me verify the implication for the options. Because the formula depends explicitly on T, the speed of sound in air depends on air temperature, so option A is correct. I should also confirm that this is treated as a physical fact in authoritative sources; indeed, audiology and acoustics guidelines list this as an acoustic or physical fact underpinning clinical and technical considerations, reinforcing that temperature is the primary environmental determinant of sound speed in air [^d7c0e709].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about frequency and wavelength. I need to check whether the speed equals frequency times wavelength and whether that implies dependence on frequency or wavelength. The relationship v = fλ is true by definition, but in a nondispersive medium like air, v is constant for a given temperature, so frequency and wavelength are inversely related and the speed does not depend on either one; thus, options B and C are incorrect, even though the v = fλ identity is always valid [^d7c0e709].

> I will now examine loudness and the sound source. Loudness relates to amplitude, not to the propagation speed of the wave, and the source identity does not alter the medium's intrinsic sound speed; neither amplitude nor source characteristics appear in the speed equation, so options D and E are incorrect. Let me reconsider to ensure I'm not missing a nonlinear effect; at ordinary sound pressure levels in air, nonlinearities do not meaningfully change the speed, so these remain incorrect for typical conditions [^d7c0e709].

> Next, I should review wind direction. Wind is a bulk motion of the air mass, and while it can add or subtract vectorially to the effective speed of sound relative to a ground-based observer, it does not change the intrinsic speed of sound in the medium itself; thus, the speed of sound in air does not fundamentally depend on wind direction, making option F incorrect from a physics standpoint, even though wind can affect observed transit times in practice [^d7c0e709].

> But wait, what if multiple options seem plausible because of everyday observations? I should double-check that I'm not conflating perception with propagation physics. Everyday experiences with wind, different instruments, or louder sounds might create the impression that speed varies with those factors, yet the thermodynamic derivation shows only temperature changes the intrinsic speed; therefore, the correct answer is not "All of these" nor "None of these", but specifically option A, air temperature [^d7c0e709].

> Final answer: A. Air temperature.

---

The speed of sound in air depends primarily on **air temperature** [^d7c0e709], increasing by about 0.6 m/s for each 1°C rise. It is **independent of frequency, wavelength, loudness, and the sound source** [^d7c0e709], and wind direction has only a minor, indirect effect via temperature or motion of the medium, not a direct effect on the intrinsic speed. Therefore, the correct answer is **A. air temperature**.

---

## Physical principles governing the speed of sound in air

The speed of sound in air is determined by the **properties of the medium**, specifically its density and elasticity. The relationship is expressed by the formula:

v = √(γRT/M)

where:

- v is the speed of sound,
- γ is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats),
- R is the universal gas constant,
- T is the absolute temperature,
- M is the molar mass of the gas.

This formula shows that the speed of sound is **directly proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature** [^d7c0e709], indicating that as temperature increases, the speed of sound increases, and vice versa.

---

## Dependence on air temperature

Air temperature is the **primary factor** influencing the speed of sound in air. The speed of sound increases by approximately 0.6 meters per second (m/s) for every 1°C rise in temperature. This relationship is due to the increased kinetic energy of air molecules at higher temperatures, leading to faster propagation of sound waves.

---

## Independence from frequency and wavelength

The speed of sound in air is **independent of frequency and wavelength** [^d7c0e709]. This means that high-pitched and low-pitched sounds travel at the same speed in a given medium, assuming constant temperature and other environmental conditions. The relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength is given by the equation v = fλ, where v is constant for a given medium, and changes in frequency result in corresponding changes in wavelength to maintain a constant speed.

---

## Independence from loudness and sound source

The speed of sound in air is also **independent of the loudness** of the sound and the **source of the sound** [^d7c0e709]. Loudness is a measure of the amplitude of the sound wave, which affects the perceived intensity but does not influence the speed at which the sound wave travels. Similarly, the source of the sound (e.g. human voice, musical instrument, or mechanical device) does not affect the speed of sound in air.

---

## Effect of wind direction

Wind direction has a **minimal indirect effect** on the speed of sound. While wind can carry sound waves, thereby affecting the effective speed of sound relative to a stationary observer, it does not directly alter the intrinsic speed of sound in the medium. The primary influence of wind is through changes in air temperature or motion of the medium, rather than a direct modification of the speed of sound itself.

---

## Summary of factors influencing the speed of sound in air

| **Factor** | **Effect on speed of sound** |
|-|-|
| Air temperature | Directly proportional; increases with temperature |
| Frequency | Independent |
| Wavelength | Independent |
| Loudness | Independent |
| Source of sound | Independent |
| Wind direction | Minimal indirect effect |

---

The speed of sound in air depends primarily on **air temperature** [^d7c0e709], increasing with higher temperatures and decreasing with lower temperatures. It is independent of frequency, wavelength, loudness, and the source of the sound, and wind direction has only a minimal indirect effect. Therefore, the correct answer is **A. air temperature**.

### Hellenic consensus oninfection [^f94356a2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since its isolation in 1983, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been one of the most interesting research fields in gastroenterology. Its significance in both benign and malignant gastric disease is well recognized all over the world, as are its extragastric manifestations. However, its epidemiology varies in various parts of the globe, while in addition research is evolving. As a result, various scientific boards have organized consensus meetings of experts and published the relevant guidelines. No doubt these guidelines are very useful and help the clinicians in their clinical practice. However, given the local differences, it is of importance for national scientific gastroenterological societies to organize their own consensus meetings and to adapt guidelines to their own countries. Towards this end, the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology recently organized the "Hellenic consensus on H. pylori infection". The aim of this publication is to report the guidelines in order to aid the local gastroenterology community in the management of H. pylori infection.

### Universal newborn hearing screening: summary of evidence [^4eb9c251]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Each year, approximately 5000 infants are born in the United States with moderate-to-profound, bilateral permanent hearing loss (PHL). Universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) has been proposed as a means to speed diagnosis and treatment and thereby improve language outcomes in these children.

Objectives

To identify strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the evidence supporting UNHS and to compare the additional benefits and harms of UNHS with those of selective screening of high-risk newborns.

Data Sources

We searched the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases for relevant articles published from 1994 to August 2001, using terms for hearing disorders, infants or newborns, screening, and relevant treatments. We contacted experts and reviewed reference lists to identify additional articles, including those published before 1994.

Study Selection

We included controlled and observational studies of (1) the accuracy, yield, and harms of screening using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), or both in the general newborn population and (2) the effects of screening or early identification and treatment on language outcomes. Of an original 340 articles identified, 19 articles, including 1 controlled trial, met these inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Data on population, test performance, outcomes, and methodological quality were extracted by 2 authors (D.C.T. H.M.) using prespecified criteria developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force. We queried authors when information needed to assess study quality was missing.

Data Synthesis

Good-quality studies show that from 2041 to 2794 low-risk and 86 to 208 high-risk newborns were screened to find 1 case of moderate-to-profound PHL. The best estimate of positive predictive value was 6.7%. Six percent to 15% of infants who are missed by the screening tests are subsequently diagnosed with bilateral PHL. In a trial of UNHS vs clinical screening at age 8 months, UNHS increased the proportion of infants with moderate-to-severe hearing loss diagnosed by age 10 months (57% vs 14%) but did not reduce the rate of diagnosis after age 18 months. No good-quality controlled study has compared UNHS with selective screening of high-risk newborns. In fair- to poor-quality cohort studies, intervention before age 6 months was associated with improved language and communication skills by ages 2 to 5 years. These studies had unclear criteria for selecting subjects, and none compared an inception cohort of low-risk newborns identified by screening with those identified in usual care, making it impossible to exclude selection bias as an explanation for the results. In a mathematical model based on the literature review, we estimated that extending screening to low-risk infants would detect 1 additional case before age 10 months for every 1441 low-risk infants screened, and result in treatment before 10 months of 1 additional case for every 2401 low-risk infants screened. With UNHS, 254 newborns would be referred for audiological evaluation because of false-positive second-stage screening test results vs 48 for selective screening.

Conclusions

Modern screening tests for hearing impairment can improve identification of newborns with PHL, but the efficacy of UNHS to improve long-term language outcomes remains uncertain.

### Haemophilus influenzae as a possible cause of Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^757b3b2d]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2004). Low credibility.

Recent reports have contained conflicting results on the relationship between antecedent Haemophilus influenzae infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). To investigate the prevalence of H. influenzae infection in GBS patients in a British population, we carried out a retrospective study with 62 consecutive GBS patients and 63 normal controls of similar age and sex. Whole bacteria of both encapsulated and nonencapsulated strains of H. influenzae were employed as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-H. influenzae IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies. Elevated antibodies of two or three classes were found in one GBS patient and none in the normal controls. Six GBS patients had IgG antibodies against nonencapsulated H. influenzae compared with only one in the normal control group (p = 0.06). Western blot for IgG antibody showed that all the sera with IgG antibodies recognized the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of both strains of H. influenzae. Antiganglioside GM1 antibody was not associated with anti-H. influenzae antibody in our study. Absorption with encapsulated or nonencapsulated H. influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli before testing on Western blot showed that only nonencapsulated H. influenzae absorbed the anti-LPS antibodies. In conclusion, there is a possible but rare association of GBS with nonencapsulated H. influenzae in the UK.

### Range nudges enhance behavioural adherence to safety and health guidelines [^b2a638e5]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Below we discuss how our findings relate to the two underlying mechanisms of the anchoring effects.
Insufficient adjustment: When a driver intending to travel at 100 km/h encounters a speed limit sign of '60 km/h', the adjustment process starts from '60 km/h' towards 100 km/h. Consequently, drivers are likely to exceed the limit, often choosing a speed somewhere between 60 km/h and 100 km/h. On the other hand, even drivers who initially intend to travel below 60 km/h may treat a 60 km/h speed limit as an anchor. As a result, they may accelerate towards that target and adopt speeds close to the limit. By contrast, when a driver encounters a speed limit sign of '0–60 km/h', the adjustment process starts at '0', proceeds towards the speed limit of 60 km/h, and then continues towards the driver's intended speed (e.g. 100 km/h). As a result, drivers tend to adjust insufficiently towards 100 km/h compared to when the adjustment starts from 60 km/h. These results demonstrate that even when the information presented is logically equivalent (e.g. 'less than 60 km/h' and '0–60 km/h'), the explicit presentation of an additional limit (i.e. 0 in '0–60 km/h') exerts a stronger influence on the adjustment process than the semantic range implied by a single limit (i.e. '60 km/h').
Selective accessibility –: Exposure to a speed limit sign of '60 km/h' may increase the accessibility of information related to speeding, potentially encouraging drivers to adopt speeds close to the limit. In contrast, exposure to a sign '0–60 km/h' — through the explicit presentation of the lower anchor of 0 — may selectively activate information related to the lower bound, such as 'very low speeds' or 'safe driving'. Consequently, variations in accessible information due to range notation can explain differences in chosen speeds. This finding reveals that even when the information presented is logically equivalent (e.g. 'less than 60 km/h' and '0–60 km/h'), the signs '60 km/h' and '0–60 km/h' activate different sets of information.

### H + ion activation and inactivation of the ventricular gap junction: a basis for spatial regulation of intracellular pH [^c87ca7f2]. Circulation Research (2007). Low credibility.

H(+) ions are powerful modulators of cardiac function, liberated during metabolic activity. Among their physiological effects is a chemical gating of cell-to-cell communication, caused by H(+)-mediated closure of connexin (Cx) channels at gap junctions. This protects surrounding tissue from the damaging effects of local intracellular acidosis. Cx proteins (largely Cx-43 in ventricle) form multimeric pores between cells, permitting translocation of ions and other solutes up to approximately 1 kDa. The channels are essential for electrical and metabolic coordination of a tissue. Here we demonstrate that, contrary to expectation, H(+) ions can induce an increase of gap-junctional permeability. This occurs during modest intracellular acid loads in myocyte pairs isolated from mammalian ventricle. We show that the increase in permeability allows a local rise of [H(+)](i) to dissipate into neighboring myocytes, thereby providing a mechanism for spatially regulating intracellular pH (pH(i)). During larger acid loads, the increased permeability is overridden by a more familiar H(+)-dependent inhibition (H(+) inactivation). This restricts cell-to-cell H(+) movement, while allowing sarcolemmal H(+) transporters such as Na(+)/H(+) exchange, to extrude the acid from the cell. The H(+) sensitivity of Cx channels therefore defines whether junctional or sarcolemmal mechanisms are selected locally for the removal of an acid load. The bell-shaped pH dependence of permeability suggests that, in addition to H(+) inactivation, an H(+) activation process regulates the ensemble of Cx channels open at the junction. As well as promoting spatial pH(i) regulation, H(+) activation of junctional permeability may link increased metabolic activity to improved myocardial coupling, the better to meet mechanical demand.

99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP interpretation — begin with visual assessment of planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images to confirm diffuse myocardial uptake and exclude nonmyocardial sources; if excess blood pool activity is noted, repeat SPECT at 3 h. If myocardial tracer uptake is visually present on SPECT, proceed to semi-quantitative visual grading; if no myocardial tracer uptake is present on SPECT, the visual grade is 0. Grade 0 is no myocardial uptake with normal bone uptake, grade 1 is myocardial uptake less than rib uptake, grade 2 is myocardial uptake equal to rib uptake, and grade 3 is myocardial uptake greater than rib uptake with mild/absent rib uptake. For heart/contralateral lung (H/CL) assessment, draw a circular ROI over the anterior heart and mirror it over the contralateral chest above the diaphragm, then calculate H/CL as the fraction of heart ROI mean counts to contralateral lung ROI mean counts. An H/CL ratio of ≥ 1.5 at 1 h can accurately identify ATTR cardiac amyloidosis if myocardial PYP uptake is visually confirmed on SPECT and systemic AL amyloidosis is excluded; an H/CL ratio of ≥ 1.3 at 3 h can identify ATTR cardiac amyloidosis. Diagnosis of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis cannot be made solely based on H/CL ratio with PYP and is not recommended if there is absence of myocardial uptake on SPECT; if the visual grade is 2 or 3, a diagnosis is confirmed and H/CL assessment is not necessary, though it may help classify equivocal grade 1 vs 2. Grade 2 or Grade 3 uptake is consistent with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis if a monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasia is excluded, as this degree of uptake can be seen in > 20% of patients with AL cardiac amyloidosis; Grade 0 and Grade 1 uptake may be observed in AL cardiac amyloidosis and warrants further evaluation to exclude AL amyloidosis, emphasizing serum immunofixation and a serum free light-chains assay in all patients with suspected amyloidosis. 99mTc-PYP/DPD/HMDP uptake could also be seen in pericarditis, myocardial infarction (regional uptake), and chemotherapy or drug-associated myocardial toxicity.

Three per cent of the global COVID-19 publications were contributed by 42 African countries

Globally, a total of 36 326 documents on SARS-CoV-2 covering 27 subject areas were published 10 months into the pandemic in August 2020 (table 1). Forty-two African countries produced 1130 documents (cited 2923 times), representing 3% of the global share of COVID-19 publications. The global h-index of COVID-19 publications is 260 (of all documents considered for the h-index, 260 have been cited at least 260 times), while the h-index for Africa is 42. The global and African distribution of COVID-19 publications were comparable by access type (open access: global, 82%; Africa, 82%), publication status (final: global, 72%; Africa, 74%) and document type (article, letter, review and editorial: global, 49%, 20%, 11% and 9%; Africa, 49%, 18%, 13% and 8%). Africans published in 4 (English, 97.6%; French, 2%; Spanish, 0.3%; Arabic, 0.1%) out of the 27 languages represented in the COVID-19 literature. The most represented subject areas were medicine (global, 76%; Africa, 68%), biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology (global, 10%; Africa, 11%), social sciences (global, 8%; and Africa, 9%), immunology and microbiology (global, 7%; Africa, 9%).

Medullary thyroid carcinoma — MEN2A hyperparathyroidism (HPTH) surveillance and management include that surveillance for HPTH should include albumin-corrected calcium or ionized serum calcium measurements (with or without serum intact-PTH levels) beginning at age 11 years in patients in the ATA-H category and at age 16 years in patients in the ATA-MOD category, and in a study of 188 patients with MEN2A (ATA-H category), 36 had HPTH with a mean age at diagnosis of 33.7 years (range 12–70 years) and cases reported in children as early as 2, 6, 7, and 10 years of age. Patients in the ATA-H and ATA-MOD categories should be screened for HPTH at the time of screening for PHEO (by age 11 years in patients in the ATA-H category and by age 16 years in patients in the ATA-MOD category) (Grade C Recommendation). In patients with HPTH only visibly enlarged parathyroid glands should be resected, and if all four glands are enlarged surgical options include subtotal parathyroidectomy with a piece of one gland left in situ on a vascular pedicle or total parathyroidectomy with a heterotopic autograft (Grade C Recommendation). Patients who develop HPTH subsequent to thyroidectomy for MTC should have localization studies performed prior to re-exploration; if only one enlarged parathyroid gland is found, normal size glands should be left in situ, and if one enlarged gland is identified with histological documentation that three parathyroid glands have been removed previously, a portion of the enlarged gland should either be left in situ with an adequate blood supply or grafted to a heterotopic site (Grade C Recommendation). If the patient remains hyperparathyroid despite one or more operations, or the patient is not a candidate for parathyroidectomy, medical therapy with calcimimetics should be considered.

Identifying haplotype sharing between H. bakeri and H. polgyrus

To identify haplotype sharing between H. bakeri and H. polygyrus, we first used miniprot 0.7-r20and the longest isoform of each protein-coding gene in the nxHelBake1.1 reference to predict genes all five non-reference H. bakeri haplotype assemblies, all four H. polygyrus haplotype assemblies, and the H. mixtum assembly. We filtered the miniprot predictions to include only the top-ranked prediction per protein and removed any predictions that had more than one stop codon or that had a frameshift. We extracted the protein sequences from the filtered GFF3 files using AGAT. For every hyper-divergent gene, we extracted the predicted protein sequence from all H. bakeri haplotypes where that gene was classified as hyper-divergent, along with the predicted protein sequences in all H. polygyrus haplotypes and in H. mixtum. We filtered any groups that lacked either a H. polygyrus or H. mixtum representative and that had only one H. bakeri representative. We aligned the remaining groups of protein sequences using FSA and inferred gene trees using IQ-TREE using the LG substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation among sites (+Γ) and 1000 ultrafast bootstraps. We then used a custom Python script (available at) and the ete3 Python moduleto root gene tree using the H. mixtum protein sequence as the outgroup and then traverse the unrooted tree to find clades that contained both H. bakeri and H. polygyrus sequences (i.e.g.ene trees where the H. bakeri and H. polygyrus sequences did not form two separate clades) that had bootstrap support of 50 or greater. To prevent mispredicted or misaligned sequences from influencing our results, we calculated the median distance between the H. mixtum sequence and the H. bakeri and H. polygyrus sequences in each gene tree and removed any sequences whose distance to H. mixtum was ≥ 2 times the median distance.

### Helicobacter pylori infection is not an independent risk factor of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in China [^735c9ee7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical and demographic characteristics

Among the 71,633 involved study participants, 30,086 (42.0%) were female and 41,547 (58.0%) were male. Among all subjects, the prevalence of H. pylori infection in this study was 34.5% (n = 24,745). Table 1 summarizes the clinical and biochemical characteristics of the participants based on their H. pylori infection status. Males with a high BMI (H. pylori − vs. H. pylori +: 23.8 ± 3.4 vs. 24.1 ± 3.4) and high blood pressure (systolic BP: 124.3 ± 19.5 vs. 125.9 ± 20.0; diastolic BP: 77.8 ± 11.4 vs. 78.9 ± 11.8) were more likely to be H. pylori positive. Compared with the H. pylori − group, the H. pylori + group had a more adverse lipid profile, including higher levels of TC (H. pylori − vs. H. pylori +: 4.80 ± 0.92 vs. 4.86 ± 0.92), TG (H. pylori − vs. H. pylori +: 1.58 ± 1.39 vs. 1.65 ± 1.50), and LDL-C (H. pylori − vs. H. pylori +: 2.76 ± 0.77 vs. 2.82 ± 0.78), and a lower level of HDL-C (H. pylori − vs. H. pylori +: 1.43 ± 0.34 vs. 1.41 ± 0.34). Moreover, the serum ALT level (H. pylori − vs. H. pylori +: 26.5 (15–31) vs. 27.0 (15–31)), and GGT (H. pylori − vs. H. pylori +: 30.2 (14–33) vs. 31.0 (15–35)) in the H. pylori + group were higher than those in the H. pylori − group. Moreover, the FBG level (H. pylori − vs H. pylori +: 5.05 ± 1.27 vs. 5.18 ± 1.47), and HbA1c (H. pylori − vs. H. pylori +: 5.48 ± 0.75 vs. 5.55 ± 0.83) were higher in the H. pylori + group (Table 1). In the matched samples (n = 29,974), there was no difference in the incidence of hypertension (P = 0.129), diabetes (P = 0.565), or dyslipidemia (P = 0.887) between the two groups (H. pylori − and H. pylori +). Further analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence of NAFLD between the H. pylori− and H. pylori + groups (P = 0.716) (Table 1).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^f84ae8b8]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

Treatment selection for PTSD follows a stepped approach emphasizing patient preference and availability. Initiate recommended individual, manualized psychotherapy (see Recommendation 8) according to patient preference. If individual psychotherapy is unavailable or not preferred, initiate recommended pharmacotherapy (see Recommendation 15). If options 1 and 2 are infeasible or are not preferred, offer suggested psychotherapy (see Recommendation 9) or suggested complementary and integrative health (CIH) (see Recommendation 26). If options 1, 2, and 3 are infeasible or are not preferred, consider other psychotherapies (see Recommendation 10, Recommendation 12, and Recommendation 14), other pharmacotherapy (see Recommendation 16), and complementary, integrative, or alternative approaches (see Recommendation 27 and Recommendation 28) based on availability, patient preference, and review of current evidence. If none of the options above are acceptable to the patient, consider treating other disorders, issues, or both and reevaluating for PTSD treatment later.

### Initial conditions combine with sensory evidence to induce decision-related dynamics in premotor cortex [^64819992]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 7
Initial conditions and inputs determine speed of dynamics and ultimately choice and RT behavior.

a First three PCs (PC 1,2,3) of firing rates aligned to checkerboard onset (red dots) and conditioned on stimulus coherence and choice. We observed strong poststimulus separation as a function of choice and coherence, but no observable prestimulus (-400 ms to 0 ms) separation. Color-matched diamonds and squares, indicate 225 ms post-checkerboard onset and 20 ms time steps respectively. b Choice-selectivity signal measured as the 6-dimensional Euclidean distance (E. distance) between left and right reaches as a function of stimulus coherence. c State space trajectories of the 1st, 2nd and 4th PCs of PCAs conditioned on RT bins and action choice within three stimulus coherences (90%, 31%, & 4%). d Choice-selectivity signal for each of the three coherences shown in c as a function of RT bin. e Average choice-selectivity (CS) signal in the 125 to 375 ms after checkerboard onset as a function of the initial condition (IC) within each coherence (Coh.). Easier coherences lead to higher choice-selectivity signals regardless of initial condition, but the magnitude of this signal depends on the initial condition as well as sensory evidence. f Latency of the choice-selectivity signal as a function of the initial condition (IC) and for each stimulus coherence (Coh.). As expected from (d), the latency is largely flat for the easier coherences and faster RT bins (regardless of coherence), but slower for the harder coherences. The bend down in e and the bend up in (f/g) for the fastest RT bin (300–400 ms, violet) is likely an artifact of fewer trials in this bin. g Slope of the choice-selectivity signal (m term in eq. 21) as a function of the initial condition (IC) and coherence (Coh.). Slopes strongly depend on initial condition but only weakly on coherence. h Same as (d), but for non-overlapping bins. Notice similarity between (h) and (d). Bend down in (h) emerges due to truncation of firing rates at movement onset when averaging. i–k Same as (e)–(g) but for non-overlapping bins. Again the choice selectivity depends on both initial condition (IC) and coherence (Coh.). Cue - Checkerboard onset. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

### Comparative evaluation of H&H and WFNS grading scales with modified H&H (sans systemic disease): a study on 1, 000 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage [^b9ef9abe]. Neurosurgical Review (2018). Low credibility.

The comparative studies on grading in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) had several limitations such as the unclear grading of Glasgow Coma Scale 15 with neurological deficits in World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS), and the inclusion of systemic disease in Hunt and Hess (H&H) scales. Their differential incremental impacts and optimum cut-off values for unfavourable outcome are unsettled. This is a prospective comparison of prognostic impacts of grading schemes to address these issues. SAH patients were assessed using WFNS, H&H (including systemic disease), modified H&H (sans systemic disease) and followed up with Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at 3 months. Their performance characteristics were analysed as incremental ordinal variables and different grading scale dichotomies using rank-order correlation, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, Youden's J and multivariate analyses. A total of 1016 patients were studied. As univariate incremental variable, H&H sans systemic disease had the best negative rank-order correlation coefficient (-0.453) with respect to lower GOS (p < 0.001). As univariate dichotomized category, WFNS grades 3–5 had the best performance index of 0.39 to suggest unfavourable GOS with a specificity of 89% and sensitivity of 51%. In multivariate incremental analysis, H&H sans systemic disease had the greatest adjusted incremental impact of 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54–0.91) against a lower GOS as compared to 0.6 (95% CI 0.45–0.74) and 0.55 (95% CI 0.42–0.68) for H&H and WFNS grades, respectively. In multivariate categorical analysis, H&H grades 4–5 sans systemic disease had the greatest impact on unfavourable GOS with an adjusted odds ratio of 6.06 (95% CI 3.94–9.32). To conclude, H&H grading sans systemic disease had the greatest impact on unfavourable GOS. Though systemic disease is an important prognostic factor, it should be considered distinctly from grading. Appropriate cut-off values suggesting unfavourable outcome for H&H and WFNS were 4–5 and 3–5, respectively, indicating the importance of neurological deficits in addition to level of consciousness.

### Helicobacter pylori infection is not an independent risk factor of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in China [^189d873f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains controversial. The exact relationship requires further investigation. This study aimed to determine the association between them in China.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted on 71,633 participants who underwent physical examinations. 13 C urea breath test (13 C-UBT) was conducted to detect H. pylori infection, and ultrasonography was used to detect NAFLD.

Results

Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), and triglyceride (TG) levels were higher in participants with H. pylori infection than in those without H. pylori infection. While the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) for participants with H. pylori infection was lower than without H. pylori infection (P < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors (age, sex, BMI, BP, Scr, BUN, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, FBG and HbA1c), multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that there was no independent relationship between them (P = 0.574). Subgroup analysis (stratified by sex, age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia) showed that H. pylori infection was not included as an independent risk factor for NAFLD. Moreover, the different grades of NAFLD were not related to H. pylori infection.

Conclusions

These results indicate that H. pylori infection is not an independent risk factor for NAFLD in China.

### Regulation of H-ras-driven MAPK signaling, transformation and tumorigenesis, but not PI3K signaling and tumor progression, by plasma membrane microdomains [^e0e55aec]. Oncogenesis (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, we assessed the contributions of plasma membrane (PM) microdomain targeting to the functions of H-Ras and R-Ras. These paralogs have identical effector-binding regions, but variant C-terminal targeting domains (tDs) which are responsible for lateral microdomain distribution: activated H-Ras targets to lipid ordered/disordered (L o /L d) domain borders, and R-Ras to L o domains (rafts). We hypothesized that PM distribution regulates Ras-effector interactions and downstream signaling. We used tD swap mutants, and assessed effects on signal transduction, cell proliferation, transformation and tumorigenesis. R-Ras harboring the H-Ras tD (R-Ras-tH) interacted with Raf, and induced Raf and ERK phosphorylation similar to H-Ras. R-Ras-tH stimulated proliferation and transformation in vitro, and these effects were blocked by both MEK and PI3K inhibition. Conversely, the R-Ras tD suppressed H-Ras-mediated Raf activation and ERK phosphorylation, proliferation and transformation. Thus, Ras access to Raf at the PM is sufficient for MAPK activation and is a principal component of Ras mitogenesis and transformation. Fusion of the R-Ras extended N-terminal domain to H-Ras had no effect on proliferation, but inhibited transformation and tumor progression, indicating that the R-Ras N-terminus also contributes negative regulation to these Ras functions. PI3K activation was tD independent; however, H-Ras was a stronger activator of PI3K than R-Ras, with either tD. PI3K inhibition nearly ablated transformation by R-Ras-tH, H-Ras and H-Ras-tR, whereas MEK inhibition had a modest effect on Ras-tH-driven transformation but no effect on H-Ras-tR transformation. R-Ras-tH supported tumor initiation, but not tumor progression. While H-Ras-tR-induced transformation was reduced relative to H-Ras, tumor progression was robust and similar to H-Ras. H-Ras tumor growth was moderately suppressed by MEK inhibition, which had no effect on H-Ras-tR tumor growth. In contrast, PI3K inhibition markedly suppressed tumor growth by H-Ras and H-Ras-tR, indicating that sustained PI3K signaling is a critical pathway for H-Ras-driven tumor progression, independent of microdomains.

SITC gastrointestinal cancer — neoadjuvant and perioperative immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use in MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer: When trial enrollment is not feasible, administration of neoadjuvant ICIs with multidisciplinary oversight could be considered for resectable MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer given data for disease response, although in the metastatic setting. In the phase II NICHE study, pathological response was observed in all 20 evaluable dMMR tumors (including 12 pCRs), and four of the 15 evaluable pMMR tumors demonstrated a pathological response. The NICHE-2 study demonstrated 95% major pathological response (MPR) and 67% pCR rates for 107 patients following one dose of neoadjuvant ipilimumab and two doses of neoadjuvant nivolumab; although the primary end point of 3-year DFS has yet to be reported, no patients had experienced a recurrence at a median follow-up time of 13 months, and safety was met with three grade 3 or 4 irAEs and three surgery delays. For MSI-H/dMMR rectal cancer in a pilot single-institution phase II study, single-agent dostarlimab every 3 weeks for 6 months resulted in a 100% complete clinical response rate (95% CI 74% to 100%) at a median follow-up time of 12 months (range 6–24 months); proposed perioperative endpoints include clinical CR at 12 and 36 months. Additional perioperative trials reported a pCR of 79% among 14 patients with MSI-H/dMMR CRC treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and a randomized phase II study of toripalimab with or without celecoxib enrolled 84 patients with pCR rates of 65% versus 88%, respectively.

### Small bowel adenocarcinoma, version 1.2020, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1629da71]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Small bowel adenocarcinoma — MSI/MMR status for adjuvant therapy: MSI/MMR is an important consideration when deciding whether to use adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II SBA; mutation or modification of MMR genes can cause MMR protein deficiency and MSI, tumors with MSI are classified as MSI-H or MSI-low (MSI-L) while those without are microsatellite-stable (MSS), and patients with dMMR are biologically the same population as those with MSI-H. In colon cancer, several large studies show MSI-H (ie, dMMR) tumors have a decreased likelihood to metastasize and that MSI-H/dMMR may be a prognostic marker for favorable outcomes in stage II disease, and some studies indicate a dMMR/MSI-H status may predict decreased benefit and possibly a detrimental impact from adjuvant therapy in stage II colon cancer. However, a study of 1913 patients with stage II CRC from the QUASAR study, half receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, showed that although dMMR was prognostic, it did not predict benefit or detrimental impact of chemotherapy, with CALGB 9581 and 89803 trials reaching a similar conclusion using older, non-standard regimens. Extrapolating from these colon cancer data, patients with stage II MSI-H/dMMR SBA may have a good prognosis and the benefit from adjuvant therapy is unclear.

### The relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection and Alzheimer's disease in Japan [^03737cd7]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Although two studies have indicated a possible link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, these were reported from Europe, where the prevalence of H. pylori infection is not very high. In this study, the prevalence of H. pylori infection was examined in AD patients in Japan, where there is a high prevalence of H. pylori. Consecutive patients referred to the Memory and Dementia Outpatient Clinic from August 2002 to March 2009 were studied. H. pylori infection status was determined by measuring urinary levels of anti-H. pylori antibody (RAPIRUN(®)). Multiple stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations of AD with the main predictor variables. Of the 917 patients who visited the clinic, 385 were diagnosed as having AD. Ninety-seven patients did not have dementia and were considered controls. On univariate analysis, average age and the proportion of males were significantly higher in AD patients than in controls. There was no difference in the prevalence of H. pylori infection between patients with AD and controls (62.0% vs. 59.7%, p = 0.67, crude odds ratio (OR), 1.10). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age and male sex, but not H. pylori status, were significantly associated with AD (p < 0.001, p = 0.01, p = 0.83, respectively). The prevalence of H. pylori infection did not differ between AD patients and controls among Japanese subjects. The high prevalence of H. pylori in controls may contribute to the discrepancy with previous reports.

European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). High credibility.

Image acquisition — timing and technique for radionuclide imaging of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma specifies that scans are obtained at 4 and 24 h after tracer injection and that images are acquired using two energy peaks at 171 and 245 keV with medium-energy collimators. Planar anterior and posterior views of the head and neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis are acquired at 4 and 24 h with a 512 x 512 or 256 x 256 matrix for 10–15 min per view or approximately 300 kcounts for the head and neck and 500 kcounts for the rest of the body. Whole-body alternatives use a 1024 x 512 or 1024 x 256 matrix for a minimum of 30 min with maximum speed 6 cm/min. SPECT acquisitions are for a 360° orbit with a 128 x 128 matrix, 6° angle steps, and 30–45 s per stop; co-registered CT images (100–130 kV) are obtained, and in cases of a single acquisition the procedure should be performed at 24 h because of a higher target-to-background ratio.

### Colon cancer, version 3.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^77a5b64a]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Workup and management of metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma — Distant metastasis in colonic-type adenocarcinomas has been reported in 23% to 37% of cases with the most common site being dissemination to the peritoneum, with metastasis to the liver and lung being less common. The pathologic M stage distinguishes between intraperitoneal acellular mucin only (M1a), intraperitoneal mucinous epithelium (M1b), and non-intraperitoneal metastasis (M1c), and if metastasis spreads beyond the peritoneum, then treatment should follow the NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer recommendations for metastatic disease. PMP is now used as an outdated umbrella term for the following classifications: low-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (MCP-L), which is also synonymous with the previous classification of DPAM (disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis). MCP-L presents as mucin pools with < 10% cellularity and non-stratified cuboidal epithelium that lack infiltrative growth. High-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (MCP-H) is synonymous with the previous classification, peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA), presenting with mucin pools of high atypical cellularity, high mitotic index, cribriform growth pattern, and infiltrative invasion of underlying organs. An MCP-H classification with the presence of signet ring cells is denoted MCP-H-S and was previously classified as PMCA-S.

### "Did I just do that? "-six-month-olds learn the contingency between their vocalizations and a visual reward in 5 minutes [^df2f68f0]. Infancy (2021). Medium credibility.

2.2 The BabblePlay App

BabblePlay responds to voiced infant vocalizations in real‐time with colorful moving shapes. After the app starts, the screen is initially blank (black), but within 160 ms of the start of an infant vocalization, a shape appears on the screen and continues to move for the duration of the vocalization. The shape, its colors, texture, initial size and location are random, but once it has appeared, its size changes with the loudness of a vocalization, growing larger with increased amplitude (see Figure 1 for some screen shots of the shapes the app produces). The app responds to all vocalizations within an infant's pitch range that are not too loud (so as not to encourage shouting and crying), not too high‐pitched (so as not to encourage shrieking), not too low‐pitched (so as to exclude potential interference from at least some adult speakers) and not too short or quiet. BabblePlay does not respond to environmental sounds such as bangs, rustling, and traffic noise (a demonstration video is available at URL). The correlations between a human judge and BabblePlay in identifying vocalizations ranged from.87 to.95 (for detailed information regarding the algorithms used to build BabblePlay and its reliability in identifying vocalizations as compared to human judges, see Daffern et al.). BabblePlay turns off automatically after 5 min of use.

FIGURE 1
BabblePlay screenshots. Note. Examples of visual displays, showing the shape and its movement trajectory across the screen

Interestingly, after we started developing the app we discovered that others have tried to develop similar tools in the past, that respond visually to infant vocalizations (see Angus & Kendall; Cohen; Fell et al.). None, as far as we are aware, have been made use of, either for research or clinically, beyond a small pilot, probably due to their being hardware based, bulky, and difficult to use. Other attempts, such as Hailpern et al. used both visual and auditory combinations of reinforcement for vocalizations in older children (5–6 years old) with autism and/or Down syndrome, but the reinforcement in this case was not simultaneous with the vocalization (as far as we can tell), and so differs from our app in important ways.

### Evolving perspectives on the sources of the frequency-following response [^c899f3cc]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Evidence for multiple sources in human scalp-recorded FFR

The biological sources of the FFR have been a topic of debate since the early days of the technique –. Efforts to clarify the sources of far-field responses have yielded greater understanding of how and where auditory information is integrated across auditory and non-auditory regions and timescales, and the degree to which auditory centres are subject to neuroplasticity.

Our view of the FFR's origins relies on three axioms about the auditory system.
The central auditory system is a network of intertwined structures that extend across medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal lobes of cortex. This network is intrinsically connected to other sensory systems and motor, cognitive, and reward systems. To be sure, cells and circuits within each of the nuclei have specialized functions and properties; but, none of these cells or circuits operates in a vacuum. The interactivity of the system means that even something as simple as a primary auditory cortex neuron's tuning curve has to be considered within the broader context of an integrative and plastic system (reviewed in Kraus and White-Schwoch). Thus, any consideration of one or more sources of the FFR also has to consider how those sources interact with each other and with non-auditory brain circuits. It is also important to bear in mind that the same auditory structure can yield different neural activity depending on the sound's context.
Phase-locking, the phenomenon by which neurons discharge at a particular phase within the stimulus cycle, is a common feature throughout the auditory system. Through this action the recurring, periodic elements of the stimulus (e.g. the period of the fundamental frequency, the period of the amplitude modulation frequency) are encoded in the synchronous activity of a neuronal population. As you ascend the lemniscal pathway the rate of phase-locking decreases. (For more on auditory system phase-locking see Box 3 and Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Schematic of frequency ranges of speech and music and the relative activation of subcortical and cortical phase-locking to the frequency-following response. Phase-locking limitations of neurons and neuronal assemblies in the human auditory system are not yet known, but can be partly inferred from animal models. Despite phase-locking limitations, the frequency-following response is predictive of the functionality of the entire auditory system
The auditory system is plastic. Neurons throughout the auditory axis exhibit rapid plasticity based on stimulus context (e.g. Carbajal and Malmierca) and the interactive nature of the auditory system makes each centre subject to non-auditory input, whether by changes in overall brain physiology or metabolism, changes in environmental input, and/or changes in top-down cognitive input to refine sensory representation. Thus, while an FFR might measure the current functional state of stimulus representation in the auditory brain, that functional state reflects the legacy of this plasticity.

### Persistent inequalities in hospice at home provision [^799d0647]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2020). High credibility.

Objective

To describe the nature and scope of a new Hospice at Home (H@H) service and to identify its equality of provision.

Methods

Case note review of patients supported by a H@H service for 1year from September 2012 to August 2013 (n = 321). Descriptive analysis to report frequencies and proportions of quantitative data extracted from service logs, referral forms and care records; thematic analysis of qualitative data from care record free text.

Results

Demand outstripped supply. Twice as many night care episodes were requested (n = 1237) as were provided (n = 613). Inequalities in access to the service related to underlying diagnosis and socioeconomic status. 75% of patients using the service had cancer (221/293 with documented diagnosis). Of those who died at home in the areas surrounding the hospice, 53% (163/311) of people with cancer and 11% (49/431) of those without cancer received H@H support. People who received H@H care were often more affluent than the population average for the area within which they lived. Roles of the service identified included: care planning/implementation, specialist end-of-life care assessment and advice, 'holding' complex patients until hospice beds become available and clinical nursing care.

Conclusion

There is significant unmet need and potentially large latent demand for the H@H service. People without cancer or of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to access the service. Action is needed to ensure greater and more equitable service provision in this and similar services nationally and internationally.

### Accelerated-rule-out of acute myocardial infarction using prehospital copeptin and in-hospital troponin: the AROMI study [^2d3a25f6]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The absolute 0.9-h LOS reduction observed was less than expected and could be argued not to be clinical relevant. It is however fully comparable to the 1-h reduction in ED LOS found in the RAPID-TnT study, comparing the ESC 0 h/1 h algorithm to the ESC 0 h/3 h algorithm. Likewise, implementation of a single-sample rule-out strategy (0 h troponin < LOD or repeated hs-cTnT after 3 h) has been shown to reduce LOS with 2.4–3.3 h; however, this was in comparison with a 0 h/6–12 h strategy.

In a larger context, our 0.9-h reduction is a 12% relative reduction in LOS, in almost half of the patients in one of the largest groups of patients in emergency medicine — the chest pain patients. The study setup required that informed consent and randomization were retrieved before first in-hospital blood sampling and may have delayed blood sampling, and thus time to final decision and discharge, however with an equal delay in both randomization arms. Site differences in LOS reduction also suggest that the LOS and the LOS reduction in rule-out patients are highly dependent of local clinical setup, including timing of sample collection, laboratory turnover time, and delay to clinical decision. In the AROMI trial, we only provided the biomarker results needed for early decision-making, and we did not interfere with the local setups.

### Ponesimod (Ponvory) [^21e306c8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Initiation Recommendations

Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present.
In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of PONVORY treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
In patients with sinus bradycardia, first-or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure with onset more than 6 months prior to initiation, first-dose monitoring is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)].
PONVORY is not recommended in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease (e.g. TIA, stroke occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation), uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy.
Use of PONVORY in patients with a history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.
Experience with PONVORY is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers - diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate such as digoxin). Concomitant use of these drugs during PONVORY initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring.
For patients receiving a stable dose of a beta-blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before introducing PONVORY treatment. If the resting heart rate is greater than 55 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, PONVORY can be introduced. If resting heart rate is less than or equal to 55 bpm, beta-blocker treatment should be interrupted until the baseline heart rate is greater than 55 bpm. Treatment with PONVORY can then be initiated and treatment with a beta-blocker can be reinitiated after PONVORY has been up-titrated to the target maintenance dosage [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
For patients taking other drugs that decrease heart rate, treatment with PONVORY should generally not be initiated without consultation from a cardiologist because of the potential additive effect on heart rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].

99mTc-labeled bisphosphonate radiopharmaceuticals — agents and biodistribution: Several 99mTc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals from the bisphosphonate family used for bone scintigraphy include methylene diphosphonate, hydroxyethylene diphosphonate, and 2,3-dicarboxypropane-1,1-diphosphonate. 99mTc decay is by isomeric transition with emission of 140.5-keV γ-rays and the half-life is 6.02 h. 99mTc-labeled radiopharmaceuticals attach to the bone surface by chemisorption, with approximately 50%–60% of diphosphonate tracers attaching to bone by 3–4 h after administration. Uptake in bone is enhanced by increased osteoblastic activity and increased blood flow. The primary excretion route is renal with approximately 70% clearance by 6 h, and clearance is typically delayed in patients with renal impairment.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^322f0f1f]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction

- COPD results from gene-environment interactions occurring over the lifetime of the individual that can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging processes

- the main environmental exposures leading to COPD are tobacco smoking and the inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution, but other environmental and host factors (including abnormal lung development and accelerated lung aging) can also contribute

- the most relevant (albeit rare) genetic risk factor for COPD identified to date are mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency; a number of other genetic variants have also been associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD, but their individual effect size is small.

### 2023 ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension the task force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension: endorsed by the international society of hypertension (ISH) and the European renal association (ERA) [^ae86e6b7]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with HF, preserved ejection fraction, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone) regardless of diagnosed resistant HTN, particularly in lower HFpEF spectrum.

FLP thermosensory neurons are essential for glocal search

Our systematic characterization of food and temperature-dependent behavioral states (Figs. 1–3) showed that temperature strongly impacts the choice between global and glocal search. Since speed and omega turn up-regulation are distinctive characteristics of glocal search (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 6 and 11a) and suffice to recapitulate the main navigational features of this exploration strategy in simulations (Supplementary Fig. 8), we focus on these two parameters for further analyses.

Temperature and feeding states are encoded in FLP neural pathway to control tonic speed elevation during glocal search.

Speed increase time course after starvation at 15 or 25 °C and in corresponding controls left on food (a); mean ± s.e.m. of n = 8, 6, 9, 6 assays for 15 °C Fed, 15 °C Starved, 25 °C Fed and 25 °C Starved, respectively. Speed measured after 6 h of starvation at 25 °C in wild type (N2), in transgenic lines with ablated neurons, or in animals carrying a Pmec-3::TeTx transgene blocking neurotransmission in FLP (b); mean ± s.e.m. (number of independent assays, n, at the bottom of each bar). FLP intracellular calcium levels at rest and following 2-min 10 °C thermal up- or down-steps (c – e); mean ± s.e.m. of n = 15, 13, 16, 17 assays for 15 °C Fed, 15 °C Starved, 25 °C Fed and 25 °C starved, respectively (c), resting calcium levels (d), corresponding to baseline period and temperature-evoked relative calcium changes (e), showing FLP encodes temperature and food signals as resting calcium levels without modulating the magnitude of thermal responses to short stimuli. Impact of temperature and food on speed elevations caused by a 5-min tonic optogenetic activation of FLP (f – h). Mean speed elevation profiles (± s.e.m. of n = 6 assays, each scoring ≥ 30 worms) with a first spike corresponding to an initial high reversal period (t = 60–90 s) and a second long-lasting speed elevation period (90–360 s) (f). Max (g) and average speed (h) during the long-lasting speed elevation period. ✱ p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 versus 15 °C Fed condition; # p < 0.05 and ##, p < 0.01 versus the indicated condition by Bonferroni posthoc tests (b, d, e, g, h). ns not significant.
