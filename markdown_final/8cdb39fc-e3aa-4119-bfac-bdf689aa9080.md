## Question

At what size of kidney stone is referral to a urologist indicated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what kidney stone size should prompt referral to a urologist, distinguishing urgent from routine pathways and integrating location, symptoms, and patient risk factors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about scenarios that mandate immediate, size-independent emergency referral. Then, I should verify outpatient thresholds by stone location: ureteral versus renal, including lower pole versus non–lower pole. Next, I will examine how asymptomatic stones are handled, including surveillance intervals and when size alone should prompt referral. After that, I need to check measurement issues that could shift patients across thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, reference-aligned threshold scheme with explicit exceptions and confirm consistency with major guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the guideline backbone and framing, because recommendations differ slightly among societies and often hinge on location and clinical context rather than a single universal size cut-point; the AUA/ES 2016 surgical guidelines and the EAU 2025 guidelines provide the highest-credibility procedural and follow-up guidance, and they consistently emphasize stone location, burden, and clinical scenario, while KDIGO 2024 addresses nephrology referral triggers in patients with CKD or extensive nephrolithiasis, all of which shape when urology should be engaged [^114P17o5] [^114zfkGF] [^114thHXV] [^116vcD47] [^112AsZq1].

> I need to ensure I start with emergencies where size is irrelevant: obstructing ureteral stone with suspected infection or sepsis requires urgent decompression by stent or nephrostomy and delayed definitive stone treatment, which means immediate emergency referral regardless of millimeters; add anuria/acute kidney injury from obstruction, uncontrolled pain or vomiting, and special populations such as pregnancy, where imaging and management pathways must be adapted, and solitary kidney with obstruction also escalates urgency [^1143mCBu].

> Now, for symptomatic ureteral stones under observation, I should confirm the time boundary for conservative management; the AUA/ES recommends offering definitive treatment if observation with or without medical expulsive therapy is not successful after 4–6 weeks, while primary care summaries often flag stones larger than 10 mm as likely needing active removal and thus referral, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — AUA does not impose a hard ureteral size threshold; the safe synthesis is: refer when stones are > 10 mm or when any size fails to progress after 4–6 weeks or earlier by shared decision-making, especially if symptoms are significant [^114thHXV] [^1123ooAc].

> For renal stones, let me think about lower pole specifically, because outcomes with shock wave differ by location; the AUA advises not offering shock-wave lithotripsy as first-line for lower-pole stones larger than 10 mm, which practically pushes management toward ureteroscopy or percutaneous options and should prompt urology referral once the lower-pole stone exceeds 10 mm or is symptomatic and unlikely to pass spontaneously [^114P17o5].

> For non–lower-pole renal stones, I should double-check the total burden threshold; the AUA recommends not using SWL as first-line when the total renal stone burden exceeds 20 mm, favoring PCNL or staged URS, which clearly warrants urology referral for definitive management; the EAU guidance aligns on a 20 mm cut-point for many renal stone scenarios, and comparative analyses of guidelines confirm this 20 mm consensus for renal stone burden requiring complex intervention [^114zfkGF] [^notfound] [^111uiv7C].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about renal pelvis stones and the 15 mm concept; I initially thought this was a formal society threshold, but I should correct that assumption, because the " > 15 mm in the renal pelvis" high-risk for progression signal derives from expert review of observational data rather than a rigid EAU/AUA cutoff; still, stones in the renal pelvis larger than 15 mm are more likely to progress and merit strong consideration for referral even if asymptomatic, with individualized discussion of timing and modality [^113myxXt].

> Next, I will examine asymptomatic stones and surveillance, because not every incidentally discovered stone requires immediate intervention; EAU recommends periodic follow-up for untreated renal stones at 6 months and then yearly with ultrasound, KUB, or CT, and many patients with asymptomatic stones ≤ 10 mm can be safely observed with escalation if growth, symptoms, obstruction, or infection develops; that said, randomized data show that removing even small secondary stones (≤ 6 mm) at the time of endoscopy for another stone substantially reduces future relapse events, so shared decision-making is essential when asymptomatic burdens are accumulating [^1148hBRF] [^113myxXt] [^114thHXV].

> I should confirm practical primary care size cues for referral outside emergencies; family medicine guidance commonly treats stones larger than 10 mm as requiring active removal and thus referral, which dovetails with the lower-pole > 10 mm AUA signal and the general observation that symptomatic stones > 10 mm are unlikely to pass; still, hold on, I should verify that observation failures at any size for 4–6 weeks also need referral, to avoid prolonged obstruction or recurrent ED use [^1123ooAc] [^114thHXV].

> Let me consider measurement nuance, because thresholds depend on how size is captured; noncontrast CT can underestimate stone size compared with KUB by roughly 12%, and acquisition or reconstruction parameters can overestimate size compared with caliper reference, while real-world practice shows variability in how radiologists and urologists "guestimate" size; I need to ensure borderline cases near 10 or 20 mm are verified consistently and, when in doubt, err toward specialist input if clinical risk is rising [^114goEQp] [^116fAuwB] [^1142yVaP].

> I will now examine special populations and non–size-based reasons to refer from primary care; KDIGO advises nephrology referral for extensive nephrolithiasis as a cause of CKD or when CKD risk factors are present, while VA/DoD CKD guidance underscores timely referral when co-morbid conditions threaten progression; pregnancy with suspected obstructing stone needs urgent imaging tailored to gestation and potential urology input, and solitary kidney, recurrent formers with heavy burden, and occupational safety roles (e.g., pilots) tip the balance toward early referral irrespective of millimeters [^116vcD47] [^117KYrvs] [^112vwgDG].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the synthesized thresholds: 10 mm is a practical first referral pivot for symptomatic stones and specifically for lower-pole renal stones where SWL is not first-line, 15 mm in the renal pelvis is a high-risk progression signal warranting referral even if asymptomatic, and 20 mm total renal stone burden is a clear threshold for referral for complex intervention; exceptions that mandate immediate referral regardless of size include obstruction with infection, anuria/AKI, uncontrolled pain/vomiting, solitary kidney with obstruction, and pregnancy with suspected obstruction; any stone that fails to progress after 4–6 weeks of observation should be referred for definitive treatment discussion [^114P17o5] [^114zfkGF] [^113myxXt] [^114thHXV] [^1143mCBu] [^112vwgDG] [^1123ooAc].

> Bottom line, and let me reconsider to ensure internal consistency: use an urgent, size-independent pathway for infected obstruction and other emergencies; for routine outpatient decisions, treat 10 mm as the initial decision point especially for lower-pole or symptomatic stones, deploy 15 mm as a caution zone for renal pelvis stones given higher progression risk, and recognize 20 mm total burden as the point where definitive urologic intervention is usually indicated; verify borderline measurements, and incorporate patient-specific risks and the 4–6 week observation limit to avoid delayed care [^114P17o5] [^114zfkGF] [^113myxXt] [^114thHXV] [^114goEQp].

Refer to urology for kidney stones **≥ 10 mm** or any size with obstruction, infection, a solitary kidney, or persistent symptoms [^1123ooAc]. Stones 5–9 mm may be observed if asymptomatic and non-obstructing [^1123ooAc]; refer if they cause symptoms, enlarge, or fail to pass with medical therapy [^1148hBRF] [^113xz5h6]. Immediate referral is required for obstructing stones with **infection** [^1143mCBu], a **solitary kidney**, or **renal impairment**.

---

## Stone size thresholds for urology referral

The size of a kidney stone is **a primary determinant of referral** to a urologist. The following thresholds are commonly used:

| **Stone size** | **Clinical scenario** | **Referral recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 5 mm | Asymptomatic, non-obstructing | Observation, no immediate referral |
| 5–9 mm | Asymptomatic, non-obstructing | Observation or referral if symptomatic, growing, or failing medical therapy |
| ≥ 10 mm | Any location | Referral to urologist for evaluation and management [^1143mCBu] [^1123ooAc] |

---

Stones ≥ 10 mm have a low likelihood of spontaneous passage and **typically require urologic intervention**.

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting immediate urology referral

Several scenarios necessitate **immediate referral** to a urologist, regardless of stone size:

- **Obstructing stone with infection**: Obstructing stones with suspected infection require urgent decompression and antibiotic therapy [^1143mCBu].
- **Solitary kidney or renal impairment**: Stones causing obstruction in a solitary kidney or patients with pre-existing renal impairment require immediate referral [^1123ooAc].
- **Persistent symptoms or failure of medical therapy**: Stones causing persistent pain, hematuria, or failure to pass despite medical expulsive therapy warrant referral [^114thHXV].

---

## Imaging modalities for stone size assessment

Accurate assessment of stone size is **critical for determining referral need** [^117GnFPB]. The following imaging modalities are commonly used:

- **Non-contrast computed tomography (CT)**: Gold standard for accurate stone size measurement and localization [^117GnFPB].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful for initial assessment, particularly in pregnant patients or those requiring radiation avoidance [^112vwgDG] [^116P58kz].
- **Plain radiography (KUB)**: Limited accuracy, often underestimates stone size compared to CT [^117GnFPB] [^1142yVaP].

---

## Potential complications of delayed referral

Delayed referral to a urologist for larger kidney stones may lead to **significant complications**, including:

- **Obstruction and hydronephrosis**: Leading to renal impairment or failure [^113Tumjb].
- **Infection**: Potentially progressing to sepsis [^1143mCBu].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Increased risk of ESRD and other adverse renal outcomes [^1179z3i3].
- **Persistent pain and reduced quality of life**: Significant morbidity and healthcare costs [^114xZesX].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Patients with stones **≥ 10 mm should be referred** to a urologist for evaluation and management. Stones **5–9 mm** may be observed if asymptomatic and non-obstructing, but refer if they become symptomatic, enlarge, or fail to pass with medical therapy [^1148hBRF] [^1123ooAc]. Immediate referral is required for an obstructing stone with **infection**, a **solitary kidney**, **renal impairment**, or **persistent symptoms** [^1143mCBu].

### Kidney stones: Treatment and prevention [^1123ooAc]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are a common disorder, with an annual incidence of eight cases per 1,000 adults. During an episode of renal colic, the first priority is to rule out conditions requiring immediate referral to an emergency department, then to alleviate pain, preferably with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The diagnostic workup consists of urinalysis, urine culture, and imaging to confirm the diagnosis and assess for conditions requiring active stone removal, such as urinary infection or a stone larger than 10 mm.

Conservative management consists of pain control, medical expulsive therapy with an alpha blocker, and follow-up imaging within 14 days to monitor stone position and assess for hydronephrosis. Asymptomatic kidney stones should be followed with serial imaging and should be removed in case of growth, symptoms, urinary obstruction, reinfections, or lack of access to health care.

All patients with kidney stones should be screened for the risk of stone recurrence with medical history, basic laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Lifestyle modifications such as increased fluid intake should be recommended for all patients. Thiazide diuretics, allopurinol, or citrates should be prescribed for patients with recurrent calcium stones. Patients at high risk of stone recurrence should be referred for additional metabolic assessment, which can serve as a basis for tailored preventive measures.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^114Cehfn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Second, the presence of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage was only extrapolated from the number of visible kidney stones on CT images and patient reports, in the absence of an objective confirmation of lithiasis. Accurately estimating asymptomatic stones, particularly following procedures like extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, poses inherent challenges due to the presence of small stone fragments. According to a study by Sivaguru et al, there is a possibility of kidney stone dissolution in vivo. In this context, it is possible that some kidney stones claimed to be expelled spontaneously without symptoms were dissolved. This could be associated with an overestimation of the number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages, although this scenario is very rare and is mostly attributed to uric acid stones. However, in our study, all patients had recurrent calcium-containing stones, which renders such an event extremely unlikely.

Third, the parent trial had an underrepresentation of women, and most of the patients were White. Nonetheless, considering that White men have by far the highest kidney stone prevalence, the trial provides information about the typical target population.

Fourth, we recognize a potential concern regarding the number of inputs of independent variables in the linear regression analysis and attribute this limitation to the influence of sample size.

Finally, the median duration of our trial was approximately 3 years. As kidney stones can recur lifelong, we do not have data about the behavior of asymptomatic stone passages beyond this period.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the comparative effectiveness and safety of preventive dietary and pharmacologic management of nephrolithiasis in adults.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on published literature on this topic that was identified using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through March 2014), Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science. Searches were limited to English-language publications. The clinical outcomes evaluated for this guideline include symptomatic stone recurrence, pain, urinary tract obstruction with acute renal impairment, infection, procedure-related illness, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, quality of life, and end-stage renal disease. This guideline grades the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using ACP's clinical practice guidelines grading system. The target audience for this guideline is all clinicians, and the target patient population is all adults with nephrolithiasis (≥ 1 prior kidney stone episode).

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends management with increased fluid intake spread throughout the day to achieve at least 2 L of urine per day to prevent nephrolithiasis. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends pharmacologic monotherapy with a thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol to prevent nephrolithiasis in patients with active disease in which increased fluid intake fails to reduce stone recurrence.

### The impact of asymptomatic kidney stones on disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^11542VKh]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a common hereditary disorder leading to end-stage kidney disease due to the progressive formation of renal cysts. Nephrolithiasis, or kidney stones, is a frequent complication of ADPKD, with a prevalence significantly higher than in the general population. However, its role in disease progression remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of asymptomatic nephrolithiasis on kidney function decline in ADPKD patients.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort of 195 ADPKD patients was followed at our nephrology clinic. Of these, 85 patients had nephrolithiasis (N+), and 110 did not (N-). Data on demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, and kidney function were collected. ΔeGFR (change in eGFR over time) served as the primary outcome. Statistical analyses, including correlation and multiple linear regression, were performed to assess the predictors of ΔeGFR.

- **Results**: The N+ group exhibited a significantly greater decline in kidney function compared to the N- group (ΔeGFR: 16.53 vs. 12.82 mL/min/1.73 m², p = 0.008). Lower calcium levels were observed in the N+ group (p = 0.007), potentially reflecting metabolic abnormalities linked to nephrolithiasis. Nephrolithiasis was independently associated with kidney function decline (B = 3.159, p = 0.038). Follow-up duration was strongly associated with ΔeGFR (p < 0.001). Age showed a trend toward significance but did not reach statistical significance.

- **Conclusion**: Asymptomatic nephrolithiasis is associated with accelerated kidney function decline in ADPKD patients.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^111uiv7C]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

With regard to renal stone size, thresholds of 20 mm are used in the EAU, DGU, and SAU guidelines, while the AUA guidelines differentiate between lower pole calculi > 10 mm and ≤ 10 mm, and non-lower pole stones > 20 mm and ≤ 20 mm. The SUA guidelines provide recommendations for lower pole calculi regardless of size, and the AFU guidelines differentiate between stones > 20 mm and 10 mm, involving ante- and retrograde approaches in the EAU guidelines.

Comparative analysis assessing the most often recommended combination of procedures revealed an agreement ranging from 50% to 83% for different stone sizes and locations. A high degree of consensus was found in particular for lower pole renal stones below 20 mm, with 83% of the guidelines recommending 'SWL or URS or PNL', and distal ureteral stones, with 83% of the guidelines recommending 'SWL or URS'.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^1131ZUjD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Our study challenges the assumption that stone size alone should determine the priority of follow-up for kidney stones. Indeed, we observed no significant difference in the size of kidney stones that passed spontaneously between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. This implies that stone size might not be the sole determining factor for symptoms or the necessity of interventions. Instead, it is crucial to consider other factors such as stone composition, location, and individual patient characteristics when determining follow-up strategies. Larger stones may generally carry a higher risk of complications and warrant closer monitoring or intervention. However, smaller stones, particularly when multiple, should not be overlooked as they can also pose a risk for symptoms or potential progression. Asymptomatic ureteral stones may lead to permanent kidney impairment, especially when larger stones do not pass spontaneously, as their presentation is often delayed. Although the spontaneously passed stones in this study were small, the absence of symptoms might justify closer imaging surveillance for patients prone to difficulties in passing future ureteral stones. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of various factors is necessary to guide follow-up approaches in patients with kidney stones.

D'Costa et al. evaluated first-time symptomatic stone formers clinically and radiologically during a follow-up of at least 5 years and reported a combined symptomatic and asymptomatic/radiographic 5-year recurrence rate of 67%. In addition, they found that 51% of patients with asymptomatic stones experienced…

### Stone burden in an average Swedish population of stone formers requiring active stone removal: How can the stone size be estimated in the clinical routine [^112RokUV]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The study aimed to gather information on the distribution of stone burdens in an average, representative group of Swedish patients who form stones and require active removal from the kidneys or ureters. It also sought to compare different methods for assessing the stone burden.

A computerized device was used to measure the total stone surface area (A(measured)) in 599 stone situations in the kidneys and ureters of a consecutive group of patients referred for active stone removal. These measurements were compared with the large and short transverse diameters of the greatest stone, the sum of the largest diameters of the stones, the arithmetically calculated surface area (A(calculated)), as well as with previously described stone-types (A-F).

The results indicated that there were 483 situations where there was one stone and 116 situations with more than one stone. The stones occurred in 407 men and 192 women. Stones were located on the left side in 343 cases and on the right side in 256 cases. There were 34 staghorn stones identified. Among the examined stone situations, 250 were in the kidney and 349 in the ureter. An A(measured) above 300 mm² was recorded in 7% of all stone situations. The corresponding numbers for A(measured) above 200 mm², 500 mm², and 700 mm² were 13%, 4%, and 3%, respectively. When staghorn stones were excluded, good correlations were recorded for all variables, but the best correlation was found between A(measured) and A(calculated). A revision of the previously published stone-type subgroups is suggested based on the following limits for the stone surface area: A ≤ 30 mm², B = 31–300 mm², and C = 301–700 mm².

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, PART I [^111yjKAT]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline is intended to provide a clinical framework for the surgical management of patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones. The summary presented herein represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline. Please refer to Part II for an in-depth discussion of patients presenting with ureteral or renal stones.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review of the literature (search dates 1/1/1985 to 5/31/2015) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. The review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of strong, moderate, or conditional recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as clinical principles and expert opinions when insufficient evidence existed.

- **Results**: The panel identified 12 adult index patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional index patients were also created to describe pediatric and pregnant patients with such stones. With these patients in mind, guideline statements were developed to aid the clinician in identifying optimal management.

- **Conclusions**: Proper treatment selection, directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment outcomes. This guideline is intended for use in clinical practice to ensure optimal management and treatment selection for patients with stones.

### Renal tract calculi: Comparison of stone size on plain radiography and noncontrast spiral CT scan [^114goEQp]. Journal of Endourology (2006). Low credibility.

Noncontrast spiral CT (NCCT) has emerged as the investigation of choice in patients presenting with renal-tract calculi. Since management guidelines are based on stone size measured on plain radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB), it is essential to assess the accuracy of stone size measured on NCCT compared with KUB films.

The NCCT and KUB studies obtained from 24 patients (27 stones) presenting to the emergency department at a major metropolitan hospital were analyzed randomly and independently by two urologists and one uroradiologist. The NCCT scans were assessed separately from the KUB films, recording only the size in the greatest dimension and stone location.

The stone size was 2 to 38 mm on NCCT scans and 2 to 46 mm on KUB films. The mean stone size was 6.773 ± 6.146 mm and 7.747 ± 7.866 mm, respectively (P = 0.0398; Student's t-test). Almost three-fourths (70%) of the stones were larger on KUB films than on NCCT scans, with a mean difference of -0.974 mm (95% confidence interval -5.652, 3.703) for NCCT.

Spiral CT underestimates stone size by approximately 12% compared with KUB films. This discrepancy may impact stone management as outlined in guidelines published by the American Urological Association, particularly for stones about 5 mm in greatest dimension. These patients may initially be managed conservatively when intervention would be more appropriate.

### When (and how) to surgically treat asymptomatic renal stones [^113myxXt]. Nature Reviews Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic renal stones are identified in 8–10% of screened populations. With the increasing utilization of CT, the number of patients seeking urologic care for incidentally diagnosed renal calculi is likely to increase. Such patients present an important management dilemma: differentiating those to treat surgically from those who can be safely observed. Observational studies have revealed that approximately 50% of asymptomatic stones will progress, but most will not require surgery. Stones greater than 15 mm in diameter and located in the renal pelvis are at the highest risk of progression. Although no guidelines exist for the optimal monitoring regimen for asymptomatic stones, follow-up studies may include serum creatinine, plain radiography, ultrasonography, and CT.

Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) does not seem to offer significant benefit over observation for asymptomatic calyceal stones. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy does improve stone-free rates compared to SWL or observation. Additional research is needed to characterize the role of ureteroscopic management of asymptomatic renal stones.

### Reducing shock number dramatically decreases lesion size in a juvenile kidney model [^111kdfXD]. Journal of Endourology (2006). Low credibility.

Adult stone patients are treated with several thousand lithotripter shockwaves (SWs) in order to pulverize a kidney stone. This typical clinical dose assures that the stone will be fractured completely. However, this same dose induces damage to the kidney, especially pediatric-size kidneys. If increasing SW number is known to increase renal injury and functional impairment, will reducing SW number below typical treatment levels significantly decrease kidney damage and hemodynamic changes?

- **Materials and methods**: To address this question, one kidney in each of nine juvenile pigs (6–7 weeks old) was treated with 1000 SWs at 24 kV directed at a lower-pole calix with an unmodified HM-3 lithotripter. Parenchymal-lesion size was determined by sectioning the entire kidney and quantitating the amount of hemorrhage in each slice. Renal function was determined before and after SW treatment by inulin clearance, paraaminohippurate (PAH) extraction, and PAH clearance. The resulting morphologic and functional changes were then compared with those of kidneys that had been treated with a typical clinical dose of 2000 SWs (data previously published; J Am Soc Nephrol 2000;11:310). Eleven pigs were utilized as sham-treated controls.

- **Results**: Limiting SW number to 1000 significantly reduced the size of the lesion (by 95%) and reduced the degree of functional change (glomerular filtration rate by 38%, PAH extraction by 73%, renal plasma flow by 46%) compared with kidneys receiving 2000 SWs (an adult dose).

- **Conclusions**: These data support the idea that SW number should.

### Prevalence and characteristics of genetic disease in adult kidney stone formers [^116DgYo3]. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation (2024). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a common global healthcare problem. Kidney stones recur frequently and cause substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life, and enormous cost. A comprehensive phenotypic examination is paramount for the detection of urinary abnormalities and provides an efficient way to identify underlying Mendelian diseases. However, in many adult patients with kidney stones, the molecular pathogenesis of clinical traits associated with kidney stone formation, such as hypercalciuria, remains unknown. Consequently, undifferentiated dietary and pharmacological preventive measures are initiated, but many patients continue to form stones. Strategies in managing this very common and debilitating disease are clearly inadequate, highlighting an unmet need for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Kidney stone formation is strongly influenced by genetic factors: a positive family history is present in 30–60% of individuals with kidney stones, and both twin and genealogy studies have revealed a high heritability of nephrolithiasis. More than 30 Mendelian (also called monogenic) causes of nephrolithiasis have been described thus far. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of intermediate effect size/incomplete penetrance variants in increasing the risk for nephrolithiasis. Identification of patients with Mendelian forms of nephrolithiasis remains a major challenge, and no clear consensus exists on clinical parameters to guide genetic testing. Clinical phenotypes can be diagnostic for many Mendelian diseases — if phenotypic screening is diligently performed.

### Percutaneous nephrolithotomy versus retrograde intrarenal surgery for treatment of renal stones in adults [^1169jmUJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Kidney stones (also called renal stones) can be a source of pain, obstruction, and infection. Depending on size, location, composition, and other patient factors, the treatment of kidney stones can involve observation, shock wave lithotripsy, retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS; i.e. ureteroscopic approaches), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), or a combination of these approaches.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) versus retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of renal stones in adults.

- **Search methods**: We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and two trials registries up to 23 March 2023. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated PCNL (grouped by access size in French gauge [Fr] into three groups: ≥ 24 Fr [standard PCNL], 15–23 Fr [mini-PCNL and minimally invasive PCNL], and < 15 Fr [ultra-mini-, mini-micro-, super-mini-, and micro-PCNL]) versus RIRS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data from the included studies. Our primary outcomes were stone-free rate, major complications, and need for secondary interventions. Our main secondary outcomes were unplanned medical visits to emergency/urgent care or outpatient clinic, length of hospital stay, ureteral stricture or injury, and quality of life. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^116M6ifc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The main objective of the NOSTONE trial was to investigate the dose-response relationship for the prevention of the primary endpoint, which is a composite of symptomatic or radiologic kidney stone recurrence. In a secondary analysis of this prospective database, we evaluated the frequency of total (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages. The association between spontaneous passage and covariates was evaluated using linear regression analyses. A total of 33 NOSTONE participants without a CT scan available at the end of the study were excluded from this radiological stone recurrence analysis. For missing laboratory values, we assumed complete randomness in the analysis.

In the per-protocol analysis of stone recurrence, patients were considered dependently censored when withdrawing, lost to follow-up, or noncompliant for nonmedical reasons. This approach excluded nonadherent patients when noncompliance was first observed.

The comparison of median sizes between asymptomatic and symptomatic stones was performed using the Mann–Whitney U test. Linear regressions are formulated in the next step. Here, the dependent variables of the number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages and the total number of spontaneous stone passages were regressed on all independent variables. It should be mentioned that the regressions used were tested for the ordinary least squares assumptions. Therefore, we first examined the presence of heteroscedasticity, applying the Breusch–Pagan test.

### Dual-energy CT kidney stone characterization-can diagnostic accuracy be achieved at low radiation dose [^116wCxTx]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

To assess the accuracy of low-dose dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) in differentiating uric acid from non-uric acid kidney stones, two generations of dual-source DECT were evaluated using stone composition analysis as the reference standard.

Patients who received a low-dose unenhanced DECT for detection or follow-up of urolithiasis, along with stone extraction and composition analysis between January 2020 and January 2022, were retrospectively included. Collected stones were characterized using X-ray diffraction. Size, volume, CT attenuation, and stone characterization were assessed using DECT post-processing software, and characterization as uric acid or non-uric acid stones was compared to stone composition analysis as the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of stone classification were computed. Dose length product (DLP) and effective dose served as radiation dose estimates.

A total of 227 stones in 203 patients were analyzed. Stone composition analysis identified 15 uric acid and 212 non-uric acid stones. Mean size and volume were 4.7 mm × 2.8 mm and 114 mm³, respectively. CT attenuation of uric acid stones was significantly lower compared to non-uric acid stones (p < 0.001). Two hundred twenty-five of 227 kidney stones were correctly classified by DECT. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 1.0 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.00), 0.93 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.00), and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.00), respectively. Eighty-two of 84 stones with a diameter of ≤ 3 mm were correctly classified. Mean DLP was 162 ± 57 mGy*cm and effective dose was 2.43 mSv.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, part II [^112buQNK]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline is intended to provide a clinical framework for the surgical management of patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones. The summary presented herein represents part II of the two-part series dedicated to surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline. Please refer to part I for introductory information and a discussion of pre-operative imaging and special cases.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review of the literature, conducted between 1/1/1985 and 5/31/2015, aimed to identify peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. The review yielded an evidence base of 1,911 articles after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the guideline statements. Evidence-based statements of strong, moderate, or conditional recommendation were developed based on benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Additional directives are provided as clinical principles and expert opinions when insufficient evidence existed.

- **Results**: The panel identified 12 adult index patients to represent the most common cases seen in clinical practice. Three additional index patients were also created to describe the more commonly encountered special cases, including pediatric and pregnant patients. With these patients in mind, guideline statements were developed to aid clinicians in identifying optimal management.

- **Conclusions**: Proper treatment selection, which is directed by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains the greatest predictor of successful treatment.

### Systematic radiologic detection of kidney stones in Canadian children: A new era of asymptomatic stones [^115rXjGU]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic, or incidental, pediatric kidney stones detected on abdominal imaging pose a clinical challenge as their significance and expected outcome are not well described.

- **Objective**: Our primary objective was to estimate the incidence of nephrolithiasis in pediatric patients undergoing abdominal ultrasound (US) or computerized tomography (CT) for all indications in a pediatric tertiary care hospital. Our secondary objective was to determine the clinical outcome of these radiographically detected stones.

- **Methods**: All abdominal US or CT radiology reports for patients younger than 18 years, between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016, were retrieved. Reports were automatically flagged using textual analysis if they contained one of the 32 keywords potentially indicating nephrolithiasis. Flagged reports, as well as 10% of unflagged reports, were reviewed to confirm the radiologist impression of the presence or absence of stones. Patient and stone-related clinical data were extracted.

- **Results**: Two thousand four hundred forty-nine (5%) of 53,235 imaging reports cited at least one of the keywords. Manual review of flagged reports identified 498 studies having a radiologist impression of stones (244 unique patients). Stone incidence in children undergoing abdominal imaging more than doubled between 2011 and 2016. Medical record review found that 140 patients (57%) were symptomatic, while the other 104 patients (43%) were asymptomatic. Spontaneous resolution was greater (57% vs 34%) in asymptomatic patients compared to symptomatic patients.

### Racial and ethnic representation in nephrolithiasis guidelines: Are they generalizable [^112yrWVU]? Urology (2025). High credibility.

To assess whether clinical trials guiding kidney stone care adequately describe the race, ethnicity, and other key demographic variables of their study populations, guidelines such as those from the American Urological Association represent the highest level of evidence informing clinical practice. We aim to investigate if studies on which they are based include sufficiently diverse patient populations for generalizable results.

- **Methods**: We reviewed American Urological Association/Endourological Society Guidelines for the medical and surgical management of kidney stones for all referenced clinical trials reporting human subjects. Study populations were reviewed for reported sex/gender, race, ethnicity, and study country of origin.

- **Results**: Of the 381 studies referenced, 287 met inclusion criteria. Only 18 (6.3%) reported the race or ethnicity of their subjects, and 254 (87%) reported sex/gender. Among studies reporting any race or ethnicity data, there were 468,281 participants, of which 48.5% were White, 1.0% Black, 0.6% Hispanic/Latino, 0.2% Asian, 0.3% other, 0.04% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 0.001% Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander. The remaining 49.4% of subjects had insufficient information to categorize into a race or ethnicity category. Factors associated with decreased likelihood of reporting race or ethnicity included cross-sectional studies (OR 0.14, P = 0.027) and international studies (OR 0.93, P = 0.012).

- **Conclusion**: A small proportion of studies cited in the kidney stone guidelines report patient race or ethnicity.

### Qualitative review of clinical guidelines for medical and surgical management of urolithiasis: Consensus and controversy 2020 [^115pq7QM]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Many major guidelines across the globe address the medical and surgical management of urolithiasis. We elected to compare and contrast the recommendations among the five most highly cited guidelines on stone disease to offer insights on where evidence has created a consensus and where there remains ongoing controversy. This highlights the need for further studies to provide a higher level of evidence.

- **Materials and methods**: We reviewed the American Urological Association 2019 medical and 2016 surgical guidelines, the 2016 Canadian Urological Association guidelines, the 2020 European Association of Urology guidelines, the 2019 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, and the 2019 Urological Association of Asia guidelines. Tables correlating guideline statements by topic were created, and a comparative analysis was conducted to ascertain consensus and discordance.

- **Results**: Comparative analysis of recommendations from the American Urological Association guidelines to those of the Canadian Urological Association, European Association of Urology, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, and Urological Association of Asia revealed a high consensus surrounding the medical management of stones. In terms of the surgical management of stones, there is high consensus regarding the treatment of ureteral stones. This includes medical expulsive therapy using alpha blockers, avoiding prestenting for uncomplicated ureteroscopy, and using either ureteroscopy or shockwave lithotripsy as first-line treatment. There is high consensus among the American Urological.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^116vcD47]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for chronic kidney disease, specifically with respect to indications for specialist referral, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend referring adult patients with CKD to specialist kidney care services in the following circumstances:

- **Causes**: Cause of CKD is uncertain, hereditary kidney disease, extensive nephrolithiasis.

- **EGFR/risk of RRT**: A > 3–5% 5-year risk of requiring RRT measured using a validated risk equation; EGFR, a sustained fall in GFR of > 20% or > 30% in patients initiating hemodynamically active therapies.

- **Albuminuria and microscopic hematuria**: Consistent finding of significant albuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g or albumin excretion rate ≥ 300 mg/24 hours, approximately equivalent to protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 500 mg/g or protein excretion rate ≥ 500 mg/24 hours) in combination with hematuria; 2-fold increase in albuminuria in patients with significant albuminuria undergoing monitoring; a consistent finding of albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 700 mg/g; urinary red cell casts, > 20 RBC/hpf sustained and not readily explained.

- **Others**: CKD and hypertension refractory to treatment; ≥ 4 antihypertensive agents; persistent abnormalities of serum potassium; acidosis; anemia; bone disease; malnutrition.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^116Vb7hr]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, prevention, and follow-up of adult patients with kidney stones based on the best available published literature.

- **Materials and methods**: The primary source of evidence for this guideline was the systematic review conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality on nephrolithiasis in adults. To augment and broaden the body of evidence in the AHRQ report, the AUA conducted supplementary searches for articles published from 2007 through 2012 that were systematically reviewed using a methodology developed a priori. In total, these sources yielded 46 studies that were used to form evidence-based guideline statements. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional statements were developed as clinical principles and expert opinions.

- **Results**: Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians regarding the use of screening evaluation for first-time and recurrent stone formers, the appropriate initiation of a metabolic evaluation in select patients, and recommendations for the initiation and follow-up of medication and/or dietary measures in specific patients.

- **Conclusions**: A variety of medications and dietary measures have been evaluated with greater or less rigor for their efficacy in reducing recurrence rates in stone formers. The guideline statements offered in this document provide a simple, evidence-based approach to identifying high-risk or interested stone-forming patients for whom medical and dietary therapy based on metabolic testing and close follow-up is recommended.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^111xPPpV]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Several societies around the world issue guidelines incorporating the latest evidence. However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points. We aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines to give novel insights into areas where low consensus between the guideline panels exists and where more evidence might increase consensus.

- **Methods**: The webpages of the 61 members of the Societé Internationale d'Urologie were analysed to identify all listed or linked guidelines. Decision trees for the surgical management of urolithiasis were derived, and a comparative analysis was performed to determine consensus and discrepancies.

- **Results**: Five national and one international guideline (EAU) on surgical stone treatment were available for analysis. While seven national urological societies refer to the AUA guidelines and eleven to the EAU guidelines, forty-three neither publish their own guidelines nor refer to others. Comparative analysis revealed a high degree of consensus for most renal and ureteral stone scenarios. Nevertheless, we also identified a variety of discrepancies between the different guidelines, the largest being the approach to the treatment of proximal ureteral calculi and larger renal calculi.

- **Conclusions**: Six guidelines with recommendations for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis to support urologists in decision-making were available for inclusion in our analysis.

### An overview of kidney stone imaging techniques [^117GnFPB]. Nature Reviews Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Kidney stone imaging is an important diagnostic tool and the initial step in deciding which therapeutic options to use for the management of kidney stones. Guidelines provided by the American College of Radiology, American Urological Association, and European Association of Urology differ regarding the optimal initial imaging modality for evaluating patients with suspected obstructive nephrolithiasis. Noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis consistently provides the most accurate diagnosis but also exposes patients to ionizing radiation.

Traditionally, ultrasonography has a lower sensitivity and specificity than CT but does not require the use of radiation. However, when these imaging modalities were compared in a randomized controlled trial, they were found to have equivalent diagnostic accuracy within the emergency department. Both modalities have advantages and disadvantages. Kidney, ureter, bladder (KUB) plain film radiography is most helpful in evaluating interval stone growth in patients with known stone disease and is less useful in the setting of acute stones. MRI offers the possibility of 3D imaging without exposure to radiation, but it is costly and currently, stones are difficult to visualize.

Further developments are expected to enhance each imaging modality for the evaluation and treatment of kidney stones in the near future. A proposed algorithm for imaging patients with acute stones, in light of the guidelines and the randomized controlled trial, could aid clinicians.

### The impact of asymptomatic kidney stones on disease progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^111yD6sw]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common hereditary kidney disorders, with a prevalence of approximately 1:400 to 1:1000 live births, affecting millions worldwide. ADPKD is characterized by the progressive formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, leading to a decline in renal function. It is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with more than 50% of patients reaching ESRD by the age of 60. Mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, which regulate renal tubular epithelial cell function, are primarily responsible for the pathogenesis of ADPKD, contributing to abnormal cyst formation and progressive kidney damage.

Nephrolithiasis (kidney stone disease) is a frequent complication of ADPKD, occurring in 20–36% of patients, significantly higher than the approximately 8–10% prevalence observed in the general population. The formation of kidney stones in ADPKD is often attributed to anatomical distortions caused by cysts and metabolic abnormalities, including urinary stasis and hypercalciuria. Although these stones can remain asymptomatic, they may still contribute to disease progression by exacerbating renal dysfunction, causing urinary tract infections, hematuria, or obstruction. Despite the prevalence of nephrolithiasis in ADPKD, studies specifically investigating the impact of asymptomatic stones on the progression of chronic kidney disease are limited.

The role of asymptomatic kidney stones in ADPKD has not been thoroughly examined, creating a gap in the understanding of their clinical significance. Most current research has focused on symptomatic cases, leaving the effects of asymptomatic stones relatively unexplored.

### Leave no stone unturned: Defining recurrence in kidney stone formers [^114THyft]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Established guidelines provide recommendations on the management of kidney stones to prevent recurrence. However, clear and clinically useful terminology for the recurrence of kidney stones is needed. This review describes the various manifestations of kidney stone recurrence and the reported rates of kidney stone recurrence in various clinical settings.

Kidney stone recurrence has a wide range of symptomatic and radiographic presentations. Symptomatic recurrence may include characteristic symptoms of stone passage via the ureter, such as renal colic and gross hematuria. This may be self-managed or result in clinical care, with or without confirmation of an obstructing stone on imaging. Radiographic recurrence has been variably defined as new stone formation, stone growth, or stone disappearance from passage with or without symptoms. Studies have used inconsistent definitions of recurrence, and recurrence rates vary substantially. Stone-free rates and residual stone fragment size after surgical interventions are useful predictors of symptomatic recurrence.

The recurrence rate of kidney stones has been assessed in stone formers from sub-specialty clinics, the general community, and clinical trials. The definition of recurrence is quite heterogeneous between studies, but the rate of recurrence generally increases as more manifestations are included in the definition.

### Physician and patient adherence to kidney stone prevention guidelines in a diverse, low-resource, urban population [^114Kj69m]. Urology (2025). Low credibility.

To assess barriers to guideline-concordant metabolic kidney stone evaluations in a diverse, low-resource, urban population, the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend that recurrent, high-risk, and interested first-time kidney stone formers undergo metabolic evaluation. Patients with low socioeconomic status are less likely to complete 24-hour urine studies.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified high-risk kidney stone patients who required stone surgery between 2016 and 2022 and completed a validated social needs screening tool. Clinical notes, orders, pharmacy, and laboratory records were reviewed for the year before and after surgery. Guideline compliance was assessed with respect to each of the following: recommendation for and completion of 24-hour urine, results counseling, dietary/pharmacologic compliance, and repeat 24-hour urine recommendation and completion.

- **Results**: Two hundred eighty patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 25.4% were Black and 51.8% were Hispanic/Latino. The median age was 57 years (IQR 48–65). Of those eligible, 123 (43.9%) were recommended to undergo metabolic evaluation, 70 (25%) completed the collection, 45 (16.1%) received dietary/pharmacologic counseling, 25 (8.9%) were recommended to repeat the 24-hour urine, 13 (4.6%) completed this repeat collection, and 10 (3.6%) attended a visit to discuss repeat results. On univariate analysis, Asian race, hyperparathyroidism, female sex, increased age, and private insurance were associated with an increased likelihood of guideline-concordant care (p < 0.05). Barriers identified by the study…

### The acceptable criterion of stone burden and the significant factors to choose retrograde intrarenal stone surgery or miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy for the treatment of renal stones > 10 mm [^1156mNNU]. Journal of Endourology (2017). Low credibility.

We investigated the surgical efficiency and cutoff criteria to determine whether retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) or supine miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) is appropriate for managing renal stones with a mean size > 10 mm.

Data from a single session of RIRS or supine MPCNL were collected in a prospective, observational study. Change point analysis with a cumulative sum of the ordered value of fragmentation efficiency and stone size was employed to detect the point at which the statistical properties of a sequence of observations change.

A total of 310 RIRS and 66 MPCNL cases were included. No differences in patient characteristics were observed between the groups. However, stone burden, fragmentation efficiency, stone distribution, and the presence of staghorn stones were higher in the MPCNL group compared to the RIRS group. Stone-free rates and complication rates showed no significant differences. The fragmentation efficiency increased to 40.4 mL/min, at which the stone size in the RIRS group was 19.1 mm. Efficiency decreased after this peak and became the same at a stone size of 30 mm with 10 mm in the RIRS group. The fragmentation efficiency in the MPCNL group continuously increased until reaching a size of 35.1 mm.

RIRS shows the highest efficiency at a maximal diameter of 19.1 mm and a volume of 15,000 mm³. The acceptable level of stone size and volume for RIRS would be 30.0 mm and 27,000 mm³, respectively. However, MPCNL would be appropriate when surgeons aim to achieve high surgical efficiency for renal stones > 21.6 mm instead of using RIRS.

### Size matters: a survey of how urinary-tract stones are measured in the UK [^1142yVaP]. Journal of Endourology (2005). Low credibility.

Stone size forms the basis of management pathways in patients with urolithiasis. We carried out a questionnaire-based audit to find out how stone size is routinely measured by radiologists in the UK.

- **Materials and methods**: A series of 831 anonymous questionnaires concerning how stone size is assessed using four imaging modalities — plain abdominal radiograph (KUB film), intravenous urogram (IVU), ultrasound, and CT — were sent to 277 radiology departments. Following the survey, a substudy at our institution compared urologists (N = 10) and radiologists (N = 5) in estimating the size of a large (26-mm) and small (11-mm) calculus on KUB films.

- **Results**: Of the questionnaires, 425 were returned, and 421 were analyzed. Of these, 85% were from consultants, 14% from trainees/middle grades, and 1% were "unspecified". In total, 92% of the respondents were radiologists (10% uroradiologists), and 8% were urologists. Estimation of stone size ("guestimation") from KUB films and IVUs was used by 40% and 36% of radiologists, respectively, whereas graded rulers were used by 57% and 59%, respectively. For ultrasound scans and CT, electronic measurement was the favored method (81% and 73%), but guestimation was still used by 10% and 15%, respectively. When assessing the KUB films and IVU, 59% and 61% of urologists, respectively, also used guestimation. The substudy revealed a significant difference among radiologists in the accuracy of size estimation for the 11-mm stone (mean estimated size 9.6 mm; P = 0.02, one-sample t-test).

- **Conclusion**: A large proportion of radiologists use guestimation when determining stone size.

### Determining the true burden of kidney stone disease [^114xZesX]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of kidney stones have increased over the past four decades. However, the diagnosis of "kidney stone" can range from an incidental asymptomatic finding of limited clinical significance to multiple painful episodes of ureteral obstruction with eventual kidney failure. Some general strategies may be useful to prevent the recurrence of kidney stones. In particular, greater attention to kidney stone classification, approaches to assessing the risk of recurrence, and individualized prevention strategies may improve the clinical care of stone formers.

Although there have been some advances in approaches to predicting the recurrence of kidney stones, notable challenges remain. Studies of kidney stone prevalence, incidence, and recurrence have reported inconsistent findings, in part because of the lack of a standardized stone classification system. A kidney stone classification system based on practical and clinically useful measures of stone disease may help to improve both the study and clinical care of stone formers. Any future kidney stone classification system should be aimed at distinguishing asymptomatic from symptomatic stones, clinically diagnosed symptomatic stone episodes from self-reported symptomatic stone episodes, symptomatic stone episodes that are confirmed from those that are suspected, symptomatic recurrence from radiographic recurrence (that is, with radiographic evidence of a new stone, stone growth, or stone disappearance from presumed passage), and determine stone composition based on mutually exclusive categories.

### Do kidney stone formers have a kidney disease [^113Tumjb]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a highly prevalent disorder, affecting approximately one in eleven people, and it is associated with multiple complications, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Significant epidemiologic associations with chronic kidney disease and ESRD have been noted and are reviewed herein, but debate persists in the literature regarding whether kidney stone formation is a pathogenic process contributing to kidney disease. Corroborating evidence supporting the presence of kidney disease in stone formers includes the variability of renal function by stone type, the positive association of stone size with renal dysfunction, the presence of markers of renal injury in the urine of even asymptomatic stone formers, and direct evidence of renal tissue injury on histopathology.

Proposed pathogenic mechanisms include:

- **Reobstruction and comorbid conditions**: Such as recurrent urinary tract infections and structural abnormalities.
- **Recent work in renal histopathology**: Evaluating different groups of stone formers, it adds further granularity, suggesting variability in mechanisms of renal injury by stone type and confirming the pathogenic effects of crystal formation.
- **Genetic abnormalities**: Leading to stone formation, including cystinuria and primary hyperoxaluria, among others, contribute to the burden of disease in the stone-forming population.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^112AsZq1]. BMC Urology (2018). High credibility.

A range of procedures is in use for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis. Treatment strategies are mainly based on stone location, size, and the patient's comorbidities and preferences. Guidelines have been developed to support clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment in controversial situations. Several institutions around the world have issued guidelines incorporating the latest evidence.

However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points, such as cut-off values for stone size and recommendations for the treatment of choice. Ambiguities and discrepancies between different guidelines may result from different interpretations of the available evidence and possible methodological differences in guideline creation. Therefore, careful analysis of the similarities and differences between different sources can provide additional insights.

We aimed to determine how many guidelines on the surgical management of urolithiasis actually exist and the urological associations that recommended them. We systematically analyzed the criteria proposed for decision-making and the recommended surgical approaches in each guideline. In addition, we aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines, with particular attention to the two major guidelines, those of the EAU and AUA.

This work provides a systematic analysis of the recommended surgical management of urolithiasis.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^111WEH6Z]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

Kidney stones are highly prevalent and characterized by a high rate of recurrence. Thus, they cause not only pain, discomfort, and a reduced quality of life but also incur tremendous health care costs. However, a significant number of kidney stones pass without symptoms and go unnoticed by patients. Currently, data regarding the frequency of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage are limited. This study evaluated the natural history of asymptomatic kidney stones and factors associated with asymptomatic spontaneous stone passage in patients with calcium-containing stones. We found that a high number of patients (209 of 383; 55%) experienced a stone event within a relatively short follow-up period of 3 years. Interestingly, 36% (158 of 442) of the spontaneous kidney stone passages were asymptomatic. The number of asymptomatic spontaneous stone passages was significantly associated with a higher number of stones on CT at randomization.

With advances in imaging technology, the possibility of detecting asymptomatic kidney stones has increased. Treatment options for kidney stones include active surveillance, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. However, a treatment strategy for asymptomatic kidney stones is yet to be established. In several guidelines, kidney stones ≤ 5 mm have been considered insignificant; however, the extent to which stone-related events can occur and surgical intervention should be performed in these small stones.

### Surgical management of stones: American urological association/endourological society guideline, part I [^114zfkGF]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to the choice of procedure for renal stones, the AUA/ES 2016 guidelines recommend not to offer shock-wave lithotripsy as first-line therapy in patients with a total renal stone burden greater than 20 mm.

### Influence of socioeconomic factors on stone burden at presentation to tertiary referral center: Data from the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter [^112diZ98]. Urology (2019). Low credibility.

To determine the social factors associated with advanced stone disease (defined as unilateral stone burden > 2 cm) at the time of presentation to a regional stone referral center, little is known about the social determinants of urolithiasis. We hypothesize that socioeconomic factors impact kidney stone severity at intake to referral centers.

A retrospective review of the prospectively collected data from the Registry for Stones of the Kidney and Ureter from 2015 to 2018 was conducted to evaluate patient characteristics predictive of having a large (> 2 cm) unilateral kidney stone. Data on patient age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, race, language, education level, infection, distance, income, referring regional urologist density, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and stone analysis were evaluated.

Complete imaging and patient variable data were present in 650 of 1,142 patients, including 197 patients with unilateral stone burden > 2 cm. On multivariate analysis, obesity, lower education level, increased distance from the referral center, and symptoms of infection predicted for unilateral stone burden greater than 2 cm. Among 191 patients with stone analysis data present, stone type, income, and urologist density predicted for unilateral stone burden greater than 2 cm.

In addition to known biological risk factors, patients with lower education levels and from regions of lower mean income were found to be more likely to present to our tertiary care center with a stone burden greater than 2 cm. More research is needed to elucidate the social factors contributing to this condition.

### Kidney stones [^117T6Ked]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Low credibility.

The age of peak incidence for stone disease is between 20 to 40 years, although stones are observed across all age groups, with a male to female ratio of 3:2.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions for stone removal in people with asymptomatic kidney stones? What are the effects of interventions for the removal of symptomatic renal stones? What are the effects of interventions to remove symptomatic ureteric stones? What are the effects of interventions for the management of acute renal colic? Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other significant databases up to June 2011. Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We identified 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. A GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions was performed.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information on the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antispasmodic drugs, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, intravenous fluids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, oral fluids, percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and ureteroscopy.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: Evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: Part I [^112kfHc6]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for renal cell carcinoma, specifically concerning indications for referral, AUA 2021 guidelines recommend considering referring patients with a high risk of CKD progression to nephrology. This includes patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², confirmed proteinuria, patients with diabetes with preexisting CKD, or whenever eGFR is expected to be < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² after an intervention.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, part II [^114thHXV]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to indications for stone treatment, the AUA/ES 2016 guidelines recommend offering definitive stone treatment in most patients with ureteral stones if observation, with or without medical expulsive therapy, is not successful after 4–6 weeks and/or if the patient and clinician decide to intervene sooner based on a shared decision-making approach.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^116QfTgf]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

All decision trees were analyzed and compared to each other to determine consensus or discrepancies between each possible combination of parameters using web-based software (Diagnostic Nodes), as described previously.

To evaluate discrepancies, a combined tree containing all recommendations was generated. A mode tree was also generated to identify the most common combination of recommendations for each possible situation.

Consensus was defined as complete overlap between the recommended treatments for any case. If all guidelines recommended only one therapy for a specific situation, agreement was 100%. However, if three out of six guidelines recommended therapy A only, and the others recommended therapy A or B, this resulted in only 50% agreement for therapy A.

In addition to comparing all guidelines, the two international and most frequently cited guidelines issued by the EAU and AUA were separately compared to highlight discrepancies or areas of consensus.

### Removal of small, asymptomatic kidney stones and incidence of relapse [^113xz5h6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The benefits of endoscopically removing small (≤ 6 mm), asymptomatic kidney stones are unknown. Guidelines leave such decisions to the discretion of the urologist and the patient. A prospective study involving older, nonendoscopic technology and some retrospective studies favor observation. However, published data indicate that about half of small renal stones left in place at the time that larger stones were removed caused other symptomatic events within 5 years after surgery.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in which, during the endoscopic removal of ureteral or contralateral kidney stones, remaining small, asymptomatic stones were removed in 38 patients (treatment group) and were not removed in 35 patients (control group). The primary outcome was relapse as measured by future emergency department visits, surgeries, or growth of secondary stones.

- **Results**: After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, the treatment group had a longer time to relapse than the control group (P < 0.001 by log-rank test). The restricted mean (± SE) time to relapse was 75% longer in the treatment group than in the control group (1631.6 ± 72.8 days vs. 934.2 ± 121.8 days). The risk of relapse was 82% lower in the treatment group than in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.44), with 16% of patients in the treatment group having a relapse as compared with 63% of those in the control group. Treatment added a median of 25.6 minutes (interquartile range, 18.5 to 35.2) to the surgery time. Five patients in the treatment group and four in the control group had incomplete data or withdrew from the study.

### Asymptomatic lower pole small renal stones: Shock wave lithotripsy, flexible ureteroscopy, or observation? A prospective randomized trial [^1144GSQ8]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to present the outcomes of flexible ureteroscopy (F-URS), shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), and observation in the management of asymptomatic lower calyceal stones.

A total of 150 patients with asymptomatic lower calyceal stones were randomized into F-URS (group 1), SWL (group 2), and observation (group 3) groups. The main criterion for patient enrollment was having asymptomatic single lower pole stones smaller than 1 cm.

- **Flexible ureteroscopy (F-URS)**: The mean stone-free rate was 92% (46 of 50).
- **Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL)**: The mean number of sessions was 1.48 ± 0.65. The stone-free rate was 90% (45 of 50).
- **Observation**: Patients were followed up for a mean of 21.02 ± 3.65 months. Three stones passed spontaneously without any symptoms. Pain developed in 3 patients during follow-up; 2 of them passed a stone and responded to analgesics without further treatment.

Complication rates for groups 1 and 2 were similar, but group 2 had higher Clavien grades.

In conclusion, for asymptomatic small-sized lower calyceal stones, SWL and F-URS are established treatment modalities. However, with low auxiliary treatment rates, observation may be an option for the management of nonsymptomatic small-sized lower pole kidney stones.

### Risk factors of asymptomatic kidney stone passage in adults with recurrent kidney stones [^115TyouV]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are a common health care problem, and their prevalence and incidence are increasing worldwide. The prevalence of kidney stones in the United States is estimated to be approximately 12% in men and 10% in women. Kidney stones can be extremely painful, relapse frequently, and cause enormous health care expenditure, excess morbidity, and reduced quality of life.

There are a variety of treatment options for kidney stones, including surgical intervention and conservative management. Despite satisfactory outcomes after intervention, the recurrence rate of kidney stones is high. Without specific treatment, the 5- and 20-year recurrence rates are 40% and 75%, respectively. Kidney stone recurrence is defined as the visible passage of a stone with or without accompanying typical symptoms, a stone requiring urological intervention for removal, or the appearance of new stones or enlargement of preexisting stones on radiological imaging. However, many stones pass without symptoms and aren't noticed by patients.

With the increased use of radiologic examinations and the promotion of regular health screening, the detection of asymptomatic kidney stones as incidental findings has become increasingly common. Although the treatment indications for kidney stones are well established, the management strategy for small, nonobstructing, and asymptomatic kidney stones remains controversial. The latest European Association of Urology guidelines for urolithiasis recommend active surveillance with annual follow-up imaging for asymptomatic calyceal stones.

### Nephrolithiasis [^11718NPh]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Low credibility.

Kidney stone prevalence is rapidly increasing worldwide, and decreasing stone growth and recurrence is critical to reducing morbidity. Preventative approaches vary with kidney stone type, so knowledge of stone composition and a thorough history and metabolic evaluation are necessary to individualize therapy. The cases presented herein highlight treatment strategies for the most common stone types seen in clinical practice, with practical pearls for the nephrologist.

### Guidelines on urolithiasis [^116XjQ6s]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

A project was initiated by the Health Care Office of the European Association of Urology to formulate common recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of patients with urolithiasis. The working group's basic task was to extract and evaluate evidence from the literature to reach a consensus on how these patients could best be managed.

- **Methods**: Extensive literature reviews and thorough discussions on various topics by a working group, including experts from several European countries, provided the basis for a consensus overview of urolithiasis and its management.

- **Results and conclusions**: Recommendations are provided for managing patients with acute stone colic and actively removing stones from the ureter and kidney. Additionally, principles for evaluating the risk of patients with recurrent stone formation and appropriate recurrence preventive treatment are presented.

### Decision-making, preference, and treatment choice for asymptomatic renal stones-balancing benefit and risk of observation and surgical intervention: A real-world survey using social media platform [^113kspEJ]. Journal of Endourology (2022). Low credibility.

The burden of kidney stone disease has risen, and several treatment options now exist. We aimed to evaluate the preferences and treatment choices based on the information provided for the management of hypothetical 8 and 15 mm renal stones, and factors that influenced their decision-making.

- **Materials and methods**: An online questionnaire to investigate trends in decision-making for two hypothesized scenarios of asymptomatic kidney stones (8 and 15 mm) was formatted online in Microsoft Forms and posted on a social media platform (Facebook) in Europe. Ethical approval was obtained from the University Ethics Committee, and data were collected from the general public between September and November 2020.

- **Results**: A total of 476 participants of different ages and backgrounds answered the survey, with a male to female ratio of 1:2.7. The age groups were categorized as 18–25 years (n = 149), 26–49 years (n = 192), and 50+ years (n = 135). In the 8 mm scenario, 107 of the 476 participants (22.5%) chose observation, 249 (52.3%) chose extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), and 120 (25.2%) opted for ureteroscopy (URS). In the 15 mm scenario, 194 participants chose SWL treatment (40.8%), 216 (45.4%) selected URS, and 66 (13.9%) preferred percutaneous nephrolithotomy. The influencing factors included success rate, complication risk, and the invasiveness of the procedure. Compared to the 8 mm stone, stent avoidance and activity limitation were considered less important with the 15 mm stone (p < 0.001), while complication rates were deemed more important (p < 0.001).

### Kidney stone pathophysiology, evaluation and management: Core curriculum 2023 [^1162detZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Kidney stone disease, also known as nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, is a disorder in which urinary solutes precipitate to form aggregates of crystalline material in the urinary space. The incidence of nephrolithiasis has been increasing, and the demographics have been evolving. Once viewed as a limited disease with intermittent exacerbations that are simply managed by urologists, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a complex condition requiring thorough evaluation and multifaceted care.

Kidney stones are frequently manifestations of underlying systemic medical conditions such as metabolic syndrome, genetic disorders, or endocrinopathies. Analysis of urine chemistries and stone composition provides a window into pathogenesis and directs ancillary studies to uncover underlying diseases. These studies allow providers to devise individualized strategies to limit future stone events.

Given its complexity, kidney stone disease is best addressed by a team led by nephrologists and urologists with input from multiple other health professionals, including dietitians, endocrinologists, interventional radiologists, and endocrine surgeons. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we provide a case-based overview of nephrolithiasis, divided by the individual stone types. The reader will gain a pragmatic understanding of the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of this condition.

### Kidney stones and kidney function loss: a cohort study [^1179z3i3]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are a common and potentially preventable cause of morbidity in the general population. Using a cohort of more than three million people treated in a universal healthcare system, we found that the risks of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and two other clinically relevant adverse renal outcomes were all significantly higher in people with at least one symptomatic kidney stone episode.

The excess risk of all three adverse renal outcomes associated with stone episodes seemed to be greater in women than in men and more pronounced among younger people than in those aged ≥ 50 years. The observed association between stones and risk was independent of potential confounders (as shown in Table 1) and seemed to be magnified in people with more than one episode of stones compared to those with a single episode. These findings suggest that kidney stones are an important potential contributor to the risk of ESRD and that patients with prior kidney stones should be considered at increased risk for adverse renal outcomes, especially younger women or those with multiple symptomatic episodes.

- **Comparison with other studies**: Consistent with our data, a recent prospective cohort study of about 1.5 million people in the United Kingdom found that kidney stones were a significant risk factor for ESRD in women but not in men. The basis for this finding is unclear, but we speculate that, although men are more likely to develop stones, they are protected from obstructive complications due to differing anatomy.

### The natural history of asymptomatic renal stones ≤ 5 mm: Comparison with ≥ 5 mm [^111mA2et]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Low credibility.

Objectives: To clarify the natural history of asymptomatic renal stones ≤ 5 mm in comparison with stones ≥ 5 mm. Calculi ≤ 5 mm are considered insignificant stones, but to what extent stone-related events can occur is unclear.

Patients and methods: In this retrospective study, 207 patients with asymptomatic renal stones confirmed by both CT and ultrasonography performed on the same day were enrolled. A follow-up ultrasound was performed every 6 months. The active indications for surgical intervention included stone relocations into the ureter and stone-related symptoms. The primary endpoint was the rate of surgical intervention.

Results: A total of 207 patients (71 cases with stones ≤ 5 mm and 136 cases with stones > 5 mm) were included in this study. At a median follow-up of 3.3 years, 14 patients (20%) from the ≤ 5-mm group and 52 (38%) from the > 5-mm group underwent surgical treatment (p = 0.0067). Moreover, 11 patients (16%) from the ≤ 5-mm group and 27 (20%) from the > 5-mm group received surgical intervention as they manifested active indications, showing no significant difference (p = 0.44).

As regards stone events, there were no significant differences in spontaneous stone passage, pain, hematuria, and stone growth. Multivariate analysis revealed that age ≤ 50 years and a history of stone surgery were significant factors, but stone size was not. About 20% of asymptomatic renal stones ≤ 5 mm require surgical treatment within 5 years.

### Size and volume of kidney stones in computed tomography: Influence of acquisition techniques and image reconstruction parameters [^116fAuwB]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is routinely used to assess suspected urolithiasis. The information obtained from CT includes the presence, location, and size of stones, with the latter frequently determining the treatment strategy. While there is a consensus regarding measurement procedures of kidney stones, the influence of radiation dose and reconstruction techniques on stone measurements is unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the influence of these technical determinants on kidney stone size measurements.

For the method, 47 kidney stones of different compositions were scanned using a 64-row multi-detector CT in a 3D-printed, semi-anthropomorphic phantom. Reference stone sizes were measured manually with a digital caliper (Man-M). Stones were imaged with 2 and 10 mGy CTDI. Images were reconstructed using filtered-back-projection, hybrid-iterative, and model-based-iterative reconstruction algorithms (FBP, HIR, MBIR) in combination with different kernels and denoising levels. All stones underwent semi-automatic, threshold-based segmentation for the computation of maximum diameter and volume. Statistics were conducted using ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons.

In the results, overall stone size as compared to manual measurements was overestimated in CT (10.0 ± 3.1 vs. 8.8 ± 2.9 mm, p < 0.05). MBIR and sharp kernels showed the closest agreement with Man-M (9.3 ± 3.1 vs. 8.8 ± 2.9 mm, p < 0.05). Differences within single stones were as high.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^112vwgDG]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining an ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder retroperitoneal as the initial or follow-up imaging for pregnant patients experiencing acute-onset flank pain with a suspicion of stone disease. Consider obtaining a color Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance urography, or unenhanced CT in these patients.
