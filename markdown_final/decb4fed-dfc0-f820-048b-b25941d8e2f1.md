## Question

when are you week pregnant

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine how many weeks pregnant they are and how to interpret that information. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical definition of gestational age and how it is counted. Then, I should verify the most reliable dating methods, especially first-trimester ultrasound versus last menstrual period. Next, I will consider special scenarios like assisted reproduction and suboptimally dated pregnancies. After that, I should translate weeks into trimesters and key clinical thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and note limitations and when to seek care, ensuring I anchor each point to guidelines and high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misstate it. Gestational age is the duration of pregnancy expressed in completed weeks and days from the first day of the last menstrual period, which is a convention that assumes a 28-day cycle with ovulation at day 14; clinically, we report weeks and days, for example 12 weeks 3 days, and this is the standard used in obstetric care and research.

> Wait, let me verify the most accurate dating method because this drives everything downstream. First-trimester ultrasound measuring crown–rump length is the most accurate way to establish or confirm gestational age, with dating accuracy around ± 5 days when performed at or before 13 weeks 6 days; this is why guidelines recommend a first-trimester dating scan when available, and why pregnancies without ultrasound confirmation of the estimated due date before 22 0/7 weeks are considered suboptimally dated [^4b9f5e4d] [^43191355] [^9b619be4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about LMP-based dating. I initially thought LMP dating is accurate within about a week, but I should double-check that. In fact, LMP dating is less reliable because many patients misremember the date and cycles vary; only about half recall the LMP accurately, and even when recalled, cycle irregularity and ovulation timing can introduce errors of a week or more, so ultrasound confirmation is preferred when available, especially in the first trimester [^73c1a742] [^9b619be4].

> I need to ensure I cover assisted reproduction. For pregnancies conceived with ART, gestational age is calculated from the date of embryo transfer by adding the embryo age at transfer plus 14 days; for example, a 5-day blastocyst transferred on June 1 corresponds to 5 + 14 = 19 days, so gestational age is 2 weeks 5 days on the transfer date, and this ART-derived dating should be used to assign the estimated due date rather than LMP or ultrasound in most cases [^4b9f5e4d] [^e36361de].

> Next, I should review how to handle suboptimally dated pregnancies because management hinges on this. If no ultrasound confirms dating by 22 0/7 weeks, the pregnancy is suboptimally dated; in such cases, clinicians should use the best clinical estimate for decisions like antenatal corticosteroids and delivery timing, consider interval growth scans to reassess dating, and avoid elective delivery; when uncertain, many manage as if late-term at 41 weeks and initiate surveillance accordingly [^43191355] [^facdeb30] [^c1a679a0].

> Let me think about translating weeks into clinically meaningful phases. The first trimester ends at 13 weeks 6 days, the second trimester spans 14 0/7 through 27 6/7 weeks, and the third trimester begins at 28 0/7 weeks; key thresholds include viability considerations around 24 weeks, late preterm at 34 0/7 through 36 6/7 weeks, early term at 37 0/7 through 38 6/7 weeks, full term at 39 0/7 through 40 6/7 weeks, late term at 41 0/7 through 41 6/7 weeks, and postterm at 42 0/7 weeks and beyond [^90d8268d] [^23f24300].

> I should confirm the practical steps someone can take to estimate their weeks right now. If you know the first day of your last menstrual period, count the number of weeks from that date to today; if you are unsure of your LMP or your cycles are irregular, arrange a first-trimester ultrasound as soon as possible for dating; if you already had an early ultrasound, use that dating rather than LMP; if you conceived with ART, use the transfer-date calculation; and if you are beyond the first trimester without dating confirmation, discuss with your clinician whether your pregnancy is suboptimally dated and what that means for planning [^4b9f5e4d] [^43191355] [^e36361de].

> But wait, what if you are trying to self-assess eligibility for medication abortion or other time-sensitive decisions. Self-assessment of gestational duration using LMP plus simple questions can be reasonably accurate, with about 83–90% sensitivity for identifying pregnancies beyond 70 days in research settings; however, ultrasound remains the clinical standard when available, and many programs still require sonographic confirmation before proceeding, so I should caution that self-assessment complements but does not replace clinical dating in decision-making [^256a0cd2] [^4b9f5e4d].

> I should double-check limitations and when to seek care. If you have bleeding, pain, uncertainty about dates, or are considering pregnancy options, arrange prompt obstetric evaluation; if you are beyond 22 weeks and have never had dating ultrasound, discuss suboptimal dating and surveillance plans; and if you are using medications with teratogenic risk in early pregnancy, early dating and counseling can be critical for safety decisions, so do not delay care when in doubt [^43191355] [^700ec9e8].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: gestational age is counted in completed weeks and days from the first day of the last menstrual period, but first-trimester ultrasound is the most accurate way to establish dating; use LMP only if ultrasound is unavailable or as a temporary estimate, and in ART pregnancies use transfer-date calculations; if dating remains uncertain by 22 weeks, manage as suboptimally dated and align decisions with best clinical estimates and guideline-based precautions [^90d8268d] [^4b9f5e4d] [^43191355].

---

You are **X weeks pregnant** based on your last menstrual period (LMP) and confirmed by your earliest ultrasound [^4b9f5e4d]. If you are unsure of your LMP or the ultrasound conflicts with it, **first-trimester ultrasound is the most accurate** method to establish gestational age [^4b9f5e4d] [^fef4b157]. If no ultrasound confirms dating before 22 weeks, your pregnancy is considered suboptimally dated, and management should use the best clinical estimate [^43191355] [^facdeb30].

---

## Calculation of gestational age

Gestational age is calculated from the **first day of the LMP** and is expressed in completed weeks and days (e.g. 12 weeks 3 days) [^90d8268d]. This assumes a 28-day cycle with ovulation on day 14; if cycles are irregular, dating may be less accurate [^73c1a742].

---

## Accuracy of dating methods

| **Method** | **Accuracy** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Last menstrual period (LMP) | Moderate | - Relies on recall <br/> - Assumes regular cycles [^73c1a742] |
| First-trimester ultrasound (≤ 13 6/7 weeks) | High (± 5–7 days) | - May not be available <br/> - Operator-dependent [^9b619be4] |
| Second-trimester ultrasound (14–27 6/7 weeks) | Moderate (± 10–14 days) | Less accurate than first trimester [^9b619be4] |
| Third-trimester ultrasound (≥ 28 weeks) | Low (± 21–30 days) | Not reliable for dating [^3cc2daf5] |

---

First-trimester ultrasound is the **most accurate** method and should be used when available to confirm or revise the estimated due date (EDD) [^4b9f5e4d] [^fef4b157].

---

## Clinical implications of accurate dating

Accurate gestational dating is essential for:

- **Timing prenatal screenings**: Nuchal translucency, anatomy scan, and glucose screening [^80ab6474].
- **Management of complications**: Preterm labor, post-term pregnancy, and fetal growth restriction [^23f24300].
- **Interventions**: Antenatal corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and timing of delivery [^11382aeb].

---

## Suboptimally dated pregnancies

A pregnancy is **suboptimally dated** if no ultrasound confirms or revises the EDD before 22 0/7 weeks [^43191355]. In such cases:

- **Best clinical estimate**: Use LMP, physical exam, and any available ultrasound to guide care [^facdeb30].
- **Late-term delivery**: Consider at 41 weeks if gestational age is uncertain [^c1a679a0].
- **Antepartum surveillance**: May start at 39–40 weeks if dating is uncertain [^c1a679a0].

---

## Special considerations

- **Assisted reproductive technology (ART)**: Use ART-derived gestational age (embryo age + transfer date) to assign EDD [^4b9f5e4d] [^e36361de].
- **Multiple gestations**: Dating should be established in the first trimester, ideally at 11–14 weeks, to assess chorionicity and amnionicity [^c7d67168] [^ec42729e].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dating accuracy

- **Irregular menstrual cycles**: Reduce LMP accuracy; ultrasound dating is preferred [^73c1a742].
- **Uncertainty of LMP**: Common; ultrasound confirmation is recommended [^80ab6474].
- **Late presentation**: If first visit is after 22 weeks, dating accuracy is reduced; manage as suboptimally dated [^43191355].

---

## Clinical guidelines summary

ACOG recommends using **first-trimester ultrasound** to establish or confirm gestational age and EDD, documenting it clearly in the record [^4b9f5e4d]. If ultrasound is unavailable, use LMP and confirm with the earliest available ultrasound. Pregnancies without ultrasound confirmation before 22 weeks are suboptimally dated and should be managed using the best clinical estimate [^43191355].

---

You are **X weeks pregnant** based on your LMP and confirmed by your earliest ultrasound. If you are unsure of your LMP or the ultrasound conflicts with it, **first-trimester ultrasound is the most accurate** method to establish gestational age [^4b9f5e4d]. If no ultrasound confirms dating before 22 weeks, your pregnancy is considered suboptimally dated, and management should use the best clinical estimate [^43191355].

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^bc185d2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods for estimating the due date — abstract directives — As soon as data from the last menstrual period, the first accurate ultrasound examination, or both are obtained, the gestational age and the estimated due date (EDD) should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. A pregnancy without an ultrasound examination that confirms or revises the EDD before 22 0/7 weeks of gestational age should be considered suboptimally dated. When determined from the methods outlined in this document for estimating the due date, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate, and for the purposes of research and surveillance, the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the last menstrual period alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age.

### Committee opinion no. 688: management of suboptimally dated pregnancies [^43191355]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Suboptimally dated pregnancy — definition and dating thresholds — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists considers first-trimester ultrasonography to be the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestational age, and pregnancies without an ultrasonographic examination confirming or revising the estimated due date before 22 0/7 weeks of gestation should be considered suboptimally dated. A recommended 22-week cutoff replaces a historic 20 weeks of gestation threshold, supported by the rationale that a discrepancy of more than 10 days applies from 16 0/7 weeks through 21 6/7 weeks of gestation, and this aligns with the recommendation that the optimal time for a single ultrasonographic examination is at 18–22 weeks of gestation.

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^dadef12f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Accurate dating of pregnancy is important to improve outcomes and is a research and public health imperative. As soon as data from the last menstrual period, the first accurate ultrasound examination, or both are obtained, the gestational age and the estimated due date (EDD) should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. Subsequent changes to the EDD should be reserved for rare circumstances, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. A pregnancy without an ultrasound examination that confirms or revises the EDD before 22 0/7 weeks of gestational age should be considered suboptimally dated. When determined from the methods outlined in this document for estimating the due date, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate. For the purposes of research and surveillance, the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the last menstrual period alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age.

### Effects of vaccine program against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus, United States, 2009–2010 [^4e7fd10b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Table 2
Estimates of cumulative weekly number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus vaccine doses administered (rounded to the nearest 1,000), by population subgroup*

*Monthly estimates, by population subgroups, are from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Estimates were benchmarked to final season monthly estimates for available age and target groups. Adjustments were made to overall population counts and the number of persons vaccinated to account for limitations in either dataset. The distribution of weekly and monthly numbers of persons vaccinated were obtained from the survey data. HR, high risk; NP, not pregnant; HCW, health care worker; Contact, household contacts and caregivers of children < 6 mo of age.
†Weekly estimates were made by examining overall National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey weekly vaccination numbers and by using the same distribution to estimate the first 3 weeks of data. For all other weeks, data were estimated by using linear interpolation between point estimates at the start and end of each month.
‡Weeks during which influenza activity was reported during 2009–10 influenza reporting period; 40–52 indicates last 12 weeks of 2009, and 1–15 indicates first 15 weeks of 2010.
§Estimated number of pregnant women from survey data was considered an underestimation because of the definition of pregnant women and low sample size. Therefore, the total number of pregnant women vaccinated during the course of the pandemic was based on data from Moro et al. Because the cohort of pregnant women changed during the influenza season, analysis for this group was restricted to NHFS interviews conducted April 4, 2010–Jun 30, 2010. During this time, a new question, "Were you pregnant at any time October 2009 through January 2010?" was added to the NHFS for women 18–64 y to include those pregnant during the major vaccination period. Because no information was available on vaccinations among pregnant women after January, we assumed no further vaccinations were administered, an approach that could have underestimated the effects of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus vaccination on pregnant women.

### Routine ultrasound for fetal assessment before 24 weeks' gestation [^c40c26e3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ultrasound examination of pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation may lead to more accurate dating and earlier diagnosis of pathology, but may also give false reassurance. It can be used to monitor development or diagnose conditions of an unborn baby. This review compares the effect of routine or universal, ultrasound examination, performed before 24 completed weeks' gestation, with selective or no ultrasound examination. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise. To assess the effect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 11 August 2020. We also examined the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and RCTs published in abstract form. We included all trials with pregnant women who had routine or revealed ultrasound versus selective ultrasound, no ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound, before 24 weeks' gestation. All eligible studies were screened for scientific integrity and trustworthiness.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data and checked extracted data for accuracy. Two review authors independently used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome MAIN RESULTS: Our review included data from 13 RCTs including 85,265 women. The review included four comparisons. Four trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment and two as high risk. The nature of the intervention made it impossible to blind women and staff providing care to treatment allocation. Sample attrition was low in the majority of trials and outcome data were available for most women. Many trials were conducted before it was customary for trials to be registered and protocols published. First trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: four studies, 1791 women, from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). First trimester scans probably reduce short-term maternal anxiety about pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; moderate-certainty evidence). We do not have information on whether the reduction was sustained. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of first trimester scans on perinatal loss (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; 648 participants; one study; low-certainty evidence) or induction of labour for post-maturity (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants; three studies; low-certainty evidence). The effect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported. Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: seven studies, 36,053 women, from Finland, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the US. Second trimester scans probably make little difference to perinatal loss (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.20; 17,918 participants, three studies; moderate-certainty evidence) or intrauterine fetal death (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence). Second trimester scans may reduce induction of labour for post-maturity (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; low-certainty evidence), presumably by more accurate dating. Routine second trimester ultrasound may improve detection of multiple pregnancy (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low-certainty evidence). Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low-certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26,893 participants, four studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Long-term follow-up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate harm to children's physical or intellectual development (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34; 603 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence). The effect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported. Standard care plus two ultrasounds and referral for complications versus standard care: one cluster-RCT, 47,431 women, from Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia. This trial included a co-intervention, training of healthcare workers and referral for complications and was, therefore, assessed separately. Standard pregnancy care plus two scans, and training and referral for complications, versus standard care probably makes little difference to whether women with complications give birth in a risk appropriate setting with facilities for caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The intervention also probably makes little to no difference to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about whether the community intervention (including ultrasound) makes any difference to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46,768 participants; low-certainty evidence). Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor at any time before 24 weeks): one study, 1095 women, from the UK. The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Early scans probably reduce short term maternal anxiety. Later scans may reduce labour induction for post-maturity. They may improve detection of major fetal abnormalities and increase the number of women who choose termination of pregnancy for this reason. They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies. All these findings accord with observational data. Neither type of scan appears to alter other important maternal or fetal outcomes, but our review may underestimate the effect in modern practice because trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of the technology, and many control participants also had scans. The trials were also underpowered to show an effect on other important maternal or fetal outcomes.

### A lexicon for first-trimester US: society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference recommendations [^90d8268d]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Gestational age (GA) and the first trimester — "The duration of pregnancy is called gestational age (GA) and is reported as number of weeks and number of days", and "GA is calculated by the best obstetric estimate, typically using the first day of the last menstrual period and/or an early-dating US examination". Synonyms are provided: "Alternate terms for GA are menstrual age, gestational duration, clinical age, or clinical dates". The first-trimester boundary is explicit: "The first trimester of pregnancy is defined as a GA of 13 weeks 6 days or less". Terminology use is constrained: "The term normal should only be used to describe the first-trimester US examination characteristics, such as normal first-trimester US examination or normal location", and "'Normal first-trimester pregnancy' should be avoided since abnormalities may be undetectable at this early GA".

### Why we should eliminate the due date: a truth in jest [^2eb6321a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

We currently use flawed calculations to set a woman's due date based on menstrual periods to determine gestational age. We use the estimated gestational age to make management decisions based on our patients' individual needs. This principle is in contrast to our patients' use of dating to set an estimated date of confinement. This date is seen as a very specific point in time. Patients and their families plan on that date and become distressed when the expected date is not met. Given that many patients are induced electively, that many will have their delivery dates changed, and that many will have delivery dates adjusted for medical reasons, and most importantly given that dating is inaccurate and unreliable, we propose eliminating the due date. We propose giving patients a calculated assigned week of delivery at 32 weeks. An assigned week of delivery allows for individualization of obstetric care based on the needs of our patients, their support systems, and hospital staffing. We believe an assigned week of delivery will improve obstetric practice and patient satisfaction.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^e9272a06]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Comments and evidence summary — uncertain pregnancy status and transitional protection: In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the patient might be pregnant, the benefits of starting the implant likely exceed any risk, and starting the implant should be considered at any time with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2–4 weeks. If a patient needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to an implant from another contraceptive method, consider continuing their previous method for 7 days after implant placement, and no direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting the implant at different times of the cycle.

### Obesity in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 230 [^a4c52fe6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, ACOG 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining weekly antenatal fetal surveillance starting at 37 weeks of gestation in patients with a prepregnancy BMI of 35.0–39.9 kg/m², and starting at 34 weeks of gestation in patients with a prepregnancy BMI ≥ 40 kg/m².

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^0aa46e05]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy due date estimation — conclusion and EDD adjustment guidance states that the best available data support adjusting the estimated due date (EDD) if the first ultrasonography is in the third trimester and suggests a discrepancy in gestational dating of more than 21 days. As soon as data from the last menstrual period (LMP) or the first accurate ultrasound examination are obtained, the gestational age and the EDD should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record, and subsequent changes to the EDD should be reserved for rare circumstances. When determined from the outlined methods, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate, and for research and surveillance the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the LMP alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age. A pregnancy without an ultrasound examination that confirms or revises the EDD before 22 0/7 weeks of gestation age should be considered suboptimally dated. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine recognize the advantages of a single dating paradigm being used within and between institutions, and Table 1 provides guidelines for estimating the due date based on ultrasonography and the LMP with single-point cutoffs and ranges.

### Should a first trimester dating scan be routine for all pregnancies? [^9b619be4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Accurate pregnancy dating is important for diagnostic and management decisions during pregnancy. Dating by last menstrual period is less reliable than dating by ultrasound, since the former has memory-related and other sources of inaccuracy. Dating by first trimester ultrasound, via the crown-rump length, has a 95% confidence range of ± 5 days, slightly better than the ± 8 days for dating by second trimester ultrasound at 14–20 weeks. This small difference appears to be too small to justify a routine first trimester scan for the purpose of dating the pregnancy.

### Induction of labour at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation [^e0f8fabf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Risks of stillbirth or neonatal death increase as gestation continues beyond term (around 40 weeks' gestation). It is unclear whether a policy of labour induction can reduce these risks. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review that was originally published in 2006 and subsequently updated in 2012 and 2018.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a policy of labour induction at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation compared with a policy of awaiting spontaneous labour indefinitely (or until a later gestational age, or until a maternal or fetal indication for induction of labour arises) on pregnancy outcomes for the infant and the mother.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (17 July 2019), and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in pregnant women at or beyond 37 weeks, comparing a policy of labour induction with a policy of awaiting spontaneous onset of labour (expectant management). We also included trials published in abstract form only. Cluster-RCTs, quasi-RCTs and trials using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review. We included pregnant women at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation. Since risk factors at this stage of pregnancy would normally require intervention, only trials including women at low risk for complications, as defined by trialists, were eligible. The trials of induction of labour in women with prelabour rupture of membranes at or beyond term were not considered in this review but are considered in a separate Cochrane Review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

In this updated review, we included 34 RCTs (reporting on over 21,000 women and infants) mostly conducted in high-income settings. The trials compared a policy to induce labour usually after 41 completed weeks of gestation (> 287 days) with waiting for labour to start and/or waiting for a period before inducing labour. The trials were generally at low to moderate risk of bias. Compared with a policy of expectant management, a policy of labour induction was associated with fewer (all-cause) perinatal deaths (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.64; 22 trials, 18,795 infants; high-certainty evidence). There were four perinatal deaths in the labour induction policy group compared with 25 perinatal deaths in the expectant management group. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with induction of labour, in order to prevent one perinatal death, was 544 (95% CI 441 to 1042). There were also fewer stillbirths in the induction group (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.75; 22 trials, 18,795 infants; high-certainty evidence); two in the induction policy group and 16 in the expectant management group. For women in the policy of induction arms of trials, there were probably fewer caesarean sections compared with expectant management (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.95; 31 trials, 21,030 women; moderate-certainty evidence); and probably little or no difference in operative vaginal births with induction (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.10; 22 trials, 18,584 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Induction may make little or difference to perineal trauma (severe perineal tear: RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.26; 5 trials; 11,589 women; low-certainty evidence). Induction probably makes little or no difference to postpartum haemorrhage (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.15, 9 trials; 12,609 women; moderate-certainty evidence), or breastfeeding at discharge (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.04; 2 trials, 7487 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Very low certainty evidence means that we are uncertain about the effect of induction or expectant management on the length of maternal hospital stay (average mean difference (MD) -0.19 days, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.18; 7 trials; 4120 women; Tau² = 0.20; I² = 94%). Rates of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission were lower (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.96; 17 trials, 17,826 infants; high-certainty evidence), and probably fewer babies had Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes in the induction groups compared with expectant management (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96; 20 trials, 18,345 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). Induction or expectant management may make little or no difference for neonatal encephalopathy (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.31; 2 trials, 8851 infants; low-certainty evidence, and probably makes little or no difference for neonatal trauma (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.49; 5 trials, 13,106 infants; moderate-certainty evidence) for induction compared with expectant management. Neurodevelopment at childhood follow-up and postnatal depression were not reported by any trials. In subgroup analyses, no differences were seen for timing of induction (< 40 versus 40–41 versus > 41 weeks' gestation), by parity (primiparous versus multiparous) or state of cervix for any of the main outcomes (perinatal death, stillbirth, NICU admission, caesarean section, operative vaginal birth, or perineal trauma).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a clear reduction in perinatal death with a policy of labour induction at or beyond 37 weeks compared with expectant management, though absolute rates are small (0.4 versus 3 deaths per 1000). There were also lower caesarean rates without increasing rates of operative vaginal births and there were fewer NICU admissions with a policy of induction. Most of the important outcomes assessed using GRADE had high- or moderate-certainty ratings. While existing trials have not yet reported on childhood neurodevelopment, this is an important area for future research. The optimal timing of offering induction of labour to women at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation needs further investigation, as does further exploration of risk profiles of women and their values and preferences. Offering women tailored counselling may help them make an informed choice between induction of labour for pregnancies, particularly those continuing beyond 41 weeks - or waiting for labour to start and/or waiting before inducing labour.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee Opinion No. 688 — definition and overarching management for suboptimally dated pregnancies states that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists considers first-trimester ultrasonography to be the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestational age, and that pregnancies without an ultrasonographic examination confirming or revising the estimated due date before 22 0/7 weeks of gestation should be considered suboptimally dated. Although guidelines for indicated late-preterm and early-term deliveries depend on accurate dating, women with suboptimally dated pregnancies should be managed according to these same guidelines because of the lack of a superior alternative, and the best clinical estimate of gestational age should serve as the basis for decisions regarding antenatal corticosteroid exposure in women at perceived risk of preterm delivery.

### Practice bulletin no. 146: management of late-term and postterm pregnancies [^23f24300]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Postterm pregnancy refers to a pregnancy that has reached or extended beyond 42 0/7 weeks of gestation from the last menstrual period (LMP), whereas a late-term pregnancy is defined as one that has reached between 41 0/7 weeks and 41 6/7 weeks of gestation (). In 2011, the overall incidence of postterm pregnancy in the United States was 5.5% (). The incidence of postterm pregnancies may vary by population, in part as a result of differences in regional management practices for pregnancies that go beyond the estimated date of delivery. Accurate determination of gestational age is essential to accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of late-term and postterm pregnancies. Antepartum fetal surveillance and induction of labor have been evaluated as strategies to decrease the risks of perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with late-term and postterm pregnancies. The purpose of this document is to review the current understanding of late-term and postterm pregnancies and provide guidelines for management that have been validated by appropriately conducted outcome-based research when available. Additional guidelines on the basis of consensus and expert opinion also are presented.

### Committee opinion no 611: method for estimating due date [^54414c2d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Accurate dating of pregnancy is important to improve outcomes and is a research and public health imperative. As soon as data from the last menstrual period, the first accurate ultrasound examination, or both are obtained, the gestational age and the estimated due date should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. Subsequent changes to the estimated due date should be reserved for rare circumstances, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. When determined from the methods outlined in this document for estimating the due date, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate. For the purposes of research and surveillance, the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the last menstrual period alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol [^c07ad9f1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

What should I know about my period when using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring?

When you use etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unplanned bleeding. Unplanned bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Unplanned bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use, but may also occur after you have been using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue using the ring on schedule. If the unplanned bleeding or spotting is heavy or lasts for more than a few days, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider.

What if I miss my regular scheduled period when using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring?

Some women miss periods on hormonal birth control, even when they are not pregnant. Consider the possibility that you may be pregnant if:

you miss a period and etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring was out of the vagina for more than 3 hours during the 3 weeks (21 days) of ring use
you miss a period and waited longer than 1 week to insert a new ring
you have followed the instructions and you miss 2 periods in a row
you have left etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring in place for longer than 4 weeks (28 days)

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop using etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring.

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^4b9f5e4d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods for estimating the due date — recommendations — Ultrasound measurement of the embryo or fetus in the first trimester (up to and including 13 6/7 weeks of gestation) is the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestational age. If pregnancy resulted from assisted reproductive technology (ART), the ART-derived gestational age should be used to assign the estimated due date (EDD). For instance, the EDD for a pregnancy that resulted from in vitro fertilization should be assigned using the age of the embryo and the date of transfer. As soon as data from the last menstrual period (LMP), the first accurate ultrasound examination, or both are obtained, the gestational age and the EDD should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. Subsequent changes to the EDD should be reserved for rare circumstances, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. When determined from the methods outlined in this document for estimating the due date, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate. For the purposes of research and surveillance, the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the LMP alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age.

### Levonorgestrel (My way) [^e6afd588]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

How can I get the best results from My Way?

You have only a few days to try to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. The sooner you take My Way, the better it works. My Way should be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex.

How effective is My Way?

The sooner you take My Way, the better it will work. Take My Way as soon as possible after unprotected sex. If it is taken as soon as possible within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex, it will significantly decrease the chance that you will get pregnant. Seven out of every 8 women who would have gotten pregnant will not become pregnant.

How will I know if My Way worked?

Most women will have their menstrual period at the expected time or within a week of the expected time. If your menstrual period is delayed beyond 1 week, you may be pregnant. You should get a pregnancy test and follow up with your healthcare professional.

What if I am already pregnant and use My Way?

There is no medical evidence that My Way would harm a developing baby. If you take My Way (accidentally) after you are already pregnant or it does not work and you become pregnant, it is not likely to cause any harm to you or your pregnancy. The pregnancy will continue. My Way will not work if you are already pregnant.

### Committee opinion no. 688: management of suboptimally dated pregnancies [^facdeb30]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists considers first-trimester ultrasonography to be the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestational age. Pregnancies without an ultrasonographic examination confirming or revising the estimated due date before 22 0/7 weeks of gestation should be considered suboptimally dated. This document provides guidance for managing pregnancies in which the best clinical estimate of gestational age is suboptimal. There is no role for elective delivery in a woman with a suboptimally dated pregnancy. Although guidelines for indicated late-preterm and early-term deliveries depend on accurate determination of gestational age, women with suboptimally dated pregnancies should be managed according to these same guidelines because of the lack of a superior alternative. The best clinical estimate of gestational age should serve as the basis for decisions regarding antenatal corticosteroid exposure in women with suboptimally dated pregnancies who are at perceived risk of preterm delivery. Amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity is not recommended as a routine component of decision making when considering delivery in a woman with a suboptimally dated pregnancy. Late-term delivery is indicated at 41 weeks of gestation when gestational age is uncertain, using the best clinical estimate of gestational age. Initiation of antepartum fetal surveillance at 39–40 weeks of gestation may be considered for suboptimally dated pregnancies. During the antenatal care of a woman with a suboptimally dated pregnancy, it is reasonable to consider an interval ultrasonographic assessment of fetal weight and gestational age 3–4 weeks after the initial ultrasonographic study.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 211: critical care in pregnancy [^3c18f9f8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 211 — antenatal corticosteroids for critically ill pregnant women provides gestational-age–specific guidance. Administration of steroids for fetal benefit should be considered in women admitted to the ICU in the preterm period. A single course of betamethasone or dexamethasone is recommended for pregnant women between 24 0/7 weeks of gestation and 33 6/7 weeks of gestation at risk of preterm birth within 1 week in order to reduce neonatal mortality and some complications of prematurity. There may be some neonatal benefit as early as 23 weeks of gestation and steroids can be offered at 23 0/7 weeks of gestation depending on the family's decision regarding neonatal resuscitation. Based on the Maternal–Fetal Medicine Units Network Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids trial, steroids administered between 34 0/7 weeks of gestation and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity, but antenatal corticosteroids have not been tested in the setting of critical maternal illness and may cause hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, leukocytosis, and impaired wound healing. Thus, the risks and benefits should be weighed with special attention to the perceived likelihood of delivery in the next 7 days, and indicated delivery should not be delayed for administration of steroids in the late preterm period.

### Committee opinion no. 688: management of suboptimally dated pregnancies [^fa30035b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Suboptimally dated pregnancy — antepartum management and delivery timing: In a patient with a suboptimally dated pregnancy and a prior low-transverse cesarean delivery who requests a repeat cesarean delivery, delivery is advised at 39 weeks of gestation using best clinical estimate of gestational age. During antepartum care, it is reasonable to consider an interval ultrasonographic assessment of fetal weight and gestational age 3–4 weeks after the initial ultrasonographic study, and interval fetal growth assessment potentially may detect cases of fetal growth restriction. For cases in which fetal growth restriction is suspected upon follow-up ultrasonography, fetal surveillance with umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry study is indicated and delivery timing should be reconsidered. When planning a delivery, the patient should be informed that limitations in determining an accurate gestational age introduce a greater risk of neonatal morbidity if the pregnancy is dated incorrectly and is actually earlier in gestation than it is believed to be, and that the rationale supporting delivery is that the risks of an ongoing pregnancy in the setting of a specific indication are believed to outweigh the risks associated with inaccurate gestational age assignment.

Subsequent prenatal visits — actions at every visit: Obstetric visit frequency should be individualized, with an uncomplicated first pregnancy typically examined every 4 weeks until 28 weeks' gestation, every 2 weeks from 28–36 weeks' gestation, and then every week until delivery. People with medical or obstetric complications might require closer surveillance, and parous people without medical or obstetric complications who have had prior normal pregnancy outcomes may be seen less frequently as long as additional appointments are available as needed. During each regularly scheduled visit, the obstetric provider should evaluate blood pressure, patient weight, uterine size for progressive growth and consistency with gestational age, and presence of fetal heart activity at appropriate gestational ages, and after quickening should ask about fetal movement at each prenatal visit thereafter.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: medication abortion between 14 0 / 7 and 27 6 / 7 weeks of gestation: jointly developed with the Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine [^e4aa1cc4]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Medication abortion — pain management between 14 0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks is addressed with the following guidance: The World Health Organization recommends routinely offering pain medication for medication abortion at any gestational duration; for pain management for medication abortion at or ≥ 12 weeks of gestation, they suggest consideration of methods for pain control in addition to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, including antiemetics and epidural anesthesia, where available, and where available, other pain management techniques — including moderate sedation, nitrous oxide, intravenous opiates, or patient-controlled analgesia — should be considered. Post-abortion, patients may experience discomfort and in most cases over-the-counter medications or topical management for vaginal and vulvar swelling should be sufficient to provide pain relief; a multimodal, step-wise approach using a combination of agents with different mechanisms of action is recommended to individualize pain control, and if opioids are required, a short course of low-dose opioids can be considered; however, severe pain following medication abortion is unusual and should prompt an evaluation for potential complications.

ACOG further states there is no role for elective delivery in a woman with a suboptimally dated pregnancy and that such pregnancies should be managed according to the same indicated LPT and ET delivery guidelines because of the lack of a superior alternative. Recommendations also state there are maternal, fetal, and placental complications for which either an LPT or ET delivery is warranted, and deferring delivery to the 39th week is not recommended if there is a medical or obstetric indication for earlier delivery.

Early (dating) ultrasound — The Work Group advises a first-trimester ultrasound to establish or confirm the gestational age and estimated birth date and to confirm the presence of cardiac activity; for pregnant patients who present after the first trimester, we advise performing a dating and anatomical ultrasound at the earliest opportunity, preferably before 22 weeks. The estimated due date is initially established by calculating 280 days from the first day of the last normal menstrual period, but only about 50% of patients accurately recall the date of the last menstrual period and menstrual cycles might be shorter or longer than 28 days, supporting ultrasound confirmation. Beyond dating, early ultrasound indications include evaluation of vaginal bleeding, confirmation of an intrauterine location, presence and chronicity of multiple gestations, presence of uterine anomalies, or presence of other pelvic pathology, and patients with complaints of bleeding or pain should be referred for immediate ultrasound on presentation.

### The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity and sedentary behavior during pregnancy: a prospective study [^7b4af0a5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Study design

A total of three 7-day assessments were conducted in early, mid, and late pregnancy. Women were recruited in early pregnancy (i.e. 8–20 weeks gestation). The late pregnancy assessment was scheduled 4 to 5 weeks prior to the expected delivery date (i.e. 35–36 weeks gestation) and the middle pregnancy assessment was scheduled halfway between the early and late pregnancy assessment. Participants were given the option of an in-person or virtual assessment. At the beginning of each assessment period, the PPAQ was administered and women were instructed in use of the ActiGraph to be worn for the following 7-days. Participants were instructed on how to complete a wear log, which recorded times that ActiGraph was not worn (e.g. during sleeping or water-based activities). Video recorded demonstrations of how to correctly wear the monitors, as well as links to paper-based materials were provided for all participants on a study website. At the end of each assessment period, the PPAQ was repeated.

The impact of the onset of the pandemic was evaluated cross-sectionally at each of the three assessment timepoints (i.e. early, middle, and late pregnancy). A secondary analysis, limited to women whose enrollment periods spanned the pre and post COVID-19 pandemic onset dates, was also conducted.

Assessment of COVID-19 impact

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was defined in two ways. First, the fixed date of March 13, 2020 was used. This date, which represents the timeframe in which states and businesses considered stay-at-home mandates, was selected to be consistent with prior studies that used a mid-March timeframe. PA before March 13, 2020 was therefore defined as "not impacted by COVID-19" and PA after March 13, 2020 was defined as "impacted by COVID-19".

Secondly, the self-reported COVID-19 impact date was used. Specifically, at each assessment conducted after mid-March of 2020, women were asked, "Has your lifestyle or daily routine been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic?" For those that responded 'yes', PA before the self-reported COVID-19 impact date was therefore defined as "not impacted by COVID-19" and PA after the self-reported COVID-19 impact date was defined as "impacted by COVID-19".

### Accuracy of self-assessment of gestational duration among people seeking abortion [^256a0cd2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Mifepristone, used together with misoprostol, is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for medication abortion through 10 weeks' gestation. Although in-person ultrasound is frequently used to establish medication abortion eligibility, previous research demonstrates that people seeking abortion early in pregnancy can accurately self-assess gestational duration using the date of their last menstrual period.

Objective

In this study, we establish the screening performance of a broader set of questions for self-assessment of gestational duration among a sample of people seeking abortion at a wide range of gestations.

Study Design

We surveyed patients seeking abortion at 7 facilities before ultrasound and compared self-assessments of gestational duration using 11 pregnancy dating questions with measurements on ultrasound. For individual pregnancy dating questions and combined questions, we established screening performance focusing on metrics of diagnostic accuracy, defined as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity (or the proportion of ineligible participants who correctly screened as ineligible for medication abortion), and proportion of false negatives (ie, the proportion of all participants who erroneously screened as eligible for medication abortion). We tested for differences in sensitivity across individual and combined questions using McNemar's test, and for differences in accuracy using the area under the receiver operating curve and Sidak adjusted P values.

Results

One-quarter (25%) of 1089 participants had a gestational duration of > 70 days on ultrasound. Using the date of last menstrual period alone demonstrated 83.5% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 78.4–87.9) in identifying participants with gestational durations of > 70 days on ultrasound, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.79–0.85) and a proportion of false negatives of 4.0%. A composite measure of responses to questions on number of weeks pregnant, date of last menstrual period, and date they got pregnant demonstrated 89.1% sensitivity (95% confidence interval, 84.7–92.6) and an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.88), with 2.7% of false negatives. A simpler question set focused on being > 10 weeks or > 2 months pregnant or having missed 2 or more periods had comparable sensitivity (90.7%; 95% confidence interval, 86.6–93.9) and proportion of false negatives (2.3%), but with a slightly lower area under the receiver operating curve (0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.79–0.84).

Conclusion

In a sample representative of people seeking abortion nationally, broadening the screening questions for assessing gestational duration beyond the date of the last menstrual period resulted in improved accuracy and sensitivity of self-assessment at the 70-day threshold for medication abortion. Ultrasound assessment for medication abortion may not be necessary, especially when requiring ultrasound could increase COVID-19 risk or healthcare costs, restrict access, or limit patient choice.

### "I can guess the month… but beyond that, I can' T tell" an exploratory qualitative study of health care provider perspectives on gestational age estimation in rajasthan, India [^87c33997]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

13.7 million preterm births (births prior to 37 weeks' gestation) occur annually in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) – over 90% of the global burden. Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of mortality among children under five years. Of the 2.7 million annual neonatal deaths (occurring in the first 27 days), 0.94 million (35%) are attributable to conditions related to preterm birth. In India, approximately 3.5 million infants are born too early each year and preterm birth-related conditions are the cause of 0.3 million deaths among Indian children under five. Conditions related to preterm birth cause 43% of all neonatal mortality and 27% of all under five mortality in India.

Knowing the gestational age of a fetus is vital to the provision of antenatal corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm delivery, which could save 370,000 lives each year. While the administration of antenatal corticosteroids is recommended for women at risk of preterm birth from 24 weeks to 34 weeks, administration after 34 weeks' gestation brings risk of harm to mature fetuses exposed to corticosteroid in-utero that may outweigh the benefits. The World Health Organization thus recommends that: "antenatal corticosteroid should not be routinely administered in situations where the gestational age cannot be confirmed".

Accurate gestational age assessment also enables the timely initiation of appropriate care for a preterm infant. Furthermore, many aspects of maternal healthcare rely on gestational age estimates, including mobile phone-based health messaging programs that provide stage-based pregnancy information to millions of women in LMICs.

In high-resource settings, early pregnancy ultrasound-based dating is standard practice and considered the most accurate method of gestational age estimation. The gold standard is ultrasound prior to 14 weeks gestation, while estimates prior to 22 weeks are considered adequate. Ultrasound-based dating during the first trimester often uses crown–rump length to estimate gestational age, since there is a linear relationship between this measurement and gestation age during early pregnancy. Later in pregnancy, gestational age can be estimated, albeit with lower accuracy, through ultrasound measurement of combinations of biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur (diaphysis) length. Menstrual-based dating is also widely used, and calculates the estimated date of full term delivery (40 weeks' gestation) as 280 days from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP), but is only accurate among women who menstruated regularly and can recall their LMP.

### The international glossary on infertility and fertility care, 2017 [^e36361de]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, 2017 — Consensus definitions for assisted reproductive technology (ART) and pregnancy terms are provided. Fetus is defined as the stages of development of an organism from eight completed weeks of fertilization (equivalent to 10 weeks of gestational age) until the end of pregnancy. Full-term birth is defined as a birth that takes place between 37 and 42 completed weeks of gestational age. Gestational age in ART is calculated by adding two weeks (14 days) to the number of completed weeks since fertilization, and for frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles an estimated date of fertilization is computed by subtracting the combined number of days an embryo was in culture pre-cryopreservation and post-thaw/-warm, from the transfer date of the FET cycle. High-order multiple births are the complete expulsion or extraction from their mother of three or more fetuses, after 22 completed weeks of gestational age, and high-order multiple gestation is a pregnancy with three or more embryos or fetuses. Haploidy is the condition in which a cell has one set of each of the 23 single chromosomes, and mature human gametes are haploid, each having 23 single chromosomes. Heterotopic pregnancy is concurrent pregnancy involving at least one embryo implanted in the uterine cavity and at least one implanted outside of the uterine cavity. Implantation is the attachment and subsequent penetration by a zona-free blastocyst into the endometrium (or, in ectopic pregnancy, into tissue outside the uterine cavity), and this process starts 5 to 7 days after fertilization of the oocyte. Implantation rate is the number of gestational sacs observed divided by the number of embryos transferred (usually expressed as a percentage, %). A Freeze-all cycle is an ART cycle in which, after oocyte aspiration, all oocytes and/or embryos are cryopreserved and no oocytes and/or embryos are transferred to a woman in that cycle.

EMBRYONIC AND FETAL DEVELOPMENT

To understand ART procedures and their potential risks, background knowledge of embryonic and fetal development is necessary. The initial fusion of egg and sperm gametes results in a diploid zygote (Figure 2). Cleavage divisions of the zygote occur every 12 to 24 hours, with individual cells at this stage termed a blastomere. At one day after the eight‐cell stage the zygote becomes a morula, at which time all cells are totipotent. The morula subsequently develops into a blastocyst on day 5. Natural implantation occurs during days 8 to 9.

FIGURE 2
Embryology. After ovulation and fertilization, the oocyte develops into a zygote which implants in the uterine wall. After implantation, the zygote will continue to develop until delivery.

Advances in culture media have led to a shift in IVF from cleavage stage embryo transfer to blastocyst stage transfer, with the belief that blastocyst transfer will improve uterine and embryonic synchronicity and enable self‐selection of viable embryos, leading to improved rates of live birth. PGT, when indicated, is now also performed at the blastocyst stage. However, it remains unclear whether the day of transfer has a beneficial effect on live birth and pregnancy rates.

Embryonic development extends from fertilization through the 10th week of pregnancy, during which time organs and body structures are formed. Fetal development begins at the 11th week (the 9th week after fertilization) and continues until birth. Embryonic and fetal development are precisely temporally and spatially organized. This elegant process is guided both by genomic mechanisms and by the environment, including maternal nutrition.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to considerations for delivery, ES/ESE 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering early delivery in patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus based on risk assessment rather than expectant management.
Consider using risk assessment criteria such as the history of diabetes-related complications, measures of glycemia, ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume, and the presence of other comorbidities associated with adverse perinatal outcomes to inform ideal delivery timing. Recognize that risks may outweigh any benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation, even among patients with ideal glycemic management.

### Adults prenatally exposed to the Dutch famine exhibit a metabolic signature associated with a broad spectrum of common diseases [^11183643]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Famine exposure definitions

Food rations were distributed centrally and below 900 kcal/day between 26 November 1944, and 15 May 1945. We defined famine exposure by the number of weeks during which the mother was exposed to < 900 kcal/day after the last menstrual period (LMP) recorded on the birth record. The gestational period was estimated from the LMP of the mother and the date of birth of the child. To analyse the effect of timing of gestational exposure, we subdivide the gestational period into units of 10 weeks. We considered the mother exposed in gestational weeks 1–10, 11–20, 21–30, or 31 to delivery if these gestational time windows were entirely contained within this period and had an average exposure of < 900 kcal/day during an entire gestation period of 10 weeks. As the famine lasted 6 months, some participants were exposed to famine during two adjacent 10-week periods. In chronological order, pregnancies with LMP between 30 April 1944 and 24 August 1944 were considered exposed in weeks 31 to delivery, between 9 July 1944 and 15 October 1944 in pregnancy weeks 21–30, between 17 September 1944 and 24 December 1944 in pregnancy weeks 11–20, and between 26 November 1944 and 4 March 1945 in pregnancy weeks 1–10. Individuals with a LMP between 4 February and 12 May 1945 which were exposed to an average of < 900 kcal/day for less than 10 weeks before conception and up to 8 weeks post-conception are denoted as the weeks 9–0 weeks group. We defined individuals exposed to one or two of these definitions exposed to 'any' gestational exposure.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^933c0bb1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Switching from Another Contraceptive Method

Timing: The implant may be placed immediately if it is reasonably certain that the patient is not pregnant (Box 3). Waiting for the patient's next menstrual cycle is unnecessary.
Need for back-up contraception: If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.
Switching from an IUD: In addition to the need for back-up contraception when starting the implant, there might be additional concerns when switching from an IUD. If the patient has had sexual intercourse since the start of their current menstrual cycle and it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, theoretically, residual sperm might be in the genital tract, which could lead to fertilization if ovulation occurs. A health care provider may consider any of the following options to address the potential for residual sperm: º Advise the patient to retain the IUD for at least 7 days after the implant is placed and return for IUD removal. º Advise the patient to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days before removing the IUD and switching to the new method. If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days. º If the patient cannot return for IUD removal and has not abstained from sexual intercourse or used barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days, advise the patient to use ECPs (with the exception of UPA) at the time of IUD removal. If it has been > 5 days since menstrual bleeding started, the patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for the next 7 days.

Comments and Evidence Summary. In situations in which the health care provider is uncertain whether the patient might be pregnant, the benefits of starting the implant likely exceed any risk. Therefore, starting the implant should be considered at any time, with a follow-up pregnancy test in 2–4 weeks. If a patient needs to use additional contraceptive protection when switching to an implant from another contraceptive method, consider continuing their previous method for 7 days after implant placement. (As appropriate, see recommendations for Emergency Contraception.)

No direct evidence was found regarding the effects of starting the ENG implant at different times of the cycle.

### Practice bulletin no. 175: ultrasound in pregnancy [^80ab6474]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound in pregnancy — optimal timing for obstetric ultrasonography emphasizes indication-driven scheduling and dating accuracy: For patients with uncertain or unreliable menstrual dating or with an indication to confirm viability, first-trimester ultrasonography is most accurate, and in these instances, a dating ultrasound examination should be obtained at the first prenatal visit. When used as part of combined first-trimester screening or integrated screening for aneuploidy, an ultrasound examination with nuchal translucency measurement before 14 0/7 weeks of gestation provides accurate dating of pregnancy, but a complete anatomic assessment is not possible before at least 14 weeks of gestation. In the absence of other specific indications, the optimal time for a single ultrasound examination is at 18–22 weeks of gestation, which allows for a survey of fetal anatomy in most women and an accurate estimation of gestational age; at 18–22 weeks of gestation, anatomically complex organs such as the fetal heart and brain can be imaged with sufficient clarity to allow detection of many major malformations.

- **Pathophysiology**: Early pregnancy is a result of conception either naturally or following medical intervention.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of early pregnancy include nausea, vomiting, back pain, pelvic girdle pain, pelvic cavity pain, vulvar itching, varicose veins, pruritus, leg cramp, exhaustion, frequent coughs and colds, migraines, constipation, hemorrhoids, depression, anxiety, and vaginal bleeding. Vaginal bleeding may lead to spontaneous abortion.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the US, mortality associated with legal induced abortion is < 1 per 100,000 procedures.

### Pregnancy and contraceptive use among women participating in an HIV prevention trial in tanzania [^e3b0cde1]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2012). Low credibility.

Ethical approval for the trial was given by the ethics committees of the Tanzanian Medical Research Coordinating Committee and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (Current Controlled Trials number ISRCTN35385041).

This study is a secondary analysis of trial data that were analysed using Stata V.10.1 (College Station). Pregnancy rates were calculated as number of pregnancies/person-years of follow-up. Women were censored at the earliest of date of first pregnancy, date last seen or end of study. Women who became pregnant more than once contributed person-years only to the time of their first pregnancy. Since pregnancy tests were not done at every visit, it was assumed that the subject was not pregnant if a test was not performed. Date of conception was calculated as midway between the date of first positive pregnancy test and the previous visit date, if this period was ≤ 9 months. If the period was over 9 months, then date of conception was assumed to be 4.5 months before the date of first positive pregnancy test. To check the sensitivity of the results to the definition of date of conception, two additional methods were used to estimate the conception date. First, the conception date was estimated as 40 weeks before the delivery date, if that information was available (no pre-term births were recorded in the trial). Second, the conception date was estimated as midway between the LMP date of and first positive pregnancy test.

Poisson regression was used to estimate RR for the association of pregnancy with baseline factors and time-varying exposures measured during follow-up and trends in pregnancy rates over trial follow-up.

Contraceptive use at each visit was categorised as any modern method (hormonal methods, the intra-uterine contraceptive device (IUD) or condoms) or other method. ORs for factors associated with modern contraception use during follow-up were estimated using random effects logistic regression to account for within-woman correlations. The enrolment visit was excluded from the analysis. Trends over time in the use of hormonal methods and condoms were assessed, restricted to women who attended the 30-month visit. Condom use was defined from responses to the question 'what method are you currently using for family planning?' and did not include condom use for other purposes.

### Clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant and recently pregnant people [^01c1a420]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical presentation, symptomology, and disease course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy.

Methods

The PRIORITY (Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY) study is an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study of people in the United States who are pregnant or up to 6 weeks postpregnancy with known or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We analyzed the clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19 in participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and reported symptoms at the time of testing.

Results

Of 991 participants enrolled from March 22, 2020, until July 10, 2020, 736 had symptoms of COVID-19 at the time of testing; 594 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 142 tested negative in this symptomatic group. Mean age was 31.3 years (SD 5.1), and 37% will nulliparous. Ninety-five percent were outpatients. Participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-infection were a geographically diverse cohort: 34% from the Northeast, 25% from the West, 21% from the South, and 18% from the Midwest. Thirty-one percent of study participants were Latina, and 9% were Black. The average gestational age at enrollment was 24.1 weeks, and 13% of participants were enrolled after pregnancy. The most prevalent first symptoms in the cohort of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were cough (20%), sore throat (16%), body aches (12%), and fever (12%). Median time to symptom resolution was 37 days (95% CI 35–39). One quarter (25%) of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection had persistent symptoms 8 or more weeks after symptom onset.

Conclusion

COVID-19 has a prolonged and nonspecific disease course during pregnancy and in the 6 weeks after pregnancy.

### Routine ultrasound in late pregnancy (after 24 weeks' gestation) [^091a13fc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic ultrasound is used selectively in late pregnancy where there are specific clinical indications. However, the value of routine late pregnancy ultrasound screening in unselected populations is controversial. The rationale for such screening would be the detection of clinical conditions which place the fetus or mother at high risk, which would not necessarily have been detected by other means such as clinical examination, and for which subsequent management would improve perinatal outcome.

Objectives

To assess the effects on obstetric practice and pregnancy outcome of routine late pregnancy ultrasound, defined as greater than 24 weeks' gestation, in women with either unselected or low-risk pregnancies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

All acceptably controlled trials of routine ultrasound in late pregnancy (defined as after 24 weeks).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main Results

Thirteen trials recruiting 34,980 women were included in the systematic review. Risk of bias was low for allocation concealment and selective reporting, unclear for random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data and high for blinding of both outcome assessment and participants and personnel. There was no difference in antenatal, obstetric and neonatal outcome or morbidity in screened versus control groups. Routine late pregnancy ultrasound was not associated with improvements in overall perinatal mortality. There is little information on long-term substantive outcomes such as neurodevelopment. There is a lack of data on maternal psychological effects. Overall, the evidence for the primary outcomes of perinatal mortality, preterm birth less than 37 weeks, induction of labour and caesarean section were assessed to be of moderate or high quality with GRADE software. There was no association between ultrasound in late pregnancy and perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.54; participants = 30,675; studies = eight; I² = 29%), preterm birth less than 37 weeks (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08; participants = 17,151; studies = two; I² = 0%), induction of labour (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; participants = 22,663; studies = six; I² = 78%), or caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; participants = 27,461; studies = six; I² = 54%). Three additional primary outcomes chosen for the 'Summary of findings' table were preterm birth less than 34 weeks, maternal psychological effects and neurodevelopment at age two. Because none of the included studies reported these outcomes, they were not assessed for quality with GRADE software.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on existing evidence, routine late pregnancy ultrasound in low-risk or unselected populations does not confer benefit on mother or baby. There was no difference in the primary outcomes of perinatal mortality, preterm birth less than 37 weeks, caesarean section rates, and induction of labour rates if ultrasound in late pregnancy was performed routinely versus not performed routinely. Meanwhile, data were lacking for the other primary outcomes: preterm birth less than 34 weeks, maternal psychological effects, and neurodevelopment at age two, reflecting a paucity of research covering these outcomes. These outcomes may warrant future research.

### Bladder squamous cell carcinoma in a pregnant woman: case report and review of the literature [^7a3b3c33]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

When establishing that the tumor is infiltrating (pT2), the case must be staged. In addition, the gestation trimester must be considered. In the first and second trimesters, the pregnancy should be terminated, followed by cystectomy; in the third trimester, the recommendation is to wait until 28–30 weeks of gestation and then perform cystectomy (after 3–4 weeks). These recommendations are based on the predicted percentage survival of the fetus, which is only 3% at 22 weeks of gestation but increases to 84% at 28 weeks.

Performing both surgeries at once is not recommended, as it would increase the risk of bleeding, considering pelvic congestion and the difficulty of performing a hysterectomy of a pregnant uterus. Regarding urinary diversion, continent and noncontinent diversions have been described, without specific recommendations for the most appropriate surgical technique.

Currently, there is no evidence regarding adjuvant therapy with chemotherapy or systemic immunotherapy in pure squamous cell bladder tumors. Postoperative radiation therapy is an alternative to local control or in cases of positive margins.

In conclusion, bladder cancer in pregnant women is extremely rare and must be considered in women with recurrent gross hematuria and/or recurrent urinary tract infection. The management of these cases should be performed by a multidisciplinary team. The best time to perform radical cystectomy seems to be at least 4 weeks after C-section and not at the same time. To our knowledge, this case constitutes the longest recurrence-free survival of a pregnant woman with squamous cell bladder cancer published in the literature.

Prior stillbirth — antenatal surveillance timing is specified as follows: for patients with a previous stillbirth at or after 32 0/7 weeks, once or twice weekly antenatal surveillance is recommended at 32 0/7 weeks or starting at 1–2 weeks before the gestational age of the previous stillbirth, and for stillbirth that occurred before 32 0/7 weeks of gestation, individualized timing of antenatal surveillance may be considered.

### Practice bulletin no. 171: management of preterm labor [^181faa69]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Preterm labor — The following recommendations and conclusions are based on limited and inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B): For women with ruptured membranes or multiple gestations who are at risk of delivery within 7 days, a single course of corticosteroids is recommended between 24 weeks and 34 weeks of gestation. A single course of corticosteroids may be considered starting at 23 weeks of gestation for pregnant women who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, irrespective of membrane status. A single repeat course of antenatal corticosteroids should, therefore, be considered in women who are less than 34 weeks of gestation, who are at risk of preterm delivery within the next 7 days, and whose prior course of antenatal corticosteroids was administered more than 14 days previously; rescue course corticosteroids could be provided as early as 7 days from the prior dose, if indicated by the clinical scenario. Bed rest and hydration have not been shown to be effective for the prevention of preterm birth and should not be routinely recommended. The positive predictive value of a positive fetal fibronectin test result or a short cervix alone is poor and should not be used exclusively to direct management in the setting of acute symptoms.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors the outcomes of females who take lenalidomide capsules during pregnancy, or if their male partner takes lenalidomide capsules and they are exposed during pregnancy. You can enroll in this registry by calling the Lenalidomide REMS at the phone number listed above.

Lenalidomide can pass into human semen:

Males, including those who have had a vasectomy, must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female that can become pregnant while taking lenalidomide capsules, during any breaks (interruptions) in your treatment with lenalidomide capsules, and for up to 4 weeks after stopping lenalidomide capsules.
Do not have unprotected sexual contact with a female who is or could become pregnant. Tell your healthcare provider if you do have unprotected sexual contact with a female who is or could become pregnant.
Do not donate sperm while taking lenalidomide capsules, during any breaks (interruptions) in your treatment, and for up to 4 weeks after stopping lenalidomide capsules. If a female becomes pregnant with your sperm, the baby may be exposed to lenalidomide and may be born with birth defects.

Men, if your female partner becomes pregnant, you should call your healthcare provider right away.

Practice Point 8.5.2 — low-dose aspirin in pregnancy — Low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg daily) should be prescribed from week 12 to week 36 in pregnant women with ADPKD. In line with the detailed dosing guidance, women with ADPKD should take 75–150 mg of aspirin daily, preferably at bedtime, starting at 12 weeks gestation (preferably starting at no later than 16 weeks), until they have reached 36 weeks of gestation. Only minimal data are available on the use of low-dose aspirin in women with ADPKD during pregnancy; however, pregnant women with ADPKD are considered high-risk, and safety data in men and nonpregnant women indicate that use of aspirin (325 mg/d) was associated with a 2-fold higher frequency of macroscopic hematuria, although the overall risk was low and episodes were self-limited.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^5fd06c32]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Antithyroid medication in early pregnancy (Question 55) — when pregnancy is diagnosed in a woman receiving ATD therapy for GD and who appears to be in remission, one option is to withdraw ATD medication and perform repeated thyroid function testing during the first trimester of pregnancy; if ATD therapy is needed during the first trimester, PTU is preferred over MMI because the risk for severe birth defects is lower, and cessation of medication has to be recommended early in gestation, before the major teratogenic periods (gestational weeks 6–10). Evidence supporting potential withdrawal includes a prospective study in which of 218 GD patients treated with ATD for 12 months, only 5% of TRAb-negative patients became hyperthyroid within 8 weeks after ATD withdrawal. Patients at high risk for rapid relapse after withdrawal include those treated for a short period (< 6 months), those who require > 5–10 mg of MMI per day to stay euthyroid, those with suppressed or low serum TSH, large goiter or orbitopathy, or high levels of TRAb; in such cases, medication should not be withdrawn, and PTU should be administered as the drug of choice. Optimally, women receiving ATD should test for pregnancy within the first days of missing or unusually weak menstruation, and if the test is positive, the woman should contact the caregiver responsible for their therapy to receive instruction regarding withdrawing or modifying ATD therapy and to discuss thyroid function testing.

Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine GRADE recommendations — grade 1A, 1B, and 1C definitions and implications are outlined as follows: Grade 1A "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" notes "Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa", supported by "Consistent evidence from well-performed randomized, controlled trials or overwhelming evidence of some other form. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of benefit and risk", with implications that "Strong recommendations; can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation" and that "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". Grade 1B "Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence" is based on "Evidence from randomized, controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise) or very strong evidence of some other research design. Further research (if performed) is likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of benefit and risk and may change the estimate", and its implications state "Strong recommendation and applies to most patients" and "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". Grade 1C "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence" states "Benefits seem to outweigh risk and burdens, or vice versa", with "Evidence from observational studies, unsystematic clinical experience, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws. Any estimate of effect is uncertain", and the implication is a "Strong recommendation that applies to most patients".

### Expectation and knowledge of women undergoing first-trimester combined screening for down syndrome in a Chinese population [^cf338442]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the preference of pregnant women regarding the time taken to report the results of first-trimester combined screening for Down syndrome and their knowledge about it.

Methods

A questionnaire survey was conducted on a cohort of 325 pregnant participants who attended our first-trimester combined nuchal translucency and biochemical screening programme for fetal Down syndrome. This service was operated in a one-stop setting and the result of the screening test was available within 1 to 2 h after the collection of blood sample.

Results

The majority of participants: (1) could recall the quoted detection rate correctly (96.6%); (2) understood that a negative test does not exclude Down syndrome (91.1%); (3) understood that a positive test does not equate to an affected fetus (91.0%), and (4) could decide on the need for further invasive tests on the basis of the screening test results (98.1%). Twenty-nine percent of participants considered that a one-stop setting was very important because any delay in releasing the results made a significant difference to them, while 48.9% considered it acceptable if the results were available on the same day. The percentage dropped dramatically to 6.3% (within 2 days), 6.7% (within 3 days), 5.7% (within 1 week), and 3.1% (more than 1 week).

Conclusion

The majority of the pregnant women in our test considered same day reporting of screening test results to be no different from a one-stop clinic. This would have important implications for the organisation and structuring of our service provision, since the operation of a one-stop clinic imposes significant stresses on the clinical staff involved.

### Committee opinion no. 713: antenatal corticosteroid therapy for fetal maturation [^94946e0d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Antenatal corticosteroid therapy — routine administration indications are stated as follows: A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for pregnant women between 24 0/7 weeks and 33 6/7 weeks of gestation, and may be considered for pregnant women starting at 23 0/7 weeks of gestation, who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days. A Cochrane meta-analysis reinforces the beneficial effect of this therapy regardless of membrane status and concludes that a single course of antenatal corticosteroids should be considered routine for all preterm deliveries.

### Preconception contraceptive use and miscarriage: prospective cohort study [^f20bb680]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Assessment of miscarriage

Miscarriage was defined as pregnancy loss occurring before 20 completed weeks of gestation; this definition included blighted ovum but not ectopic pregnancy. We used data up to and including the first observed pregnancy per participant; in other words, we assessed one pregnancy per participant.

On follow-up questionnaires, participants reported the date of their last menstrual period, whether they were currently pregnant, whether they had had a miscarriage, and the timing of their first home pregnancy test (whether negative or positive) relative to the day of expected menses). Participants who were currently pregnant completed the early pregnancy questionnaire on which they reported any pregnancy losses since their previous questionnaire, the due date of their current pregnancy, and the timing of their first positive pregnancy test relative to the day of expected menses. Miscarriages occurring after the early pregnancy questionnaire were identified on the late pregnancy questionnaire (online supplemental figure S1).

Participants who miscarried were asked to report how many weeks the pregnancy lasted and on what date the pregnancy ended. We used the participant's reported gestational weeks at loss where available. Among participants who did not report their gestational weeks at loss but reported a due date (10%, n = 192/1841), we estimated gestational age as: (pregnancy end date – (pregnancy due date–280 days))/7. Among participants who reported neither their gestational weeks at miscarriage nor their due date (21%, n = 385/1841), we estimated gestational weeks at loss as: (pregnancy end date – last menstrual period date)/7. For participants who were lost to follow-up, we attempted to collect outcome data by contacting them via email or phone, by linking to birth registries in selected states (CA, FL, MA, MI, OH, PA, TX, and NY), and by searching for baby registries and birth announcements online.

### Diagnosis of pregnancy and providing options counseling for the adolescent patient [^6b2c5313]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Adolescent pregnancy evaluation — gestational dating, early complications, and infection screening are described as follows: Counting the number of weeks since the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) is the primary means of estimating gestational age, and physical findings can support dating, including a softened uterus about the size of an orange at 8 to 12 weeks' gestation, a uterus about the size of a grapefruit by approximately 12 weeks' gestation that is beginning to rise above the pubic symphysis, and a uterine fundus palpable midway between the pubic symphysis and the umbilicus at 16 weeks' gestation and at the level of the umbilicus by about 20 weeks' gestation; if dating remains uncertain, an ultrasonography can be arranged promptly along with obstetric consultation. Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommend that all pregnant women < 25 years of age be tested for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, Chlamydia, and gonorrhea at their first prenatal visit, and although the diagnostic visit in the pediatrician's office may not be considered a prenatal visit, testing for sexually transmitted infections needs to be considered if the history and/or physical examination are suggestive of an infection or if there may be a delay in obstetric care. First trimester complications include ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion, which may present as abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding with a positive pregnancy test result; ectopic pregnancy may also present as a positive test with the absence of expected uterine enlargement, and abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and suspicion of ectopic pregnancy are indications for immediate obstetric consultation.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 71: management of previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [^2f5f6674]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes are challenging obstetrical complications to manage given the substantial risk of maternal morbidity and mortality, with no guarantee of fetal benefit. The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations for the management of previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes before the period when a trial of neonatal resuscitation and intensive care would be considered appropriate by the healthcare team and desired by the patient: (1) we recommend that pregnant patients with previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes receive individualized counseling about the maternal and fetal risks and benefits of both abortion care and expectant management to guide an informed decision; all patients with previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes should be offered abortion care, and expectant management can also be offered in the absence of contraindications (GRADE 1C); (2) we recommend antibiotics for pregnant individuals who choose expectant management after preterm prelabor rupture of membranes at ≥ 24 0/7 weeks of gestation (GRADE 1B); (3) antibiotics can be considered after preterm prelabor rupture of membranes at 20 0/7 to 23 6/7 weeks of gestation (GRADE 2C); (4) administration of antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate is not recommended until the time when a trial of neonatal resuscitation and intensive care would be considered appropriate by the healthcare team and desired by the patient (GRADE 1B); (5) serial amnioinfusions and amniopatch are considered investigational and should be used only in a clinical trial setting; they are not recommended for routine care of previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (GRADE 1B); (6) cerclage management after previable or periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes is similar to cerclage management after preterm prelabor rupture of membranes at later gestational ages; it is reasonable to either remove the cerclage or leave it in situ after discussing the risks and benefits and incorporating shared decision-making (GRADE 2C); and (7) in subsequent pregnancies after a history of previable or periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes, we recommend following guidelines for management of pregnant persons with a previous spontaneous preterm birth (GRADE 1C).

### The pregnant patient: managing common acute medical problems… [^c977d048]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Common Symptoms During Pregnancy NAUSEA AND VOMITING About one-half of pregnant women have nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. 43 Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy increases the risk of dehydration, poor function, poor weight gain, and, if severe, acute renal failure and impaired fetal growth. Benign nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is the most common obstetric cause and tends to begin by four weeks estimated gestational age and resolve by the end of 12 weeks estimated gestational age. EPIGASTRIC PAIN/GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX Gastroesophageal reflux disease is common in pregnancy and is attributed to progesterone-mediated relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, which increases the frequency and severity of gastric reflux. Other conditions that present as heartburn-like discomfort during pregnancy include peptic ulcer disease, preeclampsia.

12 cholecystitis, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. An elevated alkaline phosphatase level is normal during pregnancy. However, an elevated lipase, bilirubin, or transaminase level requires ultrasound evaluation for cholecystitis, especially in the presence of severe colicky abdominal pain or other suggestive findings. Peptic ulcer disease should be considered if results of laboratory tests such as complete blood count, liver panel, and lipase level are normal and reflux therapies are ineffective. 28 Delivery by 35 to 37 weeks estimated gestational age may be warranted if bile acid levels are more than 16. 3 mcg per mL.
29. LOW BACK PAIN Low back pain often occurs during pregnancy because of musculoskeletal strain from increased lordosis and soft tissue laxity. However, urologic and neurologic red flags.

HEADACHES New-onset headaches or a new type of headache in pregnancy warrants further evaluation to distinguish urgent or emergent causes from common preexisting conditions. 38, 40, 42 Preeclampsia must be ruled out in all pregnant women with headache who are more than 20 weeks' gestation by monitoring serial blood pressures and assessing urine for protein in consultation with a primary maternity care clinician. 40, 42.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intrauterine growth restriction, more specifically with respect to fetal ultrasound, FIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to confirm gestational age as the first step when FGR is suspected. Use the first-trimester crown-rump length in the range of 7–60 mm as the most accurate method to date pregnancy, with the exception of pregnancies achieved by ART. Use the earliest scan with a crown-rump length of at least 10 mm if more than one scan is obtained in the first trimester.

### Reported contraceptive use in the month of becoming pregnant among U.S. abortion patients in 2000 and 2014 [^cc6564d6]. Contraception (2018). Low credibility.

On both surveys, women were asked what contraceptive method, if any, they had last used, how long they had been using that method, and the month and year they had stopped using it or if they were still using it. We used the following contraceptive categorization scheme: sterilization (male and female), IUD, implant, injectables, the ring (2014 only), the pill, the patch (2014 only), condoms, withdrawal or some other method (e.g. spermicides, emergency contraception). We classified women who indicated that they had used multiple methods in the month they became pregnant (12%–15%) as having used the most effective method (with the exceptions noted below), a common strategy for documenting how well users are protected from pregnancy.

Women were considered to have been contraceptive users if they had been using a method during the calendar month they became pregnant and had not intentionally stopped doing so before becoming pregnant. Included in this category were women who had started using a method before becoming pregnant and had stopped after the month of conception. If the month of conception was unknown (15% in both samples), a woman was considered a user if she had been using a method up to 1 month before the abortion and a nonuser if she had stopped using a method at least 2 months before the abortion.

The specific items used to assess ever use of contraception were slightly different on the two surveys (relevant survey items are included in Appendix A). The 2000 APS first asked respondents "Have you EVER used any contraceptive or other method to prevent pregnancy (including rhythm, withdrawal, condoms)?" Respondents who indicated "no" on this item were directed to a subset of questions about reasons for nonuse. The 2014 survey first asked respondents "Before you became pregnant this time, had you stopped using all methods of pregnancy prevention, including condoms, withdrawal, rhythm, etc.?" Response categories included "Yes", "No" and "Never used any pregnancy prevention method". Respondents on the 2014 survey had another chance to indicate never use on the subsequent item, which asked "What was the LAST method of pregnancy prevention you used before you found out you were pregnant?" The last response category was "I never used a method". Some 302 respondents who did not indicate "Never used any pregnancy prevention" on the first item subsequently indicated that they had never used a method on the follow-up item.

2) Colostrum feeding will be measured by asking the mother, "What did you do with the first breast milk or colostrum?" The response will be categorized as "fed to the baby or discarded". Again, we will ask her, " Have you fed the first breast milk or colostrum for your baby?" The response will be either "yes" or "no". Yes represents that she has given (suckled) the baby so that it will be categorized as "colostrum fed" and coded as 1. No represents that the "colostrum was discarded" and is coded as 0. The data will be collected within one week of delivery.

3) Early initiation of breastfeeding is measured by asking the mother, " At what time have you given birth?" and "At what time have you initiated feeding breast milk?" The time will be registered in hours and minutes. Then the time of childbirth (delivery) will be subtracted from the time of the initiation of breastfeeding. The result will be categorized as "early" if she has started within one hour and coded as 1, or "lately" if it is at or after one hour and coded as 0. This will be achieved by informing the mother and/or someone who is her intimate partner to register the time during delivery and the initiation of breastfeeding. The data will be collected within one week of delivery.

4) Exclusive breastfeeding will be measured by asking the mother, " When did you introduce (initiate) food or fluids for your newborn baby?" The response will be obtained in days, months, and years and converted into complete months. Then the date of childbirth will be subtracted from the date of food or fluid introduction. If the duration of months spent from childbirth to initiation of food or fluids is less than six months, then it is categorized as not exclusively breastfed and coded as 0, and if it is greater than or equal to six months, then it is categorized as exclusively breastfed and coded as 1. In case she is unable to remember the dates, she will be asked, "In what month have you initiated food or fluids?" Then, if she initiated within six months, the response will be coded as non-exclusive breastfeeding, and if she did not give anything within six months other than breast milk, it will be categorized as exclusive breastfeeding. This data will be collected just one week after the 6th month of delivery.

### Science-based approach to harmonize contraception recommendations in clinical trials and pharmaceutical labels [^adc9abe5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

For other clinical studies not discussed in the four bullets above, pregnancy tests are not typically required more than once per month during study treatment, unless there is a specific pregnancy safety concern for the pharmaceutical.

If protocol‐scheduled visits are > 1 month apart, then testing is conducted at scheduled visits. If scheduled visits occur infrequently, additional tests may be needed between visits. Additional test(s) may also be conducted between visits if the subject or investigator suspects pregnancy or prior to a protocol‐required procedure that would increase the risk to a pregnant subject.

A pregnancy test should be repeated prior to pharmaceutical re‐administration when administration of the pharmaceutical is disrupted for > 7 days and there was also a lapse in contraceptive use, regardless of the reason for the disruption (e.g. temporary discontinuation of study treatment for an adverse experience or if required by the study design, such as during a washout period before the second arm of a crossover study).

After completion of pharmaceutical dosing, pregnancy testing should continue at a minimum, until:
Plasma levels of the pharmaceutical fall to clinically insignificant levels (i.e. after at least five terminal phase half‐lives).
Any pharmacologic or toxicologic effects relevant to the risk of fetal harm have diminished.

Pregnancy testing without contraception may suffice in (i) case of drugs with very short exposure times (e.g. imaging agents like contrast media) and/or (ii) if study participants remain in‐house (e.g. in a phase I unit during the time of relevant exposure). In case of very short exposures, pregnancy testing is ideally conducted right before administration of the pharmaceutical within the first week after natural menstrual bleeding (i.e. exposure during the follicular phase). Pregnancy testing in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is associated with a higher false‐negative rate than during the follicular phase, leaving a small chance of an undetected early pregnancy. In all other settings, pregnancy testing without contraception should be used on a case‐by‐case basis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^831ef179]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Pregnancy — management and medication safety — Although there is a general concern about any medication use in pregnancy, the advantages of actively treating asthma in pregnancy markedly outweigh any potential risks of usual asthma medications (Evidence A), and use of ICS, beta agonists, montelukast or theophylline is not associated with an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities. Women with asthma who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should be advised not to stop ICS-containing therapy; ICS reduce the risk of exacerbations of asthma during pregnancy (Evidence A), and cessation of ICS during pregnancy is a significant risk factor for exacerbations (Evidence A). One study reported that a treatment algorithm in non-smoking pregnant women based on monthly measurement of fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and symptoms using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) was associated with significantly fewer exacerbations and better fetal outcomes than an algorithm based only on ACQ; however, the ACQ-only algorithm allowed ICS to be stopped and 58% of women in the ACQ-only group were being treated without ICS by the end of pregnancy, and in a subsequent large randomized controlled trial in pregnant women, there was no reduction in exacerbations with FeNO-guided treatment compared with usual care. On balance, a low priority should be placed on stepping down treatment (regardless of the method used to assess control) until after delivery (Evidence D), and ICS should not be stopped in preparation for pregnancy or during pregnancy (Evidence C). Pregnant patients with asthma should be advised that poorly controlled asthma, and exacerbations, provide a much greater risk to their baby than do current asthma treatments, and during pregnancy, monitoring of asthma every 4–6 weeks is recommended; if it is feasible for this to be achieved by pharmacist-clinician collaboration, with monthly telephone monitoring of asthma symptom control. An intervention study with follow-up for 4–6 years reported the prevalence of asthma was over 50% lower in children of women with asthma who took ICS during pregnancy, with the largest reduction when ICS was being taken in early pregnancy (before weeks 12–20).

### Committee opinion no. 713 summary: antenatal corticosteroid therapy for fetal maturation [^11382aeb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid administration before anticipated preterm birth is one of the most important antenatal therapies available to improve newborn outcomes. A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for pregnant women between 24 0/7 weeks and 33 6/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, including for those with ruptured membranes and multiple gestations. It also may be considered for pregnant women starting at 23 0/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, based on a family's decision regarding resuscitation, irrespective of membrane rupture status and regardless of fetal number. Administration of betamethasone may be considered in pregnant women between 34 0/7 weeks and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm birth within 7 days, and who have not received a previous course of antenatal corticosteroids. A single repeat course of antenatal corticosteroids should be considered in women who are less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, and whose prior course of antenatal corticosteroids was administered more than 14 days previously. Rescue course corticosteroids could be provided as early as 7 days from the prior dose, if indicated by the clinical scenario. Continued surveillance of long-term outcomes after in utero corticosteroid exposure should be supported. Quality improvement strategies to optimize appropriate and timely antenatal corticosteroid administration are encouraged.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry (APR) at 1-800-258-4263.

Risk Summary

Data from a birth outcome surveillance study has identified an increased risk of neural tube defects when TIVICAY is administered at the time of conception compared with non-dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral regimens. As defects related to closure of the neural tube occur from conception through the first 6 weeks of gestation, embryos exposed to dolutegravir from the time of conception through the first 6 weeks of gestation are at potential risk. In addition, 2 of the 5 birth defects (encephalocele and iniencephaly), which have been observed with dolutegravir use, although often termed neural tube defects, may occur post-neural tube closure, the time period of which may be later than 6 weeks of gestation, but within the first trimester. Due to the limited understanding of the types of reported neural tube defects associated with dolutegravir use and because the date of conception may not be determined with precision, an alternative treatment to dolutegravir should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy. Initiation of dolutegravir is not recommended in adolescents and adults actively trying to become pregnant unless there is no suitable alternative (see Data).

### Obesity in pregnancy: ACOG practice bulletin, number 230 [^a17d27c8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — obesity in pregnancy (Level C recommendations) notes that all women with obesity should be provided and referred to behavioral counseling interventions focused on improving healthy diet and exercise in order to achieve a healthier weight before another pregnancy. Obese women should be counseled about the limitations of ultrasound in identifying structural anomalies, and early pregnancy screening for glucose intolerance (gestational diabetes or overt diabetes) should be based on risk factors, including maternal BMI of 30 or greater, known impaired glucose metabolism, or previous gestational diabetes. For patients with prepregnancy BMI of 35.0–39.9, weekly antenatal fetal surveillance may be considered beginning by 37 0/7 weeks of gestation, and for patients with prepregnancy BMI 40 or greater, weekly antenatal fetal surveillance may be considered beginning at 34 0/7 weeks of gestation. Consultation with anesthesia service should be considered for obese pregnant women with OSA because they are at an increased risk of hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and sudden death.

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^3cc2daf5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Third trimester gestational age assessment by ultrasonography — accuracy and caution: Gestational age assessment by ultrasonography in the third trimester (28 0/7 weeks of gestation and beyond) is the least reliable method, with an accuracy of ± 21–30 days; because of the risk of redating a small fetus that may be growth restricted, management decisions based on third‑trimester ultrasonography alone are especially problematic and need to be guided by careful consideration of the entire clinical picture and close surveillance.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^a5b8fb0d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for coccidioidomycosis, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend to offer close follow-up, including obtaining coccidioidal serologic testing at the initial visit and every 6–12 weeks throughout pregnancy in patients with a history of prior coccidioidomycosis currently not on therapy.
