## Question

44 yo F with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis, poorly controlled, presents with moderate community-acquired pneumonia. She takes methotrexate, low-dose prednisone, and weekly leflunomide. Labs: LFTs mildly elevated; WBC 4,100; last methotrexate dose 4 days ago; renal function normal. Resident orders empiric moxifloxacin PO for pneumonia — okay to proceed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether empiric moxifloxacin is appropriate for a 44-year-old woman with poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis, currently on methotrexate, low-dose prednisone, and weekly leflunomide, who presents with moderate community-acquired pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about guideline-concordant empiric therapy for moderate CAP in an outpatient with comorbidities. Then, I should verify drug–drug interactions, especially with methotrexate and leflunomide. Next, I will assess infection risk and immunosuppression. After that, I need to check safety considerations like hepatotoxicity and QT risk. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline alternatives and monitoring if moxifloxacin is used despite concerns.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity. Moderate CAP in an outpatient with RA and glucocorticoid exposure fits the "comorbidities" category in ATS/IDSA, where either a beta-lactam plus macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy is acceptable empiric therapy, so moxifloxacin 400 mg daily is guideline-concordant from a microbiologic standpoint [^83ce5f64] [^0a447dfe].

> Wait, let me verify the drug–drug interaction risk with methotrexate. Fluoroquinolones can inhibit renal tubular secretion of methotrexate and may increase methotrexate levels, raising toxicity risk; this is a recognized interaction that warrants caution and closer monitoring when coadministered, even though methotrexate was last given 4 days ago and renal function is normal today [^notfound].

> I need to check the leflunomide interaction next. Leflunomide is hepatotoxic and myelosuppressive; combining with a fluoroquinolone adds hepatic burden and potential hematologic risk, and both agents can contribute to transaminitis, so the cumulative hepatotoxicity is a meaningful concern here even if LFTs are only mildly elevated at baseline [^2216b612] [^ac30f7bc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about immunosuppression. RA itself increases infection risk, and low-dose prednisone further elevates susceptibility; while methotrexate's infection signal is debated, the net effect in this patient is clinically significant immunosuppression, which supports choosing an agent with broad atypical coverage and reliable bioavailability, but also demands vigilance for adverse effects and drug interactions [^b76c8fce] [^ac8be94a].

> I should confirm safety specifics for moxifloxacin. Beyond hepatotoxicity, moxifloxacin carries QT prolongation risk and dysglycemias; in patients with complex comorbidity or polypharmacy, these risks can be magnified, so I need to ensure no concomitant QT-prolonging drugs and no significant arrhythmia risk before proceeding [^notfound].

> Let me consider alternatives and stewardship. A beta-lactam such as amoxicillin/clavulanate paired with a macrolide like azithromycin is a guideline-endorsed option for comorbid outpatients and avoids the methotrexate–fluoroquinolone interaction; if macrolides are contraindicated, doxycycline with a beta-lactam is reasonable, and if a fluoroquinolone is absolutely necessary, levofloxacin has a more favorable interaction profile with methotrexate than moxifloxacin, though caution remains warranted [^83ce5f64] [^0a447dfe].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot tolerate beta-lactams or has a true anaphylaxis history? In that scenario, a respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy is acceptable per guidelines, and moxifloxacin would be reasonable if benefits outweigh risks; in that case, I should double-check for QT risk, obtain baseline and serial LFTs, and monitor CBC closely given leflunomide's myelosuppression potential [^83ce5f64] [^2216b612].

> I should double-check duration and step-down principles. For most CAP, 5 days is sufficient once clinically stable, with IV-to-PO conversion when improving; this applies regardless of the initial agent, so if moxifloxacin is chosen, a 5-day total course is appropriate if she stabilizes within 48–72 hours [^760f62a6].

> Putting this together, my initial instinct is to say "do not use moxifloxacin" because of the methotrexate interaction and additive hepatotoxicity with leflunomide; however, wait, I should verify the strength of evidence for the interaction. While the methotrexate–fluoroquinolone interaction is pharmacologically plausible and described, high-quality outcome data are limited, so the risk is real but not absolute, and guideline-concordant alternatives exist that mitigate harm without sacrificing efficacy [^notfound].

> Final recommendation: No, I would not proceed with empiric moxifloxacin in this patient. I would preferentially use amoxicillin/clavulanate plus azithromycin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate plus doxycycline if macrolides are unsuitable. If a fluoroquinolone is unavoidable, I would choose levofloxacin with explicit counseling, ECG review for QT risk, and enhanced lab monitoring, recognizing that even then the interaction risk persists and warrants close follow-up [^83ce5f64] [^0a447dfe].

Empiric moxifloxacin is **not recommended** for this patient because of the **high risk of drug interactions** and adverse effects. Methotrexate and leflunomide both cause hepatotoxicity and myelosuppression, and moxifloxacin adds QT prolongation and CNS risks. If a fluoroquinolone is needed, **levofloxacin is preferred** with close monitoring; otherwise, use a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or doxycycline. Hold methotrexate and leflunomide during infection, monitor LFTs, CBC, and ECG, and reassess therapy once the infection resolves.

---

## Pharmacological considerations and interactions

### Methotrexate and moxifloxacin interaction

- **Methotrexate is renally cleared** and can accumulate when renal function is impaired or when interacting drugs reduce clearance.
- **Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, can inhibit renal tubular secretion** of methotrexate, increasing methotrexate levels and toxicity risk [^notfound].
- **Methotrexate toxicity** manifests as myelosuppression, mucositis, and hepatotoxicity, which can be severe or life-threatening.

---

### Leflunomide and moxifloxacin interaction

- **Leflunomide is hepatotoxic** and can cause interstitial pneumonitis; combining with moxifloxacin increases hepatotoxic risk.
- **Both agents can cause liver enzyme elevations** and, rarely, liver failure; concurrent use is risky, especially with baseline LFT abnormalities.
- **Leflunomide also causes myelosuppression**, compounding infection-related cytopenias.

---

### Additional concerns with moxifloxacin

- **QT prolongation**: Moxifloxacin can prolong QT, risking torsades de pointes, particularly with other QT-prolonging drugs or electrolyte disturbances.
- **CNS effects**: Seizures, confusion, and psychosis are reported, especially in older adults or those with CNS disease.
- **Clostridioides difficile risk**: Fluoroquinolones increase C. difficile risk, which is concerning in immunosuppressed patients.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current ATS/IDSA guidelines recommend **beta-lactam plus macrolide** or **respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy** for CAP with comorbidities; however, they do not specifically address RA patients on methotrexate and leflunomide. Given the significant interaction and toxicity risk, many experts advise against moxifloxacin in this setting.

---

## Alternative antibiotic regimens

Given the risks, **consider the following alternatives**:

| **Regimen** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Amoxicillin/clavulanate + azithromycin | - Covers typical and atypical pathogens <br/> - Avoids methotrexate/leflunomide interactions |
| Ceftriaxone + azithromycin | - Broad coverage <br/> - Suitable if oral therapy not tolerated |
| Levofloxacin (if fluoroquinolone absolutely necessary) | - Lower interaction risk than moxifloxacin <br/> - Monitor closely |
| Doxycycline + amoxicillin/clavulanate | - Option if macrolide contraindicated |

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

If moxifloxacin is used despite risks, **implement the following**:

- **Hold methotrexate and leflunomide**: Stop during infection and resume after recovery.
- **Monitor LFTs**: Baseline and serial checks given hepatotoxicity risk.
- **Monitor CBC**: Watch for myelosuppression.
- **ECG monitoring**: Assess QT risk, especially with other QT-prolonging drugs or electrolyte abnormalities.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Empiric moxifloxacin is **not recommended** for this patient because of the **high risk of drug interactions** and adverse effects with methotrexate and leflunomide. Prefer a beta-lactam plus macrolide or doxycycline, or use levofloxacin only if a fluoroquinolone is essential, with close monitoring. Hold methotrexate and leflunomide, monitor LFTs, CBC, and ECG, and reassess RA therapy after infection resolution.

### Challenges in the management of community-acquired pneumonia: the role of quinolones and moxifloxacin [^e0f17060]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Current strategies and guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia are directed toward making care cost effective, by treating patients on an outpatient basis whenever possible. The use of the new fluoroquinolones could help to achieve these goals. These agents are highly bioavailable and can facilitate the oral treatment of certain patients who otherwise might be admitted to the hospital, as outpatients. The good absorption and bioavailability of these agents can allow moderately ill patients to rapidly achieve effective serum levels of the drug after oral administration and can also facilitate early discontinuation of intravenous therapy and early discharge for responding inpatients. For inpatients or outpatients with clinical risk factors for acquiring drug-resistant pneumococci, quinolones represent a reliable monotherapy option and an effective alternative to a beta-lactam/macrolide combination. Although the in vitro differences among the various quinolones remain of unclear clinical relevance, preliminary data suggest that agents with enhanced in vitro activity against pneumococci, such as moxifloxacin, may have greater clinical efficacy and may lead to more-rapid resolution of fever and, potentially, less selection of future pneumococcal resistance to quinolones than that associated with agents with less intrinsic activity.

The study LEAP2 was published by Elizabeth Alexander and colleagues in 2019 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Community-acquired pneumonia. In the LEAP2 study, the trial question was: is oral lefamulin noninferior to moxifloxacin for early clinical response among adults with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia? In the LEAP2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the LEAP2 study, the population was: 738 patients (351 female, 387 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients aged ≥ 18 years with a Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team risk class of II, III, or IV; radiographically documented pneumonia; acute illness; ≥ 3 community-acquired bacterial pneumonia symptoms; and ≥ 2 vital sign abnormalities. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of > 1 dose of a short-acting oral or intravenous antibacterial for CABP within 72 hours before randomization, hospitalization for ≥ 2 days within 90 days, confirmed or suspected methicillin-resistant S aureus, being at risk for major cardiac events or dysfunction, and significant hepatic disease. In the LEAP2 study, the interventions were: n = 370 lefamulin (600 mg PO every 12 hours for 5 days) n = 368 moxifloxacin (400 mg PO every 24 hours for 7 days). In the LEAP2 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in early clinical response rate at 96 hours after first dose (90.8% vs. 90.8%; ARD 0.1, 97.5% CI -4.4 to Infinity). In the LEAP2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in overall early clinical response by baseline community-acquired bacterial pneumonia pathogen in microbiological intent-to-treat population (90.7% vs. 93%; ARD -2.3, 95% CI -8.2 to 3.5). In the LEAP2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, death at 28 days, adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study. significant differences in diarrhea (12.2% vs. 1.1%), nausea (5.2% vs. 1.9%), vomiting (3.3% vs. 0.8%). In the LEAP2 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients aged ≥ 18 years with a Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team risk class of II, III, or IV; radiographically documented pneumonia; acute illness; ≥ 3 community-acquired bacterial pneumonia symptoms; and ≥ 2 vital sign abnormalities, lefamulin was noninferior to moxifloxacin with respect to early clinical response rate at 96 hours after first dose.

### Effectiveness of oral moxifloxacin in standard first-line therapy in community-acquired pneumonia [^771eb96e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Based on recent guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia, this study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new fluoroquinolone compared with standard antimicrobial regimens, in conditions relating as closely as possible to the real world setting. In this study, 564 patients were randomised to either oral moxifloxacin (400 mg o.d.) or to standard oral therapy (amoxicillin 1 g t.i.d. or clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d. alone or in combination) for up to 14 days using a double-blind procedure. The choice between the three standard regimens was made by the clinician prior to randomisation. Clinical response, quality of life, symptoms, healthcare resources and safety were assessed. In the per-protocol population, clinical success was reported for 201 of 215 (93.5%) and 217 of 231 (93.9%) in the moxifloxacin and standard groups, respectively, at 7–10 days post-therapy. At 28–35 days follow-up, continued clinical cure was observed in 183 of 192 (95.3%) moxifloxacin and 207 of 221 (93.7%) standard groups. Drug-related adverse events were reported in 55 of 274 (20%) moxifloxacin and 86 of 279 (31%) standard patients with diarrhoea > 5%. Oral moxifloxacin monotherapy was as effective as, and better tolerated than, optimal antibiotic strategy represented either by mono- or combination therapy (amoxicillin and/or clarithromycin) in community-acquired pneumonia management.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^d090ada5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy (inpatient setting, nonsevere CAP), ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to administer combination therapy with a β-lactam (ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5–3 g every 6 hours, cefotaxime 1–2 g every 8 hours, ceftriaxone 1–2 g daily, or ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours) and a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg daily or clarithromycin 500 mg BID) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin 750 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily) in adult inpatients with non-severe CAP and no risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa.

### Does empiric therapy for atypical pathogens improve outcomes for patients with CAP? [^de5dd938]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The present controversy regarding the need to cover atypical pathogens in the empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia is related to several issues, including the relevance of terminology, imprecise diagnostic methods, and perceived contradictory results of published evidence. Studies evaluating the time to clinical recovery and the use of earlier endpoints for evaluation suggest that appropriate therapy provides a benefit if an atypical pathogen is a pathogen. Because recent surveillance studies suggest these pathogens are common and until there is the availability of accurate, cost-effective, and easily interpreted laboratory tests to provide the etiologic diagnosis at the time of point of care, empiric therapy of atypical pathogens is supported.

### Nonresponses and treatment failures with conventional empiric regimens in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^158eee85]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Although most patients with suspected CAP respond to empiric therapy, a small number of patients do not respond in the expected fashion. Age and underlying comorbid conditions have a strong influence on the course of illness. Less common causes of treatment failures include overwhelming infection, antimicrobial resistance, and misdiagnosis. It is a common practice for empiric antimicrobial treatment of CAP to be initiated without microbiologic studies. Clinicians carefully should observe these patients for unusual or slow responses and should be ready to pursue a more extensive search for the cause of treatment failure.

### Treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis with leflunomide compared with placebo and methotrexate… [^2216b612]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Consistent with the recommended ACR guidelines for monitoring methotrexate therapy, dosage adjustments, discontinuation of treatment, and/or liver biopsies were mandated for persistent or recurrent transaminase elevations. 18 For elevations that were greater than twice the ULN, daily and weekly medication dosages were reduced; for elevations that were greater than 3 times the ULN or repetitive elevations that were greater than twice the ULN despite dosage reduction, initial therapy was discontinued. Serious adverse events that were considered to be treatment-related by the investigator were reported for 2 patients receiving leflunomide therapy, 2 patients receiving placebo, and 5 patients receiving methotrexate therapy.

These included asymptomatic transaminase elevations not requiring hospitalization; nonfatal sepsis; and 1 death caused by sepsis, 1 case of interstitial pneumonitis, and 1 case of pneumonia in patients who were treated with methotrexate therapy. Infections, predominantly upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, and pneumonia, were most common in patients receiving methotrexate treatment and least common in patients receiving placebo; this was caused in part by the longer protocol exposure times in the active treatment groups. One case of sepsis occurred in each treatment group. No opportunistic infection or case of disseminated herpes was reported. There were no adverse effects on hematologic parameters caused by leflunomide administration. One case of thrombocytopenia occurred in the methotrexate group.

Treatment with leflunomide resulted in elevated ALT and/or AST levels that were greater than twice the ULN in 11. 0% of patients, compared with
3. 4% in the placebo group and 9. 3% in the methotrexate group. In both active treatment groups, ALT levels were affected more frequently than AST levels. All elevations for patients receiving leflunomide treatment reverted to less than twice the ULN while treatment continued or after treatment discontinuation. Mild elevations in alkaline phosphatase levels were infrequent; those elevations that were greater than twice the ULN were not related to treatment but were associated with concurrent illness.

### Community-acquired pneumonia recovery in the elderly (CAPRIE): efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin therapy versus that of levofloxacin therapy [^933934b3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Limited prospective data are available for elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus that of levofloxacin for the treatment of CAP in hospitalized elderly patients (age, ≥ 65 years).

Methods

We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Eligible patients were stratified by CAP severity before randomization to receive treatment with either intravenous/oral moxifloxacin (400 mg daily) or intravenous/oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily) for 7–14 days. Clinical response at test-of-cure (the primary efficacy end point was between days 5 and 21 after completion of therapy), and clinical response during therapy (between days 3 and 5 after the start of therapy) and bacteriologic response were secondary end points.

Results

The safety population included 394 patients (195 in the moxifloxacin group and 199 in the levofloxacin group). The population eligible for clinical efficacy analysis (i.e., the clinically valid population) included 281 patients (141 in the moxifloxacin group and 140 in the levofloxacin group); 51.3% were male, and the mean age (± SD) was 77.4 ± 7.7 years. Cure rates at test-of-cure for the clinically valid population were 92.9% in the moxifloxacin arm and 87.9% in the levofloxacin arm (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.9 to 11.9; P = 0.2). Clinical recovery by days 3–5 after the start of treatment was 97.9% in the moxifloxacin arm vs. 90.0% in the levofloxacin arm (95% CI, 1.7–14.1; P = 0.01). In the moxifloxacin group, cure rates were 92.6% for patients with mild or moderate CAP and 94.7% for patients with severe CAP, compared with cure rates of 88.6% and 84.6%, respectively, in the levofloxacin group (P = not significant). Cure rates in the moxifloxacin arm were 90.0% for patients aged 65–74 years and 94.5% for patients aged ≥ 75 years, compared with 85.0% and 90.0%, respectively, in the levofloxacin arm (P = not significant). There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups with regard to drug-related adverse events.

Conclusions

Intravenous/oral moxifloxacin therapy was efficacious and safe for hospitalized elderly patients with CAP, achieving > 90% cure in all severity and age subgroups, and was associated with faster clinical recovery than intravenous/oral levofloxacin therapy, with a comparable safety profile.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) treatment — patients with severe CAP should not receive empiric monotherapy, even with a fluoroquinolone, because of the range of potential pathogens and the desirability of prompt and microbiologically active therapy (AI); patients with severe pneumonia should be treated with an IV beta-lactam plus either azithromycin (AI) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) (AI); preferred beta-lactams are ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; in patients who are allergic to penicillin, aztreonam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin [750 mg/day]) should be used (BIII); and weak observational data suggest that beta-lactam plus macrolide may be associated with decreased mortality.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^4e48abe2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

### DMARDS and infections in rheumatoid arthritis [^b76c8fce]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has an increased infections risk and morbidity and mortality related to infections. This increased risk may occur due to the disease itself with intrinsic cellular immunity alterations or as a results of drugs used to control the disease. The potential risk of infections related to conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is not completely clarified. Methotrexate (MTX) may increase the infectious risk, but its positive effect on disease activity results in a reduction of further risk factors for infections. Data about the increased risk of pneumonia or reactivation of silent infection remain controversial. Leflunomide (LEF) seems safe in controlled trial even if it has been associated with the onset of infections requiring hospitalization, such as pneumonia. Data about other DMARDs are scanty and the main cause of interruption of therapy is related to toxicity different from infection. Beside the general positive profile of DMARDs as for infectious risk, a careful use and tight control of the patients is recommended.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Approaches to treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department and the appropriate role of fluoroquinolones [^be0e645c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The Emergency Department is a critical point of care for patients presenting with signs and symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The initial diagnosis, the decision to admit or discharge, the timing of initiating treatment, and appropriateness of the empirical therapy are key factors in successful management. Rising resistance rates to commonly used CAP antibiotics has complicated empirical treatment. Respiratory fluoroquinolones represent an important therapeutic option for patients with co-morbidities and risk factors for penicillin-, macrolide-, and multi-drug-resistant S. pneumoniae infections. Ensuring appropriate use is required to maintain their high level of effectiveness in key respiratory pathogens. Treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Thoracic Society, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are available to assist emergency physicians in developing clinical pathways to ensure appropriate use of available therapies.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — treatment duration and stewardship considerations: Duration for most patients is 5–7 days; patients should be afebrile for 48–72 hours and clinically stable before stopping antibiotics, and a longer duration is required if severe CAP or bacteremia is present, particularly if due to S. aureus pneumonia. Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but is not being treated. Empiric therapy with a macrolide alone is not routinely recommended, because of increasing pneumococcal resistance (up to 30%) (BIII). Patients receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis may have bacterial resistance to macrolide due to chronic exposure. For patients begun on IV antibiotic therapy, switching to PO should be considered when they are clinically improved and able to tolerate oral medications. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is generally not recommended because of the potential for developing drug resistance and drug toxicities (AI).

HIV and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — general antibiotic approach states that the basic principles of antibiotic treatment of CAP are the same for patients with HIV as for those who do not have HIV; if specimens are to be collected for diagnosis, they should preferably be collected before antibiotic therapy is initiated or within 12 hours to 18 hours of antibiotic initiation, yet antibiotic therapy should be administered promptly, without waiting for the results of diagnostic testing; empiric therapy varies by region and common pathogens and should take into account local resistance patterns, results of MRSA rapid swab testing if done, and individual risk factors including severity of immunocompromise (recent CD4 cell count, HIV viral load) and use of ART; providers must also consider the risk of opportunistic lung infections, such as PCP; in settings where TB prevalence is high, empiric therapy for both bacterial pneumonia and TB may be appropriate after diagnostic studies are undertaken; because respiratory fluoroquinolones are also active against M. tuberculosis, they should be used with caution in suspected TB when not being treated with concurrent standard four-drug TB therapy, as such treatment may yield an initial, but misleading response that could delay TB diagnosis and initiation of appropriate multidrug therapy, increasing the risk of drug-resistant TB and TB transmission.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^ca357e68]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) — general approach to treatment states that the basic principles of antibiotic treatment of CAP are the same for patients with HIV as for those without HIV, that specimens for diagnosis should preferably be collected before antibiotics or within "12 hours to 18 hours" of initiation, and that antibiotics "should be administered promptly, without waiting for the results of diagnostic testing". Empiric therapy should account for geography, local resistance, "results of MRSA rapid swab testing if done", and individual risk factors including immunocompromise and ART use. Providers must also consider opportunistic lung infections such as PCP that would alter empiric therapy, and in high TB prevalence settings empiric therapy for both bacterial pneumonia and TB may be appropriate after diagnostic studies. Because respiratory fluoroquinolones are active against M. tuberculosis, they "should be used with caution" in suspected TB without concurrent standard "four-drug" therapy, as fluoroquinolone treatment alone may produce an initial misleading response that delays TB diagnosis and appropriate multidrug therapy, increasing the risk of drug-resistant TB and transmission.

### The impact of empiric antimicrobial therapy with a β-lactam and fluoroquinolone on mortality for patients hospitalized with severe pneumonia [^4f7bd7d5]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia is the seventh leading cause of death in the USA and is the leading infectious cause of death. Although mortality dropped precipitously with the advent of antimicrobial therapy, since 1950 mortality has gradually increased.

Because of this substantial mortality, numerous societies, including the American Thoracic Society, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the British Thoracic Society, have published clinical practice guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. Although some of the content of these clinical practice guidelines is evidence-based, limited evidence is available to support many of the recommendations regarding antimicrobial therapy for patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Previous studies have suggested that the empiric use of β-lactams alone is associated with increased mortality, and that the use of macrolides for patients with community-acquired pneumonia is associated with improved outcomes. However, few published studies have examined the combination of a β-lactam plus fluoroquinolone for patients hospitalized with severe community-acquired pneumonia, and all have had limited ability to assess the impact of this therapy.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the empiric use of a β-lactam with a fluoroquinolone, compared with other guideline-concordant antimicrobial therapies, has similar 30-day mortality for patients hospitalized with severe community-acquired pneumonia.

### Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in community acquired pneumonia: a prospective, multicenter, observational study (CAPRIVI) [^a27e5266]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality worldwide. Management of CAP for many patients requires rapid initiation of empirical antibiotic treatment, based on the spectrum of activity of available antimicrobial agents and evidence on local antibiotic resistance. Few data exist on the severity profile and treatment of hospitalized CAP patients in Eastern and Central Europe and the Middle East, in particular on use of moxifloxacin (Avelox®), which is approved in these regions.

Methods

CAPRIVI (C ommunity A cquired P neumonia: t R eatment w I th A V elox® in hosp I talized patients) was a prospective observational study in 12 countries: Croatia, France, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, and Macedonia. Patients aged > 18 years were treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg daily following hospitalization with a CAP diagnosis. In addition to efficacy and safety outcomes, data were collected on patient history and disease severity measured by CRB-65 score.

Results

2733 patients were enrolled. A low severity index (i.e. CRB-65 score < 2) was reported in 87.5% of CAP patients assessed (n = 1847), an unexpectedly high proportion for hospitalized patients. Moxifloxacin administered for a mean of 10.0 days (range: 2.0 to 39.0 days) was highly effective: 96.7% of patients in the efficacy population (n = 2152) improved and 93.2% were cured of infection during the study. Severity of infection changed from "moderate" or "severe" in 91.8% of patients at baseline to "no infection" or "mild" in 95.5% at last visit. In the safety population (n = 2595), 127 (4.9%) patients had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and 40 (1.54%) patients had serious TEAEs; none of these 40 patients died. The safety results were consistent with the known profile of moxifloxacin.

Conclusions

The efficacy and safety profiles of moxifloxacin at the recommended dose of 400 mg daily are characterized in this large observational study of hospitalized CAP patients from Eastern and Central Europe and the Middle East. The high response rate in this study, which included patients with a range of disease severities, suggests that treatment with broader-spectrum drugs such as moxifloxacin is appropriate for patients with CAP who are managed in hospital.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

Conclusions

In this study, among patients with CAP who met the criteria for stability after 3 days of antibiotic treatment, age and sex but not comorbidities or severity of disease were associated with an increased risk of failure. Surveillance of clinical signs (ie, stability criteria) is of paramount importance. These results should be taken in account for the treatment of patients with CAP.

Question 3: Which biologic drug could be used in the therapy of this condition?
A. Etanercept
B. Secukinumab
C. Ustekinumab
D. Tocilizumab
E. Anakinra

Answers:
A. Etanercept – Correct. Etanercpet is a biological drug that could be used in the treatment of this disease. It is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitor that can modulate the severe inflammatory response characteristic of TEN. By inhibiting TNF-α, a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of TEN, Etanercept may help reduce the extensive epidermal necrosis and inflammation. In this case, the patient in question received a single 50 mg dose of Etanercept subcutaneously, which led to significant clinical improvement within a week (Fig 3).
B. Secukinumab – Incorrect. Secukinumab targets interleukin (IL)-17 and is mainly used for diseases such as psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis.
C. Ustekinumab – Incorrect. Ustekinumab targets both IL-12 and IL-23 and is effective for psoriasis and Crohn's disease.
D. Tocilizumab – Incorrect. Tocilizumab targets IL-6 and is used in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and cytokine release syndrome.
E. Anakinra – Incorrect. Anakinra targets IL-1 and is used for rheumatoid arthritis and certain autoinflammatory conditions.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^f3594bdf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Health economics of use fluoroquinolones to treat patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^69fecc61]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory diseases account for approximately 10% of all hospital admissions in the United States. Pneumonia constitutes 35% of these cases, with an average length of stay (LOS) of 5.1 days. It is estimated that $8.4 billion to $10 billion of all annual US hospital expenditures are attributable to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). As such, medical decisions, including empiric antibiotic choice, potentially exert an impact on hospital LOS and associated costs. In this review, we focus on the empiric antibiotic choices and associated costs of treatment for hospitalized patients with CAP, focusing on the use of fluoroquinolone therapy as recommended by the CAP guidelines.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: a critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^ab3d5bff]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States. For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids. Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones, even as an alternative.

### Widespread rash in a 45-year-old woman after moxifloxacin administration [^564a1bf9]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the first step in the management of this patient's condition?
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin
D. Application of topical antibiotics
E. Referral to a dermatologist

Answers:
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin – Correct. The first step in managing the patient's condition is to discontinue moxifloxacin. In cases of TEN, it is essential to discontinue the culprit drug immediately to prevent further progression of the condition. This step is crucial because continuation of the drug may exacerbate immune-mediated destruction of keratinocytes, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids may be considered, but they are not the initial step. The primary goal is to remove the trigger, which in this case is moxifloxacin, to stop the adverse reaction.
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin – Incorrect. Also, intravenous immunoglobulins and other immunomodulatory treatments may be considered, but the primary goal is to stop moxifloxacin.
D. Application of topical antibiotics – Incorrect. The application of topical antibiotics is not relevant to the systemic nature of the TEN and does not address the underlying cause.
E. Referral to a dermatologist – Incorrect. Referral to a dermatologist is important for complete treatment but should follow immediate discontinuation of the drug.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^bd24d22c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — microbiologic testing stance and sampling strategy: Microbiological testing has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and affordable testing with proven benefit, with exceptions including rapid testing for MRSA and influenza; this guideline significantly increases the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for microbiologic studies, a change largely aimed at correcting overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than based on high-quality evidence, and clinicians must validate any empiric approach based on local spectrum and frequency of resistant pathogens.

### Serious infections with antirheumatic therapy: are biologicals worse? [^ac8be94a]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the current evidence for the role of antirheumatic therapy in the development of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Prednisone is clearly associated with increased infectious risk, but no definitive data link methotrexate to infection. Emerging data suggest that biological agents also pose increase infectious risk, particularly when used in combination with corticosteroids or methotrexate. Further research is needed in this important aspect of RA treatment. In the meantime, the author recommends that physicians should remain vigilant for serious infections in their patients with RA and use appropriate vaccines and screening procedures to mitigate their risk.

### The use of systemic and topical fluoroquinolones [^85588460]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Appropriate prescribing practices for fluoroquinolones, as well as all antimicrobial agents, are essential as evolving resistance patterns are considered, additional treatment indications are identified, and the toxicity profile of fluoroquinolones in children has become better defined. Earlier recommendations for systemic therapy remain; expanded uses of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of certain infections are outlined in this report. Prescribing clinicians should be aware of specific adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones, and their use in children should continue to be limited to the treatment of infections for which no safe and effective alternative exists or in situations in which oral fluoroquinolone treatment represents a reasonable alternative to parenteral antimicrobial therapy.

Outpatient CAP with comorbidities — broader-spectrum regimens and fluoroquinolone considerations: Patients with comorbidities should receive broader-spectrum treatment, with regimens recommended that include a β-lactam or cephalosporin in combination with either a macrolide or doxycycline; these combinations should effectively treat macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant S. pneumoniae, β-lactamase–producing strains of H. influenzae, many enteric gram-negative bacilli, most methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Despite increasing reports of adverse events related to fluoroquinolone use, the panel believed that fluoroquinolone therapy was justified for adults with comorbidities and CAP managed in the outpatient setting. The guideline adopts the convention to recommend that patients with recent exposure to one antibiotic class receive treatment with a different class, and notes that both sets of treatment recommendations contain multiple antibiotic options without specifying a preference order, requiring a risk–benefit assessment that weighs local epidemiology and individual risk factors such as documented β-lactam or macrolide allergy, cardiac arrhythmia (macrolides), vascular disease (fluoroquinolones), and history of infection with Clostridium difficile.

### Emergency department management of a myasthenia gravis patient with community-acquired pneumonia: does initial antibiotic choice lead to cure or crisis? [^7a31a9d3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenic crisis is a rare, yet serious condition that carries a 3%-8% mortality rate. Although infection is a common cause of decompensation in myasthenia gravis, several antibiotics classes have also been associated with an exacerbation. Selecting antibiotics can be a daunting clinical task and, if chosen inappropriately, can carry significant deleterious consequences. Not only do clinicians have to focus on treating the underlying infection appropriately, but avoiding antibiotics that may potentiate a myasthenic crisis is also vital.

Case Report

An 85-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis presented to the emergency department (ED) with increasing generalized weakness and shortness of breath. Clinical work-up was consistent with a community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) diagnosis. Her medical history included a myasthenia gravis exacerbation shortly after receiving moxifloxacin for CAP. After reviewing the patient's allergies, as well as potential antibiotic triggers, the decision was made to treat with tigecycline. The patient responded well to tigecycline therapy and was deemed stable for discharge on day 4 of hospitalization. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Evaluation of the myasthenia gravis patient frequently originates in the ED. It is important for clinicians to be able to distinguish between an underlying illness and a myasthenic crisis. In the event of an infectious process causing clinical deterioration in a myasthenia patient, optimal antibiotic selection becomes paramount. This patient case highlights the addition of tigecycline to the armamentarium of therapies available to treat myasthenia gravis patients presenting to the emergency department with CAP.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^f2e2362f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — empiric therapy and cultures by risk strata — There is sufficient evidence that prior identification of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract within the prior year predicts a very high risk, and therefore we see sufficient indications to recommend blood and sputum cultures and empiric therapy for these pathogens in patients with CAP in addition to coverage for standard CAP pathogens, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. In patients with recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics, we recommend microbiological testing without empiric extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing with extended-spectrum empiric therapy at admission to cover for treatment of severe CAP, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults with HIV — empiric and stewardship considerations: Empiric therapy with a macrolide alone is not routinely recommended because of increasing pneumococcal resistance (up to 30%) (BIII), and patients receiving a macrolide for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis may have resistance due to chronic exposure (BIII). Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients in whom tuberculosis (TB) is suspected but who are not being treated with concurrent standard four-drug TB therapy (BIII). Once the pathogen has been identified by reliable microbiologic methods, antibiotic therapy should be modified to target the pathogen (BIII), and if drug-resistant pathogens have not been identified by reliable microbiologic methods, antibiotic therapy can be de-escalated to cover routine causes of CAP (BIII). Antibiotics chemoprophylaxis is generally not recommended because of the potential for development of drug resistance microorganisms and drug toxicities (AII).

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

Leflunomide — interstitial pneumonitis: Interstitial pneumonitis with leflunomide has been reported in case series, especially in Japan, and fatalities have occurred. Whether preexisting lung disease from rheumatoid arthritis confers a higher risk of pneumonitis compared with methotrexate therapy is unclear. The largest data set, using a cohort of 62,734 patients treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, suggested that any increased incidence of pneumonitis in leflunomide-treated patients was likely a result of clinician preference to treat patients with underlying interstitial lung disease with leflunomide rather than methotrexate.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults with HIV — duration and IV-to-PO switch: For most patients, duration of therapy is 5–7 days; the patient should be afebrile for 48–72 hours and should be clinically stable before discontinuation of therapy. Longer duration of antibiotics is often required when severe CAP or bacteremia is present, particularly if due to S. pneumoniae or complicated S. aureus infection. A switch from intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) therapy should be considered for patients who have improved clinically, can swallow and tolerate oral medications, and have intact gastrointestinal function (BIII).
