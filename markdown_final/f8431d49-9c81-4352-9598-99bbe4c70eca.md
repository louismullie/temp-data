## Question

Key side effects to ask pwtients on zosyn

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about key side effects to ask patients about while receiving piperacillin–tazobactam (Zosyn), including screening questions, risk stratification, interactions, monitoring, counseling, and an action pathway if severe events occur. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-frequency adverse effects and how to quickly screen for them. Then, I should review common but less frequent effects across organ systems. Next, I'll prioritize serious warnings that warrant urgent action, consider patient-specific risk modifiers, evaluate interaction-related risks, outline structured laboratory monitoring, and end with patient counseling points and a decisive escalation algorithm, while verifying each step with labeling and supportive literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the very common adverse effects because those should drive my opening screening questions; the FDA labeling lists allergic reactions, decreased neutrophil count, and diarrhea as occurring in more than 10% of patients, so I should ask about new rash or pruritus, fever or signs of infection that might reflect neutropenia, and watery stools, while remembering that many patient-reported "penicillin allergies" are actually intolerances like diarrhea rather than IgE-mediated allergy, which I should clarify at the bedside [^1144nGKN] [^114z9BX2].

> Wait, let me verify the broader 1–10% profile to structure a systematic review of systems; the SPL data support asking about nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and stomatitis; candidiasis and pruritus; easy bruising or bleeding and fatigue suggestive of thrombocytopenia or anemia; changes in urination or edema that could hint at AKI; headache, confusion, insomnia or tremor; hypotension or IV site pain consistent with thrombophlebitis, making sure I connect symptoms to corresponding labs during follow-up [^116222rw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benign rashes; I need to explicitly screen for severe hypersensitivity phenotypes such as anaphylaxis, DRESS, SJS/TEN, or AGEP by asking about dyspnea, facial or throat swelling, mucosal involvement, blistering or targetoid lesions, and systemic symptoms, since these are called out in warnings and postmarketing sections and demand immediate discontinuation and higher-acuity care if present [^1144nGKN] [^113H7wQz].

> I should confirm gastrointestinal red flags consistent with C. difficile, since antibiotic exposure is a known risk; watery diarrhea three or more times per day with cramping, fever, or leukocytosis — especially after 48 hours of therapy — warrants stool testing and prompt management, and I should keep in mind this is a class effect across beta-lactams, reinforcing my threshold to evaluate early rather than attribute it to "typical" antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^1144nGKN] [^111XNwq1].

> Let me consider neurologic and renal safety next; seizures and encephalopathy are more likely in renal impairment or at higher exposures, so I need to check creatinine clearance and dose-adjust accordingly and ask about confusion, myoclonus, or seizures, while also watching kidney function closely given warnings about AKI in critically ill patients and the additional AKI risk signal when combined with vancomycin, which argues for vigilant creatinine monitoring and risk-mitigation if dual therapy is unavoidable [^113fhWyH] [^1144nGKN] [^116Kuisy] [^1178MT7z].

> Next, I should review rare but serious immune-inflammatory or muscular complications; hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis presents with persistent fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and cytopenias and should be on my radar with prolonged therapy, and muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine could suggest rhabdomyolysis, both flagged in warnings and necessitating immediate evaluation and drug cessation if suspected, with supportive care and specialty input as indicated [^1144nGKN].

> I need to ensure I factor in coagulation concerns; bleeding and prolonged PT are cautioned particularly in renal failure, so unexplained bruising, epistaxis, or petechiae should prompt CBC and coagulation studies and a careful look at concomitant anticoagulants or uremic platelet dysfunction, with heightened attention in those with advanced CKD where accumulation and uremia can synergize with drug effects [^1144nGKN].

> Now, I will examine patient-specific modifiers to tailor monitoring intensity and dosing; for CrCl less than 20 mL/min, the maximal individual dose is 2.25 g with no more frequent than every 8 hours except nosocomial pneumonia, and in intermittent hemodialysis I should follow the reduced schedule and give a 0.75 g supplement post-dialysis on dialysis days, while in older adults I must consider the sodium load and age-related reductions in clearance that increase exposure and fluid burden, prompting conservative dosing and closer renal checks [^113fhWyH] [^111M56pc] [^112MoeN8] [^115m1SU6].

> But wait, what about hematologic toxicity over time; case reports describe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia around the two-week mark even at moderate cumulative doses and pediatric series link prolonged courses with fever, rash, cytopenias, and transaminitis that resolve on discontinuation, so for courses beyond 7–10 days, I should increase CBC and LFT surveillance and counsel on fever, easy bruising, or fatigue as triggers to reassess therapy duration and marrow suppression risk [^112aYsj5] [^113cBGUE] [^116222rw].

> I should double-check interaction-related risks next; coadministration with vancomycin increases AKI risk compared to Zosyn alone in multiple cohorts, guiding me to monitor creatinine and consider alternatives if feasible, and concomitant aminoglycosides require separate preparation and administration to avoid in vitro inactivation, with awareness that aminoglycosides themselves carry ototoxic and nephrotoxic potential, warranting symptom inquiry about hearing changes and strict drug-level monitoring when used together [^116Kuisy] [^1178MT7z] [^114yNtuD].

> Next, I should review a structured monitoring plan; obtain baseline and periodic CBC with differential for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, BMP for BUN/creatinine and electrolytes including potassium and sodium, LFTs for hepatocellular or cholestatic injury, and PT/INR if bleeding concerns arise, and add a direct Coombs test if hemolysis is suspected, escalating frequency with prolonged courses or evolving symptoms rather than waiting for scheduled labs to catch abnormalities [^116222rw] [^1144nGKN].

> Let me verify duration-dependent vigilance; for therapy exceeding 7–10 days, intensify hematologic and hepatic monitoring, and for courses beyond 14 days, maintain the highest suspicion for bicytopenia and HLH, with a low threshold to discontinue and switch agents if cytopenias or systemic inflammatory signs emerge after other causes are excluded, given the timing patterns described in postmarketing data and case literature [^112aYsj5] [^113cBGUE] [^1144nGKN].

> I need to provide clear counseling points so patients know when to call urgently; new or worsening rash, especially with blisters or mucosal involvement; severe or persistent watery diarrhea with cramps or fever; unusual bleeding or petechiae; dark urine or severe muscle pain; decreased urine output, edema, or sudden weight gain; and fever above 100.4°F after several days of therapy should all trigger immediate contact and likely reassessment of the antibiotic regimen [^1144nGKN] [^116222rw].

> Let me think about a quick system-based script to streamline visits; I will ask about skin and breathing symptoms for allergy and anaphylaxis, stool frequency and abdominal pain for CDI, bruising and fatigue for cytopenias, urine output and swelling for renal issues, confusion or tremor for neurotoxicity, mucocutaneous yeast symptoms for candidiasis, and dizziness for hypotension, linking positives to targeted labs and exam while keeping the conversation anchored to the known adverse event profile from labeling [^116222rw] [^1144nGKN].

> For the final clinical decision path, if any severe adverse effect is reported or reported or reported… hmm, wait a minute, I repeated myself; I should correct that to say if any severe adverse effect is reported, immediately hold piperacillin–tazobactam, stabilize the patient, and manage according to syndrome: give intramuscular epinephrine and emergency care for anaphylaxis, stop the drug and obtain urgent dermatology input for SJS/TEN or DRESS, send stool testing and initiate CDI therapy for suspected C. difficile, assess creatinine and volume status and stop other nephrotoxins for AKI while adjusting or discontinuing Zosyn based on renal function, obtain CBC, smear, and hemolysis labs with a direct Coombs if anemia evolves, and resume alternative antimicrobials only after risk–benefit reassessment and appropriate dose adjustment for renal function or dialysis scheduling, documenting the reaction and ensuring follow-up labs and allergy labeling are updated before any future beta-lactam exposure [^1144nGKN] [^116222rw] [^113fhWyH] [^111M56pc].

---

When counseling patients on Zosyn, focus on **hypersensitivity reactions** (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing) [^114z9BX2], **severe diarrhea** (possible C. difficile) [^1144nGKN] [^111XNwq1], and **renal impairment** (reduced urine, swelling, confusion) [^112MoeN8] [^116222rw]. Also ask about **hematologic abnormalities** (easy bruising, bleeding, fatigue, infections) [^113H7wQz] [^112bEp23], **electrolyte disturbances** (muscle cramps, weakness, irregular heartbeat) [^116222rw] [^112MoeN8], and **neurologic symptoms** (seizures, confusion, tremors) [^1144nGKN] [^113fhWyH]. Advise patients to report any of these symptoms immediately, especially if they have renal impairment [^1144nGKN] or are on vancomycin, due to increased nephrotoxicity risk [^116Kuisy] [^1178MT7z].

---

## Hypersensitivity reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions are categorized as **immediate** — anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and hypotension [^114z9BX2] [^111dwhuT]; these can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention [^114ewnFG] — and **delayed** — maculopapular rash, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [^1144nGKN] [^113H7wQz].

---

## Gastrointestinal side effects

- **Diarrhea**: Very common (> 10%) [^114ewnFG], including risk of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), which can be severe or life-threatening [^1144nGKN] [^111XNwq1].

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Common (1–10%) [^116222rw].

- **Abdominal pain and indigestion**: Common (1–10%) [^116222rw].

- **Pseudomembranous colitis**: Rare but serious, associated with antibiotic use [^1144nGKN] [^1121Qbme].

---

## Renal impairment

Acute kidney injury (**AKI**) is common, particularly among critically ill patients [^1144nGKN] or when coadministered with nephrotoxic agents such as vancomycin [^116Kuisy] [^1178MT7z]. Interstitial nephritis is a rare but serious renal complication [^113H7wQz]. Increased **serum creatinine** and **blood urea nitrogen (BUN)** are common laboratory indicators of renal impairment [^116222rw] [^1141TDaw].

---

## Hematologic abnormalities

- **Neutropenia**: Very common (> 10%), especially with prolonged therapy [^114ewnFG] [^113cBGUE].

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Common (1–10%), can lead to increased bleeding risk [^116222rw] [^112aYsj5].

- **Anemia**: Common (1–10%), including hemolytic anemia [^116222rw] [^115TWkim].

- **Pancytopenia and agranulocytosis**: Rare but serious hematologic complications [^114ewnFG] [^113H7wQz].

---

## Electrolyte disturbances

Electrolyte disturbances include **hypokalemia** — Common (1–10%), which may cause muscle cramps, weakness, or cardiac arrhythmias [^116222rw] — and **hypernatremia** — Common (1–10%), particularly in patients with restricted salt intake or renal impairment.

---

## Neurologic symptoms

- **Seizures**: Rare but serious, more likely in patients with renal impairment or pre-existing seizure disorders [^1144nGKN] [^113fhWyH].

- **Confusion, delirium, and encephalopathy**: Rare but significant neurologic side effects [^1144nGKN] [^113H7wQz] [^115DMNP9].

- **Neuromuscular excitability and tremors**: Common, especially in patients with renal impairment.

---

## Injection site reactions

Injection-site reactions commonly include **phlebitis and thrombophlebitis** — Common (1–10%), characterized by redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site [^116222rw] — and **injection-site pain and inflammation** — Common (1–10%) [^116222rw].

---

## Monitoring and patient counseling

Patients receiving Zosyn should be closely monitored for **renal function** with regular serum creatinine and BUN checks, particularly in those with pre-existing renal impairment or receiving nephrotoxic drugs [^1141TDaw] [^1144nGKN]. Monitor **complete blood counts** to detect neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia [^114ewnFG] [^113H7wQz]. Electrolytes, particularly **potassium** and **sodium**, should be checked, especially in patients with renal impairment or on diuretics [^116222rw] [^112MoeN8]. Neurologic status should be assessed for **seizures**, **confusion**, or other symptoms, with heightened vigilance in those with renal impairment or seizure disorders [^1144nGKN] [^113fhWyH] [^111M56pc]. Counsel patients to **report immediately** any signs of hypersensitivity reactions, severe diarrhea, reduced urine output, unusual bleeding or bruising, muscle cramps, weakness, confusion, or seizures.

---

## Special considerations

Renal impairment requires **dose adjustment** in patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min and in dialysis patients [^112MoeN8] [^111M56pc]. In hepatic impairment, **no dose adjustment** is required, but liver function tests should be monitored [^112rh1Wz]. Pediatric and geriatric patients have safety profiles similar to adults, though **careful monitoring** is recommended due to potential differences in drug clearance [^115m1SU6] [^112MoeN8].

---

Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) is associated with **significant side effects**, including hypersensitivity reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, renal impairment, hematologic abnormalities, electrolyte disturbances, neurologic symptoms, and injection site reactions. Patients should be **closely monitored** and counseled to report any concerning symptoms immediately [^1144nGKN].

### Nephrotoxicity from vancomycin combined with piperacillin-tazobactam: A comprehensive review [^116Kuisy]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Recent studies have identified the combination of vancomycin with piperacillin-tazobactam (VPT) to be associated with increased nephrotoxicity. Multiple large cohort studies have found this widely used combination to have a higher risk of nephrotoxicity than other regimens in a variety of populations.

This review summarizes the epidemiology and clinical features of VPT-associated acute kidney injury (AKI). Potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon are also discussed. Key message: VPT-associated nephrotoxicity is a recently recognized clinical entity. Clinical strategies to minimize the risk of toxicity in this setting include antimicrobial stewardship, monitoring of kidney function, and emerging data supporting the potential role of novel biomarkers in predicting and managing AKI.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam induced bicytopenia in low cumulative treatment doses [^112aYsj5]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) was suspected to be the most likely cause of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia; hence, it was terminated on day 14 (cumulative dose of PTZ: 126 g) following stabilization of the infection condition. A transfusion was performed with two units of single donor platelets on day 14, and the patient was treated with intravenous dexamethasone 5 mg every 8 hours from day 14 to 16. Her white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts increased to 3960/µL and 81×10³/µL, respectively, on day 15 and continued to recover thereafter. Given the timing and changes in WBC and platelet counts, we considered both neutropenia and thrombocytopenia as side effects of PTZ treatment.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam induced immune hemolytic anemia led to increased renal impairment and eventual death from multiple organ failure in a patient with hypertensive nephropathy: Case report and literature review [^115TWkim]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with "hypertension for more than 20 years, hypertensive nephropathy for 4 years, vomiting for 9 hours, and urinary incontinence for 5 hours". The clinical characteristics of the patient were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb) 72 g/L (reference values 120–160 g/L); alanine transaminase (ALT) 18 U/L (reference values < 23 U/L); total bilirubin (TBIL) 7.1 μmol/L (reference values 2–21 μmol/L); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 382 U/L (reference values 135–215 U/L); blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 31.47 mmol/L (reference values 3.0–9.2 mmol/L); creatinine (Cr) 588.3 μmol/L (reference values 71–115 μmol/L); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity, physiological levels.

Through computer tomography (CT), the diagnosis was: left frontotemporal occipital subdural hematoma, left insular hemorrhage, acute exacerbation of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary infection, hypertension grade 3 high-risk group, hypertension nephropathy, chronic kidney disease stage 4, pericardial effusion. After admission, supportive treatments were administered, including infusion of leukocyte-reduced red blood cells (LRBCs) prepared from 600 mL of whole blood, blood pressure control, hemostasis, erythropoietin, and hemodialysis once every 2–3 days. By the 50th day after admission, creatinine levels dropped to 242.6 μmol/L, discontinuing hemodialysis.

On the 8th day after admission, the first course of piperacillin-tazobactam anti-infective treatment was initiated. Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g was instilled intravenously every 12 hours for 31 consecutive days, totaling 279 g.

### Assessing the effect of piperacillin/tazobactam on hematological parameters in patients admitted with moderate or severe foot infections [^112bEp23]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Piperacillin/tazobactam is a commonly used antibiotic for the empirical treatment of severe diabetic foot infections. One of the most feared complications of this drug is the development of pancytopenia. The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of piperacillin/tazobactam caused any hematological changes in patients admitted with severe diabetes-related foot infections from a specialist multidisciplinary foot clinic, specifically looking at whether it caused anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia.

- **Methods**: A 1-year retrospective analysis was conducted on patients admitted to a tertiary care center for the treatment of diabetes-related foot infections using piperacillin/tazobactam. Hematological indices, urea and electrolytes, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were recorded pretreatment, during treatment, and post-treatment. HbA1c, vitamin B12, folate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and free thyroxin were also analyzed to exclude any potential confounders as a cause of pancytopenia.

- **Results**: A total of 154 patients were admitted between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016, receiving piperacillin/tazobactam for severe diabetes-related foot infections. On admission, white cell count and CRP were raised and fell significantly within the first 48 hours. Other hematological factors did not change. Five patients developed mild pancytopenia, of which three were unexplained.

- **Conclusion**: In this relatively small cohort, pancytopenia did not occur frequently. As such, piperacillin/tazobactam appeared to have a low risk of adverse hematological outcomes and remains a viable treatment option.

### Clinical pharmacology of antibiotics [^1141TDaw]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial pharmacology and its effect on prescribing is quite complex. Selecting an antibiotic that will optimally treat an infection while minimizing adverse effects and the development of resistance is only the first step, as one must also consider the patient's individual pharmacokinetic alterations and the pharmacodynamic properties of the drug when prescribing it as well.

Patients with CKD may have alterations in their protein binding, volumes of distribution, kidney clearance, and nonrenal clearance that necessitate antibiotic dose adjustments to prevent the development of toxicity. Knowledge of a drug's pharmacodynamics, defined as the relationship between drug exposure and antibacterial efficacy, provides some guidance regarding the optimal way to make dose adjustments.

Different pharmacodynamic goals, such as maximizing the time that free (unbound) drug concentrations spend above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for time-dependent drugs (e.g. β-lactams) or maximizing the free peak-to-MIC ratio for concentration-dependent antibiotics (e.g. aminoglycosides), require different adjustment strategies. For instance, decreasing the dose while maintaining normal dosing frequency or giving normal (or even larger) doses less frequently, respectively.

Patients receiving hemodialysis have other important prescribing considerations as well. The nephrologist or patient may prefer to receive antibiotics that can be administered intravenously toward the end of a dialysis session. Additionally, newer dialysis technologies and filters can increase drug removal.

### Cefepime vs piperacillin-tazobactam in adults hospitalized with acute infection: The ACORN randomized clinical trial [^115DMNP9]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam are commonly administered to hospitalized adults for empirical treatment of infection. Although piperacillin-tazobactam has been hypothesized to cause acute kidney injury and cefepime has been hypothesized to cause neurological dysfunction, their comparative safety has not been evaluated in a randomized clinical trial.

- **Objective**: To determine whether the choice between cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam affects the risks of acute kidney injury or neurological dysfunction.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: The Antibiotic Choice on Renal Outcomes (ACORN) randomized clinical trial compared cefepime vs. piperacillin-tazobactam in adults. Participants were individuals for whom a clinician initiated an order for antipseudomonal antibiotics within 12 hours of presentation to the hospital in the emergency department or medical intensive care unit at an academic medical center in the US, between November 10, 2021, and October 7, 2022. The final date of follow-up was November 4, 2022.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the highest stage of acute kidney injury or death by day 14, measured on a 5-level ordinal scale ranging from no acute kidney injury to death. The two secondary outcomes were the incidence of major adverse kidney events at day 14 and the number of days alive and free of delirium and coma within 14 days.

- **Results**: There were 2511 patients included in the primary analysis (median age, 58 years [IQR, 43–69 years]; 42.7% were female; 16.3% we

### Beta-lactam-induced immediate hypersensitivity reactions: A genome-wide association study of a deeply phenotyped cohort [^114z9BX2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

β-Lactam (BL) antibiotics cause a wide spectrum of hypersensitivity reactions (sometimes termed allergy). The self-reported incidence of BL allergy ranges from 1% to over 10%, but in clinical populations, most patients (approximately 95%) are not found to be truly allergic with validated skin testing and oral challenge. Indeed, a high proportion are intolerant, as adverse effects such as diarrhea after the use of BLs are often mistakenly reported as allergies by patients.

True BL hypersensitivity reactions are classified according to the time of onset of the reaction following drug intake. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions develop in minutes or hours after drug intake and are due to cross-linking of specific IgE molecules on the mast cell surface, with release of vasoactive mediators such as histamine leading to vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. Clinically, this is manifested as urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and hypotension. Anaphylaxis is the most severe and feared form of immediate hypersensitivity. By contrast, delayed hypersensitivity reactions occurring more than six hours after dosing are typically T-cell-mediated and have variable manifestations, including maculopapular exanthem, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.

Medicines are among the main causes of fatal anaphylaxis, with a mortality rate higher than with other agents. Penicillins and cephalosporins are still the two most common drug classes associated with anaphylaxis, with penicillins having a higher incidence (1–5 per 100,000).

Regarding the use of piperacillin / tazobactam IV (also known as Zosyn) in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of less than 20 mL/min:

- **Maximal dose**: 2.25 g. Do not exceed a frequency of every 8 hours.
- **Monitor for neuromuscular excitability and convulsions**.
- **For nosocomial pneumonia only**: Reduce the dose to 2.25 g every 6 hours.

### Zosyn [^115m1SU6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Piperacillin and tazobactam pharmacokinetics were studied in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older. The clearance of both compounds is slower in younger patients compared to older children and adults.

In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, estimated clearance for 9-month-old to 12-year-old patients was comparable to adults, with a population mean (SE) value of 5.64 (0.34) mL/min/kg. The piperacillin clearance estimate is 80% of this value for pediatric patients aged 2 to 9 months. In patients younger than 2 months, piperacillin clearance is slower compared to older children; however, it is not adequately characterized for dosing recommendations. The population mean (SE) for the piperacillin volume of distribution is 0.243 (0.011) L/kg and is independent of age.

- **Geriatrics**: The impact of age on the pharmacokinetics of piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male subjects aged 18–35 years (n = 6) and 65–80 years (n = 12). The mean half-life for piperacillin and tazobactam was 32% and 55% higher, respectively, in the elderly compared to younger subjects, which may result from age-related changes in creatinine clearance.

- **Race**: The effect of race on piperacillin and tazobactam was evaluated in healthy male volunteers. There was no difference in piperacillin or tazobactam pharmacokinetics between Asian (n = 9) and Caucasian (n = 9) healthy volunteers who received single doses of 4/0.5 g.

- **Drug interactions**: The potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between Zosyn and aminoglycosides, probenecid, vancomycin, heparin, vecuronium,…

### Fetroja [^111XNwq1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Hypersensitivity was observed in Fetroja-treated patients in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of beta-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins.

Before therapy with Fetroja is instituted, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Discontinue Fetroja if an allergic reaction occurs.

- **Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD)**: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including Fetroja. CDAD may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use.

### Increasing evidence of the nephrotoxicity of piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin combination therapy-what is the clinician to do [^1178MT7z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Early administration of appropriate empiric antibiotics is essential for achieving the best possible outcomes in sepsis. Yet, the choice of antibiotic therapy has become more challenging due to recent reports of nephrotoxicity with the combination of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, the "workhorse" regimen at many institutions.

In this article, we assess the evidence for nephrotoxicity and its possible mechanisms. We provide recommendations for risk mitigation, address the advantages and disadvantages of alternative antibiotic choices, and suggest areas for future research.

Ceftazidime is generally well tolerated. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with the administration of ceftazidime was low in clinical trials. The most common were local reactions following IV injection and allergic and gastrointestinal reactions. Other adverse reactions were encountered infrequently. No disulfiram-like reactions were reported.

The following adverse effects from clinical trials were considered to be either related to ceftazidime therapy or were of uncertain etiology:

- **Local effects**: Reported in fewer than 2% of patients, these included phlebitis and inflammation at the site of injection (1 in 69 patients).

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Reported in 2% of patients, these included pruritus, rash, and fever. Immediate reactions, generally manifested by rash and/or pruritus, occurred in 1 in 285 patients. Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported with cephalosporin antibacterial drugs, including ceftazidime. Angioedema and anaphylaxis (bronchospasm and/or hypotension) have been reported very rarely.

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Reported in fewer than 2% of patients, these included diarrhea (1 in 78), nausea (1 in 156), vomiting (1 in 500), and abdominal pain (1 in 416). The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after treatment (see WARNINGS).

Regarding the use of piperacillin / tazobactam IV (also known as Zosyn) in patients with intermittent hemodialysis: dose as in eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m². The maximal dose is 2.25g with a maximal frequency of q12h. Monitor for neuromuscular excitability and convulsions. For nosocomial pneumonia only, reduce the dose to 2.25g every 8 hours. Since hemodialysis removes 30% to 40% of the administered dose, an additional dose of 0.75g should be given after each dialysis period on dialysis days.

### Zosyn [^112MoeN8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Patients over 65 years are not at an increased risk of developing adverse effects solely because of age. However, dosage should be adjusted in the presence of renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range. This reflects the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, as well as concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Zosyn contains 65 mg (2.84 mEq) of sodium per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. At the usual recommended doses, patients would receive between 780 and 1040 mg/day (34.1 and 45.5 mEq) of sodium. The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading. This may be clinically important with regard to diseases such as congestive heart failure.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

- **Renal impairment**: In patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 40 mL/min and dialysis patients (hemodialysis and CAPD), the intravenous dose of Zosyn should be reduced according to the degree of renal function impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Dosage adjustment of Zosyn is not warranted in patients with hepatic cirrhosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Zosyn [^114yNtuD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Aminoglycosides**: Piperacillin may inactivate aminoglycosides by converting them to microbiologically inert amides.

	**In vivo inactivation**: When aminoglycosides are administered in conjunction with piperacillin to patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, the concentrations of the aminoglycosides (especially tobramycin) may be significantly reduced and should be monitored. Sequential administration of Zosyn and tobramycin to patients with either normal renal function or mild to moderate renal impairment has been shown to modestly decrease serum concentrations of tobramycin, but no dosage adjustment is considered necessary.

	**In vitro inactivation**: Due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by piperacillin, Zosyn and aminoglycosides are recommended for separate administration. They should be reconstituted, diluted, and administered separately when concomitant therapy with aminoglycosides is indicated. Zosyn, which contains EDTA, is compatible with amikacin and gentamicin for simultaneous Y-site infusion in certain diluents and at specific concentrations. However, Zosyn is not compatible with tobramycin for simultaneous Y-site infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

- **Probenecid**: Probenecid administered concomitantly with Zosyn prolongs the half-life of piperacillin by 21% and that of tazobactam by 71% because probenecid inhibits tubular renal secretion of both piperacillin and tazobactam. Probenecid should not be co-administered with Zosyn unless the benefit outweighs the risk.

### Assessing the effect of piperacillin/tazobactam on hematological parameters in patients admitted with moderate or severe foot infections [^112Tsg9S]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

In 2015, worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes in adults aged between 20 and 79 years old was estimated at 415 million people, with an annual global cost of approximately US$1.3 trillion. A significant part of this cost was due to acute hospital admissions. Diabetic foot infections are common and are the most frequent cause of a "diabetes-specific" acute hospital admission, accounting for the majority of hospital days among diabetes-related complications.

Most moderate to severe diabetic foot infections result from polymicrobial colonization of tissue by Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. Consequently, the empirical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to sensitivity results has proven clinically effective, with reported rates of clinical resolution between 77% and 94%. Piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin ®, Pfizer Ltd, Sandwich, UK) is an antibiotic that combines the extended-spectrum agent piperacillin with the β-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam. This drug demonstrates activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to its extended spectrum, the drug has shown effectiveness in treating moderate to severe diabetic foot infections, offering an advantage over ertapenem. As a result, piperacillin/tazobactam is commonly recommended as first-line empirical treatment due to its high efficacy and relative safety compared to other antibiotics.

The manufacturer's package leaflet for piperacillin/tazobactam has documented pancytopenia as a possible side effect.

### Piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy in high-risk febrile and neutropenic cancer patients [^112veMAX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside has been the standard approach for treating febrile neutropenia for many years. More recently, beta-lactam monotherapy has also been shown to be a reliable and safe approach. In the present study, 763 eligible patients with fever and neutropenia received piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy. On day 3, according to the study protocol, 165 patients with persistent fever who fulfilled the study entry criteria were randomized to receive vancomycin or a placebo. The success rate was 51% in the intention-to-treat analysis and 62% in the per-protocol analysis. The overall mortality rate was 8% (58/763), with only 18 (2.4%) deaths attributed to the initial or subsequent infection. Randomization had no influence on the study endpoints. The adverse event rate was evaluated only in the patient population not included in the randomized part of the study. Among these patients, adverse events probably or definitely related to piperacillin-tazobactam therapy were uncommon, confirming the favorable safety profile of piperacillin-tazobactam. It was concluded that piperacillin-tazobactam could be considered as monotherapy for patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia.

### A randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing efficacy and safety of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam versus piperacillin/tazobactam in adults with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (RESTORE-IMI 2 study) [^1141fGQu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Imipenem combined with the β-lactamase inhibitor relebactam has broad antibacterial activity, including against carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam in treating hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP).

This was a randomized, controlled, double-blind phase 3 trial. Adults with HABP/VABP were randomized 1:1 to receive imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam 500 mg/500 mg/250 mg or piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g/500 mg, intravenously every 6 hours for 7–14 days. The primary endpoint was day 28 all-cause mortality in the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population, which included patients who received study therapy, excluding those with only gram-positive cocci at baseline. The key secondary endpoint was the clinical response 7–14 days after completing therapy in the MITT population.

Of 537 randomized patients from 113 hospitals in 27 countries, the MITT population comprised 264 imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam and 267 piperacillin/tazobactam patients. Among these, 48.6% had ventilated HABP/VABP, 47.5% had an APACHE II score ≥ 15, 24.7% had moderate/severe renal impairment, 42.9% were ≥ 65 years old, and 66.1% were in the intensive care unit. The most common baseline pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae (25.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.9%). Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam was noninferior (P < .001) to piperacillin/tazobactam for both endpoints. Day 28 all-cause mortality was 15.9% with imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam and 21.3% with piperacillin/tazobactam (difference, −5.3% [95% confidence).

### A randomized, open-label, multicenter comparative study of the efficacy and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes in patients with hematologic malignancies [^114zGKvZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The empirical treatment of febrile, neutropenic patients with cancer requires antibacterial regimens active against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. This study was performed to demonstrate the noninferiority of monotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam compared with cefepime.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized-controlled, open-label, multicenter clinical trial among high-risk patients from 34 university-affiliated tertiary care medical centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia who were undergoing treatment for leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and were hospitalized for empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes. Patients received piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 hours) or cefepime (2 g every 8 hours) intravenously. The primary outcome was success, defined by defervescence without treatment modification, at 72 hours of treatment, end of treatment, and test of cure in the modified intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included time to defervescence, microbiological efficacy, the additional use of glycopeptide antibiotics, emergence of resistant bacteria, and safety.

- **Results**: For 528 subjects (265 received piperacillin-tazobactam and 263 received cefepime), success rates were 57.7% and 48.3%, respectively (P = 0.04) at the 72-hour time point, 39.6% and 31.6% (P = 0.06) at the end of treatment, and 26.8% and 20.5% (P = 0.11) at the test-of-cure visit. The analyses demonstrated noninferiority for piperacillin-tazobactam at all time points (P ≤ .0001). Treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam was independently associated.

### Antibiotic allergy [^116d4RpN]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are the most common cause of life-threatening immune-mediated drug reactions that are considered off-target, including anaphylaxis, as well as organ-specific and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. However, many antibiotic reactions documented as allergies were unknown or not remembered by the patient. These may include cutaneous reactions unrelated to drug hypersensitivity, drug-infection interactions, or drug intolerances. Although such reactions pose negligible risk to patients, they currently represent a global threat to public health.

Antibiotic allergy labels result in the displacement of first-line therapies for antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. A penicillin allergy label, in particular, is associated with increased use of broad-spectrum and non-β-lactam antibiotics, leading to increased adverse events and antibiotic resistance. Most patients labeled as allergic to penicillins are not truly allergic when appropriately stratified for risk, tested, and re-challenged. Given the public health importance of penicillin allergy, this review provides a global update on antibiotic allergy epidemiology, classification, mechanisms, and management.

A fertility and general reproduction study in rats using intraperitoneal administration of tazobactam or the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam prior to mating and through the end of gestation, reported a decrease in litter size in the presence of maternal toxicity at 640 mg/kg/day tazobactam (4 times the human dose of tazobactam based on body-surface area), and decreased litter size and an increase in fetuses with ossification delays and variations of ribs, with maternal toxicity at ≥ 640/160 mg/kg/day piperacillin and tazobactam (0.5 times and 1 times the human dose of piperacillin and tazobactam, respectively, based on body-surface area).

Peri/postnatal development in rats was impaired with reduced pup weights, increased stillbirths, and increased pup mortality with maternal toxicity after intraperitoneal administration of tazobactam alone at doses ≥ 320 mg/kg/day (2 times the human dose based on body surface area) or of the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam at doses ≥ 640/160 mg/kg/day (0.5 times and 1 times the human dose of piperacillin and tazobactam, respectively, based on body-surface area) from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21.

- **Lactation**:
	- **Risk summary**: Piperacillin is excreted in human milk; tazobactam concentrations in human milk have not been studied. No information is available on the effects of piperacillin and tazobactam on the breast-fed child or on milk production.

### Zosyn [^115fD5qK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Zosyn is an antibacterial drug [see microbiology (12.4)].

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The pharmacodynamic parameter for piperacillin and tazobactam that is most predictive of clinical and microbiological efficacy is time above MIC.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: The mean and coefficients of variation (CV%) for the pharmacokinetic parameters of piperacillin and tazobactam after multiple intravenous doses are summarized in Table 7.

	- Cmax: maximum observed concentration, AUC: area under the curve, CL = clearance, CLR = renal clearance

	- V = volume of distribution, T1/2 = elimination half-life

	- Peak plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam are attained immediately after completion of an intravenous infusion of Zosyn. Piperacillin plasma concentrations, following a 30-minute infusion of Zosyn, were similar to those attained when equivalent doses of piperacillin were administered alone. Steady-state plasma concentrations of piperacillin and tazobactam were similar to those attained after the first dose due to the short half-lives of piperacillin and tazobactam.

### Practical management of antibiotic hypersensitivity in 2017 [^116KQxdK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are the most common class of medications to which individuals report allergy or intolerance. Adverse reactions are reported at a predictable rate with all antibiotic use, varying by antibiotic. The incidence rates of antibiotic allergy are sex-dependent, being higher in females than in males. Most of these events are not reproducible or immunologically mediated. Antibiotic allergy prevalence increases with age and is more common in hospitalized populations and those who use more antibiotics.

Determining potential mechanisms for the observed symptoms of adverse reactions is the starting point for effective management of antibiotic hypersensitivity. Skin testing and direct challenges are the primary tools used to determine acute tolerance in 2017. Commercially available in vitro testing is not currently clinically useful in determining antibiotic hypersensitivity, with rare exceptions. Desensitization can be employed when acute-onset immunologically mediated hypersensitivity is confirmed, to safely administer a needed antibiotic. However, desensitization is not possible when clinically significant T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity is present. Effective management of antibiotic allergy is an essential component of a comprehensive antibiotic stewardship program.

### Prospective piperacillin lymphocyte transformation testing in patients with cystic fibrosis receiving regular and desensitization courses of piperacillin-tazobactam [^114vSYVU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Low credibility.

Piperacillin-tazobactam is used in patients with cystic fibrosis to treat respiratory infections, with exposure being associated with a high frequency of nonimmediate hypersensitivity.

- **Objective**: To assess the applicability of the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) for the diagnosis of piperacillin hypersensitivity and the influence of desensitization on piperacillin-specific T-cell responses.

- **Methods**: Study arm 1 was an analysis of LTT responses from 58 naive/baseline tolerant patients with samples collected over a 3-year interventional phase. In study arm 2, 17 hypersensitive patients were recruited, and LTTs were conducted before and after desensitization. Clinical hypersensitivity reactions in both arms were monitored over an 8-year observational period.

- **Results**: In study arm 1, 58 patients received 611 piperacillin-tazobactam courses (range, 2–40; mean ± SD, 10.5 ± 8.1) during the interventional phase; 11 patients developed hypersensitivity. The patients who remained tolerant received 236 piperacillin-tazobactam courses during the observational period, 9 of whom developed hypersensitivity. Ten of 11 interventional phase hypersensitive patients had a positive LTT, whereas one remained negative. We recorded 136 negative LTTs with 39 tolerant patients, whereas eight patients had a positive LTT and four developed hypersensitivity during the observational period. Ten LTT-positive patients in study arm 2 underwent piperacillin-tazobactam desensitization, with seven tolerating the drug. The strength of the LTT decreased during desensitization, and negative result.

### Ertapenem once daily versus piperacillin-tazobactam 4 times per day for treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections in adults: results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind multicenter study [^112roBUC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial comparing ertapenem (1 g once daily) with piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 h) as parenteral treatment for 540 adults with complicated skin and skin-structure infections. The most common diagnoses were skin or soft-tissue abscesses and lower-extremity infections associated with diabetes. The mean duration (± standard deviation) of therapy was 9.1 ± 3.1 days for ertapenem and 9.8 ± 3.3 days for piperacillin-tazobactam.

At the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint, 10–21 days after treatment, 82.4% of those who received ertapenem and 84.4% of those who received piperacillin-tazobactam were cured. The difference in response rates, adjusting for the patients' assigned strata, was -2.0% (95% confidence interval, -10.2% to 6.2%), indicating that the response rates in the two treatment groups were equivalent. Cure rates for the two treatment groups were similar when compared by stratum, diagnosis, and severity of infection. The frequency and severity of drug-related adverse events were similar in the treatment groups.

### Zosyn [^1167JNV6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Microbiology**: Piperacillin sodium exerts bactericidal activity by inhibiting septum formation and cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. In vitro, piperacillin is active against a variety of gram‑positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Tazobactam sodium has little clinically relevant in vitro activity against bacteria due to its reduced affinity to penicillin‑binding proteins. It is, however, a beta-lactamase inhibitor of the molecular class A enzymes, including Richmond-Sykes class III (Bush class 2b & 2b') penicillinases and cephalosporinases. It varies in its ability to inhibit class II and IV (2a & 4) penicillinases. Tazobactam does not induce chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases at tazobactam concentrations achieved with the recommended dosage regimen.

- **Antimicrobial activity**: Zosyn has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]: The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for piperacillin and tazobactam against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of Zosyn in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

These are not beta-lactamase producing bacteria and, therefore, are susceptible to piperacillin alone.

Cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam are commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat patients with potential gram-negative bacterial sepsis. Piperacillin-tazobactam has been associated with acute kidney injury (AKI); however, it has not been compared with cefepime in patients with septic shock. This study compared the effects of cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam on the incidence of severe AKI in such patients.

- **Methods**: This retrospective, multicenter, inverse probability-of-treatment weighted cohort study was conducted in 220 geographically diverse community and teaching hospitals across the United States. Adult patients were included if they had septic shock on hospital admission and received cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam. The occurrence of stage 3 AKI during hospitalization was compared between groups.

- **Results**: Of the 8,427 patients included in the final cohort, 4,569 received cefepime, and 3,858 received piperacillin-tazobactam. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 66.2 (15.2) years, with 45.3% female; the mean (SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate was 48 (24) mL/min/1.73 m² on the day of admission. In the weighted cohort, stage 3 AKI occurred in 9.9% of those receiving cefepime and 9.8% of those receiving piperacillin-tazobactam (odds ratio, 0.98 [95% confidence interval, .84–1.15]; p = 0.82). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no significant difference between cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam with regard to renal replacement therapy, in-hospital death, and major adverse kidney events, including stage 1 AKI.

### Recarbrio [^113Xrzfu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In Trial 1, serious adverse reactions were observed in 27% (71/266) of patients receiving Recarbrio and 32% (86/269) of patients receiving piperacillin and tazobactam. Adverse reactions leading to death were reported in 15% (40/266) of patients receiving Recarbrio and 21% (57/269) of those receiving piperacillin and tazobactam. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 5.6% (15/266) of patients receiving imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg/relebactam 250 mg, compared to 8.2% (22/269) of patients receiving piperacillin and tazobactam.

In Trials 2 and 3, serious adverse reactions were reported in 3.2% (7/216) of patients receiving imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg plus relebactam 250 mg, and in 5.1% (11/214) of those receiving imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg. Notably, there were no deaths in patients receiving imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg plus relebactam 250 mg or imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg alone. Deaths were observed in 1.4% (3/215) of patients receiving imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg plus relebactam 125 mg (not an approved dose).

Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were noted in 1.9% (4/216) of patients receiving imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg plus relebactam 250 mg, and in 2.3% (5/214) of those receiving imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg.

### Practical management of antibiotic allergy in adults [^116FeznF]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

This review examines the main issues surrounding immediate hypersensitivity and the role and limitations of testing. Most literature on antibiotic hypersensitivity pertains to β-lactam antibiotics due to their extensive use. Concerns about cross-reactivity are a common worry for clinicians, especially in emergency situations. Reasonable data on β-lactam antibiotics and derivatives now exist, allowing for appropriate risk management. The available literature for other classes of antibiotics is also discussed.

### Evaluation of periprocedural hypersensitivity reactions [^114GaQ5H]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Identifying the cause of periprocedural hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) remains challenging because of the multitude of medications involved. Antibiotics are the most common cause in the United States, whereas neuromuscular blocking agents are most common in Europe.

- **Objective**: To identify causative agents for periprocedural HSRs.

- **Methods**: This study was a 7-year retrospective medical record review of patients evaluated between December 2009 and January 2017 at a drug allergy center in Bronx, New York for periprocedural HSRs, defined as occurring soon before, during, or soon following a medical procedure or operation with or without general anesthesia. Demographics, description of historical HSRs, results of testing to potential causative medications, and tolerance of subsequent anesthesia were reviewed.

- **Results**: Thirty-four patients completed a comprehensive evaluation. Skin testing identified an IgE-mediated cause in 22 patients (64.7%). The most common causative class of medications was induction agents (n = 9 [36%]), with midazolam being the most frequently implicated (n = 6 [3 positive skin test results, 3 equivocal skin test results]). Cefazolin was the most commonly identified agent (n = 8 [32%]), followed by ondansetron (n = 3 [12%]). Sixteen of 22 contacted patients were exposed to subsequent anesthesia, including 3 patients with negative evaluations. One patient experienced a mild urticarial HSR.

- **Conclusion**: Induction agents were the most common causative agents in our patients, which differs from other studies. Given the variability in evaluations of periprocedural HSRs, continued research is necessary.

### Efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam in the treatment of surgical wound infection after clean-contaminated head and neck oncologic surgery [^1119h7o9]. Head & Neck (2004). Low credibility.

Although perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis has significantly reduced surgical wound infection rates, these infections remain a frequent complication of head and neck cancer surgery. Because these infections are typically polymicrobial, our study evaluated the safety and efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam for treatment.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, prospective clinical trial, 70 patients with surgical wound infection received piperacillin-tazobactam.

- **Results**: Of the evaluable patients, 92.4% were clinically cured or improved. The bacteriologic eradication rate was 80.3%. Of the 70 patients enrolled, six (8.5%) experienced adverse events: two cases of moderate diarrhea, one allergic skin reaction, and three cases of phlebitis. No deaths were attributable to the study drug.

- **Conclusions**: Piperacillin-tazobactam is a good choice for monotherapy in treating surgical wound infection after clean-contaminated head and neck oncologic surgery.

### Adverse drug reactions among children over a 10-year period [^114VBJBe]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

This study was designed to evaluate the incidence and common types of adverse drug reactions among hospitalized children, the frequency of adverse drug reaction reporting by healthcare providers, and the follow-up processes resulting from adverse drug reactions.

A retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients who experienced an adverse drug reaction between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2004, was conducted at a community-based, tertiary care children's teaching hospital.

A total of 1087 adverse drug reactions were reported, with an overall incidence of 1.6%. The severity of most adverse drug reactions was low (levels 1–3: 89%; high levels 4–6: 11%). Adverse drug reactions with low severity were significantly more common in both the general pediatric unit and the NICU. Adverse reactions resulting from the use of antibiotics, particularly penicillins, cephalosporins, and vancomycin, were usually mild. In contrast, adverse drug reactions rated high in severity were significantly more common among reactions that led to hospital admission or occurred during surgery, and among certain drug classes including anticonvulsants and antineoplastic agents.

Adverse drug reactions were reported by pharmacists (89%), nurses (10%), and physicians (< 1%). Although documentation of physician notification occurred for 93% of adverse drug reactions, only 29% of cases were documented in the patient's medical chart, 13% included follow-up education for individuals involved, and 10% were updated in the allergy profile of the hospital computer system.

### Effect of piperacillin-tazobactam vs meropenem on 30-day mortality for patients with E coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infection and ceftriaxone resistance: A randomized clinical trial [^112BoJV8]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases mediate resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone) in *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. Significant infections caused by these strains are usually treated with carbapenems, potentially selecting for carbapenem resistance. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be an effective "carbapenem-sparing" option to treat extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether definitive therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam is noninferior to meropenem (a carbapenem) in patients with bloodstream infection caused by ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible *E coli* or *K pneumoniae*.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This noninferiority, parallel group, randomized clinical trial included hospitalized patients enrolled from 26 sites in 9 countries from February 2014 to July 2017. Adult patients were eligible if they had at least one positive blood culture with *E coli* or *Klebsiella* spp testing nonsusceptible to ceftriaxone but susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of 1646 patients screened, 391 were included in the study.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam, 4.5 g, every 6 hours (n = 188 participants) or meropenem, 1 g, every 8 hours (n = 191 participants) for a minimum of 4 days, up to a maximum of 14 days, with the total duration determined by the treating clinician.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days after randomization. A noninferiority margin of 5% was used.

Results for the patient population indicated a mean age of 66.5 years, with 47.8% being women.

### Cutaneous and systemic adverse reactions to antibiotics [^1155wRDi]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Antibiotics cause a variety of cutaneous and systemic reactions. These reactions can range from mild exanthems to life-threatening toxic epidermal necrolysis. Therefore, it is important for dermatologists to recognize common cutaneous adverse reactions caused by specific antibiotics. This review highlights the clinical features and management of these common adverse reactions to antibiotics.

### Effect of therapeutic drug monitoring-based dose optimization of piperacillin/tazobactam on sepsis-related organ dysfunction in patients with sepsis: a randomized controlled trial [^116ZWfdP]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Emerging evidence suggests that in patients with sepsis, insufficient antibiotic exposure, defined as failure to meet the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target to kill or inhibit the growth of a pathogen, is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Previous studies demonstrated that up to 50% of critically ill patients receiving a β-lactam antibiotic with regimens based on the manufacturers' recommendations fail to reach the target.

Reasons for insufficient antibiotic exposure include both altered pharmacokinetics driven by the pathophysiological changes associated with critical illness and/or reduced antibiotic susceptibility of the pathogen. One approach to optimize exposure to β-lactam antibiotics is administration by prolonged (continuous or extended) infusion. Yet, even with this alternative dosing strategy, not all patients achieve sufficient antibiotic exposure.

- **Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)**: An additional intervention to further optimize PK/PD target attainment of β-lactam antibiotics is TDM-guided therapy. Although there is a strong precedent for TDM to optimize dosing for antibiotics with a narrow therapeutic index to minimize the likelihood of toxicity (e.g. aminoglycosides, glycopeptides), limited data are available regarding the role of TDM of β-lactam antibiotics. Available studies demonstrated an increased PK/PD target attainment when TDM for piperacillin/tazobactam was performed; however, none of the studies reported a difference in clinical outcomes.

### Effect of cefepime/enmetazobactam vs piperacillin/tazobactam on clinical cure and microbiological eradication in patients with complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis: A randomized clinical trial [^114ejPaL]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

The study ALLIUM was published by Keith S Kaye and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA. This study addresses the following diseases: acute pyelonephritis, acute cystitis, and complicated urinary tract infection. The trial question in the ALLIUM study was whether cefepime/enmetazobactam is superior to piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis. The study design was multi-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT).

The population consisted of 1,034 patients, with 568 females and 466 males. The inclusion criteria were adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of complicated UTI or acute pyelonephritis caused by Gram-negative urinary pathogens. Key exclusion criteria included urine culture with gram-positive primary pathogen, hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to trial drugs, weight greater than 180 kg, and life expectancy less than the 6-week study period.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Cefepime/enmetazobactam**: n = 516 (cefepime 2 g/enmetazobactam 0.5 g given by 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days)
	- **Piperacillin/tazobactam**: n = 518 (piperacillin 4 g/tazobactam 0.5 g given by 2-hour infusion every 8 hours for 7 days)

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in overall treatment success at day 14 (79.1% vs. 58.9%; AD 21.2%, 95% CI 14.3 to 27.9).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was no significant difference in clinical cure at day 14 (92.5% vs. 88.9%; AD 3.5%, 95% CI -1 to 8). However, there was a significant increase in microbiological eradication at day 14 (82.9% vs. 64.9%; AD 19%, 95% CI 12.3 to 25.4).

### A national retrospective cohort study comparing the effects of cefepime versus piperacillin-tazobactam on the development of severe acute kidney injury in patients with septic shock [^115FXj2u]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam are commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat patients with potential gram-negative bacterial sepsis. Piperacillin-tazobactam has been associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). However, it has not been compared with cefepime in patients with septic shock. We compared the effects of cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam on the incidence of severe AKI in patients with septic shock.

This was a retrospective, multicenter, inverse probability-of-treatment weighted cohort study conducted in 220 geographically diverse community and teaching hospitals across the United States. Adult patients were included if they had septic shock on hospital admission and received cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam. The proportions of patients in whom stage 3 AKI occurred during hospitalization were compared between groups.

Of the 8,427 patients included in the final cohort, 4,569 received cefepime and 3,858 received piperacillin-tazobactam. Patients had a mean (SD) age of 66.2 (15.2) years, and 45.3% were female. The mean (SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate was 48 (24) mL/min/1.73 m² on the day of admission. In the weighted cohort, stage 3 AKI occurred in 9.9% receiving cefepime and 9.8% receiving piperacillin-tazobactam (odds ratio, 0.98 [95% confidence interval, 0.84–1.15]; P = 0.82). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no significant difference between cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam with regard to renal replacement therapy, in-hospital death, major adverse kidney events, stage 1.

### Effect of meropenem-vaborbactam vs piperacillin-tazobactam on clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication in complicated urinary tract infection: the TANGO I randomized clinical trial [^114umekd]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Meropenem-vaborbactam is a combination carbapenem/beta-lactamase inhibitor and a potential treatment for severe drug-resistant gram-negative infections.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of meropenem-vaborbactam in complicated urinary tract infection (UTI), including acute pyelonephritis.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized clinical trial (TANGO I) conducted from November 2014 to April 2016. It enrolled patients (≥ 18 years) with complicated UTI, stratified by infection type and geographic region.

- **Interventions**: Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive meropenem-vaborbactam (2g/2g over 3 hours; n = 274) or piperacillin-tazobactam (4g/0.5g over 30 minutes; n = 276) every 8 hours. After 15 or more doses, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin if they met prespecified criteria for improvement, completing a total of 10 days of treatment.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint for FDA criteria was overall success, defined as a composite of clinical cure or improvement and microbial eradication at the end of intravenous treatment in the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The primary endpoint for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) criteria was microbial eradication at the test-of-cure visit in the microbiologic modified ITT and microbiologic evaluable populations. The prespecified noninferiority margin was -15%. Since the protocol prespecified superiority testing in the event of noninferiority, two-sided 95% confidence intervals were calculated.

Results among 550 patients were randomized, and 545 received the study drug.

### Antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions and approaches to desensitization [^116LBeSN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Before initiating antibiotic therapy, drug hypersensitivity is an important consideration, and a common strategy is to avoid giving patients medications when there is a high likelihood of severe reactions. With an increase in antibiotic resistance and a decrease in novel antibiotics, there is greater pressure to consider antibiotics in patients with a history of adverse reactions. The major concerns include IgE-mediated, or type I, reactions, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

Some antibiotics with similar characteristics, such as cephalosporins and penicillins, may be given safely to patients with a certain allergy profile. However, there is still greater concern when considering antibiotics for patients with a reported allergy. Desensitization is a strategy to safely induce drug tolerance to a specific drug to limit the possibility of a type I reaction.

### Network-based in silico drug efficacy screening [^112hHKZQ]. Nature Communications (2016). Low credibility.

We compiled drug efficacy information using the adverse event reports submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. A report lists the patient reaction for a given drug and disease, including 'pain', 'nausea', and 'drug ineffective', among many other reactions. We used the openFDA Application Programming Interface (api.fda.gov/drug) to retrieve the adverse reaction information and considered only 204 drug-disease pairs for which there were at least 10 adverse event reports for the most common adverse reaction. We counted the number of reports containing the 'drug ineffective' reaction (n inefficient) and derived a score, RE, by comparing it with the number of most occurring reactions (n top) for that drug-disease pair. The RE is defined as the complement to one of relative inefficacy, where relative inefficacy is the ratio of the number of 'drug ineffective' reports to the number of most common adverse event reports, hence:

The RE takes values between 0 (poorest efficacy, 'drug ineffective' reports are the most common reports) and 1 (there is no 'drug ineffective' report associated with this drug-disease pair). For instance, among the reports containing atorvastatin and arteriosclerosis, 'myalgia' was the most common reaction with 13 occurrences, and there were two reports containing 'drug ineffective', yielding RE = 0.85. When multiple drugs are reported in the same entry, the observed reactions may not be due to all drugs. Nevertheless, RE still provides a reasonable proxy for the efficacy of the drug. In addition to the drug names provided in DrugBank, synonyms and brand names are considered.

### Ceftazidime, carbapenems, or piperacillin-tazobactam as single definitive therapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infection: A multisite retrospective study [^117CWzji]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The optimal antibiotic regimen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia is controversial. Although β-lactam monotherapy is common, data to guide the choice between antibiotics are scarce. We aimed to compare ceftazidime, carbapenems, and piperacillin-tazobactam as definitive monotherapy.

- **Methods**: A multinational retrospective study was conducted across 9 countries and 25 centers, including 767 hospitalized patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia treated with β-lactam monotherapy during 2009–2015. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Univariate and multivariate, including propensity-adjusted, analyses were conducted, introducing monotherapy type as an independent variable.

- **Results**: Thirty-day mortality was as follows: 37/213 (17.4%) for the ceftazidime group, 42/210 (20%) for the carbapenem group, and 55/344 (16%) for the piperacillin-tazobactam group. The type of monotherapy was not significantly associated with mortality in either univariate, multivariate, or propensity-adjusted analyses (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–2.46, for ceftazidime; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.67–2.51, for piperacillin-tazobactam, with carbapenems as reference in propensity-adjusted multivariate analysis; 542 patients). No significant difference between antibiotics was demonstrated for clinical failure, microbiological failure, or adverse events. Isolation of P. aeruginosa with new resistance to antipseudomonal drugs was significantly more frequent with carbapenems (36/206 [17.5%]) versus ceftazidime (25/201 [12.4%]) and piperacillin-tazobactam (28/332 [8.4%]) (P = 0.007).

### Assessing the effect of piperacillin/tazobactam on hematological parameters in patients admitted with moderate or severe foot infections [^11255CAW]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

There are several limitations. Hematological abnormalities, including pancytopenia, are reported to occur very rarely with the administration of piperacillin/tazobactam. The incidence has not been determined; the manufacturer states the frequency of this adverse effect is unknown, and the UK British National Formulary suggests it occurs very rarely. Evidence linking these abnormalities to piperacillin/tazobactam is largely comprised of case studies, which also imply that this adverse effect is uncommon. Therefore, with a sample size of 154 patients, detecting this rare event may be very difficult. A larger, potentially multicenter cohort is required to more accurately determine any correlation between piperacillin/tazobactam administration and the development of hematological abnormalities.

The present study followed patients for 14 days post-administration of piperacillin/tazobactam, with no longer-term follow-up performed. Evidence suggests that the correlation is dose- and duration-dependent. However, it is possible that hematological abnormalities associated with the antibiotic occurred after the follow-up period, although this has not been reported. Assessing this possibility is difficult, as blood results are not routinely taken after this time. Because the mean length of administration was less than 6 days, and blood was taken up to 8 days later, with almost all results normalizing by then, development of piperacillin/tazobactam-induced hematological abnormality beyond that time is considered unlikely.

The following serious adverse reactions are described in greater detail in the warnings and precautions section:

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: See warnings and precautions (5.1) for more details.
- **Seizures and other central nervous system adverse reactions**: Refer to warnings and precautions (5.2).
- **Increased seizure potential due to interaction with valproic acid**: Additional information is available in warnings and precautions (5.3).
- **Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD)**: Consult warnings and precautions (5.4) for further information.

Because clinical trials experience is conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **Overview of the safety evaluation of Recarbrio**: Safety was primarily evaluated in three active-controlled, double-blind trials in HABP/VABP, cUTI, and cIAI (Trials 1, 2, and 3, respectively).

	- In the HABP/VABP trial (Trial 1), patients were treated with either Recarbrio or piperacillin and tazobactam (4.5 grams).

	- In the cUTI trial (Trial 2) and cIAI trial (Trial 3), patients in the treatment arms were treated with either imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg and relebactam 250 mg or imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg and relebactam 125 mg (not an approved dose). Patients in the control arm were treated with imipenem 500 mg/cilastatin 500 mg plus placebo (IV normal saline). Across Trials 2 and 3, the mean duration of IV therapy in patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin plus relebactam 250 mg was approximately…
