## Question

with a calcium score of 0 when do you repeat and what is follow up?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate timing for repeating a coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan and the recommended clinical follow-up for a patient with a CAC score of 0. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the prognostic meaning of CAC = 0 and how it should influence statin decisions. Then, I should verify the recommended repeat intervals by baseline ASCVD risk category and reconcile any guideline differences. Next, I will review exceptions where CAC = 0 does not fully de-risk and may warrant earlier reassessment. After that, I should outline lifestyle and risk-factor management while off statins. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a practical, risk-stratified plan with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the prognostic significance of CAC = 0. CAC = 0 is the strongest negative risk marker in primary prevention, with very low near-term ASCVD event rates and excellent long-term survival, often described as conferring a "warranty period" of roughly 10–15 years in low-to-intermediate risk adults, though this warranty is not absolute and must be interpreted in clinical context [^112Kdmcw] [^116kwTP5] [^112xqA6r]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of risk reduction: pooled analyses show a summary risk ratio around 0.20–0.29 for CVD events with CAC = 0 compared with CAC > 0, reinforcing its de-risking value in decision-making [^112xqA6r] [^117QXGEG].

> Now, how should CAC = 0 guide statin therapy decisions? I need to ensure I align with guidelines. In adults 40–75 years without diabetes, active smoking, or premature ASCVD family history, it is reasonable to defer statins when CAC = 0 and the baseline ASCVD risk is borderline to intermediate, given the minimal short-to-intermediate term absolute risk reduction and high number needed to treat; this should be framed within shared decision-making and periodic reassessment of risk factors [^114zUrqi] [^1179eaRq] [^116UNdVo]. Wait, let me verify the NNT point: for CAC = 0, projected NNT with rosuvastatin over 5.6 years is about 206, compared with approximately 50 when CAC ≥ 100, underscoring limited near-term benefit at zero calcium [^114zUrqi].

> Next, I should review repeat-interval recommendations by risk tier. The National Lipid Association recommends repeating CAC in 5–7 years for low-risk patients (< 5% 10-year ASCVD risk), 3–5 years for borderline-to-intermediate risk (5–19.9%), and about 3 years for high-risk patients or those with diabetes, provided results would change management. This aligns with MESA-derived conversion dynamics and expert consensus from SCCT [^112dUV5J] [^111GjZ1P] [^1128wovr]. Hold on, I should double-check the conversion data: in MESA, approximately 20–25% of low-risk individuals convert from 0 to > 0 over 5–7 years, whereas borderline-to-intermediate risk patients convert at 3–5 years, and high-risk or diabetic patients convert more rapidly, supporting the shorter intervals in those groups [^1125vE1x] [^115y3cJw].

> But wait, what if the baseline risk is very high — does CAC = 0 still allow deferral? I need to check guideline caveats. ACC/AHA advises that CAC = 0 should not be used to downclassify risk in the presence of diabetes, active smoking, premature ASCVD family history, or possibly chronic inflammatory conditions; in these settings, statin therapy may still be indicated despite CAC = 0, and repeat intervals may be shortened to about 3 years given faster plaque conversion dynamics [^116UNdVo] [^112dUV5J]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied a blanket 3-year interval for everyone with diabetes; I should confirm that the 3-year interval is a reasonable minimum for high-risk phenotypes, including diabetes, rather than a rigid mandate, and still anchored in shared decision-making [^112dUV5J] [^1128wovr].

> I will now examine lifestyle and risk-factor management while off statins. Even with CAC = 0, optimal control of blood pressure, lipids, weight, glucose, and smoking cessation remains essential; the absence of calcified plaque does not negate lifetime risk from traditional risk factors, and adherence to comprehensive risk-factor optimization is critical to maintain the low-risk state [^1159X7tP] [^113PuH7U]. Let me reconsider whether any imaging follow-up is needed: routine periodic CAC reassessment is not indicated unless it is time for the planned interval based on baseline risk, symptoms emerge, or risk enhancers accrue, reinforcing a lifestyle-first approach in the interim [^112dUV5J] [^1159X7tP].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases. In adults with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL), CAC = 0 does not obviate the need for long-term, aggressive LDL-C lowering; CAC can refine near-term risk, but guideline-directed therapy remains indicated regardless of calcium status, so I need to ensure I do not over-interpret a zero calcium score here [^111eUEqq] [^1178gxeK]. In symptomatic patients, CAC = 0 lowers the likelihood of obstructive CAD but does not exclude noncalcified plaque; CCTA may be preferable when pretest probability is not low, and the negative predictive value of CAC = 0 declines with younger age, so I should be cautious in under-40 patients with symptoms [^116RRoyq] [^113sDt6s]. For adults older than 75, CAC = 0 can support a decision to avoid initiating statins when the overall risk-benefit is uncertain, but this must be individualized and contextualized with comorbidity and patient preferences [^113Ckeum] [^113xxVGB].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical, risk-stratified plan and make sure it is actionable. For low-risk patients with CAC = 0, defer statins, reinforce lifestyle, and repeat CAC in 5–7 years. For borderline-to-intermediate risk, consider deferring statins if no major risk enhancers are present and repeat in 3–5 years. For high-risk or diabetic patients, consider statins despite CAC = 0 and repeat in about 3 years, with shared decision-making documented throughout [^112dUV5J] [^1179eaRq] [^116UNdVo]. I should confirm that any repeat testing is justified by the likelihood it will change management; if the patient is already on high-intensity therapy with excellent risk-factor control, routine early repeat CAC is unlikely to alter care and can be deferred to the standard interval [^112dUV5J] [^1156zrjE].

> Finally, I need to ensure the patient understands uncertainties and the "warranty" concept. I should explain that CAC = 0 confers very low near-term risk but is not a guarantee of zero plaque or zero events, especially in younger patients or those with risk enhancers. This is why interval reassessment and ongoing risk-factor optimization are integral to the plan, and why the decision to defer statins today can be revisited as risk evolves over time [^113PuH7U] [^114KprZm] [^116UNdVo]. Let me double-check that shared decision-making is emphasized in guidelines for borderline and intermediate risk, which it is, and that documentation of patient values and preferences is recommended when using CAC to refine prevention decisions [^113pTD23] [^116nrs4d].

For a patient with a CAC score of 0, **repeat CAC in 3–5 years** if the patient is at intermediate risk (5–19.9% 10-year ASCVD risk), and in **5–7 years** if at low risk (< 5%) [^112dUV5J] [^111GjZ1P]. For high-risk patients or those with diabetes, **repeat at 3 years** [^112dUV5J] [^1156zrjE]. Management should focus on **lifestyle and risk-factor control** [^1159X7tP]; statins are generally not indicated unless diabetes, smoking, or family history of premature ASCVD are present [^116UNdVo] [^114zUrqi]. If symptoms develop or risk enhancers emerge, reassess earlier and consider further testing [^116RRoyq].

## Recommended follow-up intervals for repeat CAC scoring

The timing of repeat CAC scoring **depends on baseline ASCVD risk** [^112dUV5J]:

| **Risk category** | **Recommended repeat interval** |
|-|-|
| Low risk (< 5% 10-year ASCVD risk) | 5–7 years [^112dUV5J] [^111GjZ1P] |
| Borderline to intermediate risk (5–19.9% 10-year ASCVD risk) | 3–5 years [^112dUV5J] [^1156zrjE] |
| High risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or diabetes | 3 years [^112dUV5J] [^1156zrjE] |

---

These intervals balance the **low short-term risk** associated with a CAC score of 0 [^112xqA6r] against the **potential for future calcification** and the need to reassess risk [^1125vE1x].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up recommendations

### Lifestyle modifications and risk factor management

Patients with a CAC score of 0 should **prioritize lifestyle and risk-factor control** [^1159X7tP]:

- **Diet**: Emphasize a heart-healthy diet (e.g. Mediterranean or DASH) [^notfound].
- **Exercise**: Encourage regular physical activity (≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise) [^notfound].
- **Weight management**: Maintain a healthy BMI [^113PuH7U].
- **Blood pressure**: Monitor and control blood pressure [^notfound].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly advise quitting if applicable [^113PuH7U].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

Statins are generally **not indicated** for patients with a CAC score of 0 unless additional risk enhancers are present (e.g. diabetes, smoking, family history of premature ASCVD) [^1179eaRq] [^114zUrqi]. If these enhancers are present, **initiate statin therapy** according to guideline-directed care [^111urNer].

---

### Monitoring and reassessment

Regular clinical follow-up should occur **every 1–2 years** to monitor cardiovascular risk factors and reassess the need for pharmacotherapy [^116nrs4d]. Repeat CAC scoring should follow the intervals above, adjusted to changes in risk status or clinical presentation [^112dUV5J].

---

## Prognostic significance of a CAC score of 0

A CAC score of 0 is associated with a **very low short-term cardiovascular risk** [^111FBhAF]. Long-term data show a 10-year cardiovascular event rate of approximately 1–2% [^112xqA6r], supporting a "warranty period" of about 10–15 years for low-to-intermediate risk patients [^116kwTP5]. However, this does not negate the importance of continued risk-factor management and periodic reassessment [^1159X7tP].

---

## Factors influencing repeat CAC scoring intervals

Several factors **influence the timing** of repeat CAC scoring:

- **Age**: Younger patients may have longer intervals due to lower baseline risk.
- **Gender**: Women may have slightly longer intervals due to lower baseline risk.
- **Ethnicity**: Baseline risk and CAC prevalence vary by ethnicity, influencing intervals [^notfound].
- **Clinical risk factors**: Presence of diabetes, smoking, or family history may warrant shorter intervals [^112dUV5J].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting earlier repeat CAC scoring

Earlier repeat CAC scoring may be warranted in the following scenarios:

- **New-onset symptoms**: Chest pain, dyspnea, or other cardiovascular symptoms [^notfound].
- **Significant changes in risk factors**: New diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, or significant lipid abnormalities [^1159X7tP].
- **Family history**: New diagnosis of premature ASCVD in family members [^notfound].
- **Patient preference**: Strong patient preference for earlier reassessment after shared decision-making [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Non-calcified plaques**: A CAC score of 0 does not exclude non-calcified plaques, which can still cause events [^116UNdVo].
- **Radiation exposure**: Minimal but present; consider cumulative exposure over time [^113PuH7U].
- **Cost**: Typically not covered by insurance, requiring patient payment [^111TAAZh].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Low risk (< 5% 10-year ASCVD risk)**: Repeat CAC in 5–7 years [^112dUV5J].
- **Borderline to intermediate risk (5–19.9% 10-year ASCVD risk)**: Repeat CAC in 3–5 years [^112dUV5J].
- **High risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) or diabetes**: Repeat CAC in 3 years [^112dUV5J].
- **Lifestyle and risk factor management**: Emphasize lifestyle and risk-factor control; consider statins only if risk enhancers are present [^1159X7tP] [^1179eaRq].
- **Earlier reassessment**: Consider earlier reassessment if symptoms develop or risk factors change significantly [^112sHWKn].

---

A CAC score of 0 indicates **very low short-term cardiovascular risk** [^111FBhAF]; repeat CAC scoring should be individualized based on baseline ASCVD risk, with intervals ranging from 3 to 7 years. Management should focus on lifestyle and risk-factor control, with pharmacotherapy considered only if additional risk enhancers are present [^1159X7tP].

### Coronary artery calcium scanning: clinical paradigms for cardiac risk assessment and treatment [^1141k4N3]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scanning is being increasingly used for cardiac risk assessment in asymptomatic patients, particularly in those with a Framingham 10-year risk of 10% to 20%. Physician awareness of this technology and its appropriate uses and limitations is crucial to appropriate use.

Methods

With the goal of establishing clinical paradigms, this document integrates the results of key published articles, Framingham Risk Score, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Plan III guidelines, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association exercise testing and angiographic guidelines, and the authors' extensive clinical experience.

Results

Coronary artery calcium scanning is best used in the asymptomatic population with a 10% to 20% risk of cardiac events over 10 years, with selected application in higher and lower risk categories. In the 10%-20% risk patient, coronary artery calcium scores > 100 or > 75th percentile for age and sex transform the moderately high-risk patient to higher risk status with the attendant recommendation for more aggressive therapy; scores from 11 to 100 and < 75th percentile are consistent with the 10%-20% 10-year risk status and scores from 0 to 10 and < 75th percentile convert the patient to lesser risk categories. If stress testing is planned in the asymptomatic patient, it should be preceded by coronary artery calcium scanning and performed only for scores > 400; it should always precede coronary angiography in these patients.

Conclusions

Coronary artery calcium scanning is an important risk assessment tool with direct clinical applications; it is of particular utility in the Framingham 10%-20% 10-year risk population.

### Coronary calcium score and cardiovascular risk [^1136soUb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a highly specific feature of coronary atherosclerosis. On the basis of single-center and multicenter clinical and population-based studies with short-term and long-term outcomes data (up to 15-year follow-up), CAC scoring has emerged as a widely available, consistent, and reproducible means of assessing risk for major cardiovascular outcomes, especially useful in asymptomatic people for planning primary prevention interventions such as statins and aspirin. CAC testing in asymptomatic populations is cost effective across a broad range of baseline risk. This review summarizes evidence concerning CAC, including its pathobiology, modalities for detection, predictive role, use in prediction scoring algorithms, CAC progression, evidence that CAC changes the clinical approach to the patient and patient behavior, novel applications of CAC, future directions in scoring CAC scans, and new CAC guidelines.

### Coronary artery calcium and the age-specific competing risk of cardiovascular versus cancer mortality: the coronary artery calcium consortium [^113UdkQV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a guideline recommended cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification tool that increases with age and is associated with non-cardiovascular disease outcomes including cancer. We sought to define the age-specific change in the association between CAC and cause-specific mortality.

Methods

The Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium includes 59,502 asymptomatic patients age 40–75 without known CVD. Age-stratified mortality rates and parametric survival regression modeling was performed to estimate the age-specific CAC score at which CVD and cancer mortality risk were equal.

Results

The mean age was 54 ± 8 years (67% men) and there were 2,423 deaths over a mean 12 ± 3 years follow-up. Among individuals with CAC = 0, cancer was the leading cause of death, with low CVD mortality rates for both younger (40–54 years) 0.2/1,000 person-years and older participants (65–75 years) 1.3/1,000 person-years. When CAC ≥ 400, CVD was consistently the leading cause of death among younger (71% of deaths) and older participants (56% of deaths). The CAC score at which CVD overtook cancer as the leading cause of death increased exponentially with age and was approximately 115 at age 50 and 380 at age 65.

Conclusions

Regardless of age, when CAC = 0 cancer was the leading cause of death and the cardiovascular disease mortality rate was low. Our age-specific estimate for the CAC score at which CVD overtakes cancer mortality allows for a more precise approach to synergistic prediction and prevention strategies for CVD and cancer.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score–based treatment in the 5–20% ASCVD risk group is stratified as follows: score 0 (very low) — statin not recommended; 1–99 (mildly increased) — moderate intensity statin if < 75th%; moderate to high intensity if > 75th%; 100–299 (moderately increased) — moderate to high intensity statin + ASA 81 mg; and > 300 (moderate to severely increased) — high intensity statin + ASA 81 mg, with the footnote a Excluding familial hypercholesterolemia.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111F6Net]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement — intermediate-risk adults and statin decision thresholds: In adults at intermediate risk, coronary artery calcium measurement can be effective for meaningfully reclassifying risk in a large proportion of individuals, and in such intermediate-risk adults, those with coronary artery calcium = 100 AU or coronary artery calcium ≥ 75th percentile have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event rates for which initiation of statin therapy is reasonable. Those with coronary artery calcium scores of zero appear to have 10-year event rates in a lower range for which statin therapy may be of limited value. For those with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99 AU, 10-year ASCVD event rates are 3.8%, 6.5%, and 8.3% for adults 45 to 54, 55 to 64, and 65 to 74 years of age, respectively, indicating that risk reclassification is modest for individuals with scores of 1 to 99; therefore, for patients with coronary artery calcium scores of 1 to 99, it is reasonable to repeat the risk discussion, and if these patients remain untreated, repeat CAC measurement in 5 years may have some value, but data are limited.

SCCT expert consensus — indications, rescanning intervals, and treatment by CAC strata: CAC testing is considered in asymptomatic individuals without clinical ASCVD who are 40–75 years and in the 5–20% 10-year ASCVD risk group and selectively in the < 5% group (e.g., family history of premature coronary artery disease). For follow-up, repeat CAC scanning at 5 years for 0 CAC and 3–5 years for > 0 CAC when results would alter preventive management. In the 5–20% ASCVD risk group, CAC = 0: statin not recommended; CAC 1–99: moderate intensity statin if < 75th percentile and moderate to high intensity statin if ≥ 75th percentile; CAC 100–299: moderate to high intensity statin + ASA 81 mg; CAC ≥ 300: high-intensity statin + ASA 81 mg.

### Is there a role for coronary artery calcium scoring for management of asymptomatic patients at risk for coronary artery disease? clinical risk scores are not sufficient to define primary prevention treatment strategies among asymptomatic patients [^114yJ9C3]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Although risk factors have proven to be useful therapeutic targets, they are poor predictors of risk. Traditional risk scores are moderately successful in predicting future CHD events and can be a starting place for general risk categorization. However, there is substantial heterogeneity between traditional risk and actual atherosclerosis burden, with event rates predominantly driven by burden of atherosclerosis. Serum biomarkers have yet to show any clinically significant incremental value to the FRS and even when combined cannot match the predictive value of atherosclerosis imaging. As clinicians, are we willing to base therapy decisions on risk models that lack optimum-achievable accuracy and limit personalization? The decision to treat a patient in primary prevention must be a careful one because the benefit of therapy in an asymptomatic patient must clearly outweigh the potential risk. CAC, in particular, provides a personalized assessment of risk and may identify patients who will be expected to derive the most, and the least, net absolute benefit from treatment. Emerging evidence hints that CAC may also promote long-term adherence to aspirin, exercise, diet, and statin therapy. When potentially lifelong treatment decisions are on the line, clinicians must arm their patients with the most accurate risk prediction tools, and subclinical atherosclerosis testing with CAC is, at the present time, superior to any combination of risk factors and serum biomarkers.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^112hXRYe]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression and measurement principles: CAC scores increase by approximately 20–25% per year, and the Agatston score generally increases exponentially with scores in the range of 0–100 providing the greatest risk discrimination compared to higher scores; CAC should be measured only if such measurement will change treatment decisions and CAC does not regress; CAC progression cannot be used to measure the efficacy of statin therapy (statins modestly increase the CAC score); and in individuals undergoing repeat testing, progression of > 20–25% per year or an increase to a score of ≥ 400 after a previous CAC score > 0 is consistent with accelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) progression.

### Relation of absence of coronary artery calcium to cardiovascular disease mortality risk among individuals meeting criteria for statin therapy according to the 2018 / 2019 ACC / AHA guidelines [^114Gcn8f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines resulted in broad recommendations for preventive statin therapy allocation in patients without known cardiovascular disease (CVD). Subsequent studies demonstrated significant heterogeneity of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk across the primary prevention population. In 2018/2019, the guidelines were revised to optimize risk assessment and cholesterol management. We sought to evaluate the heterogeneity of risk in statin-recommended patients, using coronary artery calcium (CAC) according to 2018/2019 ACC/AHA guidelines in a primary prevention cohort. We evaluated 5,800 statin-naive patients aged 40 to 75 years without known coronary heart disease from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center study cohort. All participants underwent clinical CAC scoring for risk stratification and were followed for all-cause and CVD-specific mortality. A total of 181 deaths occurred including 54 CVD deaths over a follow-up of 9.5 years. Overall, 1,939 participants would have been recommended statin therapy, 32% of whom had no detectable CAC. CAC = 0 participants had the lowest all-cause and CVD mortality rates in both statin-recommended and nonrecommended groups (0.2 and 0.4 CVD deaths per 1,000 person-years, respectively). Absence of CAC in statin-naive patients portends an approximately 12-fold lower CVD mortality (0.2% vs 2.4%) in those recommended for statin therapy compared with any CAC present. In conclusion, in a cohort of patients meeting the 2018/2019 ACC/AHA guidelines for statin therapy for primary prevention, there was a marked heterogeneity of CAC scores, with about one-third of the statin recommended population having no detectable CAC (CAC = 0) with a significantly lower CVD mortality compared with CAC > 0.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^115bKSgs]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Metabolic syndrome without diabetes — coronary artery calcium (CAC) can refine ASCVD risk among those at low or intermediate Pooled Cohort Equations risk. The 2018 Cholesterol Guideline identifies the metabolic syndrome as an ASCVD risk enhancer favoring statin initiation or intensification in those at 5–19.9% 10-year ASCVD risk, and about one third of adults have the metabolic syndrome. In MESA, 44.8% with metabolic syndrome but no diabetes had CAC = 0 with 10-year ASCVD risk < 5% whereas those with CAC > 0 had a 10-year ASCVD risk averaging at least 10% or higher. Thus, CAC may be of use in risk stratification in those with the metabolic syndrome.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^116NZWUA]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

An Expert Panel of the National Lipid Association reviewed the evidence related to the use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in clinical practice for adults seen for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Recommendations for optimal use of this test in adults of various races/ethnicities, ages and multiple domains of primary prevention, including those with a 10-year ASCVD risk < 20%, those with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome, and those with severe hypercholesterolemia were provided. Recommendations were also made on optimal timing for repeat calcium scoring after an initial test, use of CAC scoring in those taking statins, and its role in informing the clinician patient discussion on the benefit of aspirin and anti-hypertensive drug therapy. Finally, a vision is provided for the future of coronary calcium scoring.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111urNer]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. In patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk), in risk discussion, the presence of risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When CAC is measured to inform treatment, if the coronary artery calcium score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years when higher-risk conditions are absent; if the coronary artery calcium score is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; and if the coronary artery calcium score is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Evaluation of the incremental value of a coronary artery calcium score beyond traditional cardiovascular risk assessment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112tzkGm]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) are used to help assess patients' cardiovascular status and risk. However, their best use in risk assessment beyond traditional cardiovascular factors in primary prevention is uncertain.

Objective

To find, assess, and synthesize all cohort studies that assessed the incremental gain from the addition of a CACS to a standard cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk calculator (or CVD risk factors for a standard calculator), that is, comparing CVD risk score plus CACS with CVD risk score alone.

Evidence Review

Eligible studies needed to be cohort studies in primary prevention populations that used 1 of the CVD risk calculators recommended by national guidelines (Framingham Risk Score, QRISK, pooled cohort equation, NZ PREDICT, NORRISK, or SCORE) and assessed and reported incremental discrimination with CACS for estimating the risk of a future cardiovascular event.

Findings

From 2772 records screened, 6 eligible cohort studies were identified (with 1043 CVD events in 17 961 unique participants) from the US (n = 3), the Netherlands (n = 1), Germany (n = 1), and South Korea (n = 1). Studies varied in size from 470 to 5185 participants (range of mean [SD] ages, 50 [10] to 75.1 [7.3] years; 38.4%-59.4% were women). The C statistic for the CVD risk models without CACS ranged from 0.693 (95% CI, 0.661–0.726) to 0.80. The pooled gain in C statistic from adding CACS was 0.036 (95% CI, 0.020–0.052). Among participants classified as being at low risk by the risk score and reclassified as at intermediate or high risk by CACS, 85.5% (65 of 76) to 96.4% (349 of 362) did not have a CVD event during follow-up (range, 5.1–10.0 years). Among participants classified as being at high risk by the risk score and reclassified as being at low risk by CACS, 91.4% (202 of 221) to 99.2% (502 of 506) did not have a CVD event during follow-up.

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that the CACS appears to add some further discrimination to the traditional CVD risk assessment equations used in these studies, which appears to be relatively consistent across studies. However, the modest gain may often be outweighed by costs, rates of incidental findings, and radiation risks. Although the CACS may have a role for refining risk assessment in selected patients, which patients would benefit remains unclear. At present, no evidence suggests that adding CACS to traditional risk scores provides clinical benefit.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^115o4LbU]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Shared decision making (SDM) and CAC-guided risk refinement — An essential tenet of patient-centered imaging is that patients have a clear understanding of the benefits and risks of an imaging test in an SDM discussion, and the 2013 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guideline was the first guideline to strongly emphasize the importance of SDM before initiating statin therapy to discuss patient preferences, adverse effects, and the potential for ASCVD risk reduction benefits. Because of the issues with risk factor-based risk prediction, physicians may wish to refine treatment decisions based on CAC. The most widespread application is likely to be in the 10-year ASCVD 15–20% risk group in which CAC = 0 and a low CAC scores would largely refine risk downward to lowest or low strata. In the 10-year ASCVD 5–15% risk group, downward risk reclassification may be considered with 0 or low CAC scores. There is little role for risk reclassification in the 10-year ASCVD > 20% risk group, other than to provide persuasive confirmation of high risk in patients reluctant to take statins or to provide reassurance to those who are statin intolerant if they have 0 or low risk CAC. In the 10-year ASCVD < 5% risk group, a 0 or low CAC score would confirm low risk status and higher scores would identify those targeted for a greater intensity of lifestyle recommendations and treatment.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) serial scanning and intervals in asymptomatic adults — index CAC = 0 vs > 0: A subset of patients may prefer to defer statin treatment especially if the CAC = 0. In a cohort undergoing annual CAC scanning, 422 patients with a baseline CAC score of 0 (66.4% on statin therapy) were followed for 5 consecutive years or until conversion to CAC > 0, with an overall conversion rate from 0 to > 0 CAC of 25.1% and a mean time to conversion of 4.1 ± 0.9 years; other data have been consistent with a 3–5 year range. Expert consensus states it may be appropriate to consider repeat CAC scanning at an interval of 5 years for patients with 0 CAC and a 3–5-year interval for patients with > 0 CAC. For index CAC > 0, serial evaluation may also be reasonable among patients with a CAC score of 100 or higher, and MESA data suggests that the average time to symptom-driven intervention was ~4 years.

Repeat coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring — prognosis by serial CAC and expected conversion rates — Heinz Nixdorf Recall assessed CAC progression and ASCVD events a mean of 7.2 years after two serial CAC scans done 5.1 years apart and found that those with CAC = 0 on both examinations had a 10-year risk of hard cardiovascular events of 0.2%; baseline CAC 1–399 with follow-up < 400 had 10-year hard CVD 5.2% and total CVD 9.1%; baseline 1–399 with follow-up ≥ 400 had a 10-year risk of 19.1%; and baseline CAC ≥ 400 had a 10-year CVD risk of 13.5% and total CVD events of 30.9%. Strongly accelerated CAC progression was associated with higher overall mortality and CV events. In MESA after an initial CAC = 0, the warranty period varies by age, sex, baseline cardiovascular risk, and the desired yield of testing; in low risk patients (< 5% 10-year risk), about 20–25% will develop newly detected CAC in 5–7 years; in borderline to intermediate risk (5–19.9% 10-year risk), 20–25% develop new CAC > 0 in approximately 3–5 years; and in high risk (> 20% 10-year risk), 20–25% develop CAC in 3 years; the diabetes sub-group develops new CAC at a faster rate compared to those without diabetes, with rates similar to the general high-risk population with 10-year ASCVD risk > 20%.

### A 15-year warranty period for asymptomatic individuals without coronary artery calcium: a prospective follow-up of 9, 715 individuals [^116kwTP5]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to examine the long-term prognosis in asymptomatic individuals with a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 0 and its associated warranty period.

Background

Emerging evidence supports a CAC score of 0 as a favorable cardiovascular short-to intermediate-term prognostic factor.

Methods

A total of 9,715 individuals undergoing CAC imaging were stratified by age, Framingham risk score (FRS), and National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) categories and followed for a mean of 14.6 years (range 12.9 to 16.8 years). Cox regression, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, and net reclassification information were used to assess all-cause mortality, discrimination, and reclassification of a CAC score of 0 compared with the FRS and NCEP ATP III, respectively. A warranty period was pre-defined as < 1% annual mortality rate. Vascular age was estimated by linear regression.

Results

In 4,864 individuals with a baseline CAC score of 0 (mean age, 52.1 ± 10.8 years; 57.9% male), 229 deaths occurred. The warranty period of a CAC score of 0 was almost 15 years for individuals at low and intermediate risk with no significant differences regarding age and sex. A CAC score of 0 was associated with a vascular age of 1, 10, 20, and 30 years less than the chronological age of individuals between 50 and 59, 60 and 69, 70 and 79, and 80 years of age and older, respectively. The CAC score was the strongest predictor of death (hazard ratio: 2.67, 95% confidence interval: 2.29 to 3.11) that enabled discrimination and consistent reclassification beyond the FRS (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.71 vs. 0.64, p < 0.001) and NCEP ATP III (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve: 0.72 vs. 0.64, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

A CAC score of 0 confers a 15-year warranty period against mortality in individuals at low to intermediate risk that is unaffected by age or sex. Furthermore, in individuals considered at high risk by clinical risk scores, a CAC score of 0 confers better survival than in individuals at low to intermediate risk but with any CAC score.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) prognostic evidence in asymptomatic individuals — the review notes that since 2010 a synthesis of evidence reveals further validation of the prognostic utility of CAC in asymptomatic individuals; across 7 registries, the cumulative sample size is 84,182 with outcomes including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, late revascularization ≥ 3 months after scanning, and composite MACE; reported associations include relative risk ratios as high as 20 times greater for high risk CAC scores compared with a CAC score of 0; follow-up has been extended with mortality data beyond 10 years after CAC scanning, and analyses compare event risk among those with 0 CAC versus detectable CAC.

### Coronary artery calcium staging to guide preventive interventions: a proposal and call to action [^111oq1wk]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

When the CAC score indicates moderate atherosclerosis (CAC 100–299) or the score is > 75th percentile, lifetime risk and short-term risk are elevated, and more aggressive risk factor modification and statin (+nonstatin) therapy as needed to achieve an LDL-C goal < 70 mg/dL should be considered. Aspirin is recommended by numerous guidelines and expert consensus documents when CAC is > 100, as the risk-benefit ratio becomes favorable at that cutpoint. Further, serial monitoring of all risk factors to ensure targets are met is advised, as these patients have a 10-fold increased risk of ASCVD events as compared with those without CAC present (score of zero).

Once the CAC score is 300 or greater, the risk of a myocardial infarction is similar to that of a myocardial infarction survivor, thus high-intensity statin and aspirin therapy should be considered, and other therapies that have been mostly reserved for secondary prevention (eg, GLP1 RA, icosapent ethyl, colchicine) should also be considered as appropriate for the individual. Such patients are considered very high risk and should be targeted with statin and nonstatin therapy as needed to achieve an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL. Scores > 1,000 carry even higher risk, and warrant even greater risk reduction (ie, LDL-C < 55 mg/dL).

The Working Group recognizes that, while evidence for the association of risk of events with CAC is overwhelming, the benefit of preventive therapy based upon CAC severity is not yet fully established. Our goal is to improve implementation of existing guidelines and expert consensus with the proposed staging system and serve as a call to action. Yet CAC staging will only be useful if CAC testing is performed. Most health insurance plans do not cover CAC testing. Importantly, the lack of access to this test exacerbates health disparities in ASCVD risk assessment. Compared with municipalities where CAC testing is available, those without CAC testing have lower socioeconomic status, more non-White residents, and lower life expectancies. A study in Cleveland found that when all costs for CAC scans were eliminated, testing increased among women, Black individuals, and lower income patients with a concomitant improvement in reclassification of statin eligibility, preventive interventions, and risk factor control. We call upon payers and health systems to recognize the utility of CAC testing and reduce barriers to its use so that subclinical coronary disease can be detected and preventive interventions implemented in patients at risk before they suffer irreversible consequences.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^115esnyC]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions — clinical utility of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring state that CAC scoring is a widely available, safe, cost-effective, rapidly performed test that improves discrimination of those at risk for ASCVD and serves to better reclassify risk, when used in conjunction with global risk scoring systems, than other clinically available tools, and that its predictive value has been consistently demonstrated in men and women of all studied races and ethnicities. The statement notes that while there have been no large, prospective randomized controlled ASCVD outcomes trials that utilized CAC scores as entry criteria, the evidence base supporting the clinical use of CAC scoring in primary prevention continues to grow and points to its valuable role to aid in the allocation of preventive therapies to those most likely to benefit, and that with the advent of future refinements and increased access based on lower cost and greater insurance coverage, more clinicians will be able to utilize this powerful tool to provide higher quality preventive care for their patients.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) healthcare coverage and cost considerations indicate CAC is a nontraditional risk marker per USPSTF, is largely governed by local coverage policies with some policies in ~35 states, and most patients pay out-of-pocket costs of $75-$150; CAC is often bundled with traditional risk factor measurement, self-pay disadvantages high-risk patients with limited means, low socioeconomic strata have higher traditional risk factor burden and higher MACE risk, and expanded coverage beyond traditional risk factor testing is emphasized alongside the benefit of improved adherence to preventive care.

### Association of coronary artery calcium with long-term, cause-specific mortality among young adults [^116w75ar]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

CAC Testing Among Younger Adults

The recent 2018 cholesterol guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend CAC scoring for intermediate-risk (10-year CVD risk, ≥ 7.5% to < 20%) individuals who are uncertain about their decision to start statin therapy. Prior analyses have suggested that, for individuals who are uncertain about statin use, CAC testing may be the best option to determine the magnitude of the potential benefit from statin therapy. In addition, CAC scoring has been proposed to help determine an individual's likelihood of benefit from aspirin as well as antihypertensive therapy.

Our data suggest that the clinical utility of CAC testing may extend to select younger adults, mainly those at elevated lifetime risk for CVD and uncertainty regarding treatment decisions. Even for individuals in their 30s, despite their young age, approximately 1 in 5 had CAC. Women were less likely to have CAC; therefore, CAC scoring for young women should be considered cautiously given the low likelihood of a positive finding. However, given the exponential nature of CAC progression, the presumed high lifetime risk of individuals with CAC, and the general safety and inexpensive nature of most preventive medications, considering tailored preventive pharmacotherapy in the context of a clinician-patient risk discussion appears reasonable for young men and women with any CAC.

A CAC score of 0 has been repeatedly shown to be associated with very low risk for CHD and CVD events. For young adults at elevated lifetime risk, a CAC score of 0 does not lessen the importance of heart-healthy lifestyle behaviors, but given that many patients would prefer to avoid preventive medications, the potential for CAC testing to identify patients for whom lifestyle therapies can be favored instead of preventive medications remains an important patient-centered outcome.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^113yo2YY]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this article, we present a clinically useful method of combining information from the CAC score with pre-test coronary risk estimates. To fully appreciate the utility of this analysis, it may be worthwhile to discuss the example from the Background section further. According to current guidelines, this 60-year-old woman, whose 10-year CHD risk estimate is about 15%, should receive both aspirin and cholesterol-lowering drug therapy, aiming for a goal LDL cholesterol of 130 mg/dl. After measuring her CAC score, however, there is a good chance (64%) that our recommendations would change. If her CAC score were zero (47% chance), our estimate of her 10-year CHD risk would be approximately halved (6–9%). Given this information, we would continue to recommend a healthy diet and exercise, but might decide that cholesterol-lowering medication is unnecessary, and that the benefits of aspirin in terms of CHD prevention do not outweigh the risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with aspirin use. On the other hand, if her CAC score were over 100 (17% chance), our estimate of her CHD risk would be approximately doubled (25–31% if CAC score = 101–400) or tripled (34–51% if CAC score > 400). In such a case, we would certainly recommend both aspirin and cholesterol-lowering medication and would probably aim for a more aggressive LDL cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dl. The probability that her treatment plan would be altered by measurement of her CAC score, therefore, is approximately 64% (the probability that her score is either 0 or > 100 = 47% + 17%), indicating likely usefulness of the test in this situation.

### Coronary artery calcium score combined with framingham score for risk prediction in asymptomatic individuals [^115nRNog]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Guidelines advise that all adults undergo coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment to guide preventive treatment intensity. Although the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is often recommended for this, it has been suggested that risk assessment may be improved by additional tests such as coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS).

Objectives

To determine whether CACS assessment combined with FRS in asymptomatic adults provides prognostic information superior to either method alone and whether the combined approach can more accurately guide primary preventive strategies in patients with CHD risk factors.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective observational population-based study, of 1461 asymptomatic adults with coronary risk factors. Participants with at least 1 coronary risk factor (> 45 years) underwent computed tomography (CT) examination, were screened between 1990–1992, were contacted yearly for up to 8.5 years after CT scan, and were assessed for CHD. This analysis included 1312 participants with CACS results; excluded were 269 participants with diabetes and 14 participants with either missing data or had a coronary event before CACS was performed.

Main Outcome Measure

Nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or CHD death.

Results

During a median of 7.0 years of follow-up, 84 patients experienced MI or CHD death; 70 patients died of any cause. There were 291 (28%) participants with an FRS of more than 20% and 221 (21%) with a CACS of more than 300. Compared with an FRS of less than 10%, an FRS of more than 20% predicted the risk of MI or CHD death (hazard ratio [HR], 14.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 2.0–104; p = 0.009). Compared with a CACS of zero, a CACS of more than 300 was predictive (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.1–7.3; P < .001). Across categories of FRS, CACS was predictive of risk among patients with an FRS higher than 10% (P < .001) but not with an FRS less than 10%.

Conclusion

These data support the hypothesis that high CACS can modify predicted risk obtained from FRS alone, especially among patients in the intermediate-risk category in whom clinical decision making is most uncertain.

The absolute ASCVD risk reduction with statin therapy is proportional to the CAC score, and in an analysis projecting number needed to treat (NNT), for those with CAC = 0 the NNT with rosuvastatin 10 mg daily for 5.6 years was 206, compared to 50 for CAC ≥ 100; registry data indicate patients with CAC = 0 receive minimal to no near-term benefit, and key points state that in the absence of diabetes mellitus, active cigarette smoking or a family history of premature ASCVD, statin therapy in those with CAC = 0 is associated with limited short to intermediate-term ASCVD risk reduction benefit.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^115nMj3G]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in statin users — statins delipidate plaque and can modestly increase calcified plaque, and CAC scores do not decrease with statin therapy. In a randomized trial in those with CAC > 0 (St. Francis Heart Study), there was no difference in CAC progression between atorvastatin 20 mg and placebo. In the CAC consortium, 28,025 adults 40–75 years of age (mean age 53.9 ± 10.9 years; 6151 statin users) were followed over a median of 11.2 years with 395 total CVD and 182 CHD deaths; among statin users, each unit increase in log CAC was associated with CVD mortality 1.2 (95% CI = 1.1–1.3) and CHD mortality 1.2 (95% CI = 1.1–1.4). CAC density predicted risk in non-users, but did not predict risk in those taking statins. Overall, the CAC score remains a predictor of risk in patients with a history of statin exposure, and in selected patients CAC scoring can be used to further risk stratify individuals taking statins or with prior statin exposure, and may guide intensity of lipid-lowering therapy, aspirin recommendations, and other preventive decision-making.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) absolute score versus percentile — risk prediction roles and examples: "Both total CAC score and age, sex, and race/ethnicity-based score percentiles should be provided on all score reports" because they convey different information. The "absolute CAC score is the best predictor of near-term absolute risk (i.e. risk of events over a 5–10 year time horizon)", whereas "CAC score percentiles give the best estimation of lifetime risk trajectory". In patients "younger than 50 years of age, any CAC will classify the patient at a high percentile", and a "40 years of age" patient "with a score of 10" has low near-term but very high relative and lifetime risk, while a "75 years of age" patient "with a score of 10" may have similar near-term risk but lower relative and lifetime risk versus peers.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112tK43c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) in adults with endocrine disorders — shared decision-making, follow-up intervals, and statin initiation thresholds: in adults at borderline or intermediate risk (10-year ASCVD risk 5–19.9%) where the decision about statin treatment and/or other preventive interventions is uncertain, we suggest measuring CAC to inform shared decision-making; at present, we suggest measuring CAC as the preferred tool for assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis; CAC = 0 marks very low risk of ASCVD, and repeating a CAC scan is reasonable after 5 to 7 years in low-risk patients, 3 to 5 years in borderline-to-intermediate risk patients, and in 3 years for high-risk patients or those with diabetes; in patients without diabetes or ASCVD and with LDL-C > 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) and 10-year ASCVD risk > 7.5%, or 10-year ASCVD risk 5% to 7.4% plus 1 or more risk-enhancing factors, or CAC score over the 75th percentile for age, sex, and race, or CAC score > 100, the initiation of a statin, as adjunct to diet and exercise, is advised after a discussion of the risks/ benefits with the patient.

### Determinants of coronary calcium conversion among patients with a normal coronary calcium scan: what is the "warranty period" for remaining normal? [^112cj9ah]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study identified the incidence and predictors of conversion of a normal to abnormal coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan during serial CAC scanning over 5 years.

Background

Although a normal CAC scan signifies absence of significant atherosclerosis and is used to identify individuals at low clinical risk, the "warranty period" of a normal CAC scan relative to its ability to predict sustained absence of coronary atherosclerosis remains unknown.

Methods

We assessed frequency of and time to progression, as well as proportional increase of CAC in 422 individuals with normal CAC scan (CAC = 0) undergoing annual CAC scanning for 5 years. Results were compared with those of a referent cohort of 621 individuals with baseline CAC scan (CAC > 0).

Results

A total of 106 (25.1%) patients with CAC = 0 developed CAC during follow-up at a mean time to conversion of 4.1 ± 0.9 years. Incidence of conversion to CAC > 0 was nonlinear and was highest in the fifth year. In multivariable analysis, progression to CAC > 0 was associated with age, diabetes, and smoking (p < 0.01 for all). Among the 621 individuals with baseline CAC > 0, only the presence of CAC itself, rather than CAD risk factors, was predictive of CAC progression. Among propensity score-matched individuals with CAC > 0 versus CAC = 0, baseline CAC > 0 emerged as the strongest predictor of CAC progression (hazard ratio [HR]: 12.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.31 to 16.77), followed by diabetes (HR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.47 to 2.90) and smoking (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.63, p < 0.05 for all).

Conclusions

Among individuals with CAC = 0, conversion to CAC > 0 is nonlinear and occurs at low frequency before 4 years. No clinical factor seems to mandate earlier repeat CAC scanning.

### A zero coronary artery calcium score in patients with stable chest pain is associated with a good prognosis, despite risk of non-calcified plaques [^113UxEQm]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a well-established marker of future cardiovascular risk. Cardiac CT is widely used for the evaluation of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) due to it being a non-invasive, cost-effective and highly sensitive technique.CT calcium scoring detects and quantifies CAC and coronary CT coronary angiography (CTCA) allows for detailed anatomical evaluation of luminal stenosis secondary to both calcified and non-calcified atherosclerotic plaques.

The absence of CAC (defined as a zero CAC score on CT) in asymptomatic individuals is associated with a very low incidence of cardiovascular events over a 15-year follow-up. However, 1%–2% of symptomatic patients with chest pain, and a zero CAC score, have non-calcified coronary artery atherosclerosis. The long-term prognosis of these symptomatic patients with a zero CAC score remains unclear.

In November 2016, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) Clinical Guideline 95 for the evaluation of patients with stable chest pain was issued as an update of their own 2010 Guideline. The update recommended the removal of CT calcium scoring from the investigation algorithm on the basis that a zero CAC score may still be associated with significant underlying CAD, particularly non-calcified plaque, instead suggesting CTCA for all patients presenting with suspected angina.

Therefore, the objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of non-calcified CAD in patients presenting with stable angina and a zero CAC score undergoing CT scanning in our centre. The secondary objectives were to compare incidence rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), and all-cause mortality, in patients with a zero CAC versus a non-zero CAC score.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) future research directions emphasize that CAC-guided care leading to improved population health requires interventions that produce improved patient-centered outcomes via initiation of effective preventive strategies with established risk reduction; high-quality evidence is increasingly required to guide medical necessity and coverage decisions, current evidence suggests CAC-guided improved adherence to therapies and healthy behaviors, and recognition of CAC in primary prevention should increase given PCE limitations.

### Role of coronary artery calcium score in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114KprZm]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

First developed in 1990, the Agatston coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an international guideline-endorsed decision aid for further risk assessment and personalized management in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This review discusses key international studies that have informed this 30 year journey, from an initial coronary plaque screening paradigm to its current role informing personalized shared decision making. Special attention is paid to the prognostic value of a CAC score of zero (the so called "power of zero"), which, in a context of low estimated risk thresholds for the consideration of preventive therapy with statins in current guidelines, may be used to de-risk individuals and thereby inform the safe delay or avoidance of certain preventive therapies. We also evaluate current recommendations for CAC scoring in clinical practice guidelines around the world, and past and prevailing barriers for its use in routine patient care. Finally, we discuss emerging approaches in this field, with a focus on the potential role of CAC informing not only the personalized allocation of statins and aspirin in the general population, but also of other risk-reduction therapies in special populations, such as individuals with diabetes and people with severe hypercholesterolemia.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) repeat testing intervals — In patients with an initial CAC of zero, a repeat CAC test should be considered to re-assess CAC and potential risk/treatment reclassification; based on Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis data, repeat intervals are: low-risk patient (10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] risk < 5%) at 5 to 7 years, borderline-to-intermediate risk (10-year ASCVD risk 5% to 19.9%) at 3 to 5 years, and high-risk (10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20%) or patient with diabetes at 3 years; CAC should generally not be repeated in already aggressively treated patients as it is not designed to measure lipid-lowering treatment efficacy.

### Association of age with the diagnostic value of coronary artery calcium score for ruling out coronary stenosis in symptomatic patients [^113sDt6s]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The diagnostic value is unclear of a 0 coronary artery calcium (CAC) score to rule out obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and near-term clinical events across different age groups.

Objective

To assess the diagnostic value of a CAC score of 0 for reducing the likelihood of obstructive CAD and to assess the implications of such a CAC score and obstructive CAD across different age groups.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study obtained data from the Western Denmark Heart Registry and had a median follow-up time of 4.3 years. Included patients were aged 18 years or older who underwent computed tomography angiography (CTA) between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2017, because of symptoms that were suggestive of CAD. Data analysis was performed from April 5 to July 7, 2021.

Exposures

Obstructive CAD, which was defined as 50% or more luminal stenosis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Proportion of individuals with obstructive CAD who had a CAC score of 0. Risk-adjusted diagnostic likelihood ratios were used to assess the diagnostic value of a CAC score of 0 for reducing the likelihood of obstructive CAD beyond clinical variables. Risk factors associated with myocardial infarction and death were estimated.

Results

A total of 23 759 symptomatic patients, of whom 12 771 (54%) had a CAC score of 0, were included. This cohort had a median (IQR) age of 58 (49–65) years and was primarily composed of women (13 160 [55%]). Overall, the prevalence of obstructive CAD was relatively low across all age groups, ranging from 3% (39 of 1278 patients) in those who were younger than 40 years to 8% (52 of 619) among those who were 70 years or older. In patients with obstructive CAD, 14% (725 of 5043) had a CAC score of 0, and the prevalence varied across age groups from 58% (39 of 68) among those who were younger than 40 years, 34% (192 of 562) among those aged 40 to 49 years, 18% (268 of 1486) among those aged 50 to 59 years, 9% (174 of 1963) among those aged 60 to 69 years, to 5% (52 of 964) among those who were 70 years or older. The added diagnostic value of a CAC score of 0 decreased at a younger age, with a risk factor-adjusted diagnostic likelihood ratio of a CAC score of 0 ranging from 0.68 (approximately 32% lower likelihood of obstructive CAD than expected) in those who were younger than 40 years to 0.18 (approximately 82% lower likelihood than expected) in those who were 70 years or older. The presence of obstructive vs nonobstructive CAD among those with a CAC score of 0 was associated with a multivariable adjusted hazard ratio of 1.51 (95% CI, 0.98–2.33) for myocardial infarction and all-cause death; however, this hazard ratio varied from 1.80 (95% CI, 1.02–3.19) in those who were younger than 60 years to 1.24 (95% CI, 0.64–2.39) in those who were 60 years or older.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that the diagnostic value of a CAC score of 0 to rule out obstructive CAD beyond clinical variables was dependent on age, with the added diagnostic value being smaller for younger patients. In symptomatic patients who were younger than 60 years, a sizable proportion of obstructive CAD occurred among those without CAC and was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and all-cause death.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) = 0 — risk reclassification and age-stratified prognosis are described as follows: among adults with 10‑year ASCVD risk 5–7.4% or 7.5–19.9%, 57% and 45.0% had CAC = 0, respectively, yielding reclassification in 49% (956 of 1970). In MESA, adults 75–84 years of age with CAC = 0 had an approximate 98% survival rate at 8.5 years, exceeding 45–54-year-old individuals with CAC > 100 (82.9%); within the 75–84 group, hard CHD risk was increased 11-fold for CAC 1–100 and 20-fold for CAC > 100 versus CAC = 0.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring with 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk — statin therapy guidance indicates the following: For patient's 10-year ASCVD risk estimate " < 5%", "Statin not recommended"; for "5–7.4%", "Consider statin"; and for "7.5–19.9%" and " ≥ 20%", "Recommend statin". With CAC incorporated, "If CAC score = 0", therapy is "Statin not recommended" at < 5%, "Statin generally not recommended" at 5–7.4% and 7.5–19.9%, and "Recommend statin" at ≥ 20%; "If CAC score > 0", "Statin may be considered" at < 5% and "Recommend statin" for 5–7.4%, 7.5–19.9%, and ≥ 20%. CAC's effect on planning is "X CAC less effective for this population" for < 5% and "X CAC not effective for this population" for ≥ 20%, while for 5–7.4% and 7.5–19.9% "✓ CAC can reclassify risk up or down". The note specifies "CAC = 0 should not be used as sole justification for use of lifestyle alone, to the exclusion of pharmacotherapy in familial hypercholesterolemia, advanced diabetes, and/or active smoking".

Symptomatic patients — pretest probability models and coronary artery calcium (CAC) evidence: "There are several pretest probability scores for use in symptomatic patients with suspected CAD". "The CAD Consortium models include basic (age, sex, symptoms, and hospital setting); clinical (basic model + risk factors: diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking); and extended (clinical model + CAC) versions". "Among symptomatic patients, a CAC score of zero identifies a low-risk cohort of patients who may not require additional diagnostic testing; most events occur among patients with detectable CAC (eg, 84% in the PROMISE trial)". "From the CRESCENT I (Comprehensive Cardiac CT Versus Exercise Testing in Suspected Coronary Artery Disease) trial, 350 symptomatic patients were randomized to CAC scanning versus exercise ECGs". "Only patients with detectable CAC or high pretest risk (141/242) underwent follow-up CCTA". "At 1 year, the CAC arm was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular disease events when compared with those who underwent exercise testing alone (P = 0.011)". "Using this approach, there was no significant difference in CAD death or hospitalization for an ACS or heart failure, with either test, but exercise testing alone provided significant cost savings".

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^115YMVov]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of zero — examples of candidates who might benefit from knowing their CAC score is zero and related caveats are provided: Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely; patients concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms; older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy; and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with PCE-calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5%, with factors that increase their ASCVD risk, although they are in a borderline risk group. Caveats state that if a coronary artery calcium score of zero is obtained at intermediate risk and a risk decision is uncertain, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years, and that CAC testing should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Comparing risk scores in the prediction of coronary and cardiovascular deaths: coronary artery calcium consortium [^113DcnHk]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study compared risk discrimination for the prediction of coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths for the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE), the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Risk Score (with and without coronary artery calcium [CAC]), and of simple addition of CAC to the PCE.

Background

The PCE predict 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD events, and the MESA Risk Score predicts risk of CHD. Their comparative performance for the prediction of fatal events is poorly understood.

Methods

We evaluated 53,487 patients ages 45 to 79 years from the CAC Consortium, a retrospective cohort study of asymptomatic individuals referred for clinical CAC scoring. Risk discrimination was measured using C-statistics.

Results

Mean age was 57 years, 35% were women, and 39% had CAC of 0. There were 421 CHD and 775 CVD deaths over a mean 12-year follow-up. In the overall study population, discrimination with the MESA Risk Score with CAC and the PCE was almost identical for both outcomes (C-statistics: 0.80 and 0.79 for CHD death, 0.77 and 0.78 for CVD death, respectively). Addition of CAC to the PCE improved risk discrimination, yielding the largest C-statistics. The MESA Risk Score with CAC and the PCE plus CAC showed the best discrimination among the 45% of patients with 5% to 20% estimated risk. Secondary analyses by estimated CVD risk strata showed modestly improved risk discrimination with CAC also among low- and high-estimated risk groups.

Conclusions

Our findings support the current guideline recommendation to use, among available risk scores, the PCE for initial risk assessment and to use CAC for further risk assessment in a broad borderline and intermediate risk group. Also, in select individuals at low or high estimated risk, CAC modestly improved discrimination. Studies in unselected populations will lead to further understanding of the potential value of tools combining risk scores and CAC for optimal risk assessment.

### Coronary artery calcium score, risk factors, and incident coronary heart disease events [^111FBhAF]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Whether the absence of coronary artery calcium, or conversely the presence of high volumes of coronary artery calcium, may alter assessment of coronary heart disease risk based on traditional risk factors is uncertain. We sought to identify a potential threshold of coronary artery calcium for clinical use and examine the predictive power of coronary artery calcium in individuals categorized using conventional coronary heart disease risk assessment.

Methods

The study included 10,746 men and women (36.3%) with a mean age of 53.8 ± 9.9 years who were either physician- or self-referred for electron beam tomography scanning to a preventive medical clinic. Coronary heart disease risk factors were elicited by use of a questionnaire.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, 81 primary events (coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) occurred. Among individuals with a coronary artery calcium score of zero, the primary event rate was very low (0.4 events per 1000 person-years of observation). When participants were stratified by self-reported coronary heart disease risk factors (0–2, or 3–4), a coronary artery calcium score ≥ 100 was associated with substantially increased risk of coronary heart disease events within each level of stratification. In a subgroup of participants with available clinical data, similar results were found when participants were categorized by Framingham risk scores.

Conclusions

Coronary artery calcium score can identify individuals at increased risk for coronary heart disease events who otherwise would be considered low-risk based on clinical assessment. A coronary artery calcium score of zero is associated with very low risk for coronary heart disease in the short to intermediate term (approximately 3.5 years) regardless of the number of risk factors present.

In adults with CAC scores ≥ 100 and an low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥ 70 mg/ dL, repeat CAC scoring at 3 years may be reasonable to assess for accelerated progression (> 20–25% per year) and/or an increase to a CAC score > 300.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^113Kibg7]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Combining information from conventional risk factors and the CAC score

First, we calculated the Framingham 10-year CHD risk estimate (and corresponding 1-year risk estimate assuming an equal event rate each year) according to published models. Next, we calculated the probability, as described above, that that individual's CAC score would fall into each one of four standard CAC score categories (0, 1–100, 101–400, and > 400). We obtained risk factor-adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates from a meta-analysis comparing the risk of a CHD event among persons with CAC scores of 1–100 (RR = 2.1), 101–400 (RR = 5.4) and < 400 (RR = 10) to the risk in a person with a CAC score of zero. The analysis was repeated using more conservative estimates from the same paper: RR = 1.7 (for CAC 1–100), RR = 3.0 (for CAC 101–400), and RR = 4.3 (for CAC > 400). The post-test CHD risk estimates for each CAC score category were then calculated algebraically by assuming that the overall 1-year CHD risk estimate represents an average of the 1-year risk estimates from the four CAC score categories, weighted by the probabilities that an individual's score would fall into each category. A spreadsheet that automates these calculations is attached.

### A zero coronary artery calcium score in patients with stable chest pain is associated with a good prognosis, despite risk of non-calcified plaques [^111mddFm]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Prognostic significance of a zero CAC

Over a medium-term follow-up, the incidence of MACE and all-cause mortality in our patients was lower in the zero CAC cohort than the non-zero CAC cohort. In multivariable survival analysis after adjusting for age, gender and cardiovascular risk factors, there was no difference in the prognosis between the two cohorts for both MACE and all-cause mortality end points (p = 0.19 and p = 0.27, respectively). However, the overall prognosis of stable angina in patients with zero CAC was good with an annualised rate of MACE in the zero CAC cohort of 1.9 per 1000 person-years.

We compared both MACE and all-cause mortality in patients with zero CAC versus non-zero CAC, whereas previous studies have focused only on all-cause mortality, and showed this to be 0.05% to 3.8% over a mean follow-up period of 5.6–15 years. In another study, the incidence of MACE was found to be 1.3% over 2.8 years. Importantly, these studies align with our findings that the overall prognosis of patients with a zero CAC is largely unaffected by the presence of non-calcified atheroma.

CAC scoring versus CTCA

Although subjects with zero CAC had a good prognosis over during medium-term follow-up, 10.3% were found to have CAD on subsequent CTCA. Once identified, this group can benefit prognostically from medical therapy as demonstrated in the Scottish COmputed Tomography of the HEART Trial (SCOTHEART). The discovery of underlying CAD in those with zero calcium scores highlights the advantages of using CTCA in all subjects rather than having calcium scoring as a gatekeeper, as was the case in the previous version of the NICE CG95 guideline. CTCA without prior CAC scoring also lowers patient radiation exposure.

Study limitations

As an observational study, clinical data were obtained from the electronic records system and there may have been incomplete patient follow-up. We assumed that loss to follow-up would occur equally across the study cohort, thereby not unduly influencing results. As a single-centre study, our findings may not be applicable in other geographic regions. Finally, while we analysed the degree of luminal stenosis on CTCA, we did not take into account the impact of high-risk plaque features that are also known to have prognostic significance.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^116nrs4d]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Borderline and intermediate risk assessment and coronary artery calcium use — Periodic assessment of risk factors is advised at least every 4 to 6 years in younger adults 20 to 39 years of age. Among adults at borderline (5% to < 7.5%) and intermediate (≥ 7.5% to < 20%) risk, one may consider additional individual risk-enhancing clinical factors to revise the 10-year ASCVD risk estimate. For individuals with intermediate-predicted risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20%) by the PCE or for select adults with borderline (5% to < 7.5%) predicted risk, coronary artery calcium measurement can be a useful tool in refining risk assessment for preventive interventions, and in these groups it can reclassify risk upward (particularly if coronary artery calcium score is ≥ 100 Agatston units (AU) or ≥ 75th age/sex/race percentile) or downward (if coronary artery calcium is zero).

Coronary artery calcium measurement — selected candidates and caveats — Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely and those concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms are listed, as are older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with pooled cohort equations (PCE)–calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk. Caveats include that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a CAC score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the CAC score in 5 to 10 years, and that, if CAC is recommended, it should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Interpreting the coronary artery calcium score-critical information for the practicing physician [^116rF4pb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery calcium scanning is a routine test for assessing the severity of atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals. This inexpensive, noninvasive test quantifies the calcium deposition in the 4 principal coronary arteries. Correct interpretation is important to the physician (for recommending therapy) and to the patient (for determining his or her lifetime risk of a cardiovascular event). A score of 0 indicates that a cardiovascular event is extremely unlikely in the next 5 years. In contrast, a score greater than 0 portends a coronary event. The higher the score, the greater the risk. Both the arterial location of the calcium and the number of coronary arteries involved alter the interpretation of the calcium score. At any given age, females have significantly lower scores than males. One-third of individuals with scores greater than 1000 will have a cardiovascular event within 3 years. For all elevated calcium scores, aggressive treatment is warranted, including significant lifestyle changes and medications to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Understanding the importance of the coronary artery calcium score will result in improved therapy and patient compliance.

### Coronary artery calcium test for heart disease risk assessment… [^113PuH7U]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Greenland P, Lloyd-Jones DM. Coronary Artery Calcium Test for Heart Disease Risk Assessment. JAMA Cardiol. 2022; 7:

1083. doi: 10.1001/jamacardio.2022.2638 Heart artery blockages start with cholesterol deposits, or plaques, that build up in the heart artery walls. Over time, these plaques can become hardened, or calcified. The calcium in plaques can be measured by a coronary computed tomographic scan. The scan takes 10 to 15 minutes and does not require any intravenous contrast or dye. People with coronary artery calcium have some plaque and are at increased risk of having a myocardial infarction, or heart attack, with the highest risk seen in people with a lot of CAC. Most people without any coronary calcium will not have a myocardial infarction or heart blockage in the next 5 years. Because it takes time to develop CAC, some people can still have heart artery blockages and not have any CAC. This is more common in young people and women.

A CAC score of 0 does not mean you do not have any plaque, although it does make it less likely. Some people with a CAC score of 0 may choose to defer statin treatment and repeat the scan in 5 years, especially those who do not have other heart disease risk factors such as diabetes, very high cholesterol levels, a history of smoking, or a family history of myocardial infarction. Physicians typically look at a number of factors to determine a person's individual risk of heart disease, such as cholesterol, blood pressure levels, diabetes, cigarette smoking, family history, and body weight. Many patients and physicians feel uncertain about starting medications for heart disease prevention, including people at borderline or intermediate risk of heart disease. In these cases, the CAC score can help guide treatment decisions. The CAC score can help increase certainty about a person's myocardial infarction risk and can help make drug prescribing more accurate.

The CAC scan is a radiograph, or x-ray test, and it involves a low amount of radiation exposure, about the same as someone would receive from a mammogram. Because the computed tomographic scan of the heart also includes some pictures of the lung, there is a risk of incidental findings, for example, finding a nodule in the lung that needs to be followed up. This can sometimes require more testing, which can cause stress and worry. The actual cost of the test ranges around $50 to $100 in many test centers to as high as $500 in others. It is usually not covered by insurance. If possible, shop around to find a reputable center that charges a low amount. For more information, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology and the US Preventive Services Task Force have evaluated the CAC test and can provide additional information if desired.

In all patients, healthy life habits regarding not smoking tobacco products, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining a healthy weight are recommended, no matter what the CAC test results show.

NLA scientific statement — coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring guidance for ordering and interpretation states that CAC scoring should be done only if the results will alter treatment decisions. For risk estimation, the absolute CAC score is the best predictor of absolute 5- to 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event risk and should be used to estimate number needed to treat and guide pharmacologic treatment decisions, while the CAC score percentile derived from MESA is the best predictor of relative risk and of lifetime risk trajectory, and should be used to estimate lifetime treatment benefit.

Participants were divided into low (< 10%), intermediate (10–20%) and high (> 20% 10-year risk groups), and CAC scoring reclassified risk in 52% of those in the intermediate category compared with Framingham risk scoring. The CAC score cutoffs for reclassification to high or low risk were 615 and 50, respectively, and CAC = 0 may also be used as a "de-risking" strategy in older adults.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing — statin withholding, reassessment, and exceptions: Caveats state that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a coronary artery calcium score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions, such as cigarette smoking, family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), or diabetes mellitus, are present and to reassess coronary artery calcium score in 5 to 10 years; moreover, if CAC scoring is recommended, it should be performed in facilities that have current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation dose. Clinicians should not downclassify risk in patients who have coronary artery calcium scores of zero but who are persistent cigarette smokers, have diabetes, have a family history of ASCVD, or, possibly, have chronic inflammatory conditions, and in the presence of these conditions, a coronary artery calcium of zero does not rule out risk from noncalcified plaque or increased risk of thrombosis.

### Effects of combining coronary calcium score with treatment on plaque progression in familial coronary artery disease: a randomized clinical trial [^111cfL2f]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring provides prognostic information, especially in patients at intermediate risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the benefit of combining CAC score with a primary prevention strategy has not been tested in a randomized trial.

Objective

To assess whether combining the CAC score with a prevention strategy can be used to limit plaque progression in intermediate-risk patients with a family history of premature CAD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective, randomized, open-blinded end point clinical trial in 7 hospitals across Australia (between 2013 and 2020; the last date of follow-up was June 5, 2021). Asymptomatic people aged 40 to 70 years with a first-degree relative with CAD onset at younger than 60 years old or second-degree relative with onset at younger than 50 years old were recruited from the community.

Interventions

Intermediate-risk participants underwent CAC scoring. Those with a CAC score greater than 0 but less than 400 underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and were randomized to CAC score-informed prevention or usual care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Follow-up CCTA was obtained at 3 years, with plaque volume measured by an independent core laboratory. The primary outcome was total plaque volume, with further analysis for calcified and noncalcified plaque volume.

Results

This study included 365 participants (mean [SD] age, 58 [6] years; 57.5% male); 179 in the CAC score-informed and 186 in the usual care groups. Compared with usual care, the CAC score-informed group showed a sustained reduction in total (mean [SD], -3 [31] mg/dL vs -56 [38] mg/dL; P < .001) and LDL (mean [SD], -2 [31] vs -51 [36] mg/dL; P < .001) cholesterol levels at 3 years, which was associated with a reduction in pooled cohort equation risk calculation (mean [SD], 2.1% [2.9%] vs 0.5% [2.9%]; P < .001). Plaque progression was greater in usual care than CAC score-informed participants for total plaque volume (mean [SD], 24.9 [37.7] mm3 vs 15.4 [30.9] mm3; p = 0.009), noncalcified plaque volume (mean [SD], 15.7 [32.2] mm3 vs 5.6 [28.5] mm3; p = 0.002), and fibrofatty and necrotic core plaque volume (mean [SD], 4.5 [25.8] mm3 vs -0.8 [12.6] mm3; p = 0.02). These plaque volume changes were independent of other risk factors including baseline plaque volume, blood pressure, and lipid profile.

Conclusions and Relevance

The combination of CAC score with a primary prevention strategy in intermediate-risk patients with a family history of CAD was associated with reduction of atherogenic lipids and slower plaque progression compared with usual care. These data support the use of CAC score to assist intensive preventive strategies in intermediate-risk patients.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^1121TBf9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

Association of coronary artery calcification (CAC), race/ethnicity, and future cardiovascular risk — MESA and the CAC Consortium demonstrate CAC-based risk gradients and racial representation patterns. In MESA, individuals were assigned to four CAC categories: 0, 1–100, 101–300, > 300, and ten-year ASCVD risk was low (< 5%) in those with CAC = 0 and was higher (> 7.5%) in those with CAC > 100. MESA prospectively followed 6814 adults with a median follow up of 11.1 years for CVD events, while the CAC Consortium retrospectively analyzed data from 42,224 patients with a median follow up of 11.7 years, assessing CVD and all-cause mortality. In the CAC Consortium, there was a disproportionately high representation of White individuals (87.2%) and very small representation of Blacks (2.3%) and Hispanics (3.8%); cumulative incidence and incidence rates of all-cause and CVD mortality were disproportionately higher in Blacks across CAC categories (0, 1–99, 100–399, ≥ 400), and these racial differences persisted even when the CAC = 0. Furthermore, in all categories of CAC, the hazard ratios for CVD and all-cause mortality were higher in Blacks and Hispanics than in Whites or Asians.

### A zero coronary artery calcium score in patients with stable chest pain is associated with a good prognosis, despite risk of non-calcified plaques [^114daGkt]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A zero CAC score in patients with stable chest pain reliably excludes obstructive CAD and is associated with an overall very good prognosis. However, CTCA provides further diagnostic and prognostic information, revealing underlying CAD in over 10% of patients. We now know that such patients should be treated with preventive medical therapy to improve their prognosis.

### Should family physicians use coronary artery calcium… [^111PtbrF]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Sudden death is often the first manifestation of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. One-third of deaths from CAD in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study occurred without warning signs, and there was no prior diagnosis of CAD in most of these persons. 1 For the primary care physician, recommended strategies for mitigating the risk of sudden death and other cardiac events include identifying and managing CAD risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use. 2 A study that supports this approach showed that among those dying from CAD, more than 87 percent had at least one traditional CAD risk factor. 3 More problematic, however, is that a large number of patients without CAD will have risk factors, and many with CAD will have normal cholesterol levels.

4 Moreover, a recent study of survivors of ST elevation myocardial infarction found that less than one-half would be considered candidates for intensive preventive management according to current global CAD risk scores.
5. Addressing these limitations, new prevention strategies have sought to directly visualize the presence of CAD by measuring coronary artery calcium on non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans of the chest. 2 Coronary artery calcification is thought to result from the replacement of dead cells and extracellular lipid in atheromatous plaque with apatite, thus signifying advanced lesions. 6 Although not necessarily representative of the degree of stenosis, coronary artery calcification does signify the presence of CAD. 7 Perhaps reflecting the overall burden of atherosclerotic plaque, CAC scores correlate with the likelihood of having a cardiac event. Low CAC scores are associated with a low risk of events. Higher scores are associated with increased relative risk of coronary death or myocardial infarction.
2. CAC scoring adds predictive value to existing global risk scores, such as the Framingham risk score. In particular, CAC scores help to reclassify a patient from intermediate risk to either the lowest or highest risk group. One-fourth of the patients in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis longitudinal cohort were better classified into the correct category of CAD risk when CAC scores were considered. 8 Similarly, one-half of the patients in a cohort of asymptomatic older patients followed for 9. 2 years were reclassified from intermediate risk into either the high-risk or low-risk category, among which 40 percent were deemed high-risk.

9 In a cohort of veterans, 15 percent of those estimated to have low risk by the Framingham risk score were found to have significant burdens of CAC and higher relative risk of cardiac mortality, compared with veterans who had lower CAC scores but high Framingham risk scores.
10. Practically speaking, better risk prediction may help tailor prevention recommendations with regard to lipid and blood pressure management. Interestingly, knowledge that patients had abnormal CAC scores was associated with increased adherence to aspirin use, dietary modifications, and physical activity. 11 A recent study of asymptomatic patients randomized to receive CAC screening or a nonscreening strategy found improved management of risk factors with lower use of resources, offsetting increases in cost among the group in which CAC data were available.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score 0 — long-term risk is very low across endpoints, with a summary risk ratio for long-term follow-up of 0.29 (p < 0.0001); for cardiovascular disease endpoints with absent CAC the summary risk ratio was 0.20 (p < 0.0001), and for > 10-year all-cause mortality it was 0.36 (p < 0.0001). Among aging individuals with CAC = 0, event rates were 0.407% for CVD and 2.2% for CHD after 10 years, and in MESA 38% of patients with diabetes had a CAC score of 0.

Severe primary hypercholesterolemia — coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring stratifies atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk: in a heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia cohort of 206 patients, 49% (n = 101) had CAC = 0 with no ASCVD events, while scores 1–100 or > 100 had annualized event rates per 1000 patients of 26.4 (95% CI, 12.9–51.8) and 44.1 (95% CI, 26–104.1); in a MESA analysis of individuals with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, those with CAC = 0 had an ASCVD incidence rate of 4.7 per 1000 person-years (0.4% per year) versus CAC > 0 at 26.4 per 1000 person-years (2.0% per year). These data support strong risk discrimination with CAC, and while CAC = 0 does not preclude the need for long term evidence-based LDL-C lowering therapy, CAC > 0 identifies a group in which particularly aggressive LDL-C lowering strategies should be undertaken.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) repeat testing intervals — it is reasonable to repeat CAC scoring in adults with CAC = 0 according to baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk: low risk (< 5% 10 year risk) at 5–7 years, borderline to intermediate risk (5–19.9% 10 year risk) at 3–5 years, and high risk or diabetes at 3 years. In adults with CAC scores 1–99, it may be reasonable to repeat CAC scoring in 3–5 years if the results might change treatment decisions. In adults with CAC scores ≥ 100 and an LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, repeat CAC scoring at 3 years may be reasonable to assess for accelerated progression (> 20–25% per year) and/or an increase to a CAC score > 300, findings that may favor more aggressive LDL-C lowering.

Adults younger than 40 years — considering coronary artery calcium (CAC) to stratify preventive therapy: current cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk equations that guide decisions regarding preventive medications are largely driven by age, and despite the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and elevated lifetime risks of CVD, the 10-year estimates of CVD risk are low in younger adults; CAC can stratify risk in younger adults who may benefit from aggressive CVD preventive therapies, such as those with a family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or those with multiple major ASCVD risk factors. In the CARDIA Study, a prospective community-based cohort of 5115 asymptomatic Black and White adults aged 18–30 years followed for ~30 years, at year 15 of the study, 3043 participants (mean age 40.3 years) underwent CAC testing and were followed up for 12.5 years; the prevalence of CAC was 10.2%; there was a 5-fold increase in fatal and nonfatal CHD and a 3-fold increase in any CVD event in those participants with CAC > 0 compared to those with CAC = 0; additionally, CAC scores as low as 1–19 increased the risk of CHD events by 2.6-fold and CAC ≥ 100 increased the risk of CHD event by 9.8-fold.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^1118LpsV]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The third and fourth clinical scenarios presented in Table 5, on the other hand, provide examples where the test is unlikely to change management. The 40-year-old woman who smokes, for example, has a very low pre-test 10-year CHD risk (3%). It is very likely her CAC score will be zero (89%) or less than 100 (10%), in which case her post-test 10-year CHD risk will still be low (≤ 5%) and her management would not change. The 80-year-old man with high cholesterol has a high pre-test 10-year CHD risk (26%) and a high probability of having a high CAC score (70% will have a score > 100), in which case his post-test 10-year CHD risk would remain over 20% and his management would have to remain aggressive. In these cases, and others in which the risk factor profile indicates very low or very high pre-test risk, the test is not likely to provide useful results, and the clinician might decide not to order the test. We have provided a simple spreadsheet (see Additional File 1) that may be used by readers of this article to replicate these analyses and apply our models to other clinical scenarios.

While others have proposed similar Bayesian approaches to use of the CAC score for coronary risk prediction, ours has advantages. Previous approaches do generally take into account the pre-test probability of coronary heart disease, but none consider the expected distribution of CAC scores in the tested population after adjustment for conventional CHD risk factors. Raggi et al advocate use of an age- and sex-adjusted calcium score percentile, but this ignores both persons with zero scores and the strong effects of other risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Some approaches use only sensitivity and specificity from dichotomized CAC score cutoffs, and others use CAC score-specific relative risks generated from a single study population. Only two provide actual post-test risk estimates for specific clinical situations. Our approach takes into account the pre-test coronary risk, the expected distribution of CAC scores adjusted for all conventional CHD risk factors, and summary adjusted relative risks from a recent meta-analysis, and provides clinically relevant post-test risk estimates that may be directly useful to primary care physicians, cardiologists and patients as they decide whether or not to take medications for primary prevention of CHD.

CAC = 0 — prognosis and negative risk marker: Among patients aged ≥ 75 years, 16% of 1663 had a calcium score of zero, with a survival rate of 98% at a mean follow up of 5.6 years. In the Biolmage study of adults aged 55–80 years, 86% qualified for statin therapy for primary prevention due to a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5%, and within this population CAC = 0 as well as CAC < 10 were the strongest negative risk factors for development of cardiovascular disease over a median follow-up of 2.7 years. Key points emphasize that CAC = 0 is associated with highly favorable cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular prognosis and is the strongest "negative risk marker" for ASCVD.

### Clinical indications for coronary artery calcium scoring in asymptomatic patients: expert consensus statement from the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^115Bgwjs]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2017). Medium credibility.

Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography expert consensus on coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring in asymptomatic patients summarizes the prognostic value of CAC and its ability to refine individual risk prediction, addresses limitations of traditional risk factor-based treatment strategies recommended by the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention guidelines including the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Recommendation Statement for Statin Use for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults. It provides CAC based treatment recommendations both within the context of the shared decision making model espoused by the 2013 ACC/AHA Prevention guidelines and independent of these guidelines. Unlike global risk scores such as the Framingham Risk Score or the Pooled Cohort Equation (PCE), the CAC score is a direct marker of atherosclerosis in an individual patient and provides an assessment of the burden of coronary atherosclerosis, reflecting the integrated lifetime effect of all risk factors in an individual patient.

### The National Lipid Association scientific statement on coronary artery calcium scoring to guide preventive strategies for ASCVD risk reduction [^113Ckeum]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). High credibility.

NLA scientific statement — age-specific use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) and prognostic value explains that CAC scoring may be used selectively to risk stratify adults < 40 years of age to more intensive CVD preventive therapies when CAC is identified, and that in adults 76–80 years of age, CAC scoring may be selectively used to re-classify ASCVD risk and aid in statin treatment decisions. It further states that CAC = 0 is associated with highly favorable cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular prognosis and that CAC = 0 is the strongest "negative risk marker" for ASCVD.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to clinical follow-up, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider using a validated chronic coronary disease-specific patient-reported health status measure to assess symptoms, functional status, and QoL in patients with chronic coronary disease.

Diabetes at age extremes — coronary artery calcium (CAC) patterns support selective CAC use to guide statin decisions in younger and older adults. In younger adults, CARDIA reported in those aged 32–43 years that CAC > 0 was associated with increased ASCVD events over 12.5 years of follow-up and for CAC ≥ 20 the ASCVD event rate was > 8.0%; a small type 2 diabetes cohort aged 32–39 years had 24% with CAC 1–100 and 8% with CAC > 100, and CAC prevalence at 30–39 years was approximately 20% in women and 35% in men. Among older adults 75 to 84 years, about 85% had CAC > 0 and those with CAC = 0 had an event rate of 1.8%/10 years as compared to ≥ 21.3% with CAC > 100. As coronary calcification is uncommon in individuals < 30 years of age and as the presence of CAC identifies those with diabetes at higher ASCVD risk, CAC scoring may be useful to inform decision-making about initiation of statin treatment in individuals 30–39 years of age with diabetes, especially in whom the decision to initiate a statin is uncertain, and it is reasonable to employ CAC scoring to decide whether to newly initiate statin therapy in those > 75 years of age.

### Coronary artery calcium is a common finding in older… [^113xcYiC]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on October 2, 2023 The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol management guidelines advised that for patients with an intermediate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, a coronary artery calcium score can be used to guide the decision to start or defer statin therapy: If the CAC score is zero, statin therapy should be withheld or delayed unless the patient is a cigarette smoker, has diabetes, or has a strong family history of premature ASCVD. A CAC score of 1 to 99 suggests statin therapy, particularly for patients 55 years and older. If the CAC score is 100 or greater or in the 75th percentile or greater, statin therapy is indicated for any patient unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of the physician–patient risk discussion. This recommendation to selectively incorporate CAC scoring into ASCVD risk management has been controversial; the U. S.

Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence that adding the CAC score to traditional risk assessment improves patient-oriented outcomes. In a previous. AFP editorial, Drs. John Mandrola and Andrew Foy argued that "it is unclear if knowing the coronary artery calcium score would improve decision quality or adherence to statin therapy. " However, a recent Diagnostic Tests article by Dr. Hu Ying Joanna Choi concluded that "CAC score is a strong predictor of coronary heart disease, CVD, and mortality risk and provides risk discrimination and stratification beyond that provided by traditional risk factor models". Incidental detection of CAC on chest computed tomography scans performed for other reasons in people without clinical ASCVD was demonstrated in a previous study to increase statin prescriptions, cardiology clinic visits, and stress tests. Until recently, however, the prevalence of CAC in asymptomatic adults was not known.

Using data from the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis in people 45 to 84 years of age without ASCVD symptoms at baseline, Dr. Matthew Tattersall and colleagues calculated CAC prevalence by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. They found that across all groups, most men in their early sixties had detectable CAC that and the majority of women had CAC by their early seventies. Nearly all non-Hispanic White adults in their early eighties had CAC. The study authors concluded the following: lthough CAC presence is associated with increased ASCVD risk regardless of age, CAC is common as age increases. Its detection provides an opportunity to discuss ASCVD risk but should avoid provoking unnecessary patient anxiety.

Further, given the high prevalence of CAC at older ages, a finding of CAC on a CT scan should not reflexively result in a specialist referral or a prescription for a statin and/or aspirin, but rather a comprehensive ASCVD risk assessment with consideration of competing risks and patient preferences.

High coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores — risk phenotype: For a given CAC score, a diffuse distribution of CAC suggests higher risk than more localized CAC, and the presence of left main coronary calcification, especially when > 25% of the total score is in the left main, suggests higher risk.

Use of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring to guide aspirin therapy — In primary prevention, the margin of net benefit of low-dose aspirin is small, and ACC/AHA guidelines assign low-dose aspirin a IIb recommendation in high risk primary prevention patients who are not at high risk of bleeding. In MESA (6470 participants) over a median follow-up of more than 14 years, the Pooled Cohort Equations identified no group with reliable net ASCVD benefit from aspirin because bleeding risk increases as calculated Pooled Cohort Equations risk increases, whereas CAC strongly predicted ASCVD events without a consistent association with bleeding. Modeling indicated that individuals with CAC = 0 are more likely to be harmed than helped by aspirin (NNH > NNT), while those with CAC > 100 are expected to derive net benefit (NNT < NNH). In the Dallas Heart Study (2191 participants) with median follow-up 12.2 years, there were 116 major bleeding events and 123 ASCVD events; applying meta analysis estimates, aspirin therapy was associated with net harm in those with < 20% 10 year ASCVD risk and net benefit in those with ≥ 20% risk.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to imaging follow-up, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to do not perform routine periodic invasive coronary angiography to guide therapeutic decision-making in patients with chronic coronary disease with no change in clinical or functional status.
