Hashimoto and pregnacy

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing Hashimoto's thyroiditis in pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about preconception optimization and screening. Then, I should verify first-trimester actions and levothyroxine dose adjustments. Next, I will review trimester-specific monitoring and TSH targets. After that, I need to check indications for treating subclinical hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity. I will then examine postpartum management, including postpartum thyroiditis and dose tapering. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like infertility, lactation, and iodine, and close with a concise algorithmic summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the preconception priorities. Women with Hashimoto's who are planning pregnancy should have TSH checked and optimized to below 2.5 mIU/L before conception, and if already on levothyroxine, they should be counseled to notify their clinician immediately upon a positive pregnancy test because dose requirements rise early in gestation, which is a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence [^113aVCb4] [^1151Wxbj]. I should also ensure iodine sufficiency; daily iodine 150 mcg is recommended preconception and during pregnancy, ideally started 3 months prior, given increased gestational iodine demands and the risk of deficiency even in iodine-sufficient regions [^1144QUG6] [^111Wytoy]. Hold on, I should verify screening scope; targeted case-finding is advised rather than universal screening, using risk factors such as age over 30, personal or family thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, prior pregnancy loss, goiter, head/neck radiation, or medications like amiodarone or lithium to guide TSH testing in those seeking pregnancy or newly pregnant [^111ZPVzV].

> Next, I should review first-trimester actions once pregnancy is confirmed. I need to check that TSH is measured as soon as pregnancy is recognized, and if the patient is already on levothyroxine, the dose should be increased by about 25–30% immediately; RCOG suggests either doubling two days per week or adding 25 mcg/day if total dose is ≤ 100 mcg, or 50 mcg/day if > 100 mcg, which helps preempt rising TSH in early gestation [^111CMNqj]. Wait, let me verify the monitoring cadence; for women at risk of hypothyroidism or on therapy, TSH should be checked approximately every 4 weeks through midgestation and at least once near 30 weeks, which is a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence [^113uC6tY] [^1175dRpW]. I should confirm the first-trimester target; in the absence of trimester-specific ranges, aim for TSH less than 2.5 mIU/L, recognizing that local trimester-specific reference ranges are preferred when available [^111ApyFT] [^11521p1H].

> I will now examine trimester-specific targets and monitoring through gestation. Let me think about the progression; if trimester-specific ranges are unavailable, pragmatic upper limits of 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 mIU/L are reasonable for first, second, and third trimesters, respectively, while striving to keep TSH in the lower half of the trimester-specific range when available [^11521p1H] [^111ApyFT]. I should double-check that dose adjustments are followed by reassessment of TSH about 4 weeks later to ensure stability, and that ongoing surveillance continues given dynamic changes across trimesters [^113uC6tY].

> Now, I need to ensure I am precise about when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism and how to handle thyroid autoimmunity. Overt hypothyroidism in pregnancy warrants immediate levothyroxine therapy, which is a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence [^117XQens] [^113j57X3]. For subclinical hypothyroidism, I should confirm that treatment is indicated when TSH exceeds the pregnancy-specific upper limit with positive anti-TPO antibodies, or when TSH is 10.0 mIU/L or higher regardless of antibody status, given elevated risks of adverse outcomes and progression [^113FQXAV]. But wait, what if TSH is 2.5–10.0 mIU/L with positive antibodies and the patient has a history of pregnancy loss; here, treatment can be considered, though evidence quality is low and recommendations are weak, so shared decision-making is essential [^112L1AZE] [^112s8GfS]. I should also remember not to treat isolated hypothyroxinemia during pregnancy, as trials have not shown benefit and guidelines advise against routine therapy in this scenario [^114yRr9j] [^117BZ7kC].

> Next, I should review postpartum management and the risk of postpartum thyroiditis. Hold on, I should verify dose reduction timing; after delivery, levothyroxine should be returned to the preconception dose, and TSH should be rechecked about 6 weeks postpartum, with the recognition that some patients may require higher doses postpartum due to evolving autoimmunity, so individualized reassessment is prudent [^111zZzqZ] [^114FL39f]. I need to ensure we communicate maternal thyroid history to the neonatologist or pediatrician, and consider pediatric endocrinology input if disease was severe or complex during pregnancy [^113dJ7KX]. Let me reconsider postpartum thyroiditis risk; women who were euthyroid with Hashimoto's in early pregnancy have a markedly higher risk of PPT than those already hypothyroid on therapy, and recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies is substantial, so annual TSH screening after PPT is recommended given the 10–50% risk of permanent hypothyroidism [^114aUbc7] [^114TPHbC] [^112ig2PY].

> I should confirm special scenarios, including infertility and assisted reproduction. For overt hypothyroidism, treat to normalize thyroid function before attempting conception, as this improves fertility and pregnancy outcomes, which is a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence [^116nE83o] [^115D7mfr]. For euthyroid women with thyroid autoimmunity attempting natural conception, evidence is insufficient to mandate levothyroxine solely to improve fertility, though some guidelines allow consideration in select contexts given minimal risk; in women undergoing ART who are TPOAb-positive, a low-dose trial of 25–50 mcg/day may be reasonable despite limited evidence, so shared decision-making is key [^113Xy3Si] [^115VcMj1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought levothyroxine clearly improves live birth in TPOAb-positive women, but I should correct that; a meta-analysis of randomized trials did not show improved live birth or reduced miscarriage with levothyroxine in TPOAb-positive women, underscoring the uncertainty and the need to individualize decisions, especially outside ART settings [^114Ezz8R].

> Let me consider lactation and iodine next. I should confirm that treating maternal hypothyroidism is compatible with breastfeeding and is recommended when indicated, as untreated disease can impair lactation, and levothyroxine is safe during nursing [^114AEP6B]. I need to ensure iodine guidance is clear; daily 150–200 mcg iodine is advised during lactation, and in severely iodine-deficient settings without universal salt iodization, a single 400 mg oral iodized oil dose postpartum can be used, though this is not routinely needed where iodine sufficiency exists [^112jmWW6].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and verify alignment with major guidelines. Preconception: optimize TSH to less than 2.5 mIU/L, start iodine 150 mcg/day, and use risk-based screening to identify who needs TSH testing; upon pregnancy confirmation: increase levothyroxine by 25–30% promptly, check TSH every 4 weeks through midgestation and at least once near 30 weeks, and target TSH in the lower half of trimester-specific ranges or the pragmatic 2.5/3.0/3.5 mIU/L cutoffs if local ranges are unavailable; postpartum: revert to the preconception levothyroxine dose 2 weeks after delivery and recheck TSH at 6 weeks, with heightened vigilance for postpartum thyroiditis and annual TSH thereafter in those affected; throughout, individualize treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism and euthyroid autoimmunity using shared decision-making given variable evidence quality [^113aVCb4] [^111CMNqj] [^113uC6tY] [^111ApyFT] [^117TYssA] [^111zZzqZ] [^114TPHbC] [^112s8GfS] [^112L1AZE].

---

Hashimoto's thyroiditis in pregnancy requires **preconception TSH optimization** to < 2.5 mIU/L and a **25–30% levothyroxine dose increase** immediately after a positive pregnancy test to meet increased thyroid hormone demands [^113aVCb4] [^111CMNqj]. TSH should be monitored **every 4 weeks** through mid-pregnancy and at least once near 30 weeks, with dose adjustments to maintain trimester-specific targets [^113uC6tY]. Untreated or undertreated hypothyroidism increases risks of miscarriage, preterm birth, and neurocognitive impairment, so **prompt recognition and treatment are essential** [^116H7H3x] [^1157XMmX]. Postpartum, return to the pre-pregnancy levothyroxine dose and recheck TSH at 6 weeks, as dose needs often normalize after delivery [^111zZzqZ].

---

## Physiological changes in thyroid function during pregnancy

Pregnancy significantly alters thyroid physiology, increasing thyroid hormone requirements by about **50%** due to increased thyroxine-binding globulin, placental deiodinase activity, and fetal hormone transfer. These changes can unmask or worsen hypothyroidism in women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^111Wytoy].

---

## Preconception management

Preconception care aims to **optimize thyroid function** to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes:

- **TSH target**: Achieve TSH < 2.5 mIU/L before conception [^113aVCb4].
- **Levothyroxine adjustment**: Increase dose by 25–30% immediately after a positive pregnancy test to prevent hypothyroidism [^111CMNqj].
- **Counseling**: Inform patients of increased levothyroxine needs during pregnancy and the importance of early dose adjustment [^1151Wxbj].

---

## Management during pregnancy

### Monitoring thyroid function

Regular monitoring is critical to ensure **euthyroidism** throughout pregnancy:

| **Trimester** | **Monitoring frequency** | **TSH target** |
|-|-|-|
| First trimester | Every 4 weeks | < 2.5 mIU/L |
| Second trimester | Every 4 weeks | < 3.0 mIU/L |
| Third trimester | At least once near 30 weeks | < 3.5 mIU/L |

---

These targets are **trimester-specific** and should be adjusted based on laboratory reference ranges [^11521p1H].

---

### Levothyroxine therapy adjustments

Levothyroxine dose should be titrated to maintain TSH within trimester-specific ranges, with dose adjustments based on **TSH measurements every 4 weeks** [^113uC6tY]. If TSH rises above the target, increase the dose by 25–50 mcg as needed [^notfound].

---

### Potential complications of untreated or undertreated hypothyroidism

Untreated or undertreated hypothyroidism in pregnancy is associated with **significant maternal and fetal risks**:

- **Maternal complications**: Increased risk of miscarriage, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and postpartum hemorrhage [^112tf9mG].
- **Fetal complications**: Increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and neurocognitive impairment [^116Zv9Px].

---

## Postpartum management

Postpartum thyroid function often returns to pre-pregnancy levels, but **continued monitoring is essential**:

- **Levothyroxine dose adjustment**: Return to pre-pregnancy dose within 2 weeks postpartum [^117TYssA].
- **TSH monitoring**: Check TSH at 6 weeks postpartum to assess thyroid function and adjust therapy as needed [^111zZzqZ].
- **Postpartum thyroiditis**: Monitor for postpartum thyroiditis, which occurs in approximately 5% of women and may require temporary or long-term therapy [^116KYNbP].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Effective management of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in pregnancy requires **coordinated care** among endocrinologists, obstetricians, and primary care providers. Regular communication and shared decision-making are essential to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes [^116H7H3x].

---

Hashimoto's thyroiditis in pregnancy requires **careful management** to prevent maternal and fetal complications. Preconception TSH optimization, early pregnancy levothyroxine dose adjustment, and regular monitoring are critical. Postpartum care ensures safe return to pre-pregnancy thyroid function.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^116P4eRV]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association pregnancy thyroid disease guideline — therapeutic interventions recommendation strength links evidence quality to interpretation as follows: Under strong recommendation, high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trial (RCT) without important limitations or overwhelming evidence from observational studies and moderate-quality evidence from RCT with important limitations or strong evidence from observational studies can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation, whereas with low-quality evidence from observational studies/case studies the interpretation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available. Under weak recommendation, high- and moderate-quality evidence state that the best action may differ based on circumstances or patients' values, and with low-quality evidence other alternatives may be equally reasonable. When evidence is insufficient, evidence is conflicting, of poor quality, or lacking and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against.

The following constitutes key background information on Hashimoto's thyroiditis:

- **Definition**: HT, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and autoimmune thyroiditis, is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland, leading to its gradual destruction and hypothyroidism.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of HT involves progressiveimmune-mediated destruction of the thyroid gland, driven by genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Infiltration by T and B lymphocytes and the production of anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies contribute to follicular damage and impaired hormone synthesis, ultimately leading to hypothyroidism. Histologic findings include parenchymal atrophy, lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, fibrosis, and Hurthle cell metaplasia.
- Epidemiology: HT is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions. The annual incidence is estimated at 0.3–1.5 cases per 1,000 individuals. Global adult prevalence is approximately 7.5%, with rates of 17.5% in women and 6.0% in men. It predominantly affects women, with a female-to-male ratio of 10:1, and is most commonly diagnosed between ages 30–50.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include female sex, advancing age, personal or family history of autoimmune disease, genetic predisposition involving HLA-DR and CTLA-4 polymorphisms, high iodine intake, exposure to radiation, an d certain medications (such as interferon-alpha, amiodarone) and medical treatments (such as radioactive iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism, external beam radiation therapy for head and neck malignancies, and thyroid surgery). Some infections and environmental stressors may also contribute.
- **Disease course**: HT is a chronic and progressive condition, with many patients remaining asymptomatic and euthyroid for years before developing overt hypothyroidism. Some experience phases of subclinical hypothyroidism. Progression to hypothyroidism is more likely in patients with high antibody titers or TSH elevation at presentation. When symptoms occur, they are usually related to hypothyroidism and include fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, bradycardia, dry skin, and depression. A painless, diffusely enlarged thyroid (goiter) may be present. In some cases, transient hyperthyroidism may occur due to follicular rupture and hormone release. Related risks and complications include infertility, miscarriage, myxedema, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular risk due to untreated hypothyroidism. There is a small increased risk of thyroid lymphoma. Goitrous enlargement may cause compressive symptoms in rare cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: With appropriate treatment, prognosis is excellent. Most patients on levothyroxine remain euthyroid and symptomatically well. However, long-term monitoring is needed, as dosage adjustments may be required over time due to progression or other factors such as weight changes or pregnancy.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^114ij2Ay]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association pregnancy thyroid disease guideline — diagnostic interventions recommendation strength specifies that a strong recommendation with high- or moderate-quality evidence implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances without reservation, while with low-quality evidence it implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances, but the utilization of the test may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available. For a weak recommendation, with high-quality evidence the degree to which the diagnostic test is seriously considered may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values, with moderate-quality evidence it may differ depending on individual patients'/ practice circumstances or patients' or societal values, and with low-quality evidence alternative options may be equally reasonable. An insufficient rating notes evidence may be of such poor quality, conflicting, lacking (i.e., studies not done), or not externally generalizable to the target clinical population such that the estimate of the true effect of the test is uncertain and does not permit a reasonable conclusion to be made, concluding insufficient evidence exists to recommend for or against routinely offering the diagnostic test.

### Assessment and treatment of thyroid disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period [^111Wytoy]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid disorders are prevalent in pregnant women. Furthermore, thyroid hormone has a critical role in fetal development and thyroid dysfunction can adversely affect obstetric outcomes. Thus, the appropriate management of hyperthyroidism, most commonly caused by Graves disease, and hypothyroidism, which in iodine sufficient regions is most commonly caused by Hashimoto thyroiditis, in pregnancy is important for the health of both pregnant women and their offspring. Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis can also occur during pregnancy and should be differentiated from Graves disease. Effects of thyroid autoimmunity and subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy remain controversial. Iodine deficiency is the leading cause of hypothyroidism worldwide. Despite global efforts to eradicate iodine deficiency disorders, pregnant women remain at risk of iodine deficiency due to increased iodine requirements during gestation. The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide, including in young adults. As such, the diagnosis of thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer during pregnancy is becoming more frequent. The evaluation and management of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer in pregnancy pose a particular challenge. Postpartum thyroiditis can occur up to 1 year after delivery and must be differentiated from other forms of thyroid dysfunction, as treatment differs. This Review provides current evidence and recommendations for the evaluation and management of thyroid disorders in pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

### Transient Graves' hyperthyroidism during pregnancy in a patient with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism [^113sStL1]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

The course and severity of autoimmune thyroid disease are altered during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The thyroidal response to a fluctuating immune status, combined with changes in thyroid economy during pregnancy, may result in a need to adjust the treatment regimen for thyroid disease during pregnancy. Patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism on thyroid hormone replacement are frequently observed to have an increased requirement for levothyroxine early in pregnancy, although this is not a universal finding. Hashimoto's hypothyroidism does not typically remit during pregnancy, although further progression of thyroiditis may be seen in the postpartum period. Graves' disease usually improves during pregnancy and flares after delivery, again necessitating monitoring of thyroid status and possible adjustments in thionamide therapy. However, spontaneous transformation from Hashimoto's hypothyroidism to Graves' disease during pregnancy is rare. We report a case of transient Graves' hyperthyroidism during the late second trimester in a patient on levothyroxine replacement for Hashimoto's hypothyroidism. This resulted in a need to discontinue the patient's thyroid hormone entirely to avoid exacerbation of her hyperthyroidism. This interesting case is presented, along with a discussion of how the expression of autoimmune thyroid disease may be altered during pregnancy.

Overt thyroid dysfunction and infertility — associations and treatment rationale are described. In hyperthyroidism, menstrual irregularities were present in 22% of patients versus 8% of age- and weight-matched euthyroid controls, and among hypothyroid women with TSH concentrations > 15 mIU/L, 68% reported irregular menses compared with 12% of euthyroid controls. In infertile populations, 5% had serum TSH levels > 4.5 mIU/L in one cross-sectional study, and among women aged 18–50 years the prevalence of infertility was 5.2% in women with GD and 4% among women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid dysfunction is also reversible, and treatment is generally safe and may exert a positive effect on fertility; therefore, it is reasonable to treat overt thyroid dysfunction in infertile women, with the goal of normalizing thyroid function.

### Increased postpartum thyroxine replacement in Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^111GCvXu]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The thyroidal response of pregnant patients with established Hashimoto's thyroiditis remains poorly described. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of pregnancy on Hashimoto's thyroiditis as revealed by changes in postpregnancy levothyroxine requirements.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of 799 hypothyroid patients in a university hospital. We reviewed the clinical records and selected a group of well-documented pregnant (n = 34) and nonpregnant (n = 32) hypothyroid women for study. We reviewed levothyroxine intake and serum thyrotropin (TSH) levels during three consecutive 9-month time intervals that were immediately before, during, and after pregnancy. We compared the percent change in levothyroxine dose between the prepregnancy level and each trimester during and after pregnancy.

Results

There were two patterns of levothyroxine supplementation during gestation. In pattern 1 (n = 11) there was either no change or a single levothyroxine dose increase with no subsequent changes in each trimester (T1 = T2 = T3). In pattern 2 (n = 18), multistep levothyroxine dose increases were required throughout pregnancy (T1 < T2 < T3) to maintain desired TSH levels (< 2.0 mU/L). Women with pattern 2 had mean TSH levels during gestation that differed significantly from pattern 1 (2.8 ± 0.5 vs. 1.3 ± 0.1 mU/L respectively; p < 0.03). Further, in multivariate logistic regression, women with pattern 2 were 62 times more likely than women with pattern 1 to have a levothyroxine dose at least 20% above baseline at 3 months postpartum (p = 0.04).

Conclusions

We showed that > 50% of hypothyroid women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis experienced an increase in levothyroxine requirements in the postpartum compared to pregestational doses. This pattern of enhanced levothyroxine need was most likely dependent on the preexisting thyroid functional reserve and postpartum progression of autoimmune destruction.

### Autoimmune diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes: an umbrella review [^113efg5C]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The main strength of this umbrella review is the comprehensive search strategy with no language or time restrictions and searches that were repeated periodically to include newly published systematic reviews. Secondly, we included a wide range of autoimmune conditions and adverse pregnancy outcomes which were identified by scoping searches of the literature and after consultation with subject experts, making this review more relevant and useful. Definitions of the outcomes for inclusion were predefined so that these were uniform across the systematic reviews. The summary estimates have been converted to odds ratios where possible to facilitate the interpretation of the results.

The main limitation of this umbrella review was that we were not able to include certain autoimmune conditions and their effects on pregnancy outcomes if there were no systematic reviews. For example, there were primary studies reporting the association of vitiligo with adverse pregnancy outcome, but no systematic review has been conducted on this topic. None of the included reviews were rated high quality following the AMSTAR2 checklist and were all either moderate or low quality, which affected the overall certainty of the evidence in this umbrella review. There was high heterogeneity between the reviews. Most of the included reviews had multiple outcomes, and in many instances, the sample size of the primary studies used for measuring the outcome in the systematic review was small, thus providing large variation in the effect size. Some reviews restricted the search strategy (e.g. time period or type of study), and the number of studies included in the meta-analysis was small meaning there could be some publication bias. Even though we attempted to include the majority of common autoimmune conditions, not all of them could be included (i.e. antiphospholipid syndrome and dermatomyositis). Another limitation is that this review cannot address the effects of co-morbidities on outcomes, for example, increased risk of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in SLE which might be the cause of the outcomes rather than SLE directly. For the outcome caesarean delivery, the reviews did not specify or analysed the indications, and therefore, it remains unclear if the increased risk was caused by the disease activity, medications, or other factors including patient or physician preference. This umbrella review provides comprehensive evidence on the adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with autoimmune conditions. No systematic reviews identified for thyroid diseases Grave's disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis; however, there was an extensive research for thyroid autoimmunity and effects on pregnancy outcome. Hence, this review has incorporated thyroid autoimmunity as a whole and consolidate the findings in this area. Other diseases not included are vitiligo, Addison's disease, or alopecia areata for which there are no prior systematic reviews. Two of the retrospective cohort studies identified exploring the association of vitiligo with spontaneous miscarriage reported significant association with OR 1.25 (1.14–1.36) and aHR 1.16 (1.09–1.25) when compared with women without vitiligo. Other studies showed no significant association of vitiligo with risk of preterm birth, GDM, or stillbirth. Two different studies reported Addison's disease was associated with almost twofold increase in the risk of preterm birth and caesarean section compared to women without the condition. One of the cohort studies showed that women with alopecia areata had a greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy with OR 1.09 (1.00–1.18) and OR 1.28 (1.13–1.46) respectively. There are also other rare autoimmune conditions that were beyond the scope of this review (e.g. myositis, vasculitis) which may be associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Small for gestational age, pregnancy loss, IUGR, preeclampsia, and preterm birth and miscarriage has been associated with the connective tissue diseases. The drugs used for the treatment of these autoimmune conditions such as biological and conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), oral glucocorticoids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can also affect the pregnancy outcomes, and various studies have been conducted to estimate which medication pose higher risk than others. However, active inflammatory disease has been shown to increase the risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, small for gestational age babies, and preterm delivery. Understanding the contribution of disease activity and the effect of pregnancy on the disease and vice versa has not been addressed in this review and will require further research. Similarly, understanding the risk of these medications and how they contribute towards adverse pregnancy outcomes need to be researched and guidelines need to be formulated. Furthermore, the effect of the autoimmunity in women during pregnancy also might affect the offspring, and they have been linked with learning disabilities, dyslexia, and autism. Further research of the associations of these conditions with pregnancy outcomes is therefore warranted.

Although no prospective, randomized LT4 trials in overtly hypothyroid pregnant women exist and such a study would be unethical, available data confirm the benefits of treating severe hypothyroidism during pregnancy.

Risk is higher with autoimmunity, including "3–4 times higher in women with diabetes mellitus type 1", and frequencies of "25% in women with chronic viral hepatitis", "14% in women with systemic lupus erythematosus", "44% in women with a prior history of GD", and "27% in patients with antipituitary antibodies". Recurrence is common, as "Individuals who have recovered fully from PPT have a 70% chance of developing PPT in each subsequent pregnancy". Additional notes include that "Women on LT4 therapy secondary to Hashimoto's thyroiditis may develop PPT if their thyroid gland is not completely atrophic", and that after pregnancy loss, "the prevalence of PPT… is unknown".

### Management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116Zv9Px]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective is to provide clinical guidelines for the management of thyroid problems present during pregnancy and in the postpartum.

Participants

The Chair was selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society. The Chair requested participation by the Latin American Thyroid Society, the Asia and Oceania Thyroid Society, the American Thyroid Association, the European Thyroid Association, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and each organization appointed a member to the task force. Two members of The Endocrine Society were also asked to participate. The group worked on the guidelines for 2 yr and held two meetings. There was no corporate funding, and no members received remuneration.

Evidence

Applicable published and peer-reviewed literature of the last two decades was reviewed, with a concentration on original investigations. The grading of evidence was done using the United States Preventive Services Task Force system and, where possible, the GRADE system.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved through conference calls, two group meetings, and exchange of many drafts by E-mail. The manuscript was reviewed concurrently by the Society's CGS, Clinical Affairs Committee, members of The Endocrine Society, and members of each of the collaborating societies. Many valuable suggestions were received and incorporated into the final document. Each of the societies endorsed the guidelines.

Conclusions

Management of thyroid diseases during pregnancy requires special considerations because pregnancy induces major changes in thyroid function, and maternal thyroid disease can have adverse effects on the pregnancy and the fetus. Care requires coordination among several healthcare professionals. Avoiding maternal (and fetal) hypothyroidism is of major importance because of potential damage to fetal neural development, an increased incidence of miscarriage, and preterm delivery. Maternal hyperthyroidism and its treatment may be accompanied by coincident problems in fetal thyroid function. Autoimmune thyroid disease is associated with both increased rates of miscarriage, for which the appropriate medical response is uncertain at this time, and postpartum thyroiditis. Fine-needle aspiration cytology should be performed for dominant thyroid nodules discovered in pregnancy. Radioactive isotopes must be avoided during pregnancy and lactation. Universal screening of pregnant women for thyroid disease is not yet supported by adequate studies, but case finding targeted to specific groups of patients who are at increased risk is strongly supported.

### Management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116AUGq3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to update the guidelines for the management of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy and postpartum published previously in 2007. A summary of changes between the 2007 and 2012 version is identified in the Supplemental Data (published on The Endocrine Society's Journals Online web site at http://jcem.endojournals.org).

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed according to the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force, grading items level A, B, C, D, or I, on the basis of the strength of evidence and magnitude of net benefit (benefits minus harms) as well as the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

The guideline was developed through a series of e-mails, conference calls, and one face-to-face meeting. An initial draft was prepared by the Task Force, with the help of a medical writer, and reviewed and commented on by members of The Endocrine Society, Asia and Oceania Thyroid Association, and the Latin American Thyroid Society. A second draft was reviewed and approved by The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated substantive changes.

Conclusions

Practice guidelines are presented for diagnosis and treatment of patients with thyroid-related medical issues just before and during pregnancy and in the postpartum interval. These include evidence-based approaches to assessing the cause of the condition, treating it, and managing hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, gestational hyperthyroidism, thyroid autoimmunity, thyroid tumors, iodine nutrition, postpartum thyroiditis, and screening for thyroid disease. Indications and side effects of therapeutic agents used in treatment are also presented.

Thyroid autoimmunity and prevalence considerations informing screening: Overt hypothyroidism is prevalent in 0.3%–0.5% of pregnant women and is asymptomatic in about 70% of patients. Anti-TPO positivity occurs in up to 17% of reproductive age women and identifies women at risk for developing hypothyroidism during gestation (20%) and postpartum thyroiditis (30–50%). Screening programs described elsewhere often have initial evaluation between 10 and 15 weeks of gestation, and no data support an anti-TPO–based universal testing algorithm at present.

### Preconception management of hyperthyroidism and thyroid status in subsequent pregnancy: a population-based cohort study [^1111W44N]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Given these challenges, many endocrinologists offer definitive treatment with radioactive iodine or surgery to women with hyperthyroidism who plan to get pregnant in the future. This reduces risks of Graves disease relapse or exposure to antithyroid drugs in the ensuing pregnancy. However, these women will usually require thyroid hormone replacement in the form of levothyroxine prior to pregnancy. We have previously shown using UK primary care data that most women with hypothyroidism established on levothyroxine prior to pregnancy have suboptimal control during pregnancy, which is associated with increased odds of fetal loss. While the majority of patients with treated hypothyroidism have autoimmune Hashimoto thyroiditis, this small proportion of patients with prior definitive treatment for hyperthyroidism may be particularly vulnerable to hypothyroidism in pregnancy due to extremely limited thyroid reserve and may therefore fail to meet the increased thyroid demands of pregnancy.

However, there are limited data on the impact of these various preconception strategies on thyroid status in subsequent pregnancy, and it is unclear how much this matter is discussed when counseling women who are offered definitive treatment. We therefore sought to determine trends in the management of hyperthyroidism before and during pregnancy and to explore the impact of different management strategies in women with pre-existing hyperthyroidism on maintaining optimal thyroid status during pregnancy using a national UK clinical research database.

### Postpartum thyroiditis in women with euthyroid and hypothyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis antedating pregnancy [^114aUbc7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) is defined as the occurrence of de novo autoimmune thyroid disease accompanied by thyroid dysfunction in the first year postpartum. However, hormonal changes resembling the typical pattern of PPT have been reported to occur even in women with pregestational Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) on levothyroxine (LT4).

Objective

To evaluate the risk of PPT in women with HT antedating pregnancy.

Design/Setting

Retrospective chart review of pregnant women with HT antedating pregnancy seen in a university hospital (2008–2017), who were followed from preconception up to 1 year after delivery.

Patients

167 women preconceptionally diagnosed with HT and classified as hypothyroid HT (hypo-HT; n = 98) or euthyroid HT (eu-HT; n = 69), according to their thyroid status at the time of diagnosis.

Outcome Measures

PPT occurrence and associated clinical characteristics/risk factors.

Results

PPT occurred in 65/167 women, with a rate statistically greater in the eu-HT than in the hypo-HT group (68.1% vs 18.4%; odds ratio [OR] 9.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.62–19.49). Most of the women experiencing PPT in both groups were euthyroid at the time of first-trimester evaluation (39/47 eu-HT [83%] and 16/18 hypo-HT [88.9%]). Multivariate regression analysis showed eu-HT group and first-trimester euthyroidism to be positively associated with PPT occurrence (ORs 10.71 and 3.89, respectively).

Conclusion

PPT may occur in hypo-HT women on LT4 therapy, although significantly less frequently than in eu-HT women. The 4-fold higher risk of PPT in HT women maintaining euthyroidism at first -trimester of gestation suggests that the risk of PPT could be related to the amount of unaffected thyroid tissue.

Women with thyroid autoimmunity should be monitored with regular thyroid function tests preconception and during gestation to identify women who develop hypothyroidism. The effectiveness of thyroid hormone treatment in reducing adverse outcomes in pregnancy has been studied in a number of randomized controlled trials. Current evidence shows obstetrical benefits of levothyroxine treatment in pregnant women with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 4 mU/L.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^111EDA9E]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid disease in pregnancy is a common clinical problem. Since the guidelines for the management of these disorders by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) were first published in 2011, significant clinical and scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease in women during pregnancy, preconception, and the postpartum period.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations. The guideline task force had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid disease in pregnancy include recommendations regarding the interpretation of thyroid function tests in pregnancy, iodine nutrition, thyroid autoantibodies and pregnancy complications, thyroid considerations in infertile women, hypothyroidism in pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy, thyroid nodules and cancer in pregnant women, fetal and neonatal considerations, thyroid disease and lactation, screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy, and directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid disease in pregnant and postpartum women. While all care must be individualized, such recommendations provide, in our opinion, optimal care paradigms for patients with these disorders.

### The role of iodine for thyroid function in lactating women and infants [^112hoJ6q]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Lactating women

Abnormal thyroid function is common during the postpartum period and the incidence of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism increase markedly compared to before and during pregnancy. Thyroid dysfunction detected during the first year after birth in women with no previous history of thyroid disease is generally classified as postpartum thyroiditis, except if the diagnosis is Graves disease. Postpartum thyroiditis is an inflammatory subclinical autoimmune thyroid disorder associated with postpartum immune rebound as well as the presence of TPO antibodies during pregnancy. Postpartum autoimmune thyroiditis typically occurs 1 to 4 months after delivery with a prevalence of 5% and often develops from a previous subclinical thyroiditis that is exacerbated after delivery. In the classic form, transient thyrotoxicosis is followed by transient hypothyroidism returning to euthyroidism by the end of the initial postpartum year. Inflammatory processes in the thyroid gland result in release of T 4 and T 3 from the follicular cells, and synthesis of the thyroid hormones resumes when the inflammation subsides.

Iodine deficiency is a well-recognized risk factor for thyroid disorders in adults. The incidence of postpartum thyroiditis has not directly been demonstrated to be associated with iodine status. However, some studies, but not all, observed an increased risk for TPO antibody positivity in iodine excess, which in turn is associated with postpartum thyroiditis. Three small randomized studies have examined the effects of prenatal iodine supplementation on postpartum thyroiditis, but none of the studies observed a difference in frequency or severity of the condition. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of iodine supplementation (200 µg/day) to pregnant women in 2 mildly iodine-deficient populations observed no differences in maternal thyroid function tests, thyroid volume, or thyroid antibodies between groups during pregnancy or at 6 weeks post partum. Adequately powered studies are needed to exclude iodine deficiency as a risk factor for postpartum thyroiditis. A recent study in women with pregestational Hashimoto thyroiditis suggests that maternal thyroid status in early pregnancy predicts postpartum thyroiditis and that euthyroidism is associated with a higher rate of postpartum thyroiditis than hypothyroidism.

Abnormal maternal thyroid hormone concentrations can negatively affect the ability to successfully breastfeed. Women at particular risk of postpartum thyroiditis may be screened, but universal thyroid function screening post partum is not recommended.

Introduction

The adaptive changes in thyroid function during pregnancy primarily manifest as thyroid gland enlargement. This compensatory morphological alteration directly supports the increased demand for thyroid hormone synthesis, with its fundamental physiological significance lying in maintaining serum free thyroxine (fT4) levels within normal ranges. This regulatory process involves coordinated participation of multiple mechanisms: Pregnancy-associated hormonal changes not only induce a remarkable 50% elevation in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels, but also accelerate thyroid hormone metabolism through upregulation of placenta-specific deiodinase DIO3 activity, accompanied by a significant 30–50% enhancement in renal iodine excretion efficiency compared to baseline levels. Furthermore, the direct stimulatory effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on the thyroid gland warrants particular attention.

Pregnancy essentially serves as a biological stress test for thyroid function. In women with no preexisting thyroid pathology (defined as euthyroid status with negative thyroid antibodies), the thyroid gland demonstrates remarkable compensatory capacity. However, those with diminished thyroid reserve — particularly women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune disorder defined by TPO antibody positivity and lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland) — often cannot meet the increased hormonal demands of gestation, potentially developing subclinical or overt hypothyroidism. Similarly, conditions like Graves' disease and thyroid nodules can disrupt normal thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion, potentially resulting in hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.

Accumulating clinical evidence demonstrates that maternal thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy is significantly associated with adverse outcomes affecting both maternal and fetal health. Multiple observational studies have consistently shown that overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are linked to an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (SA), gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and preterm delivery. A study reporting the relationship between untreated hypothyroidism and SA showed that women with untreated hypothyroidism had a higher risk of SA compared with controls with normal thyroid function. Another study of 240 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and 10,518 control patients showed no difference in SA rates. Studies on recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) and thyroid disorders have been scarce. Only one study has concluded that thyroid disorders do not lead to an increased risk of RSA. Current evidence remains inconclusive regarding the thyroid disorder-SA/RSA relationship, as existing observational studies are inherently limited by potential confounding factors and cannot establish causal inference. To address these methodological constraints, we conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to: (1) investigate the potential causal effects of thyroid dysfunction on both SA and RSA, and (2) perform reverse MR to examine whether SA/RSA might reciprocally influence thyroid disorder risk.

Regarding medical management for thyroid disease in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to management of hyperthyroidism, pre-pregnancy care, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to evaluate whether antithyroid drug withdrawal in the first trimester of pregnancy is likely to cause relapse of hyperthyroidism, based on patient records, especially the severity of Graves' disease at time of diagnosis and current disease activity, duration of antithyroid drug therapy, current antithyroid drug dose requirement, and results of recent thyroid function and TSH receptor antibody testing. Consider withdrawing therapy if risk of relapse is considered low, followed by weekly thyroid function testing during the first trimester.

American Thyroid Association pregnancy guidelines — infertility and thyroid autoimmunity: Limited evidence links thyroid autoimmunity to infertility, including higher thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positivity in female-factor infertility and associations in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), with antithyroid antibodies tied to reduced follicular response to clomiphene. Evaluation of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is recommended for all women seeking infertility care (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). LT4 treatment is recommended for overt hypothyroidism once pregnancy is confirmed (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For subclinically hypothyroid, thyroid autoantibody–negative women attempting natural conception and not undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), administration of LT4 may be considered to prevent progression to more significant hypothyroidism and low dose LT4 therapy (25–50 μg/d) carries minimal risk (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For nonpregnant, thyroid autoantibody–positive euthyroid women attempting natural conception (not undergoing ART), insufficient evidence exists and no recommendation can be made (no recommendation, insufficient evidence).

### Autoimmune diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes: an umbrella review [^112UuQXB]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Systematic reviews reporting the associations between autoimmune conditions and adverse pregnancy outcomes were included. No language restriction was applied. The population considered were pregnant women without any age restriction. We did not include reviews where all women who were pregnant were as a result of assisted reproductive treatment because this presents with its own set of risks. The autoimmune conditions that were selected were those that were more common in women of reproductive age and after consultation with experts in the subject. Furthermore, a scoping search was conducted before finalising the list of exposures and outcomes. Autoimmune conditions included Addison's disease, alopecia areata, axial spondyloarthropathy (AxSpA), coeliac disease, IBD including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis (MS), myasthenia gravis, psoriatic diseases (including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, SLE, systemic sclerosis, and thyroid autoimmunity (including Grave's disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and vitiligo.

The outcomes included were adverse pregnancy outcomes which were considered after consultations with experts (obstetricians and epidemiologists) and after input from patient public involvement and engagement (PPIE) group members. The outcomes definitions were defined prior, and definitions were compared between the reviews. The outcomes are listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Outcomes — adverse pregnancy outcomes

Systematic reviews were included with or without a meta-analysis. The identified reviews were carefully examined to determine whether the review qualified as systematic review. The reviews were excluded (1) if the review was not qualified as systematic review, e.g. scoping reviews, reviews, protocols, conference abstracts; (2) if they did not report the associations of the specified autoimmune conditions and adverse pregnancy outcome/s or (3) if studying the association of drugs for autoimmune conditions and the pregnancy outcome/s; (4) if comparing the effects of one autoimmune condition to another; and (5) duplicates.

Search strategy

Medline, Embase, and Cochrane database were systematically searched from the inception to 15 December 2023. A robust search strategy was used, and the systematic review filter was used to limit the searches. The search was repeated periodically to identify the latest published reviews. The Medical Subject Headings and free text search for autoimmune conditions (exposure) and pregnancy outcomes were used. The detailed search strategy for Medline is presented in Additional file 1: Table S3. This search strategy was adapted for use in other databases.

### Autoimmune thyroid disease during pregnancy [^114HhhQb]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Understanding of changes in thyroid function and the consequences of thyroid disease during pregnancy has rapidly grown in the past two decades, and revised American Thyroid Association guidelines on this topic were published in 2017. This Review explores the association between thyroid autoimmunity and complications during and after pregnancy. Thyroid autoimmunity refers to the presence of antibodies to thyroperoxidase or thyroglobulin, or thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAbs), or a combination of these, and is present in up to 18% of pregnant women. Thyroid antibodies in pregnant women with normal functioning thyroids (ie, euthyroid) have been associated with several complications, including miscarriage and premature delivery. Treatments to improve pregnancy outcomes are being studied. Whether thyroid antibodies are associated with infertility and assisted reproductive technology outcomes is unclear; although, treatment with low doses of levothyroxine, which is usually used to treat hypothyroidism, can be considered in such situations. Additionally, thyroid antibodies have been associated with other neonatal and maternal complications. All these associations require confirmation in larger prospective studies, and their pathogenic mechanisms need to be better understood. Post-partum thyroiditis is substantially more frequent in women who have thyroid antibodies during pregnancy than in those who do not have thyroid antibodies; however, whether treatment can prevent post-partum thyroiditis in women who are or have been antibody positive is unknown. Finally, TRAbs cross the placenta from the mother to the fetus and can cause fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism. Therefore, women who are positive for TRAbs during pregnancy should be monitored.

Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy — treatment uncertainties, medication risks, and screening debate — remains unresolved, with concern for teratogenicity and severity-dependent risks. Studies have recently questioned the optimal treatment of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy; reports have detailed the potential teratogenic effects of the antithyroid medications methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU), and while mild hyperthyroidism appears safe for the mother and fetus, moderate to severe hyperthyroidism can prove dangerous. Regarding screening, many have suggested universally evaluating thyroid function in all women either before or during pregnancy, yet to date studies appear to show mixed conclusions.

### Effect of levothyroxine on pregnancy outcomes in women with thyroid autoimmunity: a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Ezz8R]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether levothyroxine is associated with improved live birth and other benefits in women with thyroid autoimmunity.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Women positive for thyroid peroxidase antibody.

Intervention(S)

MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched without any language restrictions. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

The primary outcome was the incidence of live birth, miscarriage, preterm birth, clinical pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, neonatal admission, and birth weight. The summary measures were reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval.

Result(S)

Levothyroxine supplementation was not associated with an increased rate of live birth or a decreased risk of miscarriage. Results were similar in subgroup analyses of live birth by age, baseline thyrotropin, baseline thyroid peroxidase antibody, body mass index, and use of assisted conception. For live birth, the effect estimate lay within the futility boundary for RR of 20% and 15%, but at a 10% RR, the effect estimate lay between the futility boundary and the inferior boundary.

Conclusion(S)

High- to moderate-quality evidence demonstrated that the use of levothyroxine was not associated with improvements in clinical pregnancy outcomes among women positive for thyroid peroxidase antibody.

### ACOG practice bulletin on thyroid disease in pregnancy… [^112qs6i3]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Thyroid Function During Pregnancy Normal pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism affect thyroid function test results. In pregnancy, the values influenced by the serum thyroid binding hormone level change significantly. Plasma iodide levels decrease as a result of fetal iodide use and increased maternal renal clearance. In about 15 percent of pregnant women, these lower iodide levels are associated with a noticeable increase in thyroid gland size. Graves' disease and its treatment increase fetal and neonatal risks. Fetal thyrotoxicosis needs to be considered in women who have a history of Graves' disease; if this condition is diagnosed, appropriate consultation should be sought. Because of antibodies that cross the placenta, the possibility of neonatal immune-mediated hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism is an additional concern.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Thyroidectomy should be reserved for women who do not respond to thioamide therapy. Treatment with iodine 131 is contraindicated in pregnant women. Fetal thyroid is unlikely to have been ablated if inadvertent exposure to this agent occurred before 10 weeks of gestation. If exposure occurred after this time, the woman needs to consider the risk of induced congenital hypothyroidism and whether pregnancy should be continued. Women should not breastfeed for four months after treatment with I-131. Depending on gestational age, fetal status should be evaluated with ultrasound examination, nonstress testing, or a biophysical profile. Unless deemed necessary, delivery during thyroid storm should be avoided. How should thyroid cancer be managed during pregnancy.

All thyroid nodules should be evaluated; up to 40 percent are found to be malignant. Thyroid cancer is treated with thyroidectomy and radiation. Thyroidectomy can be performed, preferably during the second trimester, but radiation therapy should not be administered until after the pregnancy. Management options for thyroid cancer are termination of the pregnancy followed by full treatment, treatment during pregnancy, and preterm or term delivery followed by full treatment. Gestational age and tumor characteristics affect the management choice. Women should not breastfeed for four months after I-131 treatment.

### Elucidating the association of thyroid dysfunction with pregnancy outcomes… [^112A1WqH]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The potential adverse outcomes in pregnancy or in the developing fetus associated with maternal thyroid function outside of the reference range have been apparent for decades. Yet, detailed understanding of this pathophysiologic interaction has proven complex, given the interplay of many variables that may modify risk. These variables include demographic and racial and ethnic differences in patient populations, the interplay of hormonal variables, and the complex associations of harm with the timing of gestation biochemical testing or levothyroxine intervention. The study by Yang and colleagues1 dramatically expands our knowledge of gestational thyroid pathophysiology, examining associations of maternal thyrotropin concentrations outside reference range obtained before pregnancy with adverse risk once conception is confirmed.

In the largest cohort analysis of its kind, to my knowledge, Yang et al1 found that both elevated and suppressed maternal serum thyrotropin concentrations were associated with decreasing ability to achieve a successful pregnancy as well as an increased risk that a successful pregnancy may be lost before 28 weeks of gestation. Still, these data from Yang and colleagues1 significantly strengthen our broad understanding of how maternal thyroid status is associated with gonadal function and in particular the process of oocyte maturation, ovulation, and potential for conception. Significant maternal thyroid dysfunction, both overactive and underactive, is associated with fertility and the ability to successfully conceive. For most patients, symptoms are readily apparent when overt thyroid disease ensues; thus, detection of such should warrant diagnostic testing, as well as treatment prior to attempted conception.

For patients actively treated with levothyroxine who are considering pregnancy, counselling remains critical so their thyroid status can be optimized before pregnancy by targeting a goal thyrotropin level in the lower half of the reference range, with instructions for quick notification of the health care system once pregnancy is detected. These new data do not yet suggest such a change to current practice, and the answer remains no at this time. Lessons learned from parallel questions asked in relation to patients with thyrotropin within reference range known to have TPOAb should resonate with many clinicians. Despite earlier associative data suggesting levothyroxine therapy may prove benefits with little risk, a recent blinded, prospective, and multicenter study demonstrated no association of levothyroxine treatment with fecundability.
