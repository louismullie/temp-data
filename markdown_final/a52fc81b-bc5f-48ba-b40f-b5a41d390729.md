## Question

When is insertion of a Foley catheter indicated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a Foley catheter should be inserted (and when it should not), spanning both urinary drainage and non-urinary uses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about differentiating urinary drainage indications from other procedural uses. Then, I should evaluate specific urinary indications such as retention, outlet obstruction, wound protection, immobilization, and palliative care. Next, I will consider perioperative use and critical care monitoring. After that, I need to screen for inappropriate uses and safer alternatives. Finally, I will address obstetric and emergent non-urinary indications and synthesize a concise decision algorithm to guide practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and primary purpose of a "Foley catheter". In most scenarios, we are referring to an indwelling urethral catheter used for bladder decompression, urine drainage, and monitoring; however, I need to remember that the same balloon catheter can be used transcervically for mechanical cervical ripening in induction of labor and even as a tamponade device for junctional hemorrhage in trauma, so distinguishing these aims is critical upfront to avoid conflating indications across very different settings [^115ztzVd] [^1118rPXm] [^115UDTYC].

> Next, I should review urinary retention and bladder outlet obstruction, because these are the canonical indications for an indwelling urethral Foley catheter. Severe urinary retention or outlet obstruction warrants decompression with a Foley; when retention is quantified, a postvoid residual greater than 300 mL is a practical threshold that supports intervention, but I need to check for an obstruction first because, in the absence of obstruction, clean intermittent catheterization is the preferred approach to minimize catheter-associated risks and should be considered before placing an indwelling device [^115ztzVd].

> Hold on, let me verify wound-related indications. An indwelling catheter is appropriate when uncontrolled incontinence would contaminate and impair healing of sacral, buttock, or perineal wounds; conversely, incontinence-associated dermatitis alone, without active wounds, is not an indication for a Foley, and external devices or toileting strategies should be prioritized instead to reduce device-related harm [^115ztzVd].

> I need to check immobilization-related needs. Prolonged immobilization that precludes safe use of a urinal or bedpan can justify an indwelling catheter, but I should not conflate this with convenience; documentation must make clear the functional inability to toilet rather than workflow convenience, consistent with appropriate-use frameworks developed for hospitalized patients [^115ztzVd] [^114NR77C].

> Let me consider palliative care. In terminally ill patients, a Foley catheter can be indicated to reduce the burden of frequent toileting and improve comfort at the end of life; even then, I should confirm goals of care and reassess ongoing need frequently to limit duration and mitigate catheter-associated risks [^115ztzVd].

> Now, perioperative use deserves careful scrutiny. Historically, duration thresholds such as "procedures longer than three hours" were used to justify routine placement for bladder decompression and urine output monitoring, but wait, I should double-check whether time alone remains defensible; contemporary appropriateness criteria and ERAS pathways emphasize selective use and early removal rather than routine placement based solely on case length, and emerging data show some procedures can omit a Foley without increasing postoperative urinary retention, for example mastectomy and uncomplicated primary THA/TKA, where short-term intraoperative Foley use did not reduce POUR compared with no catheter, reinforcing individualized risk assessment and prompt removal when used [^113gKLQU] [^1129eu4g] [^116Fw6NJ] [^112vZ5Nu].

> Next, I should review critical care monitoring indications. In patients whose fluid status must be assessed with strict hourly urine output and cannot be accurately determined by alternative means, indwelling catheterization is appropriate; obstetric severe preeclampsia/eclampsia protocols similarly call for Foley placement on admission to facilitate close renal and fluid monitoring during magnesium therapy, aligning with appropriateness criteria that restrict Foley use to settings where benefits clearly outweigh risks [^114NR77C] [^116oTWVi].

> I will now screen for common inappropriate uses. A Foley catheter should not be placed for staff convenience, for initial management of urinary incontinence absent wounds, or simply to obtain a urine culture from a patient who can void; observational data suggest that roughly 30% of hospital catheterizations are inappropriate, with harms rising with duration, so I need to ensure indications are documented and re-evaluated daily [^115ztzVd] [^112WBnF2].

> Let me pivot to obstetric indications, which are a separate category. For cervical ripening with an unfavorable cervix, a transcervical Foley balloon is an evidence-based mechanical method that achieves similar delivery outcomes to certain prostaglandin regimens, with lower rates of tachysystole and fetal heart rate abnormalities compared with some prostaglandin strategies; in patients with a prior cesarean, mechanical ripening is often preferred over prostaglandins due to lower uterine rupture risk, so I should confirm cervical status, fetal presentation, and membrane integrity before proceeding and tailor the ripening method accordingly [^1118rPXm] [^111w21XW] [^113yHwz8].

> But wait, what if the catheter is being considered for non-urinary hemorrhage control. In catastrophic penetrating groin or junctional hemorrhage with a small skin defect, a large-balloon Foley can serve as a tamponade adjunct when other methods fail or as part of a staged approach; this is an uncommon but critical non-urinary indication where rapid hemorrhage control takes precedence over conventional urinary considerations [^115UDTYC].

> I should now synthesize a practical decision algorithm. Indwelling urethral Foley catheter placement is indicated for severe urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction, for wound protection when incontinence threatens healing of sacral, buttock, or perineal wounds, for prolonged immobilization that precludes toileting, for palliative comfort in terminal illness, and for strict urine output monitoring when fluid status cannot otherwise be assessed, including severe preeclampsia/eclampsia; in perioperative care, use it only when specific patient or procedural factors justify it and remove within 24 hours when feasible, while in obstetrics, use a transcervical Foley for mechanical cervical ripening with an unfavorable cervix, and in trauma, consider balloon tamponade for select junctional hemorrhage scenarios [^115ztzVd] [^114NR77C] [^116oTWVi] [^112vZ5Nu] [^1118rPXm] [^115UDTYC].

> Conversely, I need to ensure it is not used for convenience, as first-line management of incontinence without wounds, or solely to obtain a urine culture in a patient who can void; I should consider alternatives first, notably clean intermittent catheterization for retention without obstruction, external devices for incontinence, and, when prolonged catheterization is anticipated or urethral access is not feasible, a suprapubic catheter as a strategic alternative to reduce urethral complications [^115ztzVd].

> Finally, I should double-check risk mitigation once a Foley is placed. To minimize catheter-associated urinary tract infection and other device-related harms, I need to use a closed drainage system, reassess need and remove as soon as indicated, apply quality-improvement policies that standardize indications and maintenance, and consider adjuncts such as hydrophilic-coated intermittent catheters when CIC is used; for patients discharged with a catheter after urogynecologic procedures, a catheter valve can be considered to improve satisfaction without increasing UTI risk, although indication for continued catheterization should be rechecked at each transition of care [^117SVS32] [^116abu8Y] [^115bL5j8] [^112nDrsH] [^114hyzfR].

Foley catheters are indicated for **acute urinary retention or obstruction**, **accurate urine output monitoring in critically ill patients**, and **perioperative use** in specific surgeries (urologic, pelvic, prolonged, or with anticipated large fluid shifts). Other uses include **cervical ripening for labor induction** [^1118rPXm] and **bladder irrigation for hematuria with clots**. Remove catheters **as soon as possible** to reduce CAUTI risk, and consider alternatives (intermittent or external catheters) when appropriate [^116abu8Y] [^115ztzVd].

---

## Indications for foley catheterization

### Acute urinary retention or obstruction

- **Acute urinary retention**: Inability to void with painful bladder distension.
- **Chronic urinary retention**: Persistent incomplete emptying with high post-void residuals.
- **Obstructive uropathy**: Prostatic hypertrophy, urethral strictures, or other mechanical obstruction [^115ztzVd].

---

### Accurate urine output monitoring

For accurate monitoring, **critically ill patients** may need precise urine measurement in the ICU or during major surgery; those with **hemodynamic instability** — such as shock, severe sepsis, or multi-organ failure — also require strict fluid balance monitoring [^114NR77C].

---

### Perioperative use

Perioperative indications include **urologic and pelvic surgeries**, **prolonged procedures (> 3 hours)**, and cases with **anticipated large fluid shifts** (e.g. significant fluid administration or blood loss).

---

### Bladder irrigation and hematuria management

Gross hematuria with clots warrants **continuous bladder irrigation** to prevent clot retention and obstruction.

---

### Cervical ripening and labor induction

Mechanical cervical ripening with a **Foley catheter balloon** is appropriate [^1118rPXm].

---

### Palliative care and comfort measures

In palliative care, use in **terminally ill patients** may be appropriate to provide comfort for those with limited mobility or severe incontinence [^115ztzVd].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

### Absolute contraindications

Absolute contraindications include suspected or confirmed **urethral injury** (e.g. pelvic fracture with blood at the meatus) and **allergy to catheter materials**, such as a known latex allergy (use silicone or latex-free alternatives).

---

### Relative contraindications

Relative contraindications include **recent urethral surgery** (e.g. urethral reconstruction or prostate surgery) and **severe urethral stricture**, where urethral narrowing increases the risk of trauma.

---

## Complications associated with foley catheterization

- **Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI)**: Most common complication, increasing with duration of catheterization [^117J5w41].
- **Urethral trauma and strictures**: Injury during insertion or prolonged use [^113gKLQU].
- **Bladder spasms and discomfort**: Common postoperative complication [^115ztzVd].
- **Hematuria**: Blood in urine due to trauma or irritation.
- **Catheter blockage**: Encrustation or clot formation causing obstruction [^113ZQU5P].

---

## Alternatives to foley catheterization

- **Intermittent catheterization**: Preferred for chronic retention or neurogenic bladder [^1163tDEW] [^112nDrsH].
- **External catheters**: Condom catheters for male patients with incontinence [^115ztzVd].
- **Suprapubic catheterization**: Long-term catheterization or when urethral catheterization is not feasible [^115ztzVd].

---

## Guidelines for catheter removal

Assess catheter necessity daily and **remove as soon as possible** to minimize CAUTI risk [^116abu8Y]. After removal, conduct a **trial of voiding** to assess bladder function, and provide **patient education** on catheter care and recognizing signs of complications [^115hXCEs].

---

Foley catheters are indicated for acute urinary retention, accurate urine output monitoring, perioperative use, bladder irrigation, cervical ripening, and palliative care. Remove **promptly** to minimize complications, and consider alternatives when appropriate.

### Urinary catheter management [^115ztzVd]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Family physicians often treat patients who require urinary management using external urinary devices, clean intermittent catheterization, or indwelling urinary catheterization. External urinary devices are indicated for urinary incontinence (postvoid residual less than 300 mL), urine volume measurement for hospitalized patients, nonsterile urine diagnostic testing, improved comfort for patients in hospice or palliative care, and fall prevention for high-risk patients.

Indwelling urinary catheterization is indicated for severe urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction; wound healing in the sacrum, buttocks, or perineal area; prolonged immobilization; and as a palliative measure for terminally ill patients. Clean intermittent catheterization is an alternative to indwelling urinary catheterization for acute or chronic urinary retention (postvoid residual greater than 300 mL) without bladder outlet obstruction, sterile urine testing, postvoid residual volume assessment, and wound healing.

Suprapubic catheter placement is considered when long-term catheterization is needed or urethral catheterization is not feasible. Urinary catheters should not be used solely for staff or caregiver convenience, incontinence-related dermatitis, urine culture procurement from a voiding patient, or initial incontinence management. Common complications of urinary catheter use include obstruction, bladder spasm, urine leakage, and skin breakdown of the sacrum, buttocks, or perineum. The risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections increases with the duration of catheter use.

### Michigan appropriate perioperative (MAP) criteria for urinary catheter use in common general and orthopaedic surgeries: Results obtained using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method [^113gKLQU]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary catheters, commonly known as Foley catheters, are frequently placed in patients undergoing surgical procedures. They serve to prevent bladder distention or incontinence in the anesthetized patient, as well as facilitate the measurement of urine output during and after surgery. Yet, urinary catheters are increasingly recognized as having the potential to harm patients, as illustrated in Figure 1. Infectious harms include catheter-associated urinary tract infections and the potential for drug-resistant infections and orthopedic prosthetic infections. Non-infectious harms, such as urethral pain, trauma, and mobility restrictions caused by a 1-point restraint to a urinary drainage device, are as common as infectious complications and lengthen hospitalizations. Furthermore, catheter use beyond 48 hours following surgery has been associated with an increase in hospital-acquired urinary tract infections and 30-day mortality, along with a decreased likelihood of discharge home. Unfortunately, significant variation in catheter use exists across routine surgical procedures, often varying by local training and clinician preferences.

- **Infectious and non-infectious urinary catheter complications**: Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).

Perioperative urinary catheter use has previously been considered routine, but more recent guidelines recommend using urinary catheters only when required and removing them as soon as possible postoperatively. Some procedure-specific literature reviews and protocols promote enhanced recovery after surgery.

### Urinary catheter management [^112nDrsH]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infections, specifically with respect to antimicrobial-coated catheters, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend the use of hydrophilic-coated catheters for intermittent catheterization in appropriate patients, as they decrease urethral microtrauma and risk of UTIs compared with nonhydrophilic catheters.

### Mechanical methods for induction of labour [^1118rPXm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Ten Eikelder 2016 examined safety outcomes between the induction of labour using a Foley catheter and misoprostol (any route, any dose). The study found less uterine hyperstimulation with FHR changes and less fetal distress necessitating a caesarean section when a Foley catheter was employed. Although the use of a Foley catheter may slightly increase the caesarean section rate, conventional statistical significance was not achieved, and there was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome. Notably, studies involving high-dose misoprostol were not excluded in Ten Eikelder 2016's review. In subgroup analyses for 25 mcg and 50 mcg vaginal misoprostol, there was no evidence of differences in safety outcomes.

In our review, no evidence for differences in infection-related outcomes between mechanical induction and other methods for induction of labour was found. However, the results regarding infection outcomes were too imprecise to draw a valid conclusion. McMaster 2015 addressed this issue by comparing labour induction with a balloon versus locally-applied prostaglandin across 26 trials. Their findings were consistent with ours, showing no evidence of differences in chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and neonatal infection. When infection outcomes were pooled, little or no difference was observed, suggesting that a Foley catheter does not increase the risk of infection compared to locally-applied prostaglandin.

### Urinary catheter management [^116abu8Y]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infections, specifically concerning the minimization of catheter use, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend regularly assessing the need for indwelling urinary catheters and removing them as soon as indicated.

### Is transcervical Foley catheter actually slower than prostaglandins in ripening the cervix? A randomized study [^114Zv3kC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the maximum time for cervical ripening, ranging from 24 to 12 hours, would influence the efficacy of a transcervical Foley catheter. It also aimed to compare this efficacy to that of a prostaglandin E(2) vaginal insert.

Three hundred ninety-seven women were randomly assigned to one of three groups:

- **Foley catheter left in place for a maximum of 24 hours**
- **Foley catheter left in place for a maximum of 12 hours**
- **Prostaglandin E(2) controlled-release vaginal insert**:

The primary outcome measured was vaginal delivery within 24 hours.

There were no differences in vaginal delivery rates overall. However, the proportion of women who achieved vaginal delivery within 24 hours was lower in the 24-hour Foley catheter group than in the other two groups: 24-hour Foley catheter (21.0%), 12-hour Foley catheter (59.8%), and vaginal prostaglandin E(2) (48.5%) [P < .0001].

Cutting the ripening time with a Foley catheter by half significantly increases the proportion of women who deliver vaginally within 24 hours, and this method yields efficacy similar to that of the prostaglandin E(2) vaginal insert.

### Induction of labour with a Foley catheter or oral misoprostol at term: The PROBAAT-II study, a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^111w21XW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). High credibility.

Induction of labour is a common obstetric procedure. Currently, different methods are employed for inducing labour in women with an unfavourable cervix. Recent findings demonstrated that in term women with an unfavorable cervix, the use of a Foley catheter, as compared to vaginal Prostaglandin E2 gel, results in a comparable vaginal delivery rate. A meta-analysis on the topic indicated lower rates of hyperstimulation and, likely as a result, fewer instances of postpartum haemorrhage. Misoprostol (PgE1) is another prostaglandin frequently utilized for labour induction and is recommended by the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). Misoprostol can be administered via vaginal, rectal, or oral routes. Evidence suggests that oral administration results in less asphyxia and hyperstimulation than vaginal administration. Currently, valid comparisons between oral misoprostol and the Foley catheter are lacking. Therefore, we propose a randomised controlled trial comparing the Foley catheter to oral misoprostol to assess safety and cost-effectiveness.

- **Methods/Design**: We plan a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label clinical trial among term pregnant women with a vital singleton in cephalic presentation, unfavorable cervix, intact membranes, and an indication for induction of labour. After informed consent is obtained, women will be randomly allocated by a web-based randomisation system to either a transcervical Foley catheter or oral misoprostol (50 mcg every 4 hours). The primary outcome will be a composite of complications of uterine hyperstimulation.

### Criteria-based audit on management of eclampsia patients at a tertiary hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania [^116oTWVi]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of eclampsia at MNH involve several steps. On admission, convulsions should be controlled with intravenous magnesium sulfate, airways and intravenous lines should be secured, and a Foley's catheter inserted into the bladder. Further convulsions after initiation of treatment should be controlled with an intravenous bolus of 2 grams of magnesium sulfate. Hypertension, defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 160/ ≥ 110 mmHg, should be managed with intermittent injections of hydralazine.

Baseline investigations include a complete blood cell count, serum urea and creatinine, blood sugar, liver function tests, and platelet count as indicated. The patient's airway should be secured. As soon as the patient is stable, labor is induced or augmented according to hospital protocols. Caesarean section under general anesthesia should be performed when there is an obstetrical indication. After delivery, patients should be kept under close monitoring, and the infusion of magnesium sulfate should continue for 24 hours since the last seizure or delivery, depending on what occurred last. A fully recovered and ambulant patient is transferred to the obstetric wards where care continues until discharge.

### Strategies for the removal of short-term indwelling urethral catheters in adults [^114ww2tz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Approximately 15% to 25% of all hospitalized patients have indwelling urethral catheters. These are mainly used to assist clinicians in accurately monitoring urine output during acute illness or following surgery, to treat urinary retention, and for investigative purposes.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to determine the best strategies for the removal of catheters from patients with a short-term indwelling urethral catheter. The main outcome of interest was the number of patients who required recatheterization following the removal of the indwelling urethral catheter.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 7 December 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 12 July 2006), EMBASE (January 1980 to 12 July 2006), CINAHL (January 1982 to 12 July 2006), Nursing Collection (January 1995 to January 2002), and reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. No language or other restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of alternative strategies for the removal of short-term indwelling urethral catheters on patient outcomes were considered for inclusion in the review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Eligibility of the trials for inclusion in the review, details of eligible trials, and the methodological quality of the trials were assessed independently by two reviewers.

### Management of foley catheter induction among nulliparous women: a retrospective study [^1126GDaf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The rates of induction of labour (IOL) are rising, ranging between 20–30% in developed countries. Both mechanical and pharmacological methods are used for IOL in women with an unfavourable cervix, and vaginal delivery rates are similar. WHO recommends the use of a balloon catheter for IOL [WHO Recommendations for Induction of Labour, World Health Organization, 2011]. However, both IOL methods are associated with induction failure and caesarean delivery. The risk of caesarean section in such cases is high, up to 50%, especially among nulliparous women. We found earlier that nulliparous women with prolonged pregnancy and Foley catheter IOL in our hospital had a high caesarean delivery rate of 37.3%.

The reasons for increased caesarean section rates are unclear, but they may in part relate to the subsequent management of induced labour. In addition, previous studies have shown that duration of labour correlates with the risk of maternal chorionamnionitis and neonatal infections. This highlights the need for additional studies. Thus, we wanted to further analyse the factors that may affect the progress of induced labour. The primary objective of the study was to describe labour outcomes in nulliparous women undergoing IOL by Foley catheter, while the secondary objective was to evaluate risk factors for caesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal infections.

### Speculum versus digital insertion of Foley catheter for induction of labor in nulliparas with unripe cervix: a randomized controlled trial [^115tyDRF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

A final-year trainee in a 4-year specialist training program with experience of a few hundred cases of digital Foley catheter insertion for IoL performed the interventions.

In this study, 16F silicone-coated latex Foley catheters were used instead of the 18F gauge catheter used by Jonsson, as the 16F was the most commonly used bore according to our literature review (Appendix S1). It was felt that a smaller bore may pass more easily through the nulliparas' unripe cervix. The silicon-coated latex catheter is the standard Foley catheter make supplied to our hospital for bladder catheterization that was repurposed for cervical ripening. The silicone coating is incorporated to ease insertion and maintain the flexibility of the underlying latex. Foley catheters of this make are much cheaper than pure silicone catheters. They were purchased from a commercial hospital supplies purveyor at a cost of RM3.8 (EUR 0.82) each.

In both trial arms, participants were placed in the lithotomy position in stirrups for their catheter insertion. Equipment needed for the insertion was tested beforehand.

- **Digital arm**: The catheter tip was guided through the external cervical os to about 4 cm beyond the os by the operator's gloved hand and fingers with the aid of a water-soluble lubricant.

- **Speculum arm**: A sterile Cusco speculum covered with water-soluble lubricant was inserted into the vagina to visualize the cervix. Sponge forceps were used to grasp the catheter about 4 cm from the lubricated balloon tip, and the tip was pushed through.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117SVS32]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, specifically concerning closed catheter systems, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend maintaining a closed catheter drainage system with ports in the distal catheter for needle aspiration of urine. This helps reduce catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB) and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CA-UTI) in patients with short-term indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters. It also reduces CA-ASB and CA-UTI in patients with long-term indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters.

### Strategies to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^113CFTWQ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-related bloodstream infections, particularly concerning insertion technique and the choice of insertion site, the SHEA 2022 guidelines recommend preferring the subclavian site to reduce infectious complications when the catheter is placed in the ICU setting.

### Omitting foley catheter use in mastectomy patients with or without immediate reconstruction [^1129eu4g]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Foley catheter placement is often advised in surgeries anticipated to exceed 3 hours. However, this time cutoff does not consider the type of surgery. Complications from Foley catheter placement include urinary tract infections and genitourinary trauma, which may be costly to healthcare systems. Our objective was to determine whether mastectomy, with or without reconstruction, can be performed without Foley use and without increasing the risk of urinary retention.

- **Methods**: One hundred eighty-seven patients who underwent unilateral or bilateral mastectomies with or without reconstruction in 2020 and 2021 were reviewed. Chart review included intraoperative fluids given, estimated blood loss, lymph node dissection, and duration of the procedure.

- **Results**: After excluding patients with a case duration under 180 minutes, 145 remained. Ninety-four patients did not have a Foley, and 51 patients had an intraoperative Foley. None of the patients without a Foley experienced postoperative urinary retention, including three patients who also underwent a lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach. Eighty-six percent of patients were discharged on the day of surgery. Patients, regardless of Foley use, did not differ significantly in terms of race, rate of axillary lymph node dissection, body mass index, rate of same-day discharge, presence of hypertension or diabetes, estimated blood loss, or age.

- **Conclusions**: Patients undergoing unilateral and bilateral mastectomies, with or without reconstruction or lymphatic microsurgical preventive healing approach, may avoid Foley catheter placement.

### Foley catheter compared with the controlled-release dinoprostone insert: A randomized controlled trial [^1163fAzM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy of the Foley catheter compared with the dinoprostone vaginal insert for initiating labor inductions at or near term, we performed a multicenter randomized controlled trial. We enrolled women at 36 weeks of gestation or greater, with a singleton live fetus in cephalic presentation, intact membranes, an unfavorable cervix (dilation less than 3 cm; if 2 cm, less than 80% effaced), and no contraindication to labor or either study agent. Women were allocated to receive either a cervical Foley catheter inflated to 30 mL or dinoprostone for up to 12 hours. Oxytocin was permitted only after the removal of the study agent. The primary outcome measured was the time from agent placement to delivery. Secondary outcomes included delivery within 24 hours, vaginal delivery within 24 hours, time to vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery rate, and rate of tachysystole. We performed the analysis by intent-to-treat.

We enrolled 376 patients, 185 in the Foley catheter group and 191 in the dinoprostone group. In the Foley catheter group, the time to delivery was shorter (median 21.6 compared with 26.6 hours; p = 0.003), a greater percentage of patients delivered within 24 hours (56% compared with 40%; p = 0.003), a greater percentage delivered vaginally within 24 hours (44% compared with 30%; p = 0.004), and the time to vaginal delivery was shorter (median 20.1 compared with 24.3 hours; p = 0.005). Cesarean delivery rates were 29% compared with 39% (P = 0.07). Uterine tachysystole occurred in 0% compared with 3% (P = 0.06).

Starting labor inductions with a Foley catheter, as compared with the dinoprostone vaginal insert, results in a shorter time to delivery.

### Cervical ripening with Foley catheter balloon: A prospective cohort of 320 women [^115m6YXG]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). High credibility.

This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of cervical ripening with a Foley catheter balloon in a cohort of women with a medical indication for labor induction.

- **Methods**: In this prospective observational study, we evaluated 320 women with singleton term pregnancies, a Bishop's score less than 6, and scheduled cervical ripening with a Foley catheter balloon. The outcomes assessed were:
	- Bishop's score at first re-evaluation 18–24 hours later.
	- Gain in Bishop's score at first re-evaluation.
	- Bishop's score ≥ 6 at first re-evaluation.
	- Onset of labor in the 24 hours after insertion.
	- Delivery within 24 hours.
	- Delivery within 48 hours.
	- Failed labor induction.

	- Overall success of cervical ripening was defined as achieving a favorable Bishop's score or onset of labor within 24 hours. Adverse events occurring during balloon insertion or until the first re-evaluation were also documented.

- **Results**: At first re-evaluation 18–24 hours later, 106 women (33.1%) had a Bishop's score ≥ 6, and the median gain in Bishop's score was 2. In the first 24 hours after balloon insertion, 48 women (15%) went into labor, for an overall success rate of 48.1%. Delivery within 48 hours occurred in 214 women (66.9%), and failed labor induction in 38 women (11.9%).

	- Adverse events were observed in 14 women (4.4%), mainly pain/discomfort, vaginal bleeding, and balloon rupture. All were mild and required no further intervention. The risk of caesarean delivery for failed labor induction decreased with outpatient cervical ripening (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16–0.86) and when an open cervix was present at the start of the process (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.18–0).

### A urinary catheter valve is non-inferior to continuous bladder drainage with respect to post-operative UTIs: a randomized controlled trial [^114hyzfR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common with indwelling catheter use. Our primary aim was to compare UTI rates in women sent home after surgery with continuous bladder drainage versus a urinary catheter valve.

- **Methods**: This was a non-inferiority prospective randomized controlled study conducted between June 2016 and June 2019. Women who were being discharged home with a Foley catheter following urogynecologic surgery due to urinary retention were randomized to a continuous urinary drainage bag or a urinary catheter valve. The primary outcome of this study was post-operative UTI rates within 30 days of surgery. The secondary outcome was patient satisfaction, as determined by a Foley satisfaction questionnaire.

- **Results**: Out of 97 women, 51 were randomized to continuous drainage and 46 to the urinary catheter valve. Comparing UTI rates, the urinary catheter valve (32.6%) was non-inferior to the continuous urinary drainage bag (33.3%). The upper bound of the 95% CI was less than the predetermined non-inferiority margin (difference 0.7%, 95% CI: -0.195, 0.180), and therefore non-inferiority criteria were met. Patients were more satisfied with the urinary catheter valve than with the continuous drainage bag (p ≤ 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Use of this urinary catheter valve increased patient satisfaction without affecting the post-operative UTI rate. This easy and inexpensive device could help patients have a better catheter experience and should be considered in women being discharged home with a urinary catheter.

### Urinary catheter-associated infections [^116BBQT8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Catheter-acquired urinary infection is the most common device-associated healthcare-acquired infection. Although most patients are asymptomatic, symptomatic infection may occur and is associated with increased morbidity and costs. Long-term indwelling catheters are associated with more complex microbiology and greater morbidity than short-term catheters. The most effective way to prevent these infections is to restrict indwelling urinary catheter use to limited indications and to discontinue use of a catheter as soon as feasible. Alternate means of managing bladder emptying, including external condom catheters for men and intermittent catheterization for patients with neurologic impairment of bladder emptying, should be used when possible.

### Management of Foley catheter induction among nulliparous women: a retrospective study [^113NACk7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Interval times were calculated from the hospital records. The duration of Foley catheter retention was defined as the interval time from balloon insertion to expulsion or removal. The timing of amniotomy varied from immediately after expulsion of the balloon to the next morning, depending on cervical ripeness and delivery unit capacity. Amniotomy was categorized as either immediate (≤ 2 h from balloon expulsion) or delayed (> 12 h from balloon expulsion).

Oxytocin for labor induction was administered in the absence of spontaneous regular contractions. Oxytocin was initiated at the discretion of the obstetrician; the timing of its administration varied between 2 and 24 hours after spontaneous rupture of membranes. Oxytocin was also routinely used for labor augmentation if needed, but this study only concentrated on the timing of oxytocin for labor induction. Oxytocin induction was categorized as either immediate (≤ 3 h from rupture of membranes) or delayed (> 12 h from rupture of membranes). Regular contractions were defined as contractions every 3 to 5 minutes with cervical dilation of a minimum of 3 cm. The induction-to-delivery interval was defined as the time from insertion of the balloon catheter to delivery.

Data on the study population characteristics, maternal antenatal risk factors, mode of delivery, and maternal and neonatal infections were obtained from antenatal clinic charts and hospital records. The main outcomes were the mode of delivery and maternal and neonatal infections.

### Appropriateness of use of indwelling urinary tract catheters in hospitalized patients in Italy [^112WBnF2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

By reviewing medical records, we evaluated the appropriateness of use of indwelling urinary tract catheters in hospitalized patients in Italy. The inappropriate use of an indwelling urinary tract catheter (in 138 [30%] of 461 patients) was significantly associated with greater age, not having undergone a surgical intervention, a good state of consciousness, presence of chronic comorbidities, duration of catheterization, and ward of admission.

### Mechanical methods for induction of labour [^111pTKaf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Ten Eikelder (2016) examined safety outcomes between induction of labour using a Foley catheter and misoprostol (any route, any dose). The study found less uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate (FHR) changes and less fetal distress requiring caesarean section when a Foley catheter was used. Although the Foley catheter may slightly increase the caesarean section rate, conventional statistical significance was not reached, with moderate heterogeneity observed for this outcome. Notably, high-dose misoprostol studies were not excluded in the review by Ten Eikelder (2016). In subgroup analyses for 25 mcg and 50 mcg vaginal misoprostol, no evidence was found for differences in safety outcomes.

In our review, no difference in infection outcomes was found between mechanical induction and other induction methods. Nevertheless, outcomes related to infection were too imprecise to make a definitive judgement. McMaster (2015) addressed this question by comparing labour induction with a balloon versus locally-applied prostaglandin, including 26 trials. Their findings aligned with ours, showing no evidence of difference in chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and neonatal infection. When pooling infection outcomes, little or no difference was observed, suggesting that a Foley catheter does not increase the risk of infection compared to locally-applied prostaglandin.

### Safety and efficacy of double-balloon catheter for cervical ripening: A Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112iNwyA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). High credibility.

Unlike previous studies, we did not find any difference in Bishop score improvement between double-balloon and Foley catheters. Chorioamnionitis is a major concern when double-balloon catheters are used; however, our analysis found no significant difference in chorioamnionitis between a double-balloon catheter and any other method. Although there was a higher proportion of 5-min Apgar scores < 7 with double-balloon catheter and oral misoprostol use, there were only a few cases. There were no differences in umbilical artery pH, thus this finding was not clinically relevant. Therefore, this network meta-analysis indicated that the combination of a double-balloon catheter with oral misoprostol may be a preferable choice in view of the reduction in the cesarean section rate and lack of significant adverse outcomes.

Our analysis evaluated the safety and efficacy of double-balloon catheters. The combined effect of a double-balloon catheter with other cervical ripening methods was also included in our study. However, we did not identify any randomized controlled trial to assess the combined effect of controlled-release dinoprostone and a double-balloon catheter, although this combination may improve the induction outcome much like the combined effect with misoprostol. The high cost of controlled-release dinoprostone and a double-balloon catheter should be the reason. We did not perform a network meta-analysis to compare the combined effect of a Foley catheter with other cervical ripening methods in the present study. Because safety and efficacy were similar between double-balloon and Foley catheters.

### A randomized clinical trial comparing vaginal misoprostol versus cervical Foley plus oral misoprostol for cervical ripening and labor induction [^111xGcdJ]. American Journal of Perinatology (2009). High credibility.

This study compared labor induction using vaginal misoprostol with a supracervical Foley catheter plus oral misoprostol. Singleton pregnancies at 24 weeks' gestation or more were randomized to either an initial 25-microgram dose of intravaginal misoprostol, followed by 50-microgram intravaginal doses at 3- to 6-hour intervals, or a supracervical Foley balloon and 100 micrograms of oral misoprostol at 4- to 6-hour intervals. The primary outcome was time from induction to delivery. A total of 126 women were randomized to vaginal misoprostol alone (group I) and 106 women to the Foley and oral misoprostol group (group II).

The groups were comparable in terms of age, weight, gestational age, parity, indication for induction of labor, and oxytocin use. Cesarean delivery rates (37%) and indications were similar (P = 0.25). The time from induction to delivery was significantly shorter in group II (12.9 hours) than in group I (17.8 hours, P < 0.001). Uterine tachysystole was less common in the vaginal misoprostol group (21% versus 39%, P = 0.015). Delivery within 24 hours was significantly more likely with a Foley balloon and oral misoprostol compared with vaginal misoprostol. The use of terbutaline and peripartum outcomes were similar in the two groups.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for urinary incontinence in women, particularly concerning the management of postoperative voiding difficulties, the CUA 2024 guidelines recommend performing catheterization for 1–2 days and conducting a repeat trial of void for managing postoperative urinary retention following female stress urinary incontinence surgery. Perform early sling loosening (within 1 week) or sling incision (at 4–6 weeks) when possible in patients with continued postoperative urinary retention.

### Self-removal of a urinary catheter after urogynecologic surgery: A randomized controlled trial [^112n24As]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether self-discontinuation of a transurethral catheter is noninferior to office discontinuation in patients requiring indwelling catheterization for postoperative urinary retention after pelvic reconstructive surgery.

- **Methods**: In this randomized noninferiority trial, patients with postoperative urinary retention after pelvic reconstructive surgery were assigned to self-discontinuation or office discontinuation of their catheter one week after surgery. The primary outcome was a noninferiority comparison of postoperative urinary retention at one week. Self-discontinuation patients were instructed on home catheter removal on postoperative day 7. Office discontinuation patients underwent a standard voiding trial on postoperative days 6–8. Postoperative urinary retention at one week was defined as continued catheterization on postoperative days 6–8. Secondary outcomes included urinary tract infections (UTI), residual volume at two weeks, duration of catheter use, re-postoperative urinary retention, number of patient encounters, and visual analog scales (VAS) regarding patient experience. Given a known incidence of postoperative urinary retention at one week (16%) and a 15% noninferiority margin, a sample size of 74 per group (n = 148) was planned.

- **Results**: From January 2017 through March 2019, 217 women were screened and 157 were analyzed: 78 self-discontinuation and 79 office discontinuation. Demographic characteristics and surgeries performed were similar. Eleven patients in each group experienced postoperative urinary retention at one week (14.1% self-discontinuation group and 13.9% office discontinuation group), indicating noninferiority.

### Hyaluronidase versus Foley catheter for cervical ripening in high-risk term and post term pregnancies [^112ZW3X5]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Foley catheter and hyaluronidase for cervical ripening, a randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 140 pregnant women, with a gestational age of 37 weeks or more, an indication for labor induction, and an unripe cervix, were enrolled and allocated into two groups based on the method of cervical ripening before labor induction. Statistical analysis employed included Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square test, survival analysis, risk ratios, and number needed to treat.

The results indicated that the time of induction, dose of oxytocin, and mode of delivery had better outcomes in the Foley catheter group. Comfort with the method was reported to be higher in the hyaluronidase group.

In conclusion, both methods were effective and safe for cervical ripening. The Foley catheter group experienced a shorter period of induction, required a lower dose of oxytocin, and had higher vaginal delivery rates, whereas the women who used hyaluronidase declared greater comfort with the method.

### Speculum versus digital insertion of foley catheter for induction of labor in nulliparas with unripe cervix: a randomized controlled trial [^114TNAwN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). High credibility.

In a 2018 trial report comparing latex versus silicone 18F Foley catheter insertion by speculum, the silicone catheter was associated with a higher rate of accidental rupture of membranes but a lower rate of insertion failure. In their nulliparas subpopulation, insertion failure rates were 8.6% versus 3.2%, respectively, with a significantly higher failure rate with the latex catheter. The 8.6% latex catheter insertion failure rate is broadly similar to our rate of 0/44 (0% [95% CI 0–9.6%]) in the speculum arm, where we exclusively used the more pliable 16F silicone-coated latex catheter.

In a 2016 trial report comparing stylet versus non-stylet 22F Foley catheters inserted digitally, when the data for their nulliparas subpopulation was considered, insertion durations were median 1.78 [IQR 1.23–2.46] versus 2.08 [1.33–3.38] minutes; procedure-related pain scores were mean 4.82 [95% CI 3.56–6.08] versus 4.52 [95% CI 3.51–5.53]; and failed insertion rates were 4/28 (14.3%) versus 4/30 (13.3%). In our digital insertion arm, using an unmodified 16F silicone-coated latex Foley catheter, insertion duration was mean (standard deviation) 2.72 ± 1.85 minutes, procedure-related mean pain score was 3.6 ± 2.4, and failure rate was 2/42 (5% [95% CI 0.5–16.7%]). Compared to their non-stylet catheter arm, our results were broadly comparable; however, their insertion duration was shorter while their pain score and insertion failure rate were somewhat higher.

### Induction of labour with a Foley catheter or oral misoprostol at term: the PROBAAT-II study, a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^116DvxiT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). High credibility.

This trial is designed as a non-inferiority trial. Primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. In a comparative trial, where the aim is to decide if two treatments will be different, an intention-to-treat analysis is generally conservative: the inclusion of protocol violators and withdrawals will usually make the results from the two treatment groups more similar. However, for a non-inferiority trial, this effect is no longer conservative; any blurring of the difference between the treatment groups will increase the chance of declaring non-inferiority. We will therefore also perform a per protocol analysis.

Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the relevant outcome measures. We will additionally adjust for the stratified randomization when calculating the relative risk. Differences between categorical variables will be tested with the chi-square test, or if the expected cell count is below 5, with Fisher's exact test. Non-normally distributed continuous variables will be tested with the Mann–Whitney U test. Time to delivery will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis.

For the economic analysis, we plan a cost-minimization procedure, as we designed a non-inferior trial and expect no differences in outcomes. Resource use is multiplied by their specific costs, which are estimated according to recent guidelines on costing health care services. When relevant differences in outcomes are observed, we will perform a cost-effectiveness analysis, in which we calculate the additional cost per prevented case of fluxus or asphyxia.

### A randomized trial comparing vaginal misoprostol versus Foley catheter with concurrent oxytocin for labor induction in nulliparous women [^1163qwdx]. American Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of an intracervical Foley catheter with concurrent use of oxytocin versus vaginal misoprostol for labor induction in nulliparous women. Nulliparous women with a Bishop score of less than 6, who presented for labor induction, were randomized to either 25 micrograms of vaginal misoprostol every 4 hours, followed by oxytocin if indicated, or to an intracervical Foley catheter with the simultaneous use of oxytocin. Among the 162 patients enrolled, 79 (49%) received misoprostol, and 83 (51%) received the Foley/oxytocin treatment.

We were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the misoprostol group and the Foley/oxytocin group in the incidence of cesarean delivery (35% versus 29%; p = 0.37). However, the induction-to-delivery time was significantly shorter in the Foley/oxytocin group (18 hours versus 24 hours; p < 0.01). No differences in intrapartum complications, neonatal outcomes, or maternal morbidity were found. When compared with vaginal misoprostol, an intracervical Foley catheter combined with oxytocin has a similar efficacy and safety profile for labor induction in nulliparous women. Notably, the Foley/oxytocin method results in a shorter induction-to-vaginal delivery time compared with misoprostol.

### Strategies for the removal of short-term indwelling urethral catheters in adults [^117J5w41]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Urinary catheterization is a common procedure, with approximately 15% to 25% of all people admitted to hospital receiving short-term (14 days or less) indwelling urethral catheterization at some point during their care. However, the use of urinary catheters is associated with an increased risk of developing urinary tract infection. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is one of the most common hospital-acquired infections. It is estimated that around 20% of hospital-acquired bacteraemias arise from the urinary tract and are associated with a mortality rate of around 10%.

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2005 and last published in 2007. The objective is to assess the effects of strategies for removing short-term (14 days or less) indwelling catheters in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 17 March 2020), and reference lists of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness of practices undertaken for the removal of short-term indwelling urethral catheters in adults for any reason in any setting.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors performed abstract and full-text screening of all relevant articles. At least two review authors independently performed risk of bias assessment.

### A scoping review on the impact of hydrophilic versus non-hydrophilic intermittent catheters on UTI, QoL, satisfaction, preference, and other outcomes in neurogenic and non-neurogenic patients suffering from urinary retention [^113R3391]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Urinary retention is a condition causing incomplete emptying of the urinary bladder. The prevalence of urinary retention increases with age and is typically high in neurogenic diseases. Neurogenic urinary retention can occur in cases of spinal cord injury (SCI), spina bifida (SB), multiple sclerosis (MS), or other neurodegenerative diseases. Non-neurogenic urinary retention may be caused by a physical obstruction in the urinary tract or bladder muscle weakness, such as in cases of cancer or benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH), or may be idiopathic.

In cases of urinary retention, bladder emptying can be performed by various methods, including reflex voiding and catheterization. Several catheterization techniques and types of catheters exist. These include indwelling catheters, suprapubic catheters, or clean intermittent catheterization, as introduced by Lapides et al, where a catheter is introduced through the urethra, removed after bladder emptying, and repeated several times a day. Intermittent catheterization is recommended for people who can self-catheterize.

Different types of urinary catheters, both hydrophilic-coated and non-hydrophilic (uncoated), are available for intermittent catheterization, with an accompanying large and heterogeneous body of evidence regarding their effectiveness and applicability. Thus, a comprehensive review is needed to summarize this body of evidence, particularly one including all relevant pathologies and outcomes involved. The review presented here was performed with the aim of being wider in scope.

### Foley catheter technique for the extraction of coins lodged in the upper esophagus of children [^117Bos5K]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Esophageal coin impaction is a common clinical problem among young children and typically requires an invasive procedure for extraction. The lodged coin is usually located in the upper esophagus. Chewing and swallowing become more coordinated around the age of 5 years, when the incidence of this problem declines. The sex and age distribution, as well as the male predominance noted in our study population, are consistent with those reported in previous studies.

The removal of coins from the esophagus has always been challenging. Historical reports indicate that as early as the seventh century, a piece of sponge tied to a string was used to remove objects from the esophagus. In the modern era, rigid esophagoscopy has been the gold standard for removing foreign objects from the esophagus of children. Although this method can be used for all types of esophageal foreign bodies, regardless of their shape or material, balloon extraction has almost completely replaced rigid esophagoscopic removal for blunt and round objects. In 1966, Bingler reported the first use of a Foley catheter for extracting a blunt object from the esophagus of a pediatric patient. Since Bingler's report, large series of Foley catheter extractions of coins using fluoroscopy and/or sedation, without associated complications, have been documented. In the present study, a silicone rather than a rubber Foley catheter was used for extraction. When 12-F catheters are filled with air, the balloon of the silicone catheter inflates symmetrically, becoming more spherical.

### Induction of labour with a Foley catheter or oral misoprostol at term: The PROBAAT-II study, a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^114n9VUF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). High credibility.

Induction of labour is a common obstetric procedure. Currently, different methods are used for the induction of labour in women with an unfavourable cervix. Recently, we showed that in term women with an unfavorable cervix, the use of a Foley catheter, in comparison with vaginal prostaglandin E2 gel, results in a comparable vaginal delivery rate. A meta-analysis on the subject indicated lower rates of hyperstimulation and probably as a sequel, fewer cases of postpartum haemorrhage. Misoprostol (PgE1) is another type of prostaglandin frequently used for labour induction and is recommended by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). Misoprostol can be administered via vaginal, rectal, and oral routes. There is evidence that oral administration results in less asphyxia and hyperstimulation than vaginal administration. At present, valid comparisons between oral misoprostol and the Foley catheter are lacking. Therefore, we propose a randomised controlled trial comparing the Foley catheter to oral misoprostol to assess safety and cost-effectiveness.

- **Methods/design**: We plan a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label clinical trial among term pregnant women with a vital singleton in cephalic presentation, an unfavorable cervix, intact membranes, and an indication for the induction of labour. After informed consent, women will be randomly allocated by a web-based randomisation system to transcervical Foley catheter or oral misoprostol (50 mcg every 4 hours). The primary outcome will be a composite of complications of uterine hyperstimulation.

### Strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^116aGNZ8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Low credibility.

Education and training:

- **Healthcare professional education**: Educate healthcare professionals (HCP) involved in the insertion, care, and maintenance of urinary catheters about catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) prevention, including alternatives to indwelling catheters and procedures for catheter insertion, management, and removal. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

- **Competency assessment**: Assess healthcare professional competency in catheter use, care, and maintenance. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

- **Urine culture stewardship**: Educate HCP about the importance of urine culture stewardship and provide indications for urine cultures. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Consider requiring clinicians to identify an appropriate indication for urine culturing when placing an order for a urine culture. The indication should be supported by the literature and be appropriate for the specific patient population. Include guideline-based reminders for specific circumstances.

Below is an example of appropriate and inappropriate reasons to culture urine as referenced online on the CDC website, though several other lists are available in the literature specific to particular clinical settings (e.g. ICU, emergency department, nursing home, and catheterized versus non-catheterized patients):

- **Appropriate uses of urine culture**:
	- Presence of symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), such as flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness
	- Acute hematuria
	- New pelvic discomfort
	- New onset or worsening sepsis without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing
	- Fever or altered mental status without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing

### Speculum versus digital insertion of foley catheter for induction of labor in nulliparas with unripe cervix: a randomized controlled trial [^1113882T]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Low credibility.

Downstream secondary outcomes were very similar in both trial arms, which was expected as the technique of catheter insertion was not anticipated to impact labor or delivery performance. Our Cesarean section rates (60–64%) were similarly high across trial arms; the study population comprised nulliparas with unripe cervixes and included a substantial proportion (47.7–57.1%) with IoL indicated by 'non-reassuring fetal status', who were at higher risk of Cesarean delivery.

In nulliparas with unripe cervixes at IoL, digital insertion compared to speculum insertion of the Foley catheter in the lithotomy position resulted in similar insertion duration, pain, and failure. The point estimates for these insertion outcomes favored speculum-assisted insertion, but the small differences of < 30 s in insertion duration, ½ point difference on an 11-point pain scale, and failure rates of 0% vs. 5% in favor of speculum insertion suggested clinical equivalence or non-inferiority for digital insertion. Therefore, digital insertion, which required less equipment and consumables and had better potential for dorsal recumbent position insertion, could be preferable for the trained care provider. It could be the insertion technique to be learned by trainees, assuming a similar learning curve and skill attainment potential.

### Guidelines for perioperative care in elective abdominal and pelvic surgery at primary and secondary hospitals in low-middle-income countries (LMIC's): Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society recommendation [^112vZ5Nu]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

- **Urinary catheter**: A urinary catheter is traditionally placed prior to major abdominal or pelvic surgery to avoid urinary retention, improve patient comfort, and measure urine output. However, there is very little evidence to support this practice. The placement and duration of an indwelling catheter are associated with a higher risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). UTI is the fourth leading cause of all hospital-acquired infections and leads to increased hospital costs, length of stay, and risk of mortality. Other complications include hematuria, catheter blockage, patient discomfort, and delayed mobilization. Urinary retention is uncommon. In a recent large observational study within an ERAS program, only 14% of patients developed retention.

Summary: Foley's catheters should be removed in the majority of cases within 24 hours after surgery and individualized in patients with a high risk of retention.

### Short-term indwelling Foley catheters do not reduce the risk of postoperative urinary retention in uncomplicated primary THA and TKA: A randomized controlled trial [^116Fw6NJ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to determine whether a short-term Foley catheter, inserted in the operating room and removed upon arrival to the orthopedic floor, would reduce the risk of postoperative urinary retention (POUR) in patients undergoing primary total hip (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

- **Methods**: Three hundred and eighty-eight patients undergoing inpatient primary TKA (n = 228) or THA (n = 160) with spinal anesthesia were randomized to receive a short-term Foley catheter (n = 194) or no Foley (n = 194). There were 143 male and 245 female patients. The primary outcome was POUR, defined as requiring ≥ 2 straight catheterizations or the placement of an indwelling urinary catheter when indicated by retention of ≥ 450 mL on bladder scans. Secondary outcomes included urinary tract infections (UTIs) within 3 weeks and the need for ≥ 1 straight catheterization. A power analysis determined that 194 patients per group were required to detect a 7% minimal clinically important difference in POUR rates at 80% power and alpha of 0.05. Intention-to-treat and as-treated analyses were performed (2 patients received the non-allocated treatment). Outcomes were compared between the groups using univariate and multivariate analyses, with alpha < 0.05.

- **Results**: Nine patients developed POUR: 4 in the short-term Foley group and 5 in the control group (2.1% versus 2.6%; p = 1.00). Of those who developed POUR, 8 were male and 1 was female (88.9% versus 11.1%; p = 0.002). Twenty-four patients required ≥ 1 straight catheterization: 10 in the Foley group.

### Labor induction in women with an unfavorable Bishop score: randomized controlled trial of intrauterine Foley catheter with concurrent oxytocin infusion versus Foley catheter with extra-amniotic saline infusion with concurrent oxytocin infusion [^111eoipy]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was undertaken to determine whether the addition of extra-amniotic saline infusion improves the efficacy of the Foley catheter in women undergoing cervical ripening and induction of labor with an unfavorable cervical examination.

- **Study design**: One hundred consenting women with a Bishop score less than 5 with singleton gestation, intact membranes, vertex presentation, who required induction of labor were randomly assigned to two groups: Foley alone (Foley, n = 49) or to the Foley catheter with extra-amniotic saline infusion (EASI, 30 mL of NS per hour infused through the distal port of the Foley, n = 51). All women received concurrent dilute oxytocin infusion per protocol. The primary analysis was intent to treat. Nonparametric tests were used as indicated.

- **Results**: At randomization, the groups were well balanced for potential confounders, including parity, gestational age, prior cesarean delivery, preeclampsia, mean dilation, effacement, and Bishop score. There were no differences between the groups for time to delivery (Foley 17.7 ± 10.5 hours vs. EASI 17.4 ± 11.7 hours, P = 0.9), the proportion of women delivered before 24 hours (Foley 41/49 [84%] vs. EASI 39/51 [77%], P = 0.37), or cesarean rates (Foley 9/49 [17.7%] vs. EASI 9/51 [18.4%], P = 0.92). There were also no differences in complications, including chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and neonatal morbidity.

In conclusion, EASI does not increase the efficacy of cervical ripening and induction of labor with a Foley catheter and concurrent oxytocin infusion.

### Foley catheter placement for induction of labor with or without stylette: A randomized clinical trial [^113To3fn]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). High credibility.

Foley catheters are used for cervical ripening during the induction of labor. Previous studies suggest that using a stylette, a thin rigid wire, to guide catheter insertion decreases insertion failure. However, the effects of stylette on insertion outcomes have been sparsely studied.

The purpose of this study was to compare catheter insertion times, patient-assessed pain levels, and insertion failure rates between women who received a digitally placed Foley catheter for cervical ripening with the aid of a stylette and those who received the catheter without a stylette.

We conducted a randomized clinical trial of women aged ≥ 18 years who presented for induction of labor. Inclusion criteria included singletons with intact membranes and cephalic presentation. Women received a computer-generated random assignment of a Foley catheter insertion with a stylette (treatment group, n = 62) or without a stylette (control group, n = 61). For all women, a standard insertion technique protocol was used.

- **Three primary outcomes of interest included**:
	- **Insertion time**: Total minutes to successful catheter placement.
	- **Patient-assessed pain level**: Rated on a scale from 0–10.
	- **Failure rate**: Assessed for the randomly assigned insertion method.

Treatment-control differences were first examined using the Pearson's test of independence and the Student t-test. Per outcome, we also constructed four regression models, each including the random effect of the physician and fixed effects of stylette use, with patient nulliparity, a history of vaginal delivery, and cervical dilation at presentation.

### Predictors of catheter-related bladder discomfort after gynaecological surgery [^1144uEmn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

Urinary catheterization is widely used to avoid bladder retention, allow urine output measurement, and assess blood volume in patients during surgery. A catheter located in the bladder may cause discomfort postoperatively, known as catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD). With the extensive use of catheters, the incidence of CRBD has been rising, ranging from 47 to 90% postoperatively. The clinical manifestation of CRBD is similar to that of an overactive bladder (OAB), including urinary urgency, urinary frequency with or without urge incontinence, or discomfort in the supra-pubic region. CRBD is so distressing that it can increase postoperative agitation and pain, reduce satisfaction with the hospital stay, and even increase the workload of medical staff. Therefore, it is crucial to identify predictive factors for CRBD and enable preventive measures in clinical practice.

The two major independent predictors of CRBD are male gender and a Foley catheter diameter greater than or equal to 18 Fr. Additionally, urinary catheter-related pain (UCRP) ≥ 4, obstetric and gynaecological surgeries, and age < 50 years are identified as postoperative risk factors for CRBD. There is also a study showing that abdominal open surgery and a history of catheterization three months prior to the operation are independent predictors of CRBD after urological surgery.

Although obstetric and gynaecological surgeries have a higher incidence of CRBD, there is no study at the time of writing about the predictors of CRBD after gynaecological surgery. Therefore, we conducted this study to…

### Appropriate use of indwelling urethra catheters in hospitalized patients: Results of a multicentre prevalence study [^111QG24V]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Pre-determined criteria, based on guidelines of the Dutch Working Group on Infection Prevention and revised by a multidisciplinary team, were used to categorize the indication for catheterization as appropriate or inappropriate. The multidisciplinary team consisted of a urologist, an infectiologist, an infection control practitioner (ICP), and a member of the Dutch Working Group on Infection Prevention. Based on the recommendations given by this team, we added the categories of other proper indication and other improper indication for indwelling urethra catheters (IUCs) to the list of indications for catheterization.

The ICP or nurses categorized the indications for catheterization at both the time of initial placement and at the time of the prevalence survey. Patient records, information from ward staff, and the local guidelines for the use of catheters were used to decide whether the indication was appropriate. Patients with an unavailable indication for catheterization in the medical record were discussed with the treating physician, specialist, or nurse. If there was insufficient information on the indication for catheterization, judgment of the appropriateness of the catheterization was not possible, and the indication was coded as unknown. We deemed the (in)appropriate indication for catheterization as (in)appropriate catheter use.

### The Ann Arbor criteria for appropriate urinary catheter use in hospitalized medical patients: Results obtained by using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method [^114NR77C]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Interventions to reduce urinary catheter use often involve lists of "appropriate" indications developed from limited evidence without substantial multidisciplinary input. Implementing these lists is challenging due to the broad interpretation of indications, such as "critical illness". To refine criteria for appropriate catheter use — defined as use in which benefits outweigh risks — the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was applied.

After reviewing the literature, a 15-member multidisciplinary panel of physicians, nurses, and specialists in infection prevention rated scenarios for catheter use as appropriate, inappropriate, or of uncertain appropriateness using a standardized, multiround rating process. The appropriateness of Foley catheters, intermittent straight catheters (ISCs), and external condom catheters for hospitalized adults on medical services was assessed in 299 scenarios, including urinary retention, incontinence, wounds, urine volume measurement, urine sample collection, and comfort. The scenarios included patient-specific issues, such as difficulty turning and catheter placement challenges.

- **Scenarios assessed**:
	- **Foley scenarios**: 105 in total (43 appropriate, 48 inappropriate, 14 uncertain).
	- **ISC scenarios**: 97 in total (15 appropriate, 66 inappropriate, 16 uncertain).
	- **External catheter scenarios**: 97 in total (30 appropriate, 51 inappropriate, 16 uncertain).

The refined criteria clarify that Foley catheters are appropriate for measuring and collecting urine only when fluid status or urine cannot be assessed by other means. They also specify that patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) require specific considerations regarding catheter use.

### Timing of cesarean delivery for fetal heart rate abnormalities in hypertensive pregnancies induced with oral misoprostol or Foley catheter: Secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^112qtkub]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). High credibility.

The study aims to assess how oral misoprostol for cervical ripening affects the timing of cesarean delivery (CD) for fetal heart rate (FHR) abnormalities in pre-eclampsia patients. Secondary goals include determining the role of uterine hyperstimulation, comparing misoprostol with Foley catheter, and identifying risk factors for FHR abnormalities associated with CD.

A previously published randomized clinical trial was subjected to a secondary analysis (NCT01801410). We conducted a time-dependent analysis, stratifying the population based on the final mode of induction used (low-dose oral misoprostol vs. Foley catheter).

There was no CD for FHR abnormalities within 2 hours of starting misoprostol. At 5 hours, the cumulative incidence of CD for FHR abnormalities was 2.10% in the misoprostol group, while it was 1.00% in the Foley group (P = 0.565). After 25 hours, the CD risk for FHR abnormalities remained constant in both groups at 21.00% (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.00%-28.00%). Within 5 hours of misoprostol induction, the risk of uterine hyperstimulation was similar in both groups (0.33% in the misoprostol group vs. 0.34% in the Foley group, P = 0.161). The risk of CD for FHR abnormalities was unaffected by newborn weight centiles.

There was no significant difference in CD risk for FHR abnormalities between misoprostol and Foley catheter induction. Nonetheless, the cumulative incidence of CD for FHR abnormalities increased faster in the misoprostol group, indicating that FHR monitoring timing should be tailored to the induction method.

### Internet survey of Foley catheter practices and knowledge among Minnesota nurses [^112QwY9P]. American Journal of Infection Control (2010). Low credibility.

Although nurses insert and care for many Foley catheters, little is known about their attitudes and knowledge regarding indications for catheter use or methods to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).

- **Methods**: An internet-based survey was sent to a random sample of registered nurses (RNs) in Minnesota. The survey contained demographic questions and 5-point Likert-scale questions regarding indications for Foley catheter placement and the effectiveness of various interventions for preventing CAUTI.

- **Results**: Nurses perceived early catheter removal as the most effective intervention to prevent CAUTI (mean score, 4.5; range 1–5). Compared with other RNs, those reporting additional catheter education were more likely to rate interventions as effective in preventing CAUTI, regardless of whether the interventions actually reduce the incidence of symptomatic CAUTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria/funguria. Intensive care unit RNs were significantly more likely than other RNs to endorse that a Foley catheter was indicated for any given clinical scenario and to endorse antimicrobial-coated catheters as effective in preventing CAUTI. Most respondents reported no institutional guidance regarding catheterization.

- **Conclusion**: Although the surveyed Minnesota RNs demonstrated high-level awareness of the utility of early Foley catheter removal for preventing CAUTI, other aspects of their catheter-related knowledge were concerning. Improving these deficits may help improve catheter-related practice.

### Effect of preoperative tamsulosin on postoperative urinary retention prevention after sling placement: A randomized controlled trial [^112dLqtu]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). High credibility.

Many women consider being discharged home with a Foley catheter to be a surgical complication and describe catheter use as the worst aspect of their surgery. Indwelling catheters are the leading cause of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs), are often a source of embarrassment and inconvenience for patients, and may require additional office visits and health care utilization. Continued research should be aimed at evaluating methods of reducing postoperative urinary retention (POUR) in our patients to improve outcomes and patient satisfaction after surgery.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate whether a single dose of tamsulosin may impact POUR following mid-urethral sling (MUS) placement in a double-blind randomized controlled trial setting. Previous studies focusing on the impact of alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers have shown promising results. Livne et al. published a study evaluating a postoperative urinary retention decrease of 79.2% after the postoperative administration of dibenzyline (an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker) in women undergoing hysterectomy, with a postoperative urinary retention rate of 18.75% in controls versus 3.9% in the treatment group. Additional studies have also evaluated postoperative urinary retention in men and women undergoing various surgeries, demonstrating a decrease in postoperative urinary retention after tamsulosin administration from 72 to 88% compared with controls. These studies vary in the tamsulosin administration regimen from multiple days preoperatively and postoperatively to a single postoperative dose.

### Foley bulb added to an oral misoprostol induction protocol: A cluster randomized trial [^114Avsuo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

To evaluate whether the induction of labor in term gravid women with cervical dilation of 2 cm or less and intact membranes, using oral misoprostol preceded by transcervical Foley bulb placement, results in a significantly increased vaginal delivery rate compared with the use of oral misoprostol alone, a cluster randomized trial was conducted.

- **Methods**: We randomized the induction method by week of admission to labor and delivery, with each week group described as a cluster in a block randomized design. Women with a gestational age of 37 weeks or greater, cervical dilation of 2 cm or less, intact membranes, and an indication for labor induction were included. Study arms consisted of either 100 micrograms of oral misoprostol after transcervical Foley bulb placement or 100 micrograms of oral misoprostol alone. The primary outcome was vaginal delivery with the first induction attempt. Secondary outcomes included time to delivery, clinical chorioamnionitis (defined as a maternal temperature of 38°C or greater during labor with or without fundal tenderness, without other identified cause), cesarean delivery indications, and adverse outcomes. We estimated a sample size of 1,077 per arm was needed to detect a 5% increase in the vaginal delivery rate with a type I error of 5% and power of 80%, accounting for interim analysis and cluster size of 30 inductions per week. This was a pragmatic trial, and analysis was conducted by intention-to-treat.

- **Results**: From January 1, 2018, to May 13, 2019, 1,117 women (34 clusters) were assigned to the oral misoprostol plus Foley group, and 1,110 women (34 clusters) were assigned to the oral misoprostol alone group. Demographic characteristics were…

### Tugging the Foley catheter balloon every three hours in induction of labor after one previous cesarean: A randomized controlled trial [^113yHwz8]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). High credibility.

Induction of labor after one previous cesarean delivery with an unripe cervix carries a particularly high risk for unplanned cesarean delivery and uterine rupture. Mechanical balloon ripening is often preferred over prostaglandin-based ripening during induction of labor following a prior cesarean due to the association of uterine rupture with prostaglandin use. The transcervical Foley balloon can dislodge past the ripened cervix and be retained comfortably in the vagina during passive placement. This noninvasive method of tugging the Foley catheter can facilitate timelier retrieval of the retained balloon. Expediting the discovery of a ripened cervix would permit an earlier follow-on amniotomy and oxytocin infusion, thereby hastening birth.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of tugging the Foley balloon for 30 seconds every three hours during 12 hours of scheduled placement, in comparison with standard care (no tugging), on the induction to birth interval and patient satisfaction.

- **Study Design**: This randomized controlled trial, conducted at a university hospital in Malaysia, recruited participants from April 2023 to March 2024. Eligible participants admitted for Foley balloon induction of labor with one previous cesarean were recruited. After balloon insertion, participants were randomized to either tugging or standard care. Following balloon displacement, a vaginal examination was performed to assess the cervix. The examination findings then dictated follow-on management according to standard protocols.

### Misoprostol with Foley bulb compared with misoprostol alone for cervical ripening: A randomized controlled trial [^114LooVH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that cervical ripening using a combination of misoprostol and a transcervical Foley bulb leads to delivery within a shorter time compared with misoprostol alone.

- **Methods**: This randomized controlled trial was offered to women admitted for cervical ripening. Inclusion criteria were gestational age of 37 weeks or greater with intact membranes, a singleton fetus, cephalic presentation, and a Bishop score of 6 or less. Exclusion criteria included prior uterine surgery, ruptured membranes, and any contraindication to vaginal delivery. Patients were randomized to cervical ripening using misoprostol and a transcervical Foley bulb simultaneously or misoprostol alone. The primary outcome was the time from placement of the misoprostol to delivery. Secondary outcomes included the time to active phase, time from active phase to delivery, cesarean delivery rate, uterine tachysystole, estimated blood loss, chorioamnionitis, cord pH, 5-minute Apgar score, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. A sample size calculation revealed that 94 participants were required in each group to detect a 3-hour difference with 80% power and an α error of 0.05. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed.

- **Results**: From September 2015 to July 2016, a total of 200 patients were randomized, 100 to each group. There were no differences between groups with respect to parity, body mass index, gestational age, Bishop score, birth weight, or indication for induction. Time to delivery was significantly shorter in the combined misoprostol-transcervical Foley group: 15.0 (11.0–21.8) hours.

### Washout policies in long-term indwelling urinary catheterization in adults: A short version Cochrane review [^113ZQU5P]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

People requiring long-term bladder draining with an indwelling catheter can experience catheter blockage. Regimens involving different solutions can be used to wash out catheters with the aim of preventing blockage.

- **Objectives**: To determine if certain washout regimens (including no washout) are better than others in terms of effectiveness, acceptability, complications, quality of life, and economics for the management of long-term indwelling urinary catheters in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialized Trials Register (searched April 30, 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2009), MEDLINE In-Process (April 30, 2009), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2009), and CINAHL (December 1981 to April 2009). Additionally, we examined all reference lists of identified trials and contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing catheter washout policies (e.g. washout vs. no washout, different washout solutions, frequency, duration, volume, concentration, method of administration) in adults (16 years and above) in any setting (i.e. hospital, nursing/residential home, community) with an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter in place for more than 28 days.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted by three reviewers independently and compared. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Handbook. If the trial data were not fully reported, clarification was sought from the authors.

### The effectiveness of Foley catheter balloon tamponade versus expanding sponges and hemostatic granules for catastrophic penetrating groin hemorrhage with small skin defect: A comparative study in a live tissue porcine model with evaluation of a concise training program [^115UDTYC]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). High credibility.

This study compares the effectiveness of different hemorrhage control adjuncts for catastrophic penetrating groin hemorrhage with small skin defects using a porcine model. The adjuncts evaluated include Celox-A (MedTrade Products Ltd, Crewe, UK), XSTAT 30 GEN 2 (RevMedx, Wilsonville, OR), and two-way 26 Fr BARD Foley catheters with a 30 mL balloon (Bard Medical, New Providence, NJ).

- **Hemorrhage control adjuncts**: Celox-A is a syringe-like, pre-filled applicator containing 6 grams of chitosan-based hemostatic granules. It is designed to pass through wounds with small skin defects and treat bleeding directly at the source. When in contact with blood, these granules form a gel-like clot independent of the coagulation cascade. The granules are biodegradable and safe for use in humans with a shellfish allergy. One Celox-A applicator costs approximately 25 US dollars; however, prices may vary by country.

- **XSTAT 30 GEN 2**: XSTAT is a 30-mm prefilled, syringe-like applicator for junctional wounds in areas like the axilla or groin or deep narrow-entrance extremity wounds. The applicator contains roughly 108 compressed, nonabsorbable sponges, each marked with a radiopaque marker. These sponges rapidly expand upon contact with blood, filling the wound cavity and compressing bleeding structures.

The study provides an evaluation of these adjuncts in the context of a concise training program to enhance hemorrhage control techniques and outcomes.
