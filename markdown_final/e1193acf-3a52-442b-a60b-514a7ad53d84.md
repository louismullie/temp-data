## Question

Baby was born with umbillical cord around its neck, is it the hospital fault for negligence

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a hospital can be held liable for negligence when a baby is born with the umbilical cord around the neck (nuchal cord). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline medical facts: how common nuchal cord is and whether it typically causes harm. Then, I should verify the standard of care for managing a nuchal cord during delivery. Next, I will examine what constitutes medical negligence legally and how that applies here. After that, I need to check for exceptions where negligence might exist despite the general rule. Finally, I will synthesize a practical conclusion and outline what documentation would matter if someone were contemplating a claim.

> Let me first confirm the baseline facts. Nuchal cord is common, occurring in roughly 20–30% of pregnancies, and most babies with a nuchal cord are born healthy; large cohort data show no clinically meaningful increase in adverse outcomes even when the cord is tight, although very slight differences in NICU admission can occur without differences in severe morbidity or mortality, so I should be careful not to over-interpret small statistical signals as clinically important harm [^111JurGx] [^1161CwxY] [^112dxQFh].

> Wait, let me verify the standard of care. The appropriate management is to attempt to slip a loose nuchal cord over the head, and if it is too tight to slip, to double-clamp and cut the cord between clamps and proceed with delivery; routine pre-emptive cutting of a loose nuchal cord before delivery of the shoulders is not recommended and may cause harm by interrupting placental transfusion, so I need to ensure I am not conflating prolapsed cord management with nuchal cord management here [^117A9AZ6] [^1164MV43] [^111EN3Vd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about liability. To prove medical negligence, a claimant must show four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages; here, the duty is the accepted obstetric standard of care, breach would require showing clinicians failed to follow that standard, causation would require linking that breach to a preventable injury, and damages would require demonstrable harm to the infant; given that nuchal cord alone is not associated with increased stillbirth or adverse outcomes in large cohorts, establishing causation and damages solely from the presence of a nuchal cord is usually not possible unless there was a management failure that directly caused injury [^111JurGx] [^1161CwxY].

> I should double-check exceptions where negligence could still exist. If clinicians ignored clear signs of fetal compromise attributable to a tight nuchal cord (for example, persistent late decelerations or bradycardia) and failed to act appropriately, or if they used an improper technique such as cutting a loose nuchal cord before shoulder delivery and that choice directly worsened neonatal status, then a breach of standard and causation could be argued; similarly, if multiple loops were known in advance and reasonable clinicians would have altered management (for example, planned cesarean in select cases), failure to act might be scrutinized, though even multiple loops can still result in healthy outcomes and management remains individualized [^113Js465] [^111EN3Vd] [^116naUmx].

> Let me consider the evidentiary hurdles. In most medicolegal contexts, the mere occurrence of a nuchal cord is insufficient; plaintiffs typically need expert testimony that the hospital's management fell below the standard of care and that this deviation more likely than not caused the specific injury, which is hard to sustain when population data show no excess adverse outcomes from nuchal cord alone; documentation of fetal heart rate patterns, actions taken, timing of cord management, and neonatal condition at birth will be pivotal if a claim is pursued [^116naUmx] [^112Jvrx2].

> But wait, what if the parents were told the cord caused the injury and now believe the hospital is at fault? I need to ensure we separate counseling and causation. Families may be told "cord accident" as a lay explanation, yet professional societies caution that nuchal cord alone should not be labeled a cause of death without corroborating pathologic evidence of cord occlusion, thrombosis, or hypoxic injury; this counseling gap can fuel misattribution and litigation even when the clinical management was appropriate [^111JurGx] [^1131JbpM].

> Synthesis and bottom line: I should confirm that, in the absence of a provable deviation from the standard of care that directly caused harm, a hospital is generally not liable for negligence solely because a baby was born with the umbilical cord around the neck; nuchal cord is common, usually benign, and managed with straightforward maneuvers, and large datasets do not show increased stillbirth or severe outcomes attributable to nuchal cord alone, so liability hinges on whether clinicians failed to respond appropriately to signs of compromise or used an unsafe technique that caused injury [^111JurGx] [^1161CwxY] [^117A9AZ6].

> Practical next steps if concerns persist: I need to ensure the medical records are complete, including fetal monitoring tracings, notes on cord management, timing of interventions, Apgar scores, cord gases, and any neonatal resuscitation details; if there was an adverse outcome, a medicolegal review would compare the care provided against contemporaneous guidelines and expert opinion to determine whether a breach and causal link exist, recognizing that communication failures and documentation lapses often drive claims even when clinical care was appropriate [^116naUmx] [^112Jvrx2].

Not necessarily. A nuchal cord is common and usually benign [^111JurGx]; **negligence requires proof** that the hospital breached the standard of care and caused harm. Liability depends on whether staff failed to detect or manage a tight cord, ignored abnormal fetal heart patterns, or delayed delivery when intervention was indicated [^1125Jhz3]. If the team followed standard practice and the outcome was unavoidable, **negligence is unlikely** [^115iDmEd]. Each case needs expert review of the records to determine if care fell below accepted standards and directly caused injury [^115gV6nv].

## Medical significance of nuchal cord

- **Prevalence**: Nuchal cord occurs in about 20–30% of pregnancies, often without adverse effects [^111JurGx] [^1161CwxY].

- **Risks**: Tight or multiple loops can cause transient hypoxia or, rarely, severe outcomes, but most infants are unaffected [^11512wSS].

- **Management**: Standard care is to slip the cord over the head or cut if too tight, then proceed with delivery and resuscitation as needed [^117A9AZ6] [^1164MV43].

---

## Standard of care and medical negligence

Medical negligence requires proving **four elements** — duty, breach, causation, and damages [^notfound]. In nuchal cord cases, negligence may arise if staff fail to:

- **Detect**: Identify a tight nuchal cord during labor or delivery [^1161CwxY].

- **Monitor**: Respond appropriately to abnormal fetal heart rate patterns suggesting hypoxia [^115gV6nv].

- **Act**: Delay necessary interventions (e.g. assisted delivery or cesarean) when indicated [^1125Jhz3].

- **Resuscitate**: Provide timely neonatal resuscitation if the infant is compromised [^1137ayU5].

If the team followed accepted practice and the outcome was unavoidable, **negligence is unlikely** [^115iDmEd].

---

## Evidence from medical literature

Studies show nuchal cord is common and **not inherently linked to adverse outcomes** [^111JurGx] [^1161CwxY]. Negligence is not implied by the presence of a nuchal cord alone; it requires a breach of the standard of care that caused harm [^notfound].

---

## Legal considerations

In legal terms, **burden of proof** rests with the plaintiff to demonstrate negligence by a preponderance of the evidence [^notfound]. Expert testimony is typically required to establish the standard of care and whether it was breached [^notfound]. Hospitals may be liable if staff negligence caused preventable harm, but not if the outcome was unavoidable despite appropriate care [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

A nuchal cord alone **does not establish negligence** [^notfound]. Liability depends on whether the hospital breached the standard of care and caused harm. Each case requires expert review of the medical records and circumstances to determine if negligence occurred [^115gV6nv].

### Cord around the neck: should it be severed at delivery? A randomized controlled study [^116vSE9y]. American Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Umbilical cords often become encircled around portions of the fetus, usually the neck. The incidence ranges from 21% in one loop to 0.2% in three loops. In the present study, we assessed the practice of severing the cord, which was encircled once around the neck of the fetus, after delivery of the anterior shoulder and prior to extraction of the body. This was a prospective, randomized, controlled study. The study and the control groups included 30 women each. Cord around the neck was diagnosed during labor by ultrasound. It was cut intentionally in the study group and left intact in the control group. Demographic data were obtained. The course of labor was assessed. Neonatal outcomes measured were cord pH, Apgar scores at 5 minutes, and need for resuscitation. Length of maternal and neonatal hospitalization was determined. No differences were found between the study and the control group before, during, and after labor regarding perinatal variables such as meconium-stained amniotic fluid, fetal heart rate patterns, Apgar scores at 5 minutes, and umbilical cord pH after delivery (7.29 ± 0.07 [SD] in the study group and 7.32 ± 0.06 [SD] in the controls; p = 0.1). Single nuchal encirclement by the umbilical cord during labor, after delivery of the anterior shoulder, can be severed or left intact. We could not detect any adverse perinatal outcome in such deliveries.

### "The cord is the child": meanings and practices related to umbilical cord care in central Uganda [^113f6YLu]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

On the surface of the baby's body: the cord as a source of tension

After the baby is born, the umbilical cord is associated with anxiety and even fear. One participant told us:

The umbilical cord looks like meat (TBA IDI) and another said: Mothers fear the umbilical cord because it looks like an intestine (Health worker IDI). A health worker explaining the fear stated: They fear the cord because it doesn't look like the normal skin, and there is some little blood in the beginning, and as it shrinks it forms a certain discharge which makes them think it's painful for the baby. (Health worker IDI)

The discomfort and fear was also related to the perception that the umbilical cord was a vulnerable point on the child's body and a point of weakness. Through the umbilical cord, various illnesses could enter the body of the child. These illnesses could be caused by natural agents as well as by social agents or strained social relationships. Diseases like tetanus and Etumbizi seemed to be explained in terms of natural agents while Busobe seemed to be caused by social conflict. Etumbizi was described as a disease caused by air entering the newborn, resulting in foaming around the mouth and subsequently death. Etumbizi could also result from negligence in covering the baby well. Describing Etumbizi, young mothers in an FGD told us: That air can enter through the umbilical cord and affect the baby if you don't cover him very well (FGD young mothers). Busobe on the other hand was described as a disease caused by an adulterous father coming in contact with a newborn that still has an intact umbilical cord and causing convulsions. This was perceived as a very serious illness, with very few known effective cures and, in most cases, leading to death. A TBA described a case to us:

### Why women chose unassisted home birth in Malaysia: a qualitative study [^111NENH8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Fatalism

These women believed their pregnancy itself was a gift from God, and God also drove the process of birthing. This stance provided the courage to overcome the fear of labour as they surrendered to any outcome that might occur.

"You see, that's why our five (National Principles of Malaysia). The first one is Trust in God, right? Basically that helps to remove fear because when you remove fear you can hear your instinct clearer. Because when you are scared your body tensed up. Then you, actually create the complication " IDI 6

"It's so magical because I surrendered to God. Not doctors, not nurses, not my mother or mother-in-law, or my dad. Ultimately it's you and God. between life and death" IDI 3

These women believed that by total submission to God, they do not need medical advice, and they are fully responsible for their decisions. With this firm belief, they are free to choose their birthplace and whatever consequences that may happen is because of fate.

"Fate and destiny isn't it? There will be risks wherever you give birth, either in hospital or at home". IDI 2

"I'm a perfect creation of my God and why do I doubt my creation? We (humans) are perfect. We can give birth; we can be pregnant". IDI 12

One woman reported a critical situation when her baby was born, and there was suspicion of a complication from the birth process. She reflected the miracle of total submission to God even though her baby was born lifeless with the umbilical cord encircling around the neck.

"You know the transition of the "spirit" coming in… because when my baby was born she did not cry. There was no sign of her at all. This is scary. and the next thing you know.she cried right after the adzan (call for prayer) and you'll be in awe" IDI 12

### Neonatal outcomes following a tight nuchal cord [^1161CwxY]. Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The best practices for the care of a neonate born after a tight nuchal cord have not been defined. As a step toward this, we compared the outcomes of neonates born after a tight nuchal cord vs those born after a loose nuchal cord vs those born after no nuchal cord.

Study Design

This was a retrospective comparison using electronic data of all deliveries during a 6-year period (2005 to 2010) in a multihospital healthcare system in the western United States. At the time of delivery, each birth was recorded as having a tight nuchal cord, a loose nuchal cord or no nuchal cord. Nuchal cord was defined as a loop of umbilical cord ≥ 360° around the fetal neck. 'Tight' was defined as the inability to manually reduce the loop over the fetal head, and 'loose' as the ability to manually reduce the loop over the head.

Result

Of 219,337 live births in this period, 6.6% had a tight nuchal cord and 21.6% had a loose nuchal cord. Owing to the very large number of subjects, several intergroup differences were statistically significant but all were judged as too small for clinical significance. For instance, those with a tight nuchal cord had a very slightly older gestational age, a very slightly lower birth weight, a preponderance of male fetuses, primagravid women, singleton pregnancies and shoulder dystocia (all P < 0.001). Term neonates with a tight nuchal cord were slightly more likely to be admitted to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (6.6% vs 5.9% admission rate, P = 0.000). Those with a tight nuchal cord were not more likely to have dopamine administered or blood hemoglobin measured on the first day, nor were they more likely to receive a transfusion or to die. The subset of very low birth weight neonates with a tight nuchal cord, compared with those with no nuchal cord, were of the same gestational age and birth weight, with the same Apgar scores, and were not more likely to have severe intraventrucular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity or periventricular leukomalacia, or to die.

Conclusion

The presence of a tight nuchal cord is not uncommon, occurring in 6.6% of over 200,000 consecutive live births in a multihospital health system. No differences in demographics or outcomes, judged as clinically significant, were associated with a tight nuchal cord. Thus, we speculate that the best practices for neonatal care after a tight nuchal cord do not involve an obligation to conduct extra laboratory studies or extra monitoring solely on the basis of the report of a tight nuchal cord.

### Clinical audit to enhance safe practice of skilled birth attendants for the fetus with nuchal cord: evidence from a refugee and migrant cohort [^111EN3Vd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The critical analysis of clinical data though an audit cycle has proved useful in amending clinical practice in both high and low income countries. Briefly, the audit cycle entails identifying the need for change, setting criteria to be met, collecting data on performance, assessing performance against the criteria and creating an action plan, then re-evaluating the performance at a set time frame after implementation of the action plan. At SMRU data for each pregnant woman is recorded routinely by SBAs and doctors. Birth records are double checked by doctors to ensure they are suitable for digital data entry. A WHO safe motherhood needs assessment in Maela camp has found very high accuracy of maternity record keeping.

In an audit of 2011 birth data, a high rate of nuchal cord ligation before the birth of the shoulders was observed: 15.3% (321/2097). Nuchal cord, the presence of one or more loops of umbilical cord wrapped around the neck of the fetus at birth, is common and can be expected in one in three to five labours. In the two largest studies, nuchal cord was not associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Furthermore tight nuchal cord, defined as inability to manually reduce the loop over the head, was recorded in 6.6% of 219,337 live births and was also not associated with adverse neonatal outcome. The practice of umbilical cord ligation before birth stops the flow of blood between the baby and placenta and increases the risk of fetal morbidity and mortality from neonatal hypovolaemia, anaemia, and hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy particularly when birth is delayed by shoulder dystocia. As nuchal cord is not associated with adverse perinatal outcome, potentially harmful birth techniques are important to rectify.

### "Wrapping myself in cotton wool": Australian women's experience of being diagnosed with vasa praevia [^116HWmzb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

In contrast, some women questioned the health system for not picking up the VP during pregnancy. One woman who was diagnosed during a CS and her baby was born healthy, considered herself 'lucky', but said:

"It just really made me, not angry, but I just didn't understand how it could be missed, like how it could not be important to find out. I said to the obstetrician that I want to know how this got missed. Why isn't this looked for? No-one wants to look at the placenta and the umbilical cord and how they insert in to each other and match up. You know, that's ridiculous. Especially when you are paying for extra hospital cover and private health insurance and all that stuff and to still have someone say well it is an economic decision whether your baby gets a chance of being born alive or not". (participant 3–1)

Even when the diagnosis was made, there was inconsistency in the management. All but one woman had follow-up ultrasounds to confirm the diagnosis at later gestation. The exception explained:

"… at the 18 week scan that [VP] was confirmed. There was some discussion that I might have a 28 week scan but I didn't have that because my doctor was confident that nothing would have changed or that the management would be any different… " (participant 1–1)

Women were very keen for their caregivers to 'get the diagnosis right'. This was particularly challenging for the five women whose diagnosis was changed. These women felt 'confused' as they perceived a lack of confidence within the clinicians. One woman felt ' extraordinarily upset' about the changed diagnosis and did not trust that it was not VP. She did not feel safe to have a natural birth and questioned 'the distance that makes it not vasa praevia and when does it become velamentous cord insertion'. She explained:

Do not lift infants higher than this while the cord is intact owing to the influence of gravity on placental transfusion. Record the timing of cord clamping in medical notes routinely.

### Trends, determinants, and newborn mortality related to thermal care and umbilical cord care practices in south Asia [^112j838j]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Associations between newborn care practices and mortality

Table 5 presents the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of newborn death on days 1–28 after birth by newborn care practices for India and Bangladesh and Nepal, respectively. In India, we found that babies whose cord was cut with an unclean instrument had 1.6 times the odds of dying compared with babies whose cord was cut with a clean instrument or a blade from a kit (p -value < 0.05) although in the adjusted model, the odds were reduced (AOR = 1.4) and the association became non-significant. It should be noted that "don't know" was not a response option for this question, which may have affected these findings. Immediately drying and wrapping the baby was not significantly associated with newborn mortality in the multivariable regression analyses. We also found that firstborn children (AOR = 2.6, CI: 1.9–3.5) and children born fewer than 2 years after their mother's last child (AOR = 1.4, CI: 1.1–1.9) had increased odds of dying compared with babies born to mothers with a longer birth interval (two or more years). Babies born to mothers over age 35 (compared with age 18–34) or who had a previous child die before age 5 (compared with no previous child death), who were not protected from tetanus, who were small at birth, and who had no PNC checkup in 2 days (compared to those without a check) were less likely to survive. Babies who did not receive a PNC checkup had a twofold increase in the odds of dying compared with those who were checked (AOR = 2.1, CI: 1.5–3.1).

### Periviable birth: legal landscape in Indian jurisprudence [^115iDmEd]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Case details

A poignant case which drew the attention of neonatologists, bio-ethicists, the human rights commission and the public at large in India occurred at a reputed and well-known private hospital in Delhi in November 2017, involving twins born at just 23 weeks of gestation. The hospital, adhering to the standard protocol, provided the best possible care under the circumstances. However, amid the intensive treatment, one of the twins was mistakenly declared dead and handed over to the family in a plastic bag. This grave error came to light when the infant showed signs of life on the way to the cremation ground. The infant was rushed back to the hospital but tragically passed away a few days later. This incident sparked a public outcry and led to a legal investigation. The Delhi government temporarily revoked the hospital's licence, citing negligence and critical lapses in medical care. Delhi police registered the case under Section 308 of the IPC (attempt to culpable homicide) citing criminal act. The father filed a case and stated "grave medical criminal act, with an intention to cause the death of two infants" on the hospital's part, claiming that his babies were allowed to die because he "was not in a position to fulfil the extortion demand of Rs 50 lakh (US$55 000–60 000)" for their care. The Delhi Medical Council (DMC) disciplinary committee took up an independent inquiry (suo moto), interviewed 18 individuals and examined the conduct of the doctors and hospital and concluded there was ' no medical negligence ' in terms of clinical management, and parents were involved in decision making. However, there were procedural lapses and poor communication, for example, a failure to formally certify the boy's death and the hasty handover of the bodies without a senior doctor's sign-off. These lapses were attributed to the ' absence of standard operating guidelines ' for handling such periviable births (under 24 weeks). More importantly, they emphasised that the treatment decisions were appropriate given the circumstances: "the babies were not admitted to the NICU, as per the directions of the family ", and the decision not to resuscitate was in line with existing norms for gestations under 24 weeks. It stated that "in the present instance, the decision for management of the baby was as per the existing guidelines… no medical negligence can be attributed on the part of the doctors ".

### Adverse outcomes of nonnuchal umbilical cord entanglement [^11512wSS]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate perinatal effects of umbilical cord entanglement (UCE) of different body parts.

Methods

The database of a tertiary medical center was retrospectively searched for women who gave birth to a liveborn singleton newborn in 2014–2018. Those diagnosed postpartum with UCE were matched 1:10 with women who were not and compared for adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes, overall and by site of entanglement.

Results

A total of 14299 women were evaluated, of whom 1243 were diagnosed with UCE: 78.7% neck, 26% trunk, 6.7% limb. UCE was associated with lower birth weight percentile and higher rate of small for gestational age, but findings were significant only for neck and trunk UCE. On multivariate regression analysis adjusted for maternal age, parity, gestational age at birth, and history of cesarean delivery, UCE was an independent risk factor for nonreassuring fetal heart rate, labor induction, operative vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, and meconium-stained amniotic fluid, but not for lower absolute birth weight/birth weight percentile, small for gestational age, low 1-min Apgar score, or neonatal asphyxia.

Conclusion

While fetuses with UCE might be more compromised during labor, they apparently recover shortly after birth. The impact on perinatal outcomes was similar for UCE of the neck and trunk and lower for UCE of the limb.

### Obstetric care consensus # 10: management of Stillbirth: (replaces practice bulletin number 102, March 2009) [^111JurGx]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Umbilical cord events — prevalence, diagnostic criteria, and caution: Umbilical cord abnormalities account for approximately 10% of stillbirths but this diagnosis should be made with caution. In a cohort-control study of almost 14,000 deliveries, single nuchal cords were present at birth in 23.6% of deliveries and multiple nuchal cords in 3.7%, and single or multiple nuchal cords were not associated with an increased risk of stillbirth in this cohort. The criteria for considering a cord abnormality to be a cause of death included vasa previa, cord entrapment, and evidence of occlusion and fetal hypoxia, prolapse, or stricture with thrombi, and nuchal cord alone was not considered a cause of death. Umbilical cord knots or tangling should be noted but interpreted with caution because cord entanglement occurs in approximately 25% of normal pregnancies and most true knots are found after live births; corroborating evidence should be sought before concluding that a cord accident is the likely cause of death, and minimal criteria include vascular ectasia and thrombosis in the umbilical cord, chorionic plate, and stem villi, with regional distribution of avascular villi or villi showing stromal karyorrhexis suggested for a probable diagnosis.

### How to improve newborn outcomes in 60 s-delay clamping the umbilical cord [^11233cnn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Trends

The 2012 ACOG Committee Opinion popularized DCC in the United States. Prior to this, surveys estimate that less than 4% of obstetricians had a DCC policy at their hospital. By 2016, the percentage rose to 28.1%. After the 2017 ACOG committee publication, this metric further rose to 85.5% by 2019. The threshold for DCC in all surveys was greater than 60 s. The dissemination of hospital policy correlates with increases in the use of DCC, but not always in a proportional manner. There is a gap between the prevalence of hospital policy and obstetrician practice. Public education campaigns facilitate patients' ability to advocate for beneficial interventions prior to birth.

Obstetricians and other participating clinicians are more likely to perform DCC on preterm infants. This is due to initial ACOG recommendations that stressed the importance of DCC in preterm infants. The pattern of increase is aligned with the evidence and literature at the time, highlighting the capacity for large-scale incremental physician practice change. European studies found that interdisciplinary guideline development and communication between policymakers, hospital administration, and physicians were vital in increasing DCC rates. Recommendation adherence is better achieved through collaboration and physician involvement rather than top-down, zero-input methods.

Neonatal resuscitation — initial stabilization and cord management direct that if immediate resuscitation is required and the newborn is still attached to the mother, clamp the cord in two places and cut between the clamps; if no resuscitation is required, cut/clamp after 60 seconds or the cord stops pulsating. Dry, warm, and stimulate by wrapping the infant in a dry towel or thermal blanket and keep the head covered if possible; if strong cry, regular respiratory effort, good tone, and term gestation, the infant should be placed skin-to-skin with the mother and covered with dry linen. If weak cry, signs of respiratory distress, poor tone, or preterm gestation then position the airway (sniffing position) and clear the airway as needed; if signs of respiratory distress with airway obstruction, suction mouth then nose, and routine suctioning is not recommended. Apply cardiac monitor, if available.

### A newborn's "life line" – A review of umbilical cord management strategies [^111YXFNC]. Seminars in Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Literature supporting various umbilical management strategies have increased substantially over the past decade. Delayed cord clamping and umbilical cord milking are increasing embraced by obstetricians and neonatologists, and multiple international governing bodies now endorse these practices. This review summarizes the benefits and limitations of the different umbilical cord management strategies for term, near-term, and preterm neonates. Additional studies are underway to elucidate the safety profile of these practices, long term outcomes, and variations within these strategies that could potentially augment the benefits.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — prehospital childbirth, breech birth: Place the mother supine and allow the buttocks, feet, and trunk to deliver spontaneously, then support the body while the head is delivered; if needed, put the mother in a kneeling position which may assist in delivery and assess for the presence of a prolapsed cord and treat as above; if the head fails to deliver, place a gloved hand into the vagina with fingers between the infant's face and uterine wall to create an open airway, placing the index and ring fingers on the cheeks forming a "V" while avoiding blocking the mouth and allowing the chin to be tilted toward the chest; when delivering breech you may need to rotate the trunk clockwise or sweep the legs from the vagina, and once the legs are delivered support the body to avoid hyperextension of the head and keep the fetus elevated off the umbilical cord; never pull on the body, especially a preterm or previable baby, and instead support the body while the mother pushes when she feels the urge.

Cord care practices

The umbilical cord was cut soon after delivery and mostly it was TBAs who cut the cord in case of home deliveries. The importance of a clean cord cut was commonly understood and all TBAs generally used sterile scissors or a new razor to cut the cord. Almost all TBAs informed that they disinfected these delivery instruments (razors, scissor and thread) by boiling them in water.

"After the woman delivers, I boil the blade and roll the thread, then I tie the baby's cord by that thread and cut the cord by using the boiled blade. After cutting the cord we clean the baby and wrap in to the clean clothes"- (IDI with TBA)

TBAs further informed that razors were used only once for cutting and were buried after use.

"If we use the blades, we burry it after using, if we use the scissor we clean it by using hot water". -(IDI with TBA)

After cutting, umbilical cord was usually tied with normal tailoring thread; few of them also reported use of special thread provided by the hospital reiterating the importance of clean cord care. Respondents described the importance of tying the cord to stop bleeding as well as to prevent infection. Some of them also reported use of Utembo, a kind of thread obtained from a palm tree called Muale.

Cord length

There was mixed perception about the length at which cord should be cut, some of them gave no importance to cord length, according to them cord could be cut at any size while others reported that it should be cut at particular length mentioning it as an important part of delivery process.

"It doesn't matter because everyone cut it in her own way, on my side I cut it compared with the length of my mid finger (you know one type of rice, but various type of cooking)".-(IDI with TBA)

"Yes it is important; if you cut it too short, once it is untied how you can tie it again".-(IDI with mother)

### Of parachutes and patient care: a call to action [^113gE76k]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Obstetric caregivers are plagued with lawsuits alleging negligence for suboptimal outcomes. Some of those claims are unjustified, but many have merit. We are obligated to create systems designed to minimize the potential for errors that harm our patients. A variety of safety initiatives have been shown to improve patient outcomes in several centers in the United States, but it has been difficult to document the expected association between those results and reduced liability premiums. Furthermore, some individuals and institutions have been reluctant to adopt safety tools such as electronic fetal monitoring certification for all staff working on their Labor and Delivery floor, protocols for managing common clinical scenarios, simulation drills for dealing with uncommon dangerous events, and pre-procedure checklists because of the paucity of evidence based data documenting the effectiveness of those approaches. It is time to move forward with these and other safety initiatives in a serious national attempt to eliminate all preventable adverse patient outcomes in our specialty.

### Culturally adapted flowcharts in obstetric emergencies: a participatory action research study [^113PSEen]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Obstetric emergencies: incorrect descent of the baby

During delivery, the traditional midwives state that one of the complications presented by their patients has been incorrect descent of the " guagua " (baby), and they attribute it to problems such as nuchal cord. They manage this complication by sliding the umbilical cord over the baby's head; subsequently, they stimulate it by cleaning it and they cut the umbilical cord (Q4).

Q4-I3: I mean, the moment they're born you have to remove the cord, remove it because the little baby is all black, all black… then I remove it, untwist it, remove through the head like that and clean the little baby; because you have to clean all that from the little face, through here and there you already cut the cord and we hand it in to the relatives for them to put some clothes on it.

Another complication mentioned by the midwives was that of " guagua chupado " ("retracted baby"), a baby that cannot descend even if its head can already be seen in the vaginal canal. In these cases, the midwives state that the vertical position (vertical delivery) in a squatting position with the mother's legs wide open favors descent of the baby. If the baby does not descend despite this position, they move the mother to a crawling position. Once the baby descends, they welcome and care for the newborn (Q5).

Q5-I3: When the "guagua" is retracted, you have to tell the mum to keep pushing and, as the delivery is in a squatting position, the little baby slides off… some other times it won't come out and I tell the mother to get into a crawling position, like children… And the baby comes out smoothly.

When the mother presents complications regarding the baby's presentation, such as breech, some of the traditional midwives prefer to accompany the patient to the hospital and ask for help (Q6).

Q6-I2: It happened to me here in the hospital, the child was seated, then the doctors helped me and assisted her so the baby could come out.

### Perceptions and experiences of skilled birth attendants on using a newly developed strap-on electronic fetal heart rate monitor in tanzania [^111jWxvA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

I attached Moyo which indicated that there was fetal distress. I told the patient that her fetal heart rate was abnormal and that we would do our best to save the baby, so I gave her Ringer lactate but the fetal heart rate was still abnormal after half an hour so I called the doctor. He told me to look for a doctor who would perform an operation but I wanted to try once more, so I continued to monitor the fetal heart rate and gave another dose of Ringer lactate and within one hour the fetal heart rate went back to normal. When I examined her she was in second stage of labor so I encouraged her to push. She delivered the baby, though the baby was born with the cord around the neck but I said to myself that without Moyo the baby would not have survived.

### Are reduced fetal movements "merely" a maternal perception or truly a reflection of umbilical cord complications? A clinical trial [^114kweUS]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize obstetric outcomes and the association with umbilical cord (UC) complications among women complaining of reduced fetal movements (RFMs).

Methods

This retrospective cohort compared women with a perception of RFMs within 2weeks prior to delivery with women who reported no changes in fetal movements in terms of maternal characteristics and neonatal outcomes. A primary outcome of UC complications at delivery was defined. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify independent associations with RFMs and UC complications.

Results

In all, 46103 women were included, 2591 (5.6%) of whom reported RFMs and 43512 (94.4%) in the control group. Compared with controls, the RFM group was more likely to be nulliparous (42.6% vs 32.2%, P < 0.001), smokers (6.4% vs 5.4%, P = 0.029), or obese (body mass index > 30) (16.4% vs 11.6%, P < 0.001). They were also more likely to have an anterior placenta (56.2% vs 51.8%, P < 0.001) and poly/oligohydramnios (0.7% vs 0.4%, P = 0.015 and 3.6% vs 2.1%, P < 0.001, respectively). Induction of labor was more common in the RFM group (33.9% vs 19.7%, P < 0.001), as well as meconium (16.8% vs 15.0%, P = 0.026) and vacuum extractions (10.1% vs 8.0%, P < 0.001). Higher rates of stillbirth and the severe composite neonatal outcome were observed in the RFM group (1.5% vs 0.2%, P < 0.001 and 0.6% vs 0.3%, P = 0.010, respectively). The RFM group was characterized by higher rates of triple nuchal cord (P = 0.015), UC around body or neck (32.2% vs 29.6%, P = 0.010), and true knot (2.3% vs 1.4%, P = 0.002). Multivariable logistic regression found RFMs to be independently associated with triple nuchal cord and with a true cord knot. A sub-analysis including only cases of stillbirth (n = 127) revealed even higher rates of UC complications: 7% of all stillbirths presented with a true cord knot (20% true knots were found in stillbirths preceded by RFMs vs 6.1% in stillbirth cases without RFMs). Additionally, 33.8% of all stillbirths presented with nuchal cord (40% preceded by RFMs vs 33.3% without RFMs).

Conclusions

RFMs are associated with increased risk of UC complications observed at delivery, as well as increased risk of stillbirth and neonatal adverse outcomes.

### Management and investigation of neonatal encephalopathy: 2017 update [^116naUmx]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Documentation and medicolegal matters

Approximately 13% of infants with NE will go on to develop CP. In the United States between 1985 and 2008, the brain-damaged infant was the leading type of paediatric medicolegal claim. In the UK between 2012 and 2013, health trusts spent £482 million on 'maternity negligence', a fifth of the total maternity health expenditure. While well recognised that the obstetrician may be liable for the death or long-term disability supposedly arising from negligence at the time of birth, increasingly, the paediatrician is being taken to court. Reasons for malpractice claims include, but are not limited to, substandard resuscitation technique, failure to transfer an infant to a neonatal unit in a timely manner and failure to refer for, or initiate therapeutic hypothermia in a timely manner.

The clinician must fully document the resuscitation of infants with potential HIE. This should include time of arrival, a thorough description of the infant's clinical status as this evolves during the first minutes and hours of life, time of each resuscitative intervention, cord and early blood gas parameters and most importantly decisions made re therapeutic hypothermia. It should be clearly stated why the infant is eligible or ineligible for cooling, and at what time cooling commenced.

### Umbilical cord-care practices in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review [^114VaStg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Our initial search focused on studies that described traditional umbilical cord care practices globally. For the purposes of this article, traditional practices were those that focused on the cultural beliefs and customs that guided how the umbilical cord was cared for, including the length of the cord stump, substances applied, and the decisions regarding disposal of the cord stump. We developed systematic searches for PubMed and Google Scholar using controlled vocabulary (Additional file 1: Search Terminology). Initial criteria for eligibility were determined by topic, time period, and language of the publication. We included articles that were published between January 1, 2000, and January 30, 2016. A second search was performed in August 2016 to account for any publications during the intervening months. The language of publication was limited to English. References in the identified articles were reviewed to determine if other sources would be pertinent and additional articles were abstracted if relevant.

The original search yielded 321 articles, from which 107 duplicates were excluded. A reviewer then screened titles and abstracts of the remaining 214 articles to determine suitability for inclusion. Articles that did not meet the criteria included those unrelated to the application of substances to the umbilical cord, articles focused on clinical trials comparing a variety of antiseptic applications to the umbilical cord, articles wherein the authors related only secondary data sources regarding umbilical cord-care practices, and articles that were unrelated to umbilical cord care, but had appeared in the search due to a common term, such as spinal cord. A total of 65 full-text articles were then reviewed using standardized inclusion criteria. The primary criterion for inclusion was a description of substances applied to the umbilical cord stump in the days following birth. Based on these criteria, a total of 46 of the 65 articles were included in this review. Secondary data about beliefs in relation to umbilical cord care and other cord-care practices were also recorded, if available. Data regarding cord-care practices were extracted from the articles using a standardized tracking form in Excel. Data items included:
○ What was used to cut the umbilical cord?
○ What was used to tie the umbilical cord?
○ Applications of a substance to the umbilical cord stump. ○ What substance was applied? ○ How often it was applied? ○ How many days it was applied? ○ Why was it applied (belief)? ○ Who applied the substance? ○ Source of product supply. ○ Cost of product applied.
○ Other newborn skin-care practices, such as infant massage, that could contribute to the development of neonatal sepsis or tetanus were also tracked.

### An international internet survey of the experiences of 1, 714 mothers with a late stillbirth: the STARS cohort study [^1131JbpM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Nuchal cords occur in up to 30% of uncomplicated pregnancies and they have not been found to be associated with an increased risk of stillbirth. Similarly, true knots also are quite common in live births and in order for the true knot to be implicated as the COD, demonstration of constriction of the umbilical vessels or evidence thrombosis is necessary. Therefore gross cord problems (nuchal cord, true knot) in and of themselves are not usually considered the antecedent COD unless there is demonstration of vascular thrombosis/avascular villi in the placenta/fetal vessels. Nevertheless, cord-related stillbirths may be underdiagnosed. For example in a small study, when placental histologic criteria were applied to a series of 62 stillbirths, 42% met the criteria for cord accident. Therefore, it may be that a higher percentage of late stillbirths are actually caused by cord issues than is currently being attributed.

In the case where the participants believed that their baby died as a result of a cord accident and they were told something else, perhaps they did not believe or understand what their care provider told them or remembered that the cord was mentioned. Further, if they were told that the COD was unknown or the attributed cause was in some way unacceptable to them, it may be that they have adopted the belief that the cord was responsible as a means of plausible explanation either to themselves or their family and friends. Perhaps the care provider chose to implicate the cord as the COD because they considered it may be more simply understood as a physical barrier to fetal blood flow.

As well as the marked increase in the number of reported cord accidents participants also reported all COD, as told to them by their care provider, at frequencies significantly different from most perinatal mortality reports from high-income countries (e.g.). There was substantially less infection, and obstetric condition causes than would be expected. This may reflect exclusion of stillbirths < 28 weeks gestation which are more likely to have signs of infection.

### Systematic review of medical literature for medicolegal claims and complaints involving neonates [^112Jvrx2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

What is known about the subject?

In 2019/2020, maternity claims (including neonatal cases) made up 9% of the number of clinical negligence claims received by the National Health Service litigation authority but represented 50% of the total claim value.
Analysis of successful litigation claims in childhood fatalities over a 7-year period in England (in the paediatric population) showed that the top reasons included delay in diagnosis followed by delay in treatment.
In America, 60% of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) physicians who had been in practice for over 15 years had experienced a case of malpractice litigation.

What this study adds?

Communication-related allegations are a significant cause of complaints. This includes communication during preterm counselling, resuscitation, during an NICU admission as well as in situations on the postnatal ward.
Factors implicated for clinician's errors that resulted in parental complaint were inadequate supervision of junior staff, work culture and hierarchy, resulting in a fear of asking for help, not listening to families' concerns and system failure.

### Effects of nuchal cord on birthweight and immediate neonatal outcomes [^112dxQFh]. American Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Our objective was to ascertain if nuchal cord is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. Using a retrospective database of term neonates, outcomes were compared among infants with 0, 1, and 2 or more loops of cord encircling the neck. Of 4426 neonates, 3651 served as controls, 691 had one loop, and 84 had two or more loops. There were no significant differences in the mean birthweight, the frequency of nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns, operative vaginal deliveries, or 5-minute Apgar scores of < 7. The cesarean delivery rate was significantly different among the three groups and was the highest among the group of women whose fetus had no nuchal cord (p < 0.01). A nuchal cord at term is not associated with untoward pregnancy outcomes.

The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were defined as follows: spontaneous abortion (SA) refers to the loss of pregnancy naturally before 20 weeks of gestation; recurrent pregnancy loss refers to two or more consecutive spontaneous abortions; intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) is fetal death after 20 weeks of gestation but before the onset of labor; preterm birth (PTB) refers to childbirth at least 20 but before 37 gestational weeks; oligohydramnios refers to amniotic fluid index ≤ 5 cm or single deepest vertical pocket < 2 cm; cord-around-the neck refers to the umbilical cord becomes wrapped around the fetal neck 360 degrees; small for gestational age (SGA) refers to birth weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age using local gender-specific population-based curves; severe small for gestational age refers to birth weight below the 3rd percentile for the gestational age using local gender-specific population-based curves.

Statistical analyses

Data analysis was performed with the SPSS version 25.0 package (Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics are presented as the means and standard deviations (SDs) and as percentages for the enumerated data. Differences in the means between groups and subgroups were analyzed using Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. Counts and proportions were used for the categorical variables. The Chi-squared test, Yates correction for continuity, or Fisher's exact test were performed to compare the categorical variables. Modified Poisson regression analyses were used to estimate the relationships between the hemi-uterus pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes by adjusting for potential confounders. A P value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Ethics Statement

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Women's Hospital (date of approval: May 17, 2022; reference number: 2022 Medical Ethics Review K NO. (05)-01; Hangzhou, China). The Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Women's Hospital granted a patient consent exemption because this retrospective study was harmless to the patients and contained no personal data.

### Umbilical cord management in newborn resuscitation [^113Ggkpy]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Aside from the considerable body of evidence in stable term and preterm infants, very few trials have investigated the groups of babies who needed resuscitation at birth. It is crucial, therefore, that the above results are not extrapolated to the population of compromised babies without adequate evidence. In addition, as most studies were unable to accurately record who needed resuscitation, it is challenging, retrospectively, to reliably extract data on intervention and control groups.

In this edition of Pediatric Research, Major and co-authors present a meta-analysis (6 trials, 539 babies) of trials that explicitly reported on all, or nearly all babies who were resuscitated with an intact cord ("intact cord resuscitation"). Sample sizes ranged from 37 to 162 babies per trial and most trials were conducted in high-income countries. Four trials included babies below 32 weeks' gestational age, one included babies over 32 weeks and one babies of greater than 33 weeks' gestational age. In their analyses, Major et al. highlight the lack of evidence for important outcomes: there were no statistically significant differences for in-hospital mortality, oxygen saturation level, Apgar scores, temperature at NICU admission, or early complications of prematurity. The small sample size of the studies included, and inadequate power for most of the outcomes, is likely to explain these findings. There was a suggestion that intact cord resuscitation may improve oxygenation at 5 minutes of age, as this parameter nearly reached statistical significance, when data from the three trials reporting it were combined. The mean difference in saturation of oxygen at 5 minutes was 6.67% (95% Cl –1.16–14.5).

Quality of care

All babies with an adverse outcome (trial primary outcome plus cord-artery pH < 7.05 with base deficit ≥ 12 mmol/l) and all neonatal deaths and intrapartum stillbirths will have their care in labour assessed to see if it was suboptimal. All cases of adverse neonatal outcome (primary outcome plus cord-artery pH < 7.05 with base deficit ≥ 12 mmol/l) will undergo panel review similar to that undertaken by CEMACH. Intrapartum notes will be copied and anonymised, and all references to trial allocation will remain. These notes will then be examined by a panel of experienced obstetricians, midwives and neonatologists to identify if there was suboptimal care, particularly in relation to interpretation of the CTG and actions which flow from any identification of CTG abnormalities. The panels will also seek to identify cases with clear evidence of suboptimal care, where the care could be considered negligent in the event of litigation. This information will be important for evaluating whether the decision-support software decreases the risk of suboptimal care in labour; it will also be useful in the economic modelling, which will seek to explore the effect that such an intervention may have on litigation in obstetrics.

### Labouring women who used a birthing pool in obstetric units in Italy: prospective observational study [^113EMrs9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

In our sample there were no serious adverse neonatal outcomes. All 10 babies admitted to NICU were discharged home with their mothers. In Italy paediatricians routinely attend childbirth, consequently there may be a lower threshold for intervention than in countries where the paediatrician is not routinely present. There were two cases of umbilical snap in this study sample. This unintended effect has been previously reported for babies born in water. One possible reason for this could be inadvertent traction on the umbilical cord as the baby is lifted up out of the water before the placenta is delivered. Whilst a reassuringly rare event, umbilical cord snap is not unique to waterbirth and can also occur with landbirth.

The results presented here are from a large sample of women representative of state hospitals in Northern Italy. In Italy at the time of the data collection for this study (2002 to 2005) about 88 percent of women received their intrapartum care in public maternity hospitals staffed by midwives, obstetricians, paediatricians and anaesthetists. Southern Italy was under-represented because, at this time, there were few obstetric units with birthing pools, and those few that did, declined to participate. This study was strengthened by prospective data collection and having a low proportion of missing data.

Intervention

When delivery was imminent (expected within 10 minutes), the midwife opened a sealed, numbered, opaque envelope containing the treatment allocation. The interventions consisted of delayed clamping of the umbilical cord (≥ 180 seconds after delivery) or early clamping of the umbilical cord (≤ 10 s). In both intervention arms, the midwife was instructed to hold the newborn infant at a level about 20 cm below the vulva for 30 seconds and then place the baby on the mother's abdomen (20 cm was chosen as a practically obtainable level because of the facility to fold down the lower part of the delivery bed). Babies born by caesarean section were placed in the mother's lap before clamping in accordance with clinical routines. Oxytocin (10 IU) was administered intravenously immediately after cord clamping. The time from complete delivery of the baby to the first clamp on the umbilical cord was measured with a stopwatch by the midwife's assistant.

Venous and arterial cord blood samples for assessment of acid-base status were taken within 30 seconds from the unclamped cord in the delayed cord clamping group and within 10 minutes from the double clamped segment of the umbilical cord in the early clamping group. Study samples were taken from the clamped umbilical cord in both groups. The remaining fetal blood in the placenta was measured by placing the free end of the cut umbilical cord in a measuring glass and elevating the placenta until all blood had been drained. All other aspects of obstetric care were managed according to standard practice at the hospital. All staff in the delivery unit were trained in the study procedures before the trial started. Early cord clamping was the clinical standard procedure in the hospital before the study.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for umbilical cord management, more specifically with respect to considerations for delayed cord clamping, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that relative contraindications to delayed cord clamping in term infants include the following, and consider performing immediate cord clamping in these situations:

- risk factors for significant hyperbilirubinemia (such as significant polycythemia, severe intrauterine growth restriction, pregestational diabetes)

- high maternal antibody titers

- the first infant in a pair of monochorionic twins is delivered.

### Clinical audit to enhance safe practice of skilled birth attendants for the fetus with nuchal cord: evidence from a refugee and migrant cohort [^116B2UFq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

The registered midwife was available ten hours a day, six days per week in Maela birth facility which was staffed by a total number of twenty six SBAs including six senior SBAs. At each birth with a fetal nuchal cord, preservation of umbilical cord circulation was the aim. Being present at the birth allowed the registered midwife to encourage and support the SBAs to facilitate birth with the nuchal cord intact. On observing the presence of nuchal cord the SBA often sought assistance with cries of "cord, cord". Reassurance from the registered midwife that this was "no problem" and encouragement to continue to allow the birth to proceed without cutting and clamping the cord was all that was required. Following the birth the cord was gently unwrapped from the baby's neck and/or body. Three SBAs were often present during birth and this provided them the opportunity to observe the management of birth with nuchal cord left intact. Those who had gained experience in facilitating birth with intact nuchal cord then supported and reassured their colleagues. The senior SBAs rotated from Maela to the Maw Ker Thai site. In September the registered midwife spent three days at Wang Pha clinic where she explained evidence-based management of nuchal cord and showed a short video of a delivery taken in Maela. There were no deliveries with nuchal cord during this short period at Wang Pha.

Semi-structured interviews with SBA

Interviews of SBAs were conducted on a one to one basis by an independent researcher (CPD) familiar with the camp and clinic situation; fluent in written and spoken Karen, Burmese and English language and holding a Bachelor of Education. Interviews were carried out on one day in Maela camp. The purpose of the interview was to gain an understanding of why SBAs wanted to clamp and cut the cord and how "Theramu" (traditional and respectful term used to name a teacher) helped them change their practice more than the site doctor.

The interviews were conducted in a private area near the clinic on a single day in mid- February 2012. Five SBA were asked if they agreed to be interviewed and none refused. While the senior SBA was interviewed first, subsequent interviewees were chosen in turn by the SBA who had just been interviewed. Notes were taken during the interview in the original language: Karen, Burmese and/or English (based on interviewee preference) and later translated into English by the interviewer.

### Obstetric litigation is asphyxiating our maternity services [^115Pyg3T]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Obstetric care in the United States, as judged by maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, stillbirth rates, or any other metric, has never been better. Despite this, litigation over "bad outcomes" is threatening the specialty, not only now, but into the future. Despite damage to our specialty, the injured party often benefits little, if at all, from the process. Potential solutions include an emphasis on evidence-based medicine, a qualification and review process for medical experts, and a more rational and fair health court system.

### Management of nuchal cord with multiple loops [^113Js465]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Nuchal cords are rarely associated with significant neonatal morbidity or mortality.

Case

A primigravida with a normal term pregnancy presented for diminished fetal movement. Several nuchal cord loops were found on the ultrasound imaging, with normal Doppler findings. Abnormal fetal heart rate pattern appeared after 6 hours of labor. A cesarean delivery was performed. A healthy baby was born with eight nuchal cord loops.

Conclusion

The management of nuchal cord with a single loop, suspected before delivery, seems clear: it should not influence the clinical management. However, in this case, the previous knowledge of multiple nuchal loops may have influenced our decision to perform a cesarean delivery.

### Analysis of factors associated with the umbilical cord pitch value by ultrasound measurement in late pregnancy [^116dzroK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

This study revealed that cord wrapping around the neck or the body had a substantial impact on the size of the umbilical cord spiral. Additionally, the pitch value significantly increased in the part of the cord that wrapped around the fetal limb. Hence, the spiral was not evenly distributed throughout the cord and became more sparse. A study on postnatal umbilical cord spiral structure by Strong et al. in 1996, revealed significantly fewer umbilical cord spirals in fetuses with cord entanglement than those without cord entanglement, which is in line with our current findings. However, no additional pertinent research has been published since Liu Tianxin et al. reported, in 2011, that cord entanglement could increase the umbilical cord pitch value.

The pitch value was closely related to cord torsion and entanglement in this study, as well as to cord edema and Wharton's jelly thickening, which has only rarely been documented in earlier research. Several earlier studies have noted the association between sparse umbilical cord spirals and various adverse perinatal outcomes, but no study has highlighted Wharton's jelly thickening as one of the potential reasons for sparse umbilical cord spirals. Our study revealed a negative correlation between the umbilical cord pitch value and the age of pregnant women. Further, the older the mother, the lower the pitch values and the tighter the umbilical cord spirals. However, further studies are needed to verify these results. A significant correlation was also discovered between the pitch values and gestational ages, but the correlation coefficient was not high, which is similar to a previous study. The cord pitch values remained varied between the mid- and late-trimester, with the late-trimester values being higher, although several earlier studies reported that the cord length gradually increased after 20 weeks. The present study revealed that the gestational age ranged from 28 weeks to the day before delivery, and the spiral values during this period remained affected by the gestational age, which was positively correlated with the gestational age. The lengthening of gestational ages increased the pitch values but to a lesser extent. Neonatal weight was likewise favorably correlated with pitch values while a substantial association was found between weight and gestational age. Older fetuses have longer umbilical cords, while heavier fetuses are likely to have longer umbilical cords. However, further research is required to confirm this discovery by examining correlations between neonatal weight and pitch values at the same gestational age.

### Cochrane update: effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping at birth of term infants on mother and baby outcomes [^114opo21]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Policies for timing of cord clamping vary, with early cord clamping generally carried out in the first 60 seconds after birth, whereas later cord clamping usually involves clamping the umbilical cord greater than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation has ceased.

Objectives

To determine the effects of different policies of timing of cord clamping at delivery of the placenta on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Child Birth Group's Trials Register (December 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing early and late cord clamping.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 11 trials of 2,989 mothers and their babies. No significant differences between early and late cord clamping were seen for postpartum hemorrhage or severe postpartum hemorrhage in any of the five trials (2236 women) which measured this outcome (relative risk (RR) for postpartum hemorrhage 500 mls or more 1.22, 95% (CI) 0.96 to 1.55). For neonatal outcomes, our review showed both benefits and harms for late cord clamping. Following birth, there was a significant increase in infants needing phototherapy for jaundice (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92; five trials of 1,762 infants) in the late compared with early clamping group. This was accompanied by significant increases in newborn hemoglobin levels in the late cord clamping group compared with early cord clamping (weighted mean difference 2.17 g/dL; 95% CI 0.28 to 4.06; three trials of 671 infants), although this effect did not persist past six months. Infant ferritin levels remained higher in the late clamping group than the early clamping group at six months.

Authors' Conclusion

One definition of active management includes directions to administer an uterotonic with birth of the anterior shoulder of the baby and to clamp the umbilical cord within 30–60 seconds of birth of the baby (which is not always feasible in practice). In this review delaying clamping of the cord for at least two to three minutes seems not to increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage. In addition, late cord clamping can be advantageous for the infant by improving iron status which may be of clinical value particularly in infants where access to good nutrition is poor, although delaying clamping increases the risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.

### Cerebral palsy litigation: change course or abandon ship [^1125M1RF]. Journal of Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Obstetrics and Malpractice

Before 1970, obstetrical care generated few medical malpractice claims. But by 1985, obstetrical claims represented 10% of all medical malpractice lawsuits. 28 Today obstetrical claims are consistently among the highest verdicts and settlements in the United States, some reaching above $200,000,000, verdicts on a par with business litigation cases. 29

What changed?

Before 1970, a fetus was monitored intermittently with stethoscopes or fetoscopes. If a child later developed cerebral palsy, mental retardation, seizures, or similar conditions, no amount of speculation could overcome the obstetrician's recollection that the intermittent auscultation revealed no evidence of fetal distress and thus no reason to intervene.

Electronic fetal monitoring changed everything. Electronic fetal monitoring, to an eager bevy of trial lawyers, was more valuable than the crown jewels: a computer-generated permanent tracing that could be reanalyzed in the courtroom. More importantly, this new instrument of blame was wielded not so much by lawyers as by self-proclaimed electronic fetal monitoring experts whose skills were more evident in courtrooms than in delivery rooms. In courtrooms around the world, these experts delivered babies a second time reanalyzing the electronic fetal monitoring strip, identifying the exact moment the negligent defendant should have delivered what the experts said was a neurologically perfect infant. Instead, the child had been sentenced to lifelong neurologic devastation by the negligent defendant unable to read or react to plainly evident electronic fetal monitoring warnings. Electronic fetal monitoring, according to the experts, enabled physicians to identify a fetus being asphyxiated in utero. Rescue was only moments away by means of a simple, quick cesarian section.

The testimony was and is false.

### Learning from the law: a review of 21 years of litigation for anaesthetic negligence resulting in peripartum hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy [^1125Jhz3]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most devastating complications that can result from medical mismanagement during labour and delivery is hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy has profound implications for the newborn and its family, as well as for the healthcare team involved. Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy can take only minutes to develop, but the repercussions of this complication can last a lifetime. A proportion of these injuries arise from failure to deliver the baby within a sufficiently short time frame once fetal compromise has been recognised. Obstetric anaesthetists are often involved in such claims, usually in relation to a perception that provision of anaesthesia for caesarean section was unduly delayed. In the following article, using a database of over 360 cases spanning 21years, we break down and examine the recurrent components of medicolegal claims concerning the anaesthetic involvement in hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, and consider how increased awareness of the anaesthetic contribution to this complication might reduce future harm, improve clinical standards and consequently decrease the need for litigation.

### Relationship between the natural cessation time of umbilical cord pulsation in full-term newborns delivered vaginally and maternal-neonatal outcomes: a prospective cohort study [^113tQGpK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends delayed umbilical cord clamping in full-term neonates and preterm infants for at least 30–60 seconds after birth. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the umbilical cord should be clamped between 1 and 3 minutes after birth as part of the active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL), in order to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes unless the baby has special circumstances such as neonatal asphyxia and the need for resuscitation. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends if there is no concern about the integrity of the umbilical cord or if the baby's heart rate is below 60 beats per minute and is not getting faster, it is best to clamp the cord 1–5 minutes after delivery.

Whether to clamp the umbilical cord early or delayed has always been a controversial topic. Although a large number of studies have shown the positive impact of delayed cord clamping on mother and baby, most have not focused on the impact of the time to natural cessation of cord pulsation on maternal and infant outcomes. And there is still a shortfall in guiding the recommended optimal time to clamp the cord. In our study, artificial clipping was performed when the umbilical cord pulsation naturally stopped, disregarding the complex relationship between subsequent umbilical blood flow and umbilical cord pulsation. We aimed to compare the relationship of different times of umbilical cord disconnection with the outcomes of mothers and infants.

### Intrapartum umbilical cord rupture [^115d1aC9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Surveillance and identification of umbilical cord abnormalities is a challenging problem in obstetrics. Continuous fetal monitoring during active labor helps identify when danger exists for the fetus.

Case

A nullipara underwent emergent cesarean delivery for fetal distress and was found to have a fetus already separated from the completely torn umbilical cord. The cord was 17 cm in length, centrally attached, pale, and without bleeding from vasospasm. The newborn was initially pale but had a hemoglobin of 17.4 g and survived.

Conclusion

The incidence of rupture of the umbilical cord in utero is rare and has little documentation.

### Umbilical cord antiseptics for preventing sepsis and death among newborns [^114oZFge]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The umbilical cord is a structure made of blood vessels and connective tissue that connects the baby and placenta in utero. The umbilical cord is cut after birth, which separates the mother and her baby both physically and symbolically. Omphalitis is defined as infection of the umbilical cord stump. Tracking of bacteria along the umbilical vessels may lead to septicaemia that can result in neonatal morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries.

Objectives

To determine the effect of application of antimicrobials on newborn's umbilical cord versus routine care for prevention of morbidity and mortality in hospital and community settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 October 2012). In addition, we also searched LILACS (1982 to 11 October 2012) and HERDIN NeON (October 2012)

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, cluster-randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of topical cord care compared with no topical care, and comparisons between different forms of care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, trial quality and subsequently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

The search identified 77 trials. We included 34 trials in the review involving 69,338 babies, five studies are awaiting classification and there are two ongoing community trials. Included studies were conducted in both developed and developing countries. Among the 34 included trials, three were large, cluster-randomized trials conducted in community settings in developing countries and 31 studies were conducted in hospital settings mostly in developed countries. Data for community and hospital studies were analyzed separately. The three trials conducted in community settings contributed 78% of the total number of children included in this review. Of the trials conducted in hospital settings, the majority had small sample sizes. There were 22 different interventions studied across the included trials and the most commonly studied antiseptics were 70% alcohol, triple dye and chlorhexidine. Only one antiseptic, chlorhexidine was studied in community settings for umbilical cord care. Three community trials reported data on all-cause mortality that comprised 1325 deaths in 54,624 participants and combined results showed a reduction of 23% (average risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.94, random-effects, T² = 0.02, I² = 50%) in the chlorhexidine group compared with control. The reduction in omphalitis ranged from 27% to 56% depending on the severity of infection. Cord separation time was increased by 1.7 days in the chlorhexidine group compared with dry cord care (mean difference (MD) 1.75 days, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.05, random-effects, T² = 0.88, I² = 100%). Washing of umbilical cord with soap and water was not advantageous compared with dry cord care in community settings. Among studies conducted in hospital settings, no study reported data for mortality or tetanus. No antiseptic was advantageous to reduce the incidence of omphalitis compared with dry cord care in hospital settings. Topical triple dye application reduced bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus aureus compared with dry cord care (average RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.22, four studies, n = 1319, random-effects, T² = 0.04, I² = 24%) or alcohol application (average RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.80, two studies, n = 487, random-effects, T² = 0.00, I² = 0%). There was no advantage of application of alcohol and triple dye for reduction of colonization with streptococcus. Topical alcohol application was advantageous in reduction of colonization with Enterococcus coli compared with dry cord care (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.92, two studies, n = 432, random-effects, T² = 0.00, I² = 0%) and in a separate analysis, triple dye increased the risk of colonization compared with alcohol (RR 3.44, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.64, one study, n = 373). Cord separation time was significantly increased with topical application of alcohol (MD 1.76 days, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.48, nine studies, n = 2921, random-effects, T² = 6.54, I² = 97%) and triple dye (MD 4.10 days, 95% CI 3.07 to 5.13, one study, n = 372) compared with dry cord care in hospital settings. The number of studies was insufficient to make any inference about the efficacy of other antiseptics.

Authors' Conclusions

There is significant evidence to suggest that topical application of chlorhexidine to umbilical cord reduces neonatal mortality and omphalitis in community and primary care settings in developing countries. It may increase cord separation time however, there is no evidence that it increases risk of subsequent morbidity or infection. There is insufficient evidence to support the application of an antiseptic to umbilical cord in hospital settings compared with dry cord care in developed countries.

### Randomised trial of cord clamping and initial stabilisation at very preterm birth [^116U7S6f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

At birth, if the umbilical cord is not clamped blood flow between baby and placenta may continue for several minutes. This umbilical flow is part of the physiological transition from the fetal to the neonatal circulation; clamping the cord too soon may restrict the infant's ability to cope with this transition. A short delay in cord clamping may increase neonatal blood volume, a longer delay of several minutes may have more substantive advantages, such as smoother cardiorespiratory transition and more stable blood pressure, which for very preterm infants (< 32 weeks gestation) may reduce the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage. Concerns about deferring (delaying) cord clamping include exacerbating jaundice, polycythaemia, delayed respiratory support and hypothermia.

The relevant Cochrane review suggests that for infants born preterm deferring cord clamping may improve outcomes at hospital discharge. However, the 15 trials included were small and have a high risk of bias. None were prospectively registered, and they reported different outcomes, so the possibility of selective outcome reporting is high. Also, data on long-term safety are sparse. Importantly, these studies excluded infants requiring resuscitation at birth, and for very preterm births most trials deferred clamping for < 60 s. Guidelines for very preterm birth make various recommendations about when to clamp the cord, and advise that clamping should not be delayed if neonatal resuscitation is required. Evaluating timing of cord clamping at very preterm birth is a research priority, particularly for infants requiring resuscitation at birth.

Our hypothesis is that for very preterm births a policy of cord clamping after at least 2 min and providing immediate neonatal care with cord intact, rather than usual care of clamping within 20 s and neonatal care after clamping, improves outcome for the infants without adverse effects for the women. Having developed strategies for providing stabilisation and resuscitation with the cord intact, we conducted a randomised trial.

### Neonatal advanced life support. neonatal resuscitation [^11292sK1]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation — definitions for cord management specify deferred cord clamping as cord clamping without milking, with or without respiratory support, at more than 15 seconds after birth; umbilical cord milking as repeated compression of the cord toward the infant with the connection to the placenta intact immediately after birth (intact-cord milking) or drainage of a long segment from the cut end toward the infant with or without respiratory support after clamping and cutting of the long segment after birth (cut-cord milking); and immediate cord clamping as cord clamping, without milking or initiation of respiratory support, at 15 or less seconds after the birth of the infant or as defined by the trialist. The review did not distinguish between intact- and cut-cord milking, and it was noted that in most trials the intact cord was milked 2 to 4 times, while a few trials milked the cut cord once.

### Postnatal care and acceptability of emollient therapy in very low birthweight infants in harare, Zimbabwe: a qualitative analysis [^116hvJkc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Neonatal skincare and bathing at birthing facilities

The infant's first bath was almost universally delayed beyond 24 h. Most mothers reported wiping or drying the baby at the hospital and waiting to bathe the infant until they returned home, with the median hospital stay among women who delivered normal-term infants being 3 days. Mothers used a dry towel, wet towel, soap, " wipers " (baby wipes), cotton, or aqueous cream to clean their babies at the hospital, sometimes with the help of nurses.

Nearly all respondents expressed knowledge of placing the newborn on the mother's bare chest, though most reported not practicing this while at the hospital. Of the five mothers who responded that they did perform skin-to-skin care, two described continuous placement of the newborn (one was a preterm infant) on the chest (as in KMC) for at least one week, while the other three (including one mother of a preterm infant) explained that contact only lasted several minutes. One mother who performed skin-to-skin contact briefly gave the reason of improving infant attachment. Because these responses do not accord with the nurses' and doctors' accounts of standard practice, which is to deliver the baby onto the mother's abdomen, it is likely that respondents here were referring to additional skin-to-skin care which occurred beyond the delivery period. While not asked directly about cord care, many described practicing it at the hospital with cotton and [methylated] spirit.

Focus group discussions with nurses and doctors offered further insight into the standard care for infants after delivery at SMCH. Delivery procedures were described to include all essential aspects of neonatal care: "As soon as the baby is born, it's put on mother's, the mother's belly um, then the the drying of the baby whilst still on the belly, then the clamping of the cord and the cutting of the cord". This is followed by a full examination of the baby, wrapping the baby, encouraging breastfeeding within one hour if the baby is well, and teaching the mother how to perform proper cord care. Drying of the baby was termed " top and tail " by nurses. Though not always cited, maternal sentiment towards nurse involvement was positive whenever mentioned by CS1 and CS2 respondents.

Conclusions

The most frequent categories of complaint reported in our systematic review were delay in/incorrect diagnosis and delay in/incorrect treatment. We would recommend that it is valuable for individual organisations to analyse and publish their complaints data. The aim is to pick up similar or recurring themes for complaints, and this could contribute to a shared learning and appreciation of human factors.

### Neonatal advanced life support. neonatal resuscitation [^113zrh1Y]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation — umbilical cord milking in preterm infants: The suggestion against intact-cord milking in infants less than 28 weeks' gestation was based on low-certainty evidence for increased severe intraventricular hemorrhage compared with deferred cord clamping, informed by a randomized clinical trial of preterm infants born at 23 weeks' to 32 weeks' gestation that was terminated early due to a signal for harm. In that trial, there were 474 infants enrolled who completed the trial, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage was higher with umbilical cord milking than delayed umbilical cord clamping (8% [20/236] versus 3% [8/238], respectively; risk difference, 5%, [95% CI, 1%–9%]; P = 0.02); among infants born at 23 to 27 weeks' gestation, rates were 22% [20/93] versus 6% [5/89], respectively; risk difference, 16% [95% CI, 6%–26%]; P = 0.002.

### Clinical audit to enhance safe practice of skilled birth attendants for the fetus with nuchal cord: evidence from a refugee and migrant cohort [^113zqsAQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Knowledge survey results

The survey was conducted three months after the departure of the registered midwife. The results of the knowledge survey (Table 2) show that most SBAs know the proportions of infants born with nuchal cord and that is can be associated with fetal distress in the second stage of labour. The majority answered the question about harm from fetal nuchal cord incorrectly. The reason for harm in the 20/24 (83.3%) who provided one included low fetal oxygen 16/20 (80.0%) and fetal distress 4/16 (20.0%). The dangers associated with ligation of the umbilical artery circulation are not completely understood, except in association with shoulder dystocia (Table 2). When asked about current practice of a loose nuchal cord only one SBA reported they would ligate the umbilical artery before delivery of the body 1/26 (3.3%); while this was 21/26 (80.8%) if the nuchal cord was tight.

### Guideline no. 424: umbilical cord management in preterm and term infants [^114PopZk]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for preterm infant, more specifically with respect to umbilical cord clamping, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to discuss benefits and risks and the duration of delayed cord clamping with the newborn's care providers and be cautious regarding delayed cord clamping in preterm infants with risk factors for significant hyperbilirubinemia (such as significant polycythemia, severe intrauterine growth restriction), high maternal antibody titers, and when the first infant in a pair of monochorionic twins is delivered.

### Guideline no. 424: umbilical cord management in preterm and term infants [^116jEZF3]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for umbilical cord management, more specifically with respect to considerations for delayed cord clamping, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that absolute contraindications of delayed cord clamping include (but are not limited to):

- fetal hydrops

- need for immediate resuscitation of mother or infant (except in centers with appropriate experience and equipment)

- disrupted utero-placental circulation (such as bleeding vasa previas)

- known twin-twin transfusion syndrome or twin anemia polycythemia sequence.

### Prevalence and contributing factors of birth asphyxia among the neonates delivered at nigist eleni mohammed memorial teaching hospital, Southern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study [^1136oTLH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

This study also showed that mothers encountering a prolonged second stage of labor were at a greater risk for birth asphyxia with respect to their counterparts. These findings were similar to those of studies conducted in Ethiopia, Colombia and Pakistan. One reason that babies born after a prolonged labor have a greater risk of birth asphyxia may be due to umbilical cord problems or the stress of too many contractions.

Meconium stained amniotic fluid was a contributing factor to birth asphyxia, similar to what was reported in Ethiopia, India, and Pakistan. Possibly, the presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid may cause aspiration of meconium-stained amniotic fluid to occur, and this can block small airways, deactivate surfactants and may also inhibit surfactant synthesis, resulting in birth asphyxia. As shown by the present study, prematurity was found to have a significant association with birth asphyxia, which is in line with what has been found in Ethiopia and Pakistan. A baby being born before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy may develop birth asphyxia due to an insufficient amount of surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant creates a continuously reforming surface layer over the alveoli which reduces surface tension, prevents atelectasis and maintains alveolar stability. A deficiency in pulmonary surfactant production causes Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

Birth asphyxia was also found to be associated with a tight nuchal cord. This finding is similar to that of the studies conducted in Ethiopia and Pakistan. This might be related to tight nuchal cord cords can interrupt normal blood, nutrient, and oxygen exchange by compressing the umbilical cord, or restricts arteries and veins in the fetal neck, this can lead to birth asphyxia.

### Neonatal advanced life support. neonatal resuscitation [^114bUkjw]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation — cord management methodology for preterm birth describes that an adolopment process guided adaptation of a systematic review and network meta-analysis with individual participant data and led to development of two PICOSTs questions and CoSTR statements. The first PICOST used an individual participant data pairwise meta-analysis of preterm infants born at less than 37+0 weeks' gestation and their mothers to compare deferred cord clamping or umbilical cord milking with immediate (early) cord clamping, with between-interventions (deferred cord clamping versus umbilical cord milking) also compared. Multiple infant and maternal outcomes were selected for assessment, including mortality before hospital discharge, major inpatient morbidities and maternal complications.

### Standardization of diagnosis for coiling of the umbilical cord around fetal neck by ultrasound [^112oLtK4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To elucidate classification of coiling of the umbilical cord around fetal neck (CUFN) by ultrasound and forming factors of entanglement angle of CUFN.

Methods

From January 2006 to December 2012, color Doppler ultrasonic was used to observe the blood flow vector of umbilical artery, and prospective descriptive observation was made for entanglement direction and type of 707 single fetuses taking prenatal examination in our hospital during the middle and late trimester of pregnancy and having umbilical cord echo around the neck. The relationship of position of fetus, position of placenta and entanglement direction of umbilical cord with the entanglement angle of umbilical cord is analyzed.

Results

Among the 707 fetuses, 634 had one circle of coiling, 43 had two circles of coiling, two had three circles of coiling, and 28 had CUFN. According to entanglement direction, 361 had entanglement from left to right and 318 had entanglement from right to left According to entanglement type, 305 were C-shaped type (43.14%), 85 were O-shaped type (12.02%), 289 were α-shaped type (40.88%), and 28 were L-shaped type (3.96%).

Conclusion

Color Doppler ultrasound was used to detect the entanglement direction of umbilical cord and establish the five-type classification of umbilical cord around the neck, laying the foundation for the feasibility of establishing the normalization of diagnostic standard of umbilical cord around the neck.

### 2022 interim guidance to health care providers for basic and advanced cardiac life support in adults, children, and neonates with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: from the emergency cardiovascular care committee and get with the guidelines-resuscitation adult and pediatric task forces of the American Heart Association in collaboration with the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association for Respiratory Care, the society of critical care anesthesiologists, and American society of anesthesiologists [^115tpd4a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2022). High credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation — care for newborns of mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: Every newborn baby should have a skilled attendant prepared to resuscitate regardless of COVID-19 status, and health care providers should don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). Routine initial steps are unlikely to be aerosol generating and include drying, tactile stimulation, placement into a plastic bag or wrap, assessment of heart rate, and placement of pulse oximetry and electrocardiographic leads. Suction of the airway after delivery should not be performed routinely for clear or meconium-stained amniotic fluid; suctioning is an AGP and is not indicated for uncomplicated deliveries, regardless of COVID-19 status. Endotracheal instillation of medications such as surfactant or epinephrine is an AGP (especially via an uncuffed tube), and intravenous epinephrine via a low-lying umbilical venous catheter is the preferred route of administration during neonatal resuscitation, regardless of COVID-19 status. Positive pressure ventilation remains the main resuscitation strategy for newborns with apnea, ineffective breathing (gasping), and bradycardia, with chest compressions occurring later in the algorithm. Delayed cord clamping and skin-to-skin contact may be practiced in stable neonates of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 positive mothers if the mother is appropriately masked, and until confirmed COVID-19 negative, such mothers should practice hand and breast hygiene and wear a mask during care and feeding. For neonatal intensive care patients, closed incubator transfer and care (with appropriate distancing) should be used when possible, but incubators do not protect against aerosolized particles.

### Neonatal advanced life support. neonatal resuscitation [^113hHoeC]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation — umbilical cord milking (UCM) guidance: The recommendation to consider UCM as an alternative to immediate cord clamping in infants born at 28+0 to 36+6 weeks' gestation was based on evidence for reduced red cell transfusion and higher hemoglobin after UCM compared with immediate clamping in infants both less than 32 weeks' gestation and 32 or more weeks' gestation, alongside low-certainty evidence that UCM may not reduce death before discharge. No evidence was identified for adverse effects in preterm infants less than 37 weeks' gestation or their mothers after UCM compared with immediate clamping, and there was no evidence for adverse effects after UCM compared with deferred clamping in preterm infants born at 28+0 to 36+6 weeks' gestation.

### Innovation in immediate neonatal care: development of the bedside assessment, stabilisation and initial cardiorespiratory support (BASICS) trolley [^113RmEXo]. BMJ Innovations (2015). Medium credibility.

Objective

Babies receive oxygen through their umbilical cord while in the uterus and for a few minutes after birth. Currently, if the baby is not breathing well at birth, the cord is cut so as to transfer the newborn to a resuscitation unit. We sought to develop a mobile resuscitation trolley on which newly born babies can be resuscitated while still receiving oxygenated blood and the 'placental transfusion' through the umbilical cord. This would also prevent separation of the mother and baby in the first minutes after birth.

Design

Multidisciplinary iterative product development.

Setting

Clinical Engineering Department of a University Teaching Hospital.

Methods

Following an initial design meeting, a series of prototypes were developed. At each stage, the prototype was reviewed by a team of experts in the laboratory and in the hospital delivery suite to determine ease of use and fitness for purpose. A commercial company was identified to collaborate on the trolley's development and secure marking with the Conformité Européenne mark, allowing the trolley to be introduced into clinical practice.

Results

The trolley is a small mobile resuscitation unit based on the concept of an overbed hospital table. It can be manoeuvred to within 50 cm of the mother's pelvis so that the umbilical cord can remain intact during resuscitation, irrespective of whether the baby is born naturally, by instrumental delivery or by caesarean section. Warmth for the newborn comes from a heated mattress and the trolley has the facility to provide suction, oxygen and air.

Conclusions

This is the first mobile resuscitation device designed specifically to facilitate newborn resuscitation at the bedside and with an intact cord. The next step is to assess its safety, its acceptability to clinicians and parents, and to determine whether it allows resuscitation with an intact cord.

### Prognostic risk score development to predict birth asphyxia using maternal and fetal characteristics in south gondar zone hospitals, north west Ethiopia [^115B6tDf]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The agreement could be accepted the fact that whiles the fetal membrane ruptured impulsively, extemporaneous amniotic liquid occurs lengthways with umbilical cord prolapse and compression. The longer the distance of the rapture of membranes, the more likely the uterus increases the incidence of fetal and maternal morbidity suffering, and mortality. Meconium aspiration syndrome was the additional prognostic determinant of birth asphyxia, which was analogous to the various studies conducted in the Swedish urban population, Uganda, Ethiopia (in different study areas and study populations).

The conceivable explanation, the occurrence of meconium in the amniotic fluid may cause aspiration of meconium-stained amniotic fluid to happen, and this can block minor airways, deactivate surfactants, chemical inflammation, and apoptosis of the pulmonary tissues, and may also constrain surfactant production, causing in a pulmonary air leak and birth asphyxia. Like other variables, a mother encountering prolonged second-stage labor was one of the prognostic determinants of birth asphyxia in this study. Hence, it was supported by studies accompanied in Ethiopia and Colombia. This might be the reason that babies born after extended labor have a larger danger of birth asphyxia and birth trauma leads to umbilical cord difficulties or the stress of too many contractions. Prematurity was another prognostic determinant of birth asphyxia, which was in line with a study found in Ethiopia and Pakistan.

Babies being born earlier than 37 completed weeks of gestation may be exposed to birth asphyxia due to an unsatisfactory amount of surfactant in the lungs. Surfactant generates an uninterruptedly reforming surface layer over the alveoli which diminishes surface tension, prevents atelectasis, and maintains alveolar stability. A deficiency in pulmonary surfactant production causes respiratory distress syndrome. The furthermore tight nuchal cord was a prognostic determinant of birth asphyxia. Previous studies evidenced that the tight nuchal cord was a strong substantial risk factor for birth asphyxia. This might be related to tight nuchal cords that can interject usual blood, nutrient, and oxygen exchange by compressing the umbilical cord or limiting arteries and veins in the fetal neck, which can lead to birth asphyxia.

Lastly, malpresentation was one of the prognostic determinants of birth asphyxia. Consequently, this study was supported by. The possible justification could be because malpresentation is often associated with premature rupture of membrane, a prognostic determinant in this study. Succeeding premature rupture of the membrane, newborn life intimidating occasions like umbilical cord accidents (cord prolapse and cord compression) would have occurred.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^111P3KrN]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — childbirth patient safety considerations emphasize positioning, newborn handling, and delivery precautions. For supine hypotension syndrome, if mother has hypotension before delivery, place patient in left lateral recumbent position or manually displace gravid uterus to the left in supine position, and knee-chest position may create safety issues during rapid ambulance transport. The guideline advises do not routinely suction the infant's airway (even with a bulb syringe) during delivery, newborns are very slippery, take care not to drop the infant, and dry, warm and stimulate all newborns to facilitate respirations and prevent hypothermia. It also cautions do not pull on the umbilical cord while the placenta is delivering and, if possible, transport between deliveries if mother is expecting twins.

### Amnioinfusion for potential or suspected umbilical cord compression in labour [^114URq32]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Amnioinfusion aims to prevent or relieve umbilical cord compression during labour by infusing a solution into the uterine cavity.

Objectives

To assess the effects of amnioinfusion for potential or suspected umbilical cord compression on maternal and perinatal outcome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 October 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of amnioinfusion compared with no amnioinfusion in women with babies at risk of umbilical cord compression in labour.

Data Collection and Analysis

The original review had one author only (Justus Hofmeyr (GJH)). For this update, two authors (GJH and T Lawrie) assessed 13 additional trial reports for eligibility and quality. We extracted data and checked for accuracy.

Main Results

We have included 19 studies, with all but two studies having fewer than 200 participants. Transcervical amnioinfusion for potential or suspected umbilical cord compression was associated with the following reductions: caesarean section overall (13 trials, 1493 participants; average risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.83); fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations (seven trials, 1006 participants; average RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74); Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (12 trials, 1804 participants; average RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.72); meconium below the vocal cords (three trials, 674 participants, RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92); postpartum endometritis (six trials, 767 participants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.81) and maternal hospital stay greater than three days (four trials, 1051 participants; average RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78). Transabdominal amnioinfusion showed similar trends, though numbers studied were small. Mean cord umbilical artery pH was higher in the amnioinfusion group (seven trials, 855 participants; average mean difference 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.06) and there was a trend toward fewer neonates with a low cord arterial pH (less than 7.2 or as defined by trial authors) in the amnioinfusion group (eight trials, 972 participants, average RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.14).

Authors' Conclusions

The use of amnioinfusion for potential or suspected umbilical cord compression may be of considerable benefit to mother and baby by reducing the occurrence of variable FHR decelerations, improving short-term measures of neonatal outcome, reducing maternal postpartum endometritis and lowering the use of caesarean section, although there were methodological limitations to the trials reviewed here. In addition, the trials are too small to address the possibility of rare but serious maternal adverse effects of amnioinfusion. More research is needed to confirm the findings, assess longer-term measures of fetal outcome, and to assess the impact on caesarean section rates when the diagnosis of fetal distress is more stringent. Trials should assess amnioinfusion in specific clinical situations, such as FHR decelerations, oligohydramnios or prelabour rupture of membranes.

### Risk factors for nuchal cord entanglement at delivery [^112m7qGj]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify nuchal cord risk factors.

Methods

The present case-control study was carried out between December 2016 and April 2017 at two hospitals in Yaoundé, Cameroon. Singletons with a nuchal cord at delivery (case group) as well as the two neonates without a nuchal cord delivered immediately after each case (control group), all in cephalic presentation, were included. Undated pregnancies were excluded. The main variables studied were maternal age, parity, pregnancy duration at delivery, cord insertion site, cord length, delivery weight, and fetal sex.

Results

A nuchal cord was present in 121 (6.0%) of 2015 singletons. The final analysis included 114 and 228 neonates in the case and control groups, respectively, with similar maternal age, parity, pregnancy duration, and delivery weight. Significant independent risk factors for nuchal cord formation were a cord length of 70 cm or more (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 19.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.63–42.04), a pregnancy duration of more than 42 weeks (aOR 7.43, 95% CI 1.46–37.21), marginal cord insertion (aOR 2.90, 95% CI 1.11–9.35), and a male fetus (aOR 2.14, 95% CI 1.16–7.74).

Conclusion

Marginal cord insertion and post-term pregnancy should be added to the list of known nuchal cord risk factors.

### Neonatal advanced life support. neonatal resuscitation [^113nCx1B]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Neonatal advanced life support — umbilical cord milking versus deferred cord clamping: An individual participant data pairwise meta-analysis included 1655 infants from 15 trials with a median gestational age at birth of 30 weeks, and the deferred clamping group used a time to cord clamping of 30 to 120 seconds. For preterm infants less than 37+0 weeks' gestation, a significant reduction in mortality before hospital discharge was not shown with umbilical cord milking versus deferred clamping (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59–1.53). Among preterm infants less than 32 weeks' gestation, intact umbilical cord milking appeared to carry a higher risk of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (OR 2.20, 95% CI, 1.13–4.31; Number needed to harm, 24 [95% CI, 9 to 200 infants more have severe intraventricular hemorrhage after umbilical cord milking compared with delayed cord clamping]), and one RCT was stopped early due to increased rates of severe intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants less than 28 weeks' gestation.

### Baby-directed umbilical cord clamping: a feasibility study [^115JTLm2]. Resuscitation (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over five percent of infants born worldwide will need help breathing after birth. Delayed cord clamping (DCC) has become the standard of care for vigorous infants. DCC in non-vigorous infants is uncommon because of logistical difficulties in providing effective resuscitation during DCC. In Baby-Directed Umbilical Cord Clamping (Baby-DUCC), the umbilical cord remains patent until the infant's lungs are exchanging gases. We conducted a feasibility study of the Baby-DUCC technique.

Methods

We obtained antenatal consent from pregnant women to enroll infants born at ≥ 32 weeks. Vigorous infants received ≥ 2 min of DCC. If the infant received respiratory support, the umbilical cord was clamped ≥ 60 s after the colorimetric carbon dioxide detector turned yellow. Maternal uterotonic medication was administered after umbilical cord clamping. A paediatrician and researcher entered the sterile field to provide respiratory support during a cesarean birth. Maternal and infant outcomes in the delivery room and prior to hospital discharge were analysed.

Results

Forty-four infants were enrolled, 23 delivered via cesarean section (8 unplanned) and 15 delivered vaginally (6 via instrumentation). Twelve infants were non-vigorous. ECG was the preferred method for recording HR. Two infants had a HR < 100 BPM. All HR values were > 100 BPM by 80 s after birth. Median time to umbilical cord clamping was 150 and 138 s in vigorous and non-vigorous infants, respectively. Median maternal blood loss was 300 ml.

Conclusions

It is feasible to provide resuscitation to term and near-term infants during DCC, after both vaginal and cesarean births, clamping the umbilical cord only when the infant is physiologically ready.
