## Question

Can I put pregnant patient on BiPAP?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether BiPAP can be used in pregnancy and how to apply it safely and effectively in this context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiologic changes of pregnancy that affect ventilation and oxygenation. Then, I should verify the indications and potential benefits of BiPAP in pregnancy-specific conditions. Next, I will review the risks and contraindications, including hemodynamic and fetal considerations. After that, I need to check the evidence base and guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize practical, stepwise recommendations for initiation, monitoring, and escalation, and close with a concise conclusion that aligns with the evidence and physiology.

> Let me first confirm the physiologic context. Pregnancy increases oxygen consumption by about 20% and reduces functional residual capacity due to diaphragmatic elevation, while progesterone drives a chronic respiratory alkalosis with lower PaCO2, all of which lower oxygen reserve and increase the risk of rapid desaturation during respiratory compromise. The gravid uterus can compress the IVC and aorta, impairing venous return and cardiac output, especially supine, so left uterine displacement becomes important in late gestation. I should also remember that pregnancy lowers the threshold for intubation because of these changes, so I need to keep a low threshold to escalate if noninvasive support fails.

> Now, I will examine the indications where BiPAP has been used in pregnancy. Case-based evidence supports BiPAP in late pregnancy for acute decompensation of pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure, where careful titration improved oxygenation without compromising hemodynamics, and in COVID-19 ARDS as a bridge to avoid intubation, sometimes alongside rescue strategies like inhaled nitric oxide when hypoxemia persisted despite high PEEP and FiO2 [^1173PpVV] [^1139c1PW]. Hold on, I should verify the hemodynamic rationale: in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, noninvasive ventilation can reduce left ventricular afterload, improve oxygenation, and potentially avert invasive ventilation, which is particularly relevant in peripartum cardiac disease [^1112ruHJ].

> Next, I should review the potential benefits. BiPAP can improve oxygenation and ventilation while reducing the work of breathing, which is valuable in pregnancy where oxygen consumption is high and FRC is low; it may also reduce the need for intubation and its associated risks, including aspiration, hemodynamic instability, and preterm delivery triggers from positive pressure and sedatives, though I need to be cautious not to overstate causality from observational data [^1112ruHJ]. Let me consider the fetal side: maternal oxygenation directly supports fetal oxygen delivery, so improving maternal SpO2 and PaO2 is a key fetal benefit when BiPAP is effective [^115Tw7vk].

> I will now examine the risks and contraindications. Positive pressure can reduce venous return and cardiac output, which may be problematic in hypotension or shock; in pulmonary hypertension with RV failure, abrupt high intrathoracic pressures can worsen RV afterload, so pressures should be titrated carefully with close hemodynamic monitoring and a plan to escalate if unstable [^1112ruHJ]. Wait, let me verify the concern about myocardial infarction with BiPAP: small studies in acute heart failure suggested possible harm with BiPAP compared with CPAP, but these signals are inconsistent and confounded; nonetheless, I should avoid BiPAP in patients with low PCO2 or suspected MI and favor CPAP when the etiology is unclear or cardiac ischemia is a concern [^112AjzkK] [^114fNVow]. Additional risks include mask discomfort, aerophagia, and theoretical aerosolization with infectious etiologies, which argues for airborne precautions and helmet or well-sealed interfaces when feasible [^1166PUPy].

> Let me consider absolute and relative contraindications. I should not use BiPAP in patients with impaired consciousness, inability to protect the airway, hemodynamic instability, or severe facial trauma. In pregnancy-specific contexts, I should be cautious with severe preeclampsia with pulmonary edema and RV failure, and I should avoid high PEEP in the setting of aortocaval compression without left uterine displacement, as this can further impair venous return [^115Tw7vk]. Hold on, I should verify the ARDS caveat: in moderate-to-severe ARDS, NIV may fail and delay needed intubation, so I need to monitor closely for worsening gas exchange, rising PaCO2, or mental status decline and escalate promptly if present [^1166PUPy].

> Next, I should review the evidence quality. The strongest support is from case reports and small series in pregnancy, including pulmonary hypertension and COVID-19 ARDS, which consistently show feasibility and physiologic benefit but are low-certainty by design. Broader nonpregnant data suggest NIV can reduce intubation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, but heterogeneity and limited pregnancy-specific RCTs mean I must individualize decisions and monitor closely for failure [^1173PpVV] [^1139c1PW] [^113ZeyaL]. I should double-check that no major society issues a blanket endorsement for BiPAP in pregnancy. Instead, guidance emphasizes maternal stabilization with appropriate ventilatory support and multidisciplinary care, which implicitly includes judicious use of NIV when indicated [^113zrEya].

> I will now translate this into practical recommendations. First, select patients carefully: use BiPAP for hypoxemic or mixed respiratory failure due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, decompensated pulmonary hypertension with RV involvement, or selected cases of COVID-19 ARDS when high-flow nasal oxygen has failed and the patient is cooperative with intact airway reflexes; avoid in shock, altered mentation, or suspected MI, and favor CPAP if the etiology is unclear or cardiac ischemia is suspected [^1173PpVV] [^1139c1PW] [^114fNVow]. Let me think about positioning and hemodynamics: ensure left uterine displacement in late gestation, start with low pressures (for example, IPAP 10–12 cm H2O, EPAP 5 cm H2O), and titrate to improve oxygenation and work of breathing while watching blood pressure and mental status; if RV failure is present, titrate PEEP cautiously to balance recruitment against venous return [^115Tw7vk] [^1112ruHJ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and escalation. Continuous pulse oximetry, frequent vital signs, and serial ABGs are essential. I need a low threshold to intubate if there is worsening hypoxemia, rising PaCO2 with acidosis, hemodynamic instability, or declining mental status, recognizing that pregnancy lowers the safe margin for apnea and delays in airway management can be catastrophic [^113eMMZU]. Hold on, I should verify adjuncts: in refractory hypoxemia with suspected or confirmed pulmonary hypertension, inhaled nitric oxide can be considered as a bridge, and if NIV fails and ECMO criteria are met, pregnant and postpartum patients are generally considered appropriate candidates for venovenous ECMO in experienced centers [^1139c1PW] [^11613xce].

> But wait, what if the patient is in late pregnancy with severe ARDS and I am worried about proning? I initially thought pregnancy might be a contraindication to prone positioning, but let me reconsider: modified prone positioning with uterine offloading can be performed safely in gravid patients with appropriate supports, and it may improve oxygenation when done correctly, so I should not dismiss it outright if hypoxemia persists despite optimized NIV or invasive ventilation [^116NjYUp]. I should confirm that institutional protocols and trained staff are in place before attempting this maneuver [^116NjYUp].

> Finally, I need to ensure multidisciplinary coordination. Involve obstetrics for fetal surveillance, anesthesia for airway planning and delivery timing, and cardiology or critical care for disease-specific management. Document maternal-fetal risks and benefits, and plan delivery location and anesthesia strategy in advance if instability is anticipated, as maternal stabilization remains the priority to optimize fetal outcomes [^113zrEya] [^112HKdm8]. I should double-check that invasive hemodynamic monitoring is reserved for select cases with cardiopulmonary decompensation or high-risk lesions, and that arterial lines are used when beat-to-beat blood pressure or frequent ABGs will guide care [^112HKdm8].

> In summary, yes, BiPAP can be used in pregnancy when indicated, with the strongest support in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, decompensated pulmonary hypertension with RV failure, and selected ARDS cases as a bridge to avoid intubation. Benefits include improved oxygenation and reduced work of breathing, but risks include hemodynamic compromise and delayed intubation, so careful selection, cautious titration, vigilant monitoring, and a low threshold to escalate are essential, ideally within a multidisciplinary framework [^1173PpVV] [^1139c1PW] [^1112ruHJ] [^113zrEya].

In select pregnant patients with **respiratory failure**, BiPAP is appropriate when used with **close monitoring** and a **multidisciplinary approach** [^1112ruHJ]. It improves oxygenation, reduces work of breathing, and may avoid intubation, but **risks include gastric insufflation, aspiration, and hemodynamic effects**. Avoid BiPAP in **hemodynamic instability**, **altered mental status**, or **facial trauma**, and monitor for fetal distress. Use **lung-protective settings** (plateau < 30 cm H2O, driving pressure < 15 cm H2O) and be ready to escalate to invasive ventilation if there is no improvement or deterioration [^1112ruHJ] [^1166PUPy].

---

## Indications for BiPAP in pregnancy

BiPAP is indicated in pregnant patients with **acute respiratory failure** from:

- **Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema**: Reduces preload/afterload, improves oxygenation, and may avoid intubation [^1112ruHJ].

- **Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)**: Improves oxygenation and reduces respiratory events [^notfound].

- **COVID-19-related respiratory distress**: Used as a bridge to avoid intubation in selected cases [^114vY2aJ] [^1166PUPy].

- **Pulmonary hypertension with right ventricular failure**: Improves oxygenation and reduces RV afterload [^1173PpVV] [^1112ruHJ].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

BiPAP is **contraindicated or requires caution** in the following scenarios:

| **Contraindications** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamic instability | Facial trauma or deformity |
| Altered mental status | Gastric insufflation or aspiration risk |
| Severe facial trauma | patient discomfort or intolerance |
| Untreated pneumothorax | Need for close monitoring |

---

## Physiological considerations and adjustments

Pregnancy alters respiratory mechanics and oxygenation; therefore, **adjust BiPAP settings** accordingly:

- **Increased oxygen consumption**: Higher FiO2 may be needed to maintain adequate oxygenation [^115Tw7vk].

- **Reduced functional residual capacity**: Lower tidal volumes (6–8 mL/kg PBW) to avoid overdistension [^1112ruHJ].

- **Aortocaval compression**: Use left lateral tilt or displacement to improve venous return [^115Tw7vk].

- **Permissive hypercapnia**: Accept mild hypercapnia to avoid high tidal volumes; monitor for fetal acidosis [^1112ruHJ].

---

## Potential risks and complications

BiPAP in pregnancy carries **potential risks**:

- **Gastric insufflation and aspiration**: Increased risk due to reduced lower esophageal sphincter tone [^notfound].

- **Hemodynamic effects**: Positive pressure may reduce venous return and cardiac output, especially in hypotension [^1112ruHJ].

- **Fetal hypoxia**: Inadequate oxygenation or ventilation can compromise fetal well-being [^115Tw7vk].

- **Patient discomfort**: Mask intolerance or claustrophobia may limit adherence [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and safety measures

Continuous monitoring and a **multidisciplinary approach** are essential:

- **Maternal monitoring**: Continuous pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and frequent ABGs [^112HKdm8].

- **Fetal monitoring**: Continuous cardiotocography to assess fetal well-being [^notfound].

- **Multidisciplinary team**: Obstetricians, anesthesiologists, neonatologists, and respiratory therapists [^notfound].

- **Emergency readiness**: Immediate access to intubation and invasive ventilation equipment [^112V6DD3].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Limited data suggest BiPAP can **improve oxygenation**, reduce respiratory rate, and lower intubation rates in pregnant patients with acute respiratory failure. It is effective for cardiogenic pulmonary edema and OSA in pregnancy, though evidence is limited and careful patient selection is required [^1112ruHJ] [^117Ah7Ds].

---

## Guidelines and expert consensus

There are **no pregnancy-specific guidelines**; expert consensus supports selective use with close monitoring and a low threshold to escalate to invasive ventilation if there is no improvement or deterioration [^1166PUPy].

---

## Alternative respiratory support methods

If BiPAP is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider:

- **High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC)**: Provides humidified oxygen with mild positive pressure; well tolerated in pregnancy [^111PGyWG].

- **Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)**: Useful for OSA and mild respiratory failure [^112ZKRHh].

- **Invasive mechanical ventilation**: Indicated for severe respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, or failed non-invasive support [^1139c1PW].

---

BiPAP can be used safely in pregnancy when carefully selected and monitored, offering benefits such as improved oxygenation and avoidance of intubation; however, **close monitoring and readiness to escalate care** are essential to mitigate risks [^1112ruHJ].

Evidence quality and recommendation strength — The Work Group used the GRADE approach to craft each recommendation and determine its strength, and per the GRADE approach, recommendations must be evidence based and cannot be made based on expert opinion alone. The GRADE approach uses domains to inform recommendation strength: confidence in the quality of the evidence; balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes; patient values and preferences; and other considerations, as appropriate (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations). Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation (Strong or Weak), and the strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects. A Strong recommendation generally indicates High or Moderate confidence in the quality of the available evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility). When evidence is insufficient, the Work Group might include a statement of insufficient evidence, might decide to exclude this type of statement, might remain silent where an absence of evidence occurs for a rarely used intervention, or that an intervention might have a favorable balance of benefits and harms but might be a standard of care for which no recent evidence has been generated.

The temporal change in BP showed a mid-pregnancy fall with a nadir at GA 24–28 weeks, see intra-group difference in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. For the modified-intention-to-treat analysis, the SBP nadir was significant only in the CPAP, but not in the usual-care group (Fig. 2). DBP was lower throughout pregnancy in the CPAP-group with mean differences (95% CI) of − 3.09 (− 5.34, − 0.93), − 3.49 (− 5.67, − 1.31) and − 3.03 (− 5.20, − 0.85) mmHg at GA 18–20, 24–28, and 32–34 weeks, respectively when compared to GA < 16 weeks; a DBP reduction was only significant in the usual-care group at the GA 24–28 weeks nadir (Fig. 3). MAP was also lower in the CPAP-group at all time-points with the corresponding mean of − 2.76 (− 5.09, − 0.42), − 3.56 (− 5.92, − 1.20), and − 2.91 (− 5.92, − 0.55) mmHg; again, only the GA 24–28 weeks nadir was significant in the usual-care group (Fig. 4).

### Continuous positive airway pressure treatment and hypertensive adverse outcomes in pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Ah7Ds]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association between continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and lowered risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia for pregnant women with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 studies including 809 pregnant women with OSA, the pooled results showed a significant reduction in the risk of gestational hypertension (35%) and preeclampsia (30%).

Meaning

These findings suggest that implementing CPAP treatment in pregnant women with OSA may reduce the risk of adverse gestational hypertensive outcomes.

### Caring for two: management of the critically ill cardiac patient during pregnancy [^1112ruHJ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Positive end-expiratory pressure is essential to prevent alveolar collapse, but should be used cautiously to avoid excessive intrathoracic pressure, which can impair venous return and cardiac output. Optimal positive end-expiratory pressure titration with driving pressure < 15 cm H 2 O is recommended. Maintaining plateau pressures < 30 cm H 2 O helps mitigate barotrauma risk. Interventions aimed to improve oxygenation within this population is imperative, with target saturation > 92% or PO 2 > 70 mm Hg. Hyperoxygenation may be harmful to the fetus, by decreasing cardiac output and fetal oxygen delivery. However, data remain limited on this and vary according to guidelines.

While permissive hypercapnia is an accepted approach for ventilating patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring lung-protective ventilation, hypercapnia may lead to fetal acidosis. This may reduce the gradient for excretion of fetal CO 2, and right-shift the fetal oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, reducing fetal oxygen transport. In the presence of uncompensated acidosis, fetal acidosis may occur but likely does not have the ominous implications of lactic acidosis secondary to hypoxia. Managing hypercapnia involves a balance of worsening lung injury by higher tidal volume ventilation, against the unclear adverse effects of mild hypercapnia on the fetus. Hypocapnia and alkalosis may be harmful by reducing placental perfusion.

Pregnancy-related cardiovascular changes, including increased plasma volume, cardiac output, and decreased systemic vascular resistance can worsen pre-existing heart disease. Pulmonary congestion resulting from left ventricular dysfunction may necessitate noninvasive ventilation (bilevel positive airway pressure). Its benefits include reducing left ventricular afterload, decreasing the work of breathing, enhancing oxygenation and ventilation, and lastly, preventing invasive mechanical ventilation.

Another factor to consider within the cardiac population is that lung-protective strategies are essential during right ventricular failure to minimize right ventricular afterload. Low tidal volumes (6–8 mL/kg) help prevent alveolar overdistension, while positive end-expiratory pressure should be cautiously optimized to balance oxygenation without hindering venous return. In this instance, avoidance of hypercapnia is needed as it exacerbates pulmonary vasoconstriction and elevates right ventricular workload. Given physiologic changes with right ventricular failure, awake fiberoptic intubation may be considered. Prone positioning (include using specially designed positioning pillows or foam supports to allow for uterine offloading and chest expansion, proning in left lateral decubitus rotation or a modified prone position to avoid aortocaval compression) and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) may be considered a rescue therapy.

### Days spent on non-invasive ventilation support: can it determine when to initiate VV-ECMO? Observational study in a cohort of COVID-19 patients [^1145z2Cj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of days spent on mechanical ventilation before interventions, such as venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) or steroids, has been used to classify different clinical stages of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This classification tries to differentiate between an early phase, most of the times defined within the first week from endotracheal intubation (ETI) when interventions could potentially change the ARDS evolution, and a late phase, normally more than seven days from ETI when interventions would theoretically be ineffective. This classification, where day 0 is defined by the day of ETI, represents a somewhat historic cohort given that in the past most of the patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) were not treated with any form of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) prior to ETI.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of NIV for hypoxemic ARF extraordinarily increased, initially due to logistical reasons, but soon after it became a more standard practice with observational reports showing that this NIV approach could be associated with a decrease in mortality (although study designs do not allow inferring causality) especially when compared to that of an early intubation approach. NIV in whatever form it be, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), probably heralds the initial stage of alveolar collapse of ARDS where positive pressure is required to maintain adequate oxygenation. HFNC can be included as a NIV modality but important differences exist in the level of positive pressure that can provide support to reduce the work of breathing and improve oxygenation. Furthermore, important concerns still exist respect to the effect that these pressures may have in the lung specially regarding the patient's self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) hypothesis although no solid scientific data has demonstrated so far that invasive ventilation would be less harmful than NIV, especially when high PEEP is required or recruitment manoeuvres are performed.

Recommendations

1. CPAP or (s)NIPPV should be started from birth in all babies at risk of RDS, such as those < 30 weeks of gestation who do not need intubation for stabilisation (A1).

2. NIV with early rescue surfactant by LISA technique is considered optimal management for babies with RDS (A1).

3. The system delivering CPAP is of little importance; however, the interface should be short binasal prongs or mask with a starting pressure of about 6–8 cm H 2 O (A2). Ability to escalate to NIPPV will reduce the need for invasive MV in some infants (A1).

4. BIPAP devices confer no advantage over CPAP alone (A2). However, synchronised NIPPV, if delivered through a ventilator, can reduce need for ventilation or need for re-ventilation following extubation and may reduce BPD (A2).

5. HFNC can be used as an alternative to CPAP for some babies, with the advantage of less nasal trauma, provided centres have access to CPAP or NIPPV for those failing this mode (B2).

MV Strategies

Despite best efforts to maintain as many preterm babies as possible on NIV, around half of babies < 28 weeks will require MV and those that do have worse outcomes. In addition, around half of infants < 28 weeks will also fail their first attempt at extubation and they too have worse outcomes. It is important that those managing infants with RDS understand the principles of MV to minimise the risk of iatrogenic lung injury. The aim of MV is to provide "acceptable" blood gases by ventilating at optimal lung volumes (open lung concept) while avoiding over-distension and atelectasis. Pulmonary over-distension increases risk of air leaks and pulmonary interstitial emphysema, while ventilating at sub-optimally low pressures may cause atelectasis and repeated pulmonary sheer stress, which in turn can generate inflammation and lung injury.

CONCLUSIONS

It should be noted that there is no sufficient scientific evidence to recommend BiPAP or helmet due to the limited number of trials available. Large rigorous randomized trials are needed to answer these questions definitely.

Results

At the 13 study sites, retrospective chart review was completed for 876 eligible women who met inclusion criteria. We excluded 107 women; 93 of these were excluded because they were missing at least 10 out of 19 candidate predictor variables included in the imputation step and 14 because they were missing outcome data. A final cohort of 769 women was identified for analysis.

Characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1, comparing women with and without the primary adverse outcome of death or morbidity, as previously defined. Women with the primary adverse outcome were younger and more often accessed care through private facilities, were admitted for non-obstetric reasons, were admitted to the ICU earlier in gestation and for longer, and had a greater number of early pregnancy losses and stillbirths. The primary outcome was observed in 127 (16.5%) women. Of these, 59 (7.7%) were maternal deaths and 68 (8.8%) required one or more component of organ support alone. The most common organ support outcome was the need for respiratory support (Table 2).

Discussion and conclusions

Although the currently available data mostly suggest mild courses of the disease during pregnancy, the management of ARDS is particularly challenging in these patients. Our patient met the criteria for severe ARDS due to COVID-19 with refractory hypoxemia, despite optimized mechanical ventilation in evaluation for ECMO therapy. Considering the decompensating maternal condition and early gestational age, both maternal and fetal outcomes needed to be considered. The current management of ARDS consists of supportive care, including low tidal volume ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, and prone positioning in moderate-to-severe ARDS. In cases of worsening, refractory hypoxemia (P/F ratio < 80 for > 6 h, or < 50 for > 3 h), patients should be considered for ECMO. Pregnant women have an increased risk of developing ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation compared to non-pregnant women. In addition, ARDS management might also be complicated in pregnant women due to physiological pregnancy-related changes in the cardiorespiratory system such as reduced functional residual capacity and increased oxygen consumption. Due to the patient's severe obesity, she had a high risk of disease deterioration. Obesity is associated with altered pulmonary mechanics and physiology, with increased ACE2 expression, which is suspected to further increase the risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19. Various studies have shown that obesity and its associated complications, including hypertension and diabetes, are among the most crucial factors increasing the risk for a more serious course of COVID-19 requiring hospital admission and probably invasive ventilation. Other risk factors include older age, male sex, several ethnicities, smoking, COPD, malignant disease, immunodeficiency, and several coagulation disorders.

Conclusions

In this multicenter US cohort study, most pregnant and postpartum individuals who required ECMO for COVID-19–associated respiratory failure survived, but experienced high frequency of serious maternal morbidity and pregnancy loss events. These findings suggest that pregnant and postpartum patients should be considered good candidates for ECMO initiation for COVID-19–associated respiratory failure.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Heart failure clinical data standards — mechanical ventilatory support is defined as mechanical ventilation, or assisted ventilation, used for artificial ventilation where mechanical means assist or replace spontaneous breathing, with permissible values of Mechanical ventilation, CPAP, BiPAP, Adaptive servo-ventilation, and None. Mechanical ventilation is described as a life-sustaining technique moving gas toward and from the lungs via an external device connected directly to the patient. CPAP is described as continuous positive airway pressure/power applying mild air pressure on a continuous basis to keep airways continuously open in patients who can breathe spontaneously but need help keeping their airway unobstructed. BiPAP is described as a noninvasive therapy in which positive air pressure is higher during inspiration and lower during expiration. Adaptive servo-ventilation is positive airway pressure therapy in which the air pressure target is adjusted to the patient's breathing patterns; in patients with NYHA class II–IV HFrEF and central sleep apnea, adaptive servo-ventilation causes harm.

### Ventilatory parameters in obstetric patients with COVID-19 and impact of delivery: a multicenter prospective cohort study [^1119zL1o]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Current evidence on obstetric patients requiring advanced ventilatory support and impact of delivery on ventilatory parameters is retrospective, scarce, and controversial.

Research Question

What are the ventilatory parameters for obstetric patients with COVID-19 and how does delivery impact them? What are the risk factors for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and for maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality?

Study Design and Methods

Prospective, multicenter, cohort study including pregnant and postpartum patients with COVID-19 requiring advanced ventilatory support in the ICU.

Results

Ninety-one patients were admitted to 21 ICUs at 29.2 ± 4.9 weeks; 63 patients (69%) delivered in ICU. Maximal ventilatory support was as follows: IMV, 69 patients (76%); high-flow nasal cannula, 20 patients (22%); and noninvasive mechanical ventilation, 2 patients (2%). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment during the first 24 h (SOFA 24) score was the only risk factor for IMV (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.29–2.99; p = 0.001). Respiratory parameters at IMV onset for pregnant patients were: mean ± SD plateau pressure (PP), 24.3 ± 4.5 cm H 2 O; mean ± SD driving pressure (DP), 12.5 ± 3.3 cm H 2 O; median static compliance (SC), 31 mL/cm H 2 O (interquartile range [IQR], 26–40 mL/cm H 2 O); and median Pao 2 to Fio 2 ratio, 142 (IQR, 110–176). Respiratory parameters before (< 2 h) and after (≤ 2 h and 24 h) delivery were, respectively: mean ± SD PP, 25.6 ± 6.6 cm H 2 O, 24 ± 6.7 cm H 2 O, and 24.6 ± 5.2 cm H 2 O (P = 0.59); mean ± SD DP, 13.6 ± 4.2 cm H 2 O, 12.9 ± 3.9 cm H 2 O, and 13 ± 4.4 cm H 2 O (P = 0.69); median SC, 28 mL/cm H 2 O (IQR, 22.5–39 mL/cm H 2 O), 30 mL/cm H 2 O (IQR, 24.5–44 mL/cm H 2 O), and 30 mL/cm H 2 O (IQR, 24.5–44 mL/cm H 2 O; p = 0.058); and Pao 2 to Fio 2 ratio, 134 (IQR, 100–230), 168 (IQR, 136–185), and 192 (IQR, 132–232.5; p = 0.022). Reasons for induced delivery were as follows: maternal, 43 of 71 patients (60.5%); maternal and fetal, 21 of 71 patients (29.5%); and fetal, 7 of 71 patients (9.9%). Fourteen patients (22.2%) continued pregnancy after ICU discharge. Risk factors for maternal mortality were BMI (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.006–1.204; p = 0.037) and comorbidities (OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 1.212–14.20; p = 0.023). Risk factors for fetal or neonatal mortality were gestational age at delivery (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.86; p = 0.002) and SOFA 24 score (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.13–2.08; p = 0.006).

Interpretation

Contrary to expectations, pregnant patient lung mechanics were similar to those of the general population with COVID-19 in the ICU. Delivery was induced mainly for maternal reasons, but did not change ventilatory parameters other than Pao 2 to Fio 2 ratio. SOFA 24 score was the only risk factor for IMV. Maternal mortality was associated independently with BMI and comorbidities. Risk factors for fetal and neonatal mortality were SOFA 24 score and gestational age at delivery.

Perinatal care

Given the patient's unstable condition, risk for further respiratory and hemodynamic decompensation, and promising fetal condition, a multidisciplinary expert consultation with anesthesiologists, obstetricians, and neonatologists agreed to proceed with a cesarean section. The patient was started on magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection. On day 4 of hospitalization, at 28 + 1 gestational weeks, the cesarean section was conducted in the ICU in compliance with strict safety guidelines, using full personal protective equipment. A liveborn male neonate weighing 1445 g was delivered with an Apgar score of 3/7/7 at 1, 5, and 10 min. The amniotic fluid was clear, while intraoperative blood loss was estimated to be 500 mL. The patient received oxytocin intraoperatively and postpartum to prevent uterine atony, as well as a single-shot antibiotic prophylaxis with cefazolin.

### Putting It all together: clinical considerations in the care of critically ill obstetric patients with COVID-19 [^116NjYUp]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for the clinical condition newly described in 2019 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and illness severity to warrant intensive care have a complex disease process that must involve multiple disciplines. Guidelines from various clinical societies, along with direction from local health authorities, must be considered when approaching the care of an obstetric patient with known or suspected COVID-19. With a rapidly changing landscape, a simplified and cohesive perspective using guidance from different clinical society recommendations regarding the critically-ill obstetric patient with COVID-19 is needed. In this article, we synthesize various high-level guidelines of clinical relevance in the management of pregnant patients with severe disease or critical illness due to COVID-19. KEY POINTS: · When caring for severely ill obstetric patients with COVID-19, one must be well versed in the complications that may need to be managed including, but not limited to adult respiratory distress syndrome with need for mechanical ventilation, approach to refractory hypoxemia, hemodynamic shock, and multiorgan system failure. · Prone positioning can be done safely in gravid patients but requires key areas of support to avoid abdominal compression. · For the critically ill obstetric patient with COVID-19, the focus should be on supportive care as a bridge to recovery rather than delivery as a solution to recovery.

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in pregnancy [^114CuU4X]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Safety and efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in pregnancy is unknown.

Case

A 33-year-old pregnant woman at 23 weeks of gestation presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome unresponsive to conventional mechanical ventilation. Early initiation of ECMO therapy along with protective mechanical ventilation strategy resulted in an excellent maternal and fetal outcome.

Conclusion

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be life saving when initiated early in pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory insufficiency unresponsive to conventional mechanical ventilation.

Considering the intergroup difference at the different time-points, CPAP treatment significantly lowered DBP [− 3.18 (− 5.32, − 1.04)] and MAP [− 3.07 (− 5.40, − 0.73)] mmHg at GA 32–34 week, resulting from the marked increase in BP after the nadir-point of 24–28 week in the usual-care group in contrast to the persistently lowered BP of the CPAP-group (Figs. 2, 3, 4). These trends were still consistent in subgroups of participants who did and did not take anti-hypertensive medications (Additional file 2: Figs. S1, S2, S3, S4). Furthermore, in those taking anti-hypertensive medication, the BP nadir-point and the increase thereafter occurred earlier at GA 18–20 weeks in the usual-care group. However, this early increase in BP was prevented by CPAP use (Additional file 2: Figs. S1, S2, S3, S4).

Every hour of CPAP use decreased SBP, DBP, and MAP by − 0.60 (− 1.19, − 0.01), − 0.50 (− 0.89, − 0.10), and − 0.53 (− 0.97, − 0.09) mmHg, respectively.

Since the emergence of a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 has been associated with severe morbidity and mortality and has left world governments, healthcare systems, and providers caring for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, wrestling with the optimal management strategy. Unique physiologic and ethical considerations negate a one-size-fits-all approach when caring for critically ill pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, and few resources exist to guide the multidisciplinary team through decisions regarding optimal maternal-fetal surveillance, intensive care procedures, and delivery timing. We present a case of rapid clinical decompensation and development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in a woman at 31 weeks' gestation to highlight these unique considerations and present an algorithmic approach to the diagnosis and management of the disease.

Approach to the non-intubated COVID-19 patient

Monitoring respiratory drive and effort are essential in spontaneously breathing patients to detect early stages of respiratory fatigue. Although non-invasive ventilatory (NIV) maneuvers have been employed in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and the literature regarding the adequate timing for intubation is controversial, most authors agree that in the presence of impaired respiratory mechanics, worsening of respiratory acidosis and most importantly decreased mental status, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation should not be delayed.

For spontaneously breathing patients with mild-to-moderate dyspnea and hypoxemia, non-responsive to regular low-flow nasal cannula, initial approach may involve the use of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and awake prone positioning based on limited clinical data. HFNC, although initially controversial due to its aerosolizing potential, it was found to be safe in further studies, with a bio-aerosol dispersion not significantly different from regular nasal prongs. Airborne precautions among the treating staff should be maintained and the patient should be placed in a negative pressure room if available. Yang et al. demonstrated higher survival among patients with HFNC when compared to other means of mechanical ventilation, either non-invasive or invasive. Awake prone positioning involves the patient lying on his/her abdomen as a method to improve secretion clearance and recruitment of atelectatic lung tissue at the dependent lung bases.

NIV support (continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] or Bi-level positive airway pressure [BiPAP]) has been employed in COVID-19 patients as a last resource to circumvent endotracheal intubation after failing HFNC and awake prone positioning, although no formal recommendation regarding their use has been released due to the risk of aerosolization. CPAP seems to provide the greatest advantage among NIV for COVID-19 pneumonia patients, since it provides the greatest amount of mean airway pressure leading a more effective alveolar recruitment when compared with BiPAP. This latter has been found to be more appropriate for specific certain group of patients with other concomitant co-morbidities (i.e. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure). Due to the aerosolizing potential of the traditional NIV techniques, the use of a "helmet CPAP" as a means to non-invasive ventilation interface have been proposed. The use of bronchodilators should be minimized and instead nebulization metered dose inhalers should be employed.

PAP modalities — Recommendation 6 states: We suggest that clinicians use CPAP or APAP over BIPAP in the routine treatment of OSA in adults. (CONDITIONAL). Remarks clarify that this recommendation is based on BPAP defined as a respiratory assist device that delivers inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressure and applies to all BPAP devices including flexible, modified, and auto-adjusting BPAP; BPAP devices may need to be used for patients with higher therapeutic pressure requirements than can be provided by CPAP or APAP devices; this recommendation is for the initial treatment of OSA and does not address management of patients who have previously failed CPAP or APAP, and treatment of other forms of sleep-related breathing disorders associated with hypercapnia, which may require the use of BPAP, are covered in other AASM guidelines. Evidence reviewed included that the TF examined BPAP versus CPAP for adherence, sleepiness, and QOL, the TF identified 5 RCTs that compared the use of BPAP to CPAP, meta-analyses demonstrated no clinically significant differences in adherence, and, while no direct evidence was available for APAP to BPAP, the TF considers APAP to be equivalent to CPAP for the implementation of this recommendation.

However, she presented with worsening symptoms of respiratory distress the next day, with the following vital signs: respiratory rate: 50/min; SpO 2: 89% on room air; blood pressure: 87/49 mmHg; and heart rate: 115 bpm. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where non-invasive ventilation therapy was initiated. She received intravenous fluids and a low dosage of supportive catecholamines, and was started on ampicillin/sulbactam for antibiotic treatment of suspected bacterial coinfection. Weight-adapted prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and enoxaparin (40 mg twice daily) were administered. Chest radiography showed bilateral opacities in the lower lobes and left middle lobe, consistent with pneumonia (Fig. 1 A–C). Laboratory test results showed lymphopenia, eosinophilia, anemia, and elevated C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels (Table 1). Maternal echocardiography revealed no signs of cardiac failure. Fetal sonography and cardiotocographic monitoring showed no signs of fetal distress. Antenatal corticosteroids were administered to accelerate fetal lung maturation due to the risk of preterm birth. On day 2 of hospitalization and at 28 + 0 gestational weeks, her respiratory condition worsened; she was consequently intubated and transferred to a larger hospital. Despite maximum ventilatory support, the patient developed further deterioration of oxygenation and decarboxylation with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) ratio of 84; therefore, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy was considered a possible rescue therapy. On day 3 of hospitalization, she was transferred to our tertiary center for ECMO evaluation. The patient initially presented with a PF ratio of 84, receiving biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and requiring a FiO 2 of 1.0, peak pressure of 35 mbar, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 mbar, resulting in a tidal volume of 334 mL. However, local ECMO entry criteria based on the EOLIA Trial by Combes et al. (PF ratio < 80 for > 6 h among others) were not met upon admission; thus, the patient was not started on ECMO treatment. Instead, rescue therapy with nitric oxide was initiated, which improved the PF ratio (Fig. 2). Fetal sonography performed upon arrival showed an estimated fetal weight of 1578 g, and normal umbilical artery Doppler values, and amniotic fluid measurements.

### Successful use of CPAP in a pregnant patient with COVID-19 pneumonia [^114vY2aJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 35-year-old nurse, who was 27 weeks pregnant at the time, was admitted to hospital with a short history of cough, fever and worsening shortness of breath. Oral and nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time viral PCR. During her admission, her breathing further deteriorated and she developed type 1 respiratory failure. A decision was made to trial treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as a means of avoiding intubation. The patient tolerated this well and made rapid improvements on this therapy. She was quickly weaned off and fully recovered before being discharged home. This case highlights the potential for CPAP to be used as a means of avoiding mechanical ventilation and iatrogenic preterm birth in COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy. Furthermore, it highlights the need for robust evidence to support this treatment.

Acute heart failure syndromes — noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in the emergency department is addressed with graded recommendations and supporting evidence: Level A recommendations are none specified. Level B recommendations state to use 5 to 10 mm Hg CPAP by nasal or face mask for dyspneic patients with acute heart failure syndrome without hypotension or the need for emergent intubation to improve heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and reduce intubation and possibly reduce inhospital mortality. Level C recommendations state to consider using BiPAP as an alternative to CPAP for dyspneic patients with acute heart failure syndrome; however, data about the possible association between BiPAP and myocardial infarction remain unclear. Supporting text notes that initial studies of CPAP at 5 to 10 mm Hg consistently showed significant improvements in oxygenation and reductions in heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure versus standard oxygen therapy, yet with the exception of one study that showed a reduction in mortality, a statistically significant benefit over standard oxygen therapy has not been found for hospital length of stay and mortality.

### Intensive care considerations for the critically ill pregnant patient [^113zrEya]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Critical care of the pregnant patient requires a multidisciplinary approach. These patients can present a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome should be readily recognized and treated on obstetric units. In cases of cardiopulmonary arrest, advanced life support care remains largely unchanged with only a few pregnancy-specific modifications. The maternal status should be prioritized as maternal well-being is a pre-requisite to ensure optimal neonatal outcomes. Stabilizing the mother will improve the fetal status in many cases. Critical, life-saving interventions should not be withheld from patients solely because of their pregnant status.

Data Sources and Searches

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of NIV in patients with AHRF were independently searched for in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science using the following key word terms ("acute respiratory failure" or "acute hypoxemic respiratory failure" or "acute hypoxemic respiratory distress" or "ARF" or "AHRF") and ("nippv" or "bipap" or "cpap" or "niv" or "nipsv" or "noninvasive positive pressure ventilation" or "non invasive positive pressure ventilation" or "noninvasive ventilation" or "non invasive ventilation" or "bilevel positive airway pressure" or "continuous positive airway pressure" or "noninvasive pressure support ventilation" or "non invasive pressure support ventilation" or "mask ventilation" or "nasal ventilation"). Our research was limited to studies using adult participants.

Study Selection

Figure 1 summarizes the study selection process. Two investigators (X-P.X. X-C.Z.) assessed the retrieved studies independently, including titles, abstracts, and citations. Any differences were resolved by consensus. In the absence of sufficient detail to inform decision making, full texts were sourced and the process repeated. The investigators selected the retrieved studies that fulfilled the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.

### Management of pregnancy and obstetric complications in prehospital trauma care: faculty of prehospital care consensus guidelines [^112fHKMU]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

This consensus statement seeks to provide clear guidance for the management of pregnant trauma patients in the prehospital setting. Pregnant patients sustaining trauma injuries have certain clinical management priorities beyond that of the non-pregnant trauma patients and that if overlooked may be detrimental to maternal and fetal outcomes.

### Management of acutely decompensated chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in late pregnancy: a case report [^1173PpVV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension diagnosed during pregnancy carries considerable risk and requires adequate peripartum planning. Most common symptoms include dyspnea, hemoptysis, exercise intolerance and careful workup can identify hypoxia and hypotension. If suspected early, BNP levels higher than 300 pg/mL can identify patients at risk for heart failure, while echocardiography can verify the existence of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular involvement.

In some rare cases though, the condition remains unnoticed until sudden and progressive worsening of cardiorespiratory parameters. Understandably, the diagnosis and treatment of previously unknown pulmonary hypertension presenting as acute right heart failure and respiratory failure in the late stage of pregnancy poses a difficult multidisciplinary management problem. Increased maternal mortality, risk of fetal growth and developmental delay, high-risk delivery and potential worsening of circulatory parameters in the postpartum period, all need to be considered when treating the patient. Several issues need to be addressed when establishing a peripartum management plan for a patient newly diagnosed with acute decompensation of previously undiagnosed pulmonary hypertension (Table 1).

Table 1
Bullet points for peripartum management of acute decompensation of previously undiagnosed pulmonary hypertension

As there are no current clear recommendations regarding these issues, the ideal management needs to be established on a case by case basis, which is highlighted by our experience. Perioperative invasive cardiovascular monitoring is critical, but pulmonary arterial catheter use is discouraged in acute right heart failure due to high complication rates. Because of this, we opted to use PiCCO monitoring and regular echocardiography assessments. We hypothesized that regular measurement of cardiac index would be informative during the postpartum period when we expected hemodynamic instability. There are several factors that aid cardiovascular stability, crucial for both maternal and fetal outcome in the peripartum period. Improving oxygenation is important in reversing hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and normal oxygen saturation can ideally be achieved with high flow oxygen or low-pressure noninvasive ventilation. In our case we used BIPAP noninvasive ventilation with high FiO 2: careful titration of pressures resulted in improved oxygenation while not compromising cardiovascular parameters.

### Respiratory devices… [^116jVaRW]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Respiratory devices are used to help breathing. Patients may use respiratory devices at home or in a clinical setting, such as a hospital. Examples of Respiratory Devices Continuous Ventilators Mechanically controls or helps patients' breathing while delivering a set amount of oxygen. Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure Machines Pumps air under varying pressure into the airway of the lungs. BiPAP machines use a higher pressure when you breathe in and lower pressure when you breathe out. These devices are also prescribed to people with obstructive sleep apnea to keep their airways open during sleep. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Machines Keeps your airway open by providing a stream of air at a continuous pressure through a mask. CPAP machines are often prescribed to people with obstructive sleep apnea to keep their airways open during sleep.

### Case report: perioperative management of caesarean section for a parturient with mitochondrial myopathy [^116X8tj2]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

In the afternoon of the first postoperative day, the parturient suddenly developed dyspnoea and cyanosis of the lips because of the low temperature in the ward. After being warmed and receiving oxygen supply via face mask, the patient was gradually relieved from respiratory distress. However, in the evening of postoperative day 4, the patient had difficulty breathing once again and was not alleviated by inhaling oxygen via face mask. Her ECG confirmed supraventicular tachycardia with frequent ventricular premature contractions, complete right bundle branch block and left anterior branch block. Arterial blood gas analysis showed the artery oxygen pressure (PaO 2) was 56 mmHg and carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO 2) was 87 mmHg. The brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was 1234 pg/ml. Echocardiography revealed a LVEF of 43%, dilatation of the right heart (mild), and decreasing systolic function of the left ventricle. According to the patient's clinical symptoms and examinations, we diagnosed her with IIrespiratory failure and cardiac insufficiency. Endotracheal intubation was immediately performed for mechanical ventilation, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further treatment. Biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation was used for respiratory support to maintain arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) more than 95% and the fraction of inspiration O 2 (FiO 2) was 40–60%. The positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set to 4–8 cm H 2 O to improve oxygenation and mitigate the harmful effects of mechanical ventilation. She also received intravenous phosphocreatine, potassium chloride, albumin and diuretics for improving nutrition and the internal environment. After a series of therapy in the ICU, the patient was extubated 5 days later and was transferred to the neurology department for subsequent treatment. The patient was safely discharged home on the 22nd postoperative day.

Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine GRADE recommendations — classification and implications used in this Obstetric Care Consensus are summarized as follows: Recommendations are classified as either strong (Grade 1) or weak (Grade 2), and quality of evidence is classified as high (Grade A), moderate (Grade B), and low (Grade C), yielding six possibilities (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C). For strong recommendations, strong recommendations can apply to most patients in most circumstances without reservation, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. For weak recommendations, best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients or societal values; alternative approaches likely to be better for some patients under some circumstances; and very weak recommendation indicates other alternatives may be equally reasonable.

### CPAP treatment and hypertensive adverse outcomes in pregnancy… [^113mtBjX]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that implementing CPAP treatment in pregnant women with OSA may reduce the risk of adverse gestational hypertensive outcomes. Importance Pregnancy may contribute to the development or exacerbation of obstructive sleep apnea and increase the risk of gestational complications. Continuous positive airway pressure is the first-line and criterion standard treatment for OSA and is regarded as the most feasible choice during pregnancy. However, the association between CPAP therapy in pregnant women with OSA and reduced gestational complications remains inconclusive. Meta-regression revealed that patients' age and BMI were not correlated with reduction of risk of hypertension and preeclampsia. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that implementing CPAP treatment in pregnant women with OSA may reduce the risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

However, health care professionals may prioritize CPAP treatment for pregnant women with moderate to severe OSA with desaturation or with OSA comorbid with high-risk pregnancy, such as chronic hypertension, obesity, history of preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy, because they are associated with greater risk of complications for both the mother and fetus during pregnancy. The timing of CPAP treatment for pregnant women with OSA may vary based on individual circumstances, which are influenced by the severity of OSA and the presence of gestational complications. It is generally recommended that patients with a preexisting OSA diagnosis and established CPAP treatment should continue using CPAP during their pregnancies. 33 Patients with newly diagnosed OSA should promptly initiate CPAP treatment, typically starting with autotitrating CPAP in most cases.

33 The application of a CPAP intervention varies widely, ranging from nightly CPAP in early pregnancy to a 4-week block of CPAP between 24 and 28 weeks or CPAP initiation from the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in the third trimester.
32. Pregnant women may develop or experience an exacerbation of OSA, which may increase the risk of gestational complications. This meta-analysis found that CPAP treatment for pregnant women with OSA was significantly associated with a reduction in the risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Future research should prioritize assessing treatment adherence and exploring the optimal timing and duration of CPAP use.

### Inpatient obstetric management of COVID-19 [^114pBmfh]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe inpatient management strategies and considerations for pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

Findings

The novel coronavirus has posed challenges to both obstetric patients and the staff caring for them, due to its variable presentation and current limited knowledge about the disease. Inpatient antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum management can be informed by risk stratification, severity of disease, and gestational age. Careful planning and anticipation of emergent situations can prevent unnecessary exposures to patients and clinical staff.

Conclusion

As new data arises, management recommendations will evolve, thus practitioners must maintain a low threshold for adaptation of their clinical practice during obstetric care for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

### Critical COVID-19 in a 24-week pregnant woman with 32 days of invasive mechanical ventilation before delivery of fetus: a case of successful collaborative multidisciplinary care [^113jMy9V]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We describe the successful treatment of a 24-week pregnant, 44-year-old woman with COVID-19. Management of this complex case required multidisciplinary collaboration and included prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Caesarean section delivery was delayed for 32 days, with no monitored fetal compromise, while stabilising the mother. To our knowledge, this is the longest reported duration of invasive ventilation while pregnant in a patient with COVID-19. COVID-19 has been shown to cause increased disease severity in pregnant women, and certain pregnancy-related physiological adaptations that occur could help explain this association. While COVID-19 has been shown to cause no increased adverse neonatal outcomes, clinicians should be aware that data show increased preterm birth in symptomatic pregnant women, thereby increasing the chance of prematurity-related complications. Further research on COVID-19 in pregnancy is crucial to facilitate better management, and full inclusion of pregnant women in therapeutic clinical trials will help achieve this.

Anticoagulation (enoxaparin 60 mg SC used prophylactically during pregnancy) was discontinued for 12 h and after thromboelastography (TEG) evaluation of coagulation parameters to rule out prostacyclin-associated platelet dysfunction, an epidural catheter was placed. After improving lactate, BE and urine output, a Cesarean was performed under epidural anesthesia (300 mg lidocaine and 15mcg sufentanil) and continued noninvasive ventilation. Operating time was 35 min with a blood loss of 500 ml, levosimendan and epoprostenol was continued during the operation and cardiac output was monitored via PiCCO. Additional low dose norepinephrine (0.06mcg/kg/min) therapy was started to counteract anesthesia-induced decrease in systemic vascular resistance, maintaining stable blood pressure parameters in the perioperative period (preoperative BP: 124/62 mmHg, lowest intraoperative BP: 75/42 mmHg, postoperative BP: 118/62 mmHg). A 1490 g baby girl was delivered with an Apgar of 8/9. The baby required CPAP therapy and PICU treatment, but adapted as expected in subsequent days.

The patient continued to be monitored during the postoperative period. Low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation was re-established 12 h after the operation and was regularly monitored with anti-Factor Xa activity. No bleeding complications were observed. Repeat echocardiogram showed improving right ventricle diameter (28 mm) but increased systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (72 + 10 = 82 mmHg). Epoprostenol dose was titrated up to 10 ng/kg/min, 24-h levosimendan treatment was followed with dobutamine treatment (4mcg/kg/min) and noninvasive ventilation was continued. During the next 48 h, we observed ongoing improvement in cardiac index (3.4 and subsequently 3.8 L/min/m 2 by PiCCO), and in pulmonary pressure (sPAP 60 + 10 = 75 and subsequently 48 + 10 = 58 mmHg by echocardiogram). Urine output was maintained despite tapered diuretic therapy. Despite improving cardiovascular parameters, persistent BIPAP NIV and FiO 2 dependence was observed, so chest CT was repeated with right lower lobe bronchi obstruction apparent (see Fig. 2). A bronchoscopy was performed in dexmedetomidine anesthesia and ongoing BIPAP noninvasive ventilation and several blood clots were extracted. After the procedure, oxygenation improved markedly and the patient was successfully weaned from BIPAP NIV to nasal O 2 therapy.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pregnancy — GRADE-based recommendation development states that the overall quality of the body of evidence for each outcome is assessed using the GRADE approach, which considers overall study quality (risk of bias or study limitations), consistency, directness, and precision, and rates the body of evidence as High, Moderate, Low, and Very Low. The strength and direction of each recommendation were determined by assessing the quality of the overall evidence base, the associated benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and other implications, and, per GRADE, each recommendation's strength and direction is determined by the following four domains. For the domain "Confidence in the Quality of the Evidence", options include High, Moderate, Low, or Very Low, and per GRADE if quality differs across relevant critical outcomes, the lowest quality for any critical outcome determines the overall quality for the recommendation. Recommendation strength generally aligns with the confidence in the quality of evidence, with Strong recommendations typically supported by High or Moderate quality evidence, although GRADE permits Low or Very Low quality evidence to support a Strong recommendation in certain instances (e.g., life-threatening situation).

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2022). High credibility.

Maternal cardiac arrest — pregnant patients with symptomatic COVID-19 are at increased risk of more severe illness, including increased risk of ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation and ventilatory support, and death. If return of spontaneous circulation is not achieved, complete perimortem cesarean delivery ideally within 5 minutes after time of arrest. We recommend calling multidisciplinary team members early in the resuscitation process for maternal cardiac arrest to allow time for PPE donning before they enter the resuscitation area. Oxygenation with intubation should be prioritized earlier in pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 who suffer cardiac arrest, and providers should give chest compressions with concurrent left lateral uterine displacement when the uterine fundus is at the level of the umbilicus or greater.

While the benefits of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for patients with obstructive sleep apnea are well described, reports in the literature of complications from its use are rare. A patient who received postoperative BiPAP after undergoing transsphenoidal craniopharyngioma resection developed severe pneumocephalus and unplanned intensive care unit admission. Although the pneumocephalus resolved with conservative management over two weeks, we propose caution in the use of CPAP postoperatively in patients undergoing procedures of the head and neck.

### Setting and techniques for monitoring blood pressure during pregnancy [^114YxEsc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Regular blood pressure (BP) measurement is crucial for the diagnosis and management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia. BP can be measured in various settings, such as conventional clinics or self-measurement at home, and with different techniques, such as using auscultatory or automated BP devices. It is important to understand the impact of different settings and techniques of BP measurement on important outcomes for pregnant women.

Objectives

To assess the effects of setting and technique of BP measurement for diagnosing hypertensive disorders in pregnancy on subsequent maternal and perinatal outcomes, women's quality of life, or use of health service resources.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 22 April 2020, and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving pregnant women, using validated BP devices in different settings or using different techniques.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Of the 21 identified studies, we included three, and excluded 11; seven were ongoing. Of the three included RCTs (536,607 women), one was a cluster-RCT, with a substantially higher number of participants (536,233 deliveries) than the other two trials, but did not provide data for most of our outcomes. We generally judged the included studies at low risk of bias, however, the certainty of the evidence was low, due to indirectness and imprecision. Meta-analysis was not possible because each study investigated a different comparison. None of the included studies reported our primary outcome of systolic BP greater than or equal to 150 mmHg. None of the studies reported any of these important secondary outcomes: antenatal hospital admissions, neonatal unit length of stay, or neonatal endotracheal intubation and use of mechanical ventilation. Setting of BP measurement: self-measurement versus conventional clinic measurement (one study, 154 women) There were no maternal deaths in either the self-monitoring group or the usual care group. The study did not report perinatal mortality. Self-monitoring may lead to slightly more diagnoses of pre-eclampsia compared with usual care (risk ratio (RR) 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 2.54; 154 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) but the wide 95% CI is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm. Self-monitoring may have little to no effect on the likelihood of induction of labour compared with usual care (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.45; 154 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if self-monitoring BP has any effect on maternal admission to intensive care (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 37.25; 154 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), stillbirth (RR 2.57, 95% CI 0.13 to 52.63; 154 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), neonatal death (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 37.25; 154 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) or preterm birth (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.55; 154 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), compared with usual care because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CI is consistent with appreciable harms and appreciable benefits. Self-monitoring may lead to slightly more neonatal unit admissions compared with usual care (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.62; 154 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence) but the wide 95% CI includes the possibility of slightly fewer admissions with self-monitoring. Technique of BP measurement: Korotkoff phase IV (K4, muffling sound) versus Korotkoff phase V (K5, disappearance of sound) to represent diastolic BP (one study, 220 women) There were no maternal deaths in either the K4 or K5 group. There may be little to no difference in the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia between using K4 or K5 for diastolic BP (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.49; 1 study; 220 women; low-certainty evidence), since the wide 95% CI includes the possibility of more diagnoses with K4. We are uncertain if there is a difference in perinatal mortality between the groups because the quality of evidence is low and the 95% CI is consistent with appreciable harm and appreciable benefit (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.92; 1 study, 220 women; low-certainty evidence). The trial did not report data on maternal admission to intensive care, induction of labour, stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, or neonatal unit admissions. Technique of BP measurement: CRADLE intervention (CRADLE device, a semi-automated BP monitor with additional features, and an education package) versus usual care (one study, 536,233 deliveries) There may be little to no difference between the use of the CRADLE device and usual care in the number of maternal deaths (adjusted RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11; 536,233 women; 1 study; low-certainty evidence), but the 95% CI is consistent with appreciable harm and appreciable benefit. The trial did not report pre-eclampsia, induction of labour, perinatal mortality, preterm birth, or neonatal unit admissions. Maternal admission to intensive care and perinatal outcomes (stillbirths and neonatal deaths) were only collected for a small proportion of the women, identified by an outcome not by baseline characteristics, thereby breaking the random allocation. Therefore, any differences between the groups could not be attributed to the intervention, and we did not extract data for these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The benefit, if any, of self-monitoring BP in hypertensive pregnancies remains uncertain, as the evidence is limited to one feasibility study. Current practice of using K5 to measure diastolic BP is supported for women with pregnancy hypertension. The benefit, if any, of using the CRADLE device to measure BP in pregnancy remains uncertain, due to the limitations and instability of the trial study design.

### Caring for two: management of the critically ill cardiac patient during pregnancy [^111PGyWG]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Strategies for intubation, noninvasive/invasive mechanical ventilation

Physiological changes during pregnancy, such as increased oxygen consumption, decreased functional residual capacity, and airway edema complicate airway management and ventilation strategies. Multidisciplinary collaboration among critical care, obstetrics, anesthesia, and cardiology teams enhances outcomes, and management should be dependent on the physiology of each cardiac lesion with its respective hemodynamic sequelae.

Meticulous preoxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen is essential, as delivery of heated, humidified oxygen (flow rates < 60 L/min), generates mild positive pressure and aids in maintaining alveolar recruitment, extending safe apnea time. Additionally, high-flow nasal oxygen may be advantageous postextubation in preventing respiratory decompensation in high-risk patients.

Rapid sequence induction is recommended because delayed gastric emptying and elevated intra-abdominal pressure increase the risk of aspiration. Short-acting medications such as propofol and succinylcholine are frequently used. However, certain medications should either be avoided or used with caution in patients with cardiac disease due to hemodynamic changes. Most drugs cross the placenta through passive or active diffusion across the membrane, a process determined by either the properties of the placenta or the properties of the drug. Historically, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration classified benzodiazepines as drugs to avoid during the first trimester due to teratogenic effects. Skilled personnel and advanced airway equipment (video laryngoscopy) should be available to address intubation challenges. Once intubated, parameters must accommodate pregnancy-related respiratory mechanics. To prevent volutrauma, tidal volumes of 6 to 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight should be used, aligning with lung-protective ventilation strategies.

Other high-risk scenarios and when to hold VTE prophylaxis

How should VTE prophylaxis be managed with active bleeding or coagulopathy?

Recommendation

Pharmacological prophylaxis should be delayed in patients with active bleeding or coagulopathy, until these conditions have been controlled or reversed. Mechanical prophylaxis should be employed in these patients.

Discussion

It is appropriate to withhold chemical prophylaxis in patients with active bleeding or coagulopathy, or hemodynamic instability resulting from those conditions. Delaying initiation of enoxaparin should be minimized to the shortest acceptable time period, since the early trauma-induced coagulopathy soon gives way to a hypercoagulable state. In the setting of trauma coagulopathy, enoxaparin may be considered after completing the initial resuscitation, even though laboratory parameters of coagulation have not yet normalized. As holding pharmacological prophylaxis is associated with an increased VTE rate, enoxaparin initiation is encouraged if there are no signs of bleeding and the hypocoagulable state is expected to resolve. Intermittent pneumatic compression as a means of mechanical prophylaxis is an important adjunct in conditions that prohibit chemical prophylaxis, especially in patients with moderate-to-high VTE risk.

Should pharmacological VTE prophylaxis dosing be adjusted during pregnancy?

Recommendation

Dosing of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis should be adjusted in pregnant trauma patients.

Discussion

Pregnant trauma patients are at increased risk of VTE. Increases in weight and creatinine clearance make dosing adjustments for enoxaparin necessary, namely higher and more frequent dosing regimens. At admission, a pregnant trauma patient should receive enoxaparin 30 mg two times per day, and if the patient weighs > 90 kg then 40 mg two times per day should be initiated. The dosing should then be titrated by antifactor Xa levels to target a range of 0.2–0.4 IU/mL.

### Caring for two: management of the critically ill cardiac patient during pregnancy [^115Tw7vk]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Critical care monitoring and interventions in the cardiac intensive care unit

The normal pregnant patient presents an anatomic and physiological conundrum for the intensivist. This is further exaggerated when there is pre-existing cardiac disease (ie, Fontan circulation or mitral stenosis). The approach to resuscitation and steady-state management of the patient is of vital importance for fetal well-being and should be targeted to maintain hemodynamics and maintenance of uteroplacental blood flow to reverse hypoxia and acidosis. Fetal monitoring of the fetus during resuscitation of the pregnant individual is necessary.

As pregnancy advances, the enlarging uterus may compress the aorta and the inferior vena cava, which increases afterload and decreases preload. Left uterine displacement in the parturient at term can augment preload by more than 25%.

A higher partial pressure of oxygen is required to achieve oxygen saturation at term. This has implications for monitoring the spontaneously ventilating patient in respiratory distress. Pregnancy induces chronic respiratory alkalosis due to progesterone-driven hyperventilation, results in a lower PaCO 2 (28–32 mm Hg) compared to nonpregnant adults (35–45 mm Hg). Like an asthmatic patient in extremis, if the PaO 2 falls despite increased minute ventilation, while PCO 2 climbs, resulting in respiratory acidosis, respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation is likely imminent (Table 1).

Table 1
Normal Values for Arterial Blood Gas in the Nonpregnant and Pregnant Woman by Trimester (Derived From Deloya-Tomas et al)

Critically ill patients requiring organ support (ie, vasoactive medications or renal replacement therapy) merit invasive monitoring. Currently, there are no defined universal standards for monitoring. However, subdiaphragmatic placement of invasive monitors and vascular access are favored in the parturient. Monitoring central venous pressure and arterial pressure (radial or brachial preferred) is mandatory. The gravid uterus impedes inferior vena cava ultrasound assessment. Transthoracic echocardiography can assist with volume assessment.

Use of intrapartum hemodynamic monitoring

Hemodynamic monitoring is an important adjunct for the management of high-risk cardiac deliveries. Noninvasive monitoring with continuous electrocardiogram monitoring with intrapartum telemetry is useful for patients with a history of arrhythmia. However, patient discomfort from additional monitoring devices during active labor should be weighed against potential benefit of monitoring for women with known risk of malignant arrhythmia. Data for use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring (including intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring, central venous catheter [CVC], and pulmonary artery catheters [PACs]) are limited and poorly validated in pregnant patients. We agree with expert opinion that CVC and PAC monitoring in pregnancy should be reserved for patients with: 1) cardiopulmonary decompensation; 2) right ventricular failure requiring titration of vasopressors and/or pulmonary vasodilators; or 3) high risk of decompensation in setting of large volume shifts.CVCs may also be used as a conduit for intravenous access particularly for patients for whom prolonged access is required or with challenging access. PAC may be helpful to accurately assess hemodynamic status in patients failing to respond to standard therapies. The routine use of PAC is not recommended in pregnant patients and should be individualized. The estimated risks of complications are low and on par with the general nonpregnant population (0.3%-3.8%). Invasive arterial line blood pressure monitoring is recommended for pregnant patients when: 1) immediate beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring would guide vasopressor and inotrope management; 2) changes in SVR could lead to rapid decompensation (eg, severe cardiomyopathy, dynamic outflow tract obstruction, high-risk aortopathy, and hypertensive emergencies); and 3) rapid and frequent arterial blood gases are needed. Whenever CVC and/or PAC are being utilized, concomitant arterial line use is generally recommended. Finally, some have advocated for the use of peripherally inserted central catheters or midline catheters for central venous pressure monitoring, but data are limited. Peripherally inserted central catheters and midlines are associated with low insertion risk and catheter-based blood stream infections, and may offer a less invasive alternative to CVC for central venous pressure monitoring, but the theoretical risk of upper extremity thrombosis has limited their widespread use in pregnant women.

### Management of acutely decompensated chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension in late pregnancy: a case report [^112w7hhb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Severe decompensation of pulmonary hypertension also warrants vasodilator treatment, which in this situation is ideally achieved by rapidly titrated intravenous prostacyclin treatment. Additional vasodilator pharmacological options (endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, guanylate cyclase stimulators) are generally limited because of possible fetal toxicity. Use of mechanical cardiovascular support has been described in the peripartum period and despite increased bleeding risks and questionable long-term outcomes, it can be lifesaving during sudden cardiovascular collapse and therefore should be considered as an emergency intervention during delivery.

Although natural delivery has been described in well-managed cases with moderate pulmonary hypertension, delivery should be performed surgically in cases where cardiovascular stability is frail and exclusively in cases where right heart failure is established. Optimal timing for the surgery should be based on maternal and fetal evaluation. In our case, a Cesarean was warranted because of recurrent transient hypoxia, dyspnea and drops in maternal blood pressure. Ideally, optimizing cardiac output, oxygenation, acid-base parameters and urine output, as well as optimal anticoagulation timing, are crucial in order to minimize surgical risk. In our case, we scheduled the operation after a successful 24-h stabilization period, during which fetal lung maturation could also be initiated. Delivery should be performed with an aim of limited blood loss and short operation time (with gynecological and neonatal intensive care support). Choice of anesthesia for delivery is controversial. Use of general anesthesia has been described more frequently in literature although epidural anesthesia has the theoretical advantage of a slow build up and avoidance of positive pressure ventilation. As positive pressure ventilation is often associated with further sudden increase in pulmonary arterial pressure, we opted for slow buildup of epidural anesthesia, ongoing BIPAP noninvasive ventilation with high FiO 2 and norepinephrine to counteract decrease of systemic vascular resistance.

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^111HSXqf]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Using a flow driver to generate CPAP has the theoretical advantage of offloading expiratory work of breathing, although no important clinical differences have been shown in clinical trials among various CPAP devices. The simplicity of bubble CPAP systems allows their use in low-income settings with some evidence of benefit over free-flowing oxygen. Leaks between the interface and nose are common with both nasal prongs and masks but somewhat less with prongs. All CPAP interfaces carry risk of facial distortion and nasal trauma.

Bi-level CPAP, Duo-PAP, or BIPAP are variants between CPAP and IPPV that use low pressure differences between inspiratory and expiratory phases at PIPs of 9–11 cm H 2 O at rates of around 20–40 per minute with long inspiratory times of up to 1.0 s. There is no evidence that BIPAP confers any advantage over CPAP, and any clinical differences may simply reflect a higher overall mean airway pressure. Modern ventilators provide NIPPV using pressures similar to those used for invasive MV. Challenges of NIPPV relate to pressure delivery through a non-sealed system, which is limited by leak at the nasal interface and the infant's tolerance to gas inflation of the stomach. Ventilator inflations can be synchronised with the infant's breathing by using either an abdominal capsule or in-line sensors. Synchronisation of nasal ventilation further improves respiratory stability. Recent systematic reviews comparing different modes of NIV for primary respiratory support or post-extubation concluded that synchronised NIPPV was the most effective, decreasing the need for MV, or re-ventilation, in preterm infants.

### Factors affecting oxygen delivery with bi-level positive airway pressure [^112DbHZi]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

Portable pressure ventilators, or bi-level ventilators, do not typically have an oxygen control, and thus supplemental oxygen is usually administered by adding it into the mask or the circuit. We conducted this study to test the hypothesis that delivered oxygen concentration using this configuration is affected by the choice of leak port, oxygen injection site, and ventilator settings.

Methods

A lung model simulating spontaneous breathing was connected to the head of a manikin. An oronasal mask was attached to the manikin. A single-limb circuit was attached to the mask and a bi-level ventilator. Three leak ports were compared: leak in the mask, plateau exhalation valve with mask leak port occluded, and leak port in the circuit with mask leak port occluded. Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) settings of 10/5, 15/5, 20/5, 15/10, 20/10, and 25/10 cm H(2)O were used at respiratory rates of 15 and 25 breaths/min. Oxygen was added into the mask or into the circuit at the ventilator outlet, using flows of 5 and 10 L/min. Carbon dioxide was added into the lung model to produce an end-tidal P(CO(2)) of either 40 or 75 mm Hg.

Results

Delivered oxygen concentration was not affected by respiratory rate (p = 0.22) or end-tidal P(CO(2)) (p = 0.74). The oxygen concentration was greater when oxygen was added into the circuit with the leak port in the mask (p < 0.001), whereas oxygen concentration was greater when oxygen was added into the mask with the leak port in circuit (p = 0.005). Oxygen concentration was significantly lower with the leak port in the mask (p < 0.001), with a higher inspiratory positive airway pressure (p < 0.001), and with a higher expiratory positive airway pressure (p < 0.001). The highest oxygen concentration was achieved with oxygen added to the mask, with the leak port in the circuit, and with the lowest settings of inspiratory (10 cm H(2)O) and expiratory (5 cm H(2)O) positive airway pressure.

Conclusions

Delivered oxygen concentration during BiPAP is a complex interaction between the leak port type, the site of oxygen injection, the ventilator settings, and the oxygen flow. Because of this, it is important to continuously measure arterial oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry with patients in acute respiratory failure who are receiving noninvasive ventilation from a bi-level ventilator.

### Respiratory considerations including airway and ventilation issues in critical care obstetric patients [^113eMMZU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Critical care management of the obstetric patient can present unique challenges. Parturients who present with respiratory distress can suffer from a multitude of etiologies, and each diagnosis must be pursued as appropriate to the clinical picture. Normal physiologic changes of pregnancy may obscure the presentation and diagnosis, and irrelevant of the cause, pregnancy may complicate the management of hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure in this patient population. In addition to these concerns, both anticipated and unanticipated difficult airway management, including difficulty ventilating and intubating, are more common during pregnancy and may be encountered during endotracheal tube placement.

Adjuvant interventions for persistent hypoxemia

In cases of persistent severe hypoxemia (with no response to the assigned protocol and a PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio of < 150 mmHg during invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 12h), clinicians may consider implementing adjuvant interventions for hypoxemia at their discretion, such as prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, or inhalation of nitric oxide, in both groups.

1) Prone positioning: If there are no contraindications, prone positioning can be performed for more than 12 h per day after careful preparation, following the criteria outlined by Guerin C, et al. Exclusion criteria for prone positioning include unstable spine, uncontrolled intracranial pressure, open abdominal injury, multiple trauma with skeletal/cervical traction, pregnancy, intra-abdominal pressure ≥ 20 mmHg, and severe hemodynamic instability.
2) Neuromuscular blockade: a If Pplat exceeds 30 cmH 2 O, and spontaneous inspiratory efforts are clinically detected, neuromuscular blockade is indicated. b Despite prioritizing optimization of ventilator settings, if patients exhibit rigorous respiratory effort, dyspnea, or breath stacking, neuromuscular blockade may be employed to prevent lung injury and facilitate smooth adaptation between the patient and the ventilator.
3) Inhalation of nitric oxide: If patients do not respond to the above therapies and continue to experience severe hypoxemia with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 150 and an increase in pulmonary artery pressure, administration of 5–20 ppm iNO with concentration may be considered, with reassessment 48h later.

All adjuvant interventions are utilized at the discretion of the clinician. Once the treatment goal of PaO 2 /FiO 2 > 150 mmHg with FiO 2 < 0.6 is achieved, clinicians may discontinue these interventions. If patients do not respond to the adjuvant interventions, the clinician may consider initiating ECMO.

Other treatments

During the treatment of ARDS, clinical doctors should manage patients according to best clinical practice evidence, closely and dynamically evaluate and solve pulmonary and extrapulmonary factors that cause or exacerbate hypoxia, such as anti-infection, optimized fluid therapy, maintaining appropriate hemoglobin levels, and optimize balance of oxygen supply and demand, actively prevent and treat complications.

### Airway pressure-release ventilation in pregnant patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a novel strategy [^117X4mLV]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Airway pressure-release ventilation (APRV) is a novel mode of positive-pressure ventilation that has several advantages over low-tidal-volume, assist-control ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, specifically, lower airway pressures, lower minute ventilation, minimal effects on cardio-circulatory function, ability to spontaneously breathe throughout the entire ventilatory cycle, and decreased sedation requirements. APRV is consistent with lung-protective strategies that aim to limit lung injury associated with mechanical ventilation. APRV utilization in obstetrical patients has not previously been reported.

Cases

We present 2 cases of pregnant women with severe life-threatening ARDS who were successfully managed with APRV.

Conclusions

APRV may have particular utility in pregnant patients with ARDS. We believe APRV was life-saving in our cases. APRV ventilation should be considered in pregnant patients with ARDS.

### Buprenorphine-naloxone for pregnant patients with opioid use… [^112EUsqo]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION In pregnant patients with opioid use disorder, is buprenorphinenaloxone as safe and effective as buprenorphine. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER Buprenorphine-naloxone can be used to treat opioid use disorder in pregnant patients. It has an obstetric safety profile similar to those of alternative treatments for this disorder and is associated with a lower rate of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. EVIDENCE SUMMARY A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis identified five retrospective cohort trials with 1, 875 pregnant patients receiving various therapies, including buprenorphine-naloxone, for opioid use disorder in pregnancy. 1 Alternative treatments included buprenorphine, methadone, and long-acting opioids.

Compared with other treatment groups, the buprenorphinenaloxone groups had similar rates of full-term delivery, vaginal delivery, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Newborns of patients in the buprenorphine-naloxone groups had lower rates of NOWS compared with newborns of patients prescribed other opioid agonist medications. Researchers noted that three of the studies had a high risk of bias. This review did not directly compare buprenorphine-naloxone with buprenorphine. SubscribeFrom $180

Maternal sepsis is a signiﬁcant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, and is a potentially preventable cause of maternal death. This Consult aims to summarize what is known about sepsis and provide guidance for the management of sepsis during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Most studies cited are from the nonpregnant population, but where available, pregnancy data are included. The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend that clinicians consider the diagnosis of sepsis in pregnant or postpartum patients with otherwise unexplained end-organ damage in the presence of a suspected or confirmed infectious process, regardless of the presence of fever (GRADE 1C); (2) we recommend that sepsis and septic shock in pregnancy be considered medical emergencies and that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately (Best Practice); (3) we recommend that hospitals and health systems use a performance improvement program for sepsis in pregnancy with sepsis screening tools and metrics (GRADE 1B); (4) we recommend that institutions develop their own procedures and protocols for the detection of maternal sepsis, avoiding the use of a single screening tool alone (GRADE 1B); (5) we recommend obtaining tests to evaluate for infectious and noninfectious causes of life-threatening organ dysfunction in pregnant and postpartum patients with possible sepsis (Best Practice); (6) we recommend that an evaluation for infectious causes in pregnant or postpartum patients in whom sepsis is suspected or identified includes appropriate microbiologic cultures, including blood, before starting antimicrobial therapy, as long as there are no substantial delays in timely administration of antibiotics (Best Practice); (7) we recommend obtaining a serum lactate level in pregnant or postpartum patients in whom sepsis is suspected or identified (GRADE 1B); (8) in pregnant or postpartum patients with septic shock or a high likelihood of sepsis, we recommend administration of empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, ideally within 1 hour of recognition (GRADE 1C); (9) after a diagnosis of sepsis in pregnancy is made, we recommend rapid identification or exclusion of an anatomic source of infection and emergency source control when indicated (Best Practice); (10) we recommend early intravenous administration (within the first 3 hours) of 1 to 2 L of balanced crystalloid solutions in sepsis complicated by hypotension or suspected organ hypoperfusion (GRADE 1C); (11) we recommend the use of a balanced crystalloid solution as a first-line fluid for resuscitation in pregnant and postpartum patients with sepsis or septic shock (GRADE 1B); (12) we recommend against the use of starches or gelatin for resuscitation in pregnant and postpartum patients with sepsis or septic shock (GRADE 1A); (13) we recommend ongoing, detailed evaluation of the patient's response to fluid resuscitation guided by dynamic measures of preload (GRADE 1B); (14) we recommend the use of norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor during pregnancy and the postpartum period with septic shock (GRADE 1C); (15) we suggest using intravenous corticosteroids in pregnant or postpartum patients with septic shock who continue to require vasopressor therapy (GRADE 2B); (16) because of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism in sepsis and septic shock, we recommend the use of pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in pregnant and postpartum patients in septic shock (GRADE 1B); (17) we suggest initiating insulin therapy at a glucose level > 180 mg/dL in critically ill pregnant patients with sepsis (GRADE 2C); (18) if a uterine source for sepsis is suspected or confirmed, we recommend prompt delivery or evacuation of uterine contents to achieve source control, regardless of gestational age (GRADE 1C); and (19) because of an increased risk of physical, cognitive, and emotional problems in survivors of sepsis and septic shock, we recommend ongoing comprehensive support for pregnant and postpartum sepsis survivors and their families (Best Practice).
