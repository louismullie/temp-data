## Question

What are the most common sites affected by osteonecrosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which anatomic sites are most commonly affected by osteonecrosis and how confident we can be about that ranking. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality sources that explicitly enumerate common sites. Then, I should verify whether any of these sources provide quantitative rankings or just qualitative lists. Next, I will cross-check across multiple references to see which sites consistently appear and in what order. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, reference-backed hierarchy and note any exceptions or special contexts like multifocal disease or medication-related jaw osteonecrosis.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative statements. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria explicitly list common sites as femoral head, humeral head, knee, femoral/tibial metadiaphysis, scaphoid, lunate, and talus, which gives me a solid foundation to build on [^5f845074]. Wait, let me verify whether any of these sources rank them by frequency; on first read, I thought the ACR might have ranked them, but I should double-check — no, it provides a list without ordinal frequency, so I need to be careful not to over-interpret order as prevalence [^5f845074].

> Next, I should review corroborating summaries. The Radiographics review similarly lists femoral head, humeral head, knee, femoral/tibial metadiaphysis, scaphoid, lunate, and talus as common sites, reinforcing the same anatomic distribution without asserting a strict ranking, which supports the consistency of the site list across sources [^71005b84]. Hold on, I should verify whether any of these texts quantify incidence by site; they generally do not, so I must avoid assigning numbers where none are provided [^71005b84].

> Now, I will examine disease-specific literature to infer relative frequency. Multiple high-quality sources consistently emphasize that the femoral head is the most common site of osteonecrosis, particularly in nontraumatic forms, which aligns with clinical experience and epidemiologic summaries [^c67fa878] [^73cb3daa] [^96a093f3]. Let me consider the shoulder next; nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the humeral head is repeatedly described as the second most common site after the femoral head, which supports placing the humeral head second in frequency [^675bca7b]. I should confirm the knee's position; osteonecrosis of the knee is a recognized entity with distinct subtypes, suggesting it is a frequent site, though exact comparative frequencies are not specified in these sources [^23f1a5bc].

> I need to check the remaining sites. The wrist (scaphoid and lunate) and ankle (talus) are repeatedly included among common sites in radiologic and clinical reviews, and metadiaphyseal long bone infarcts in the femur and tibia are described as common, though they are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, which may underrepresent their clinical prominence relative to articular sites [^71005b84] [^5f845074]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence of symptoms does not equal absence of occurrence, so I should keep metadiaphyseal infarcts on the list while acknowledging their different clinical impact [^71005b84].

> But wait, what if the clinical context changes the ranking? In multifocal osteonecrosis, the knee is frequently involved and may be the most common additional site beyond the hip, which can shift the observed distribution in steroid-associated or autoimmune cohorts, so I should qualify any ranking by etiology and population [^e4331f1e] [^ff5fe8f5]. I should also remember medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, which is a distinct entity confined to the mandible and maxilla and is not captured in general osteonecrosis site lists, so it should be considered separately when discussing "most common sites" by mechanism [^edc7d63f] [^a6b8a034].

> Let me synthesize a cautious hierarchy. Based on repeated emphasis across sources, the femoral head is clearly the most common site, followed by the humeral head as the second most common, with the knee, scaphoid, lunate, talus, and femoral/tibial metadiaphysis rounding out the commonly affected locations; however, I should emphasize that beyond the femoral and humeral heads, precise ordinal rankings are not quantified in the cited literature, so the order of the remaining sites is inferred from their repeated inclusion rather than incidence data [^5f845074] [^71005b84] [^c67fa878] [^675bca7b]. I should double-check that I am not overstating any numeric claims; indeed, I find no site-specific incidence percentages in these sources, so I will avoid assigning numbers where none are provided [^5f845074] [^71005b84].

> Final answer, keeping the caveats explicit: The most common sites of osteonecrosis are the femoral head, followed by the humeral head, with the knee, scaphoid, lunate, talus, and femoral/tibial metadiaphysis also commonly affected; exact relative frequencies beyond the femoral and humeral heads are not specified in the cited literature, and the distribution can vary in multifocal disease and medication-related jaw osteonecrosis, which involves the mandible and maxilla as a distinct pattern [^5f845074] [^71005b84] [^c67fa878] [^675bca7b] [^e4331f1e] [^edc7d63f].

Osteonecrosis most commonly affects the **femoral head** (hip) [^c67fa878], followed by the **humeral head** (shoulder) [^675bca7b], **knee** (femoral condyles and tibial plateau) [^23f1a5bc], and **wrist** (scaphoid and lunate) [^5f845074]. Other frequent sites include the **talus** (ankle) [^71005b84], **mandible/maxilla** (jaw) [^edc7d63f] (notably with bisphosphonates or radiation) [^748676f1], and **metadiaphyseal regions** of long bones (femur, tibia) [^71005b84]. The femoral head is the most common site due to its limited collateral circulation and high mechanical load, with an estimated 10,000–20,000 new cases annually in the US [^71005b84] [^c67fa878].

## Most common sites of osteonecrosis

| **Anatomic site** | **Clinical significance** | **Common etiologies** |
|-|-|-|
| Femoral head (hip) | Most common site; high risk of collapse and arthritis [^c67fa878] | - Trauma <br/> - Corticosteroids <br/> - Alcohol <br/> - Idiopathic [^c67fa878] [^73cb3daa] |
| Humeral head (shoulder) | Second most common; often bilateral [^675bca7b] | - Corticosteroids <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Systemic diseases [^675bca7b] |
| Knee (femoral condyles, tibial plateau) | Third most common; includes SPONK and secondary forms [^23f1a5bc] | - Trauma <br/> - Corticosteroids <br/> - Systemic diseases [^23f1a5bc] |
| Wrist (scaphoid, lunate) | Common in trauma and systemic disease [^5f845074] | - Trauma <br/> - Systemic diseases [^5f845074] |
| Talus (ankle) | Less common but significant [^71005b84] | - Trauma <br/> - Systemic diseases [^71005b84] |
| Mandible/maxilla (jaw) | Distinct entity; MRONJ and ORNJ [^edc7d63f] [^748676f1] | - Bisphosphonates <br/> - Denosumab <br/> - Radiation [^edc7d63f] [^748676f1] |
| Metadiaphyseal regions (femur, tibia) | Often asymptomatic; detected incidentally [^71005b84] | - Systemic diseases <br/> - Corticosteroids [^71005b84] |

## Factors influencing site predilection

Several factors influence **site predilection** in osteonecrosis:

- **Vascular anatomy**: Sites with limited collateral circulation (e.g. femoral head, humeral head) are more susceptible to ischemia and necrosis [^notfound].
- **Mechanical stress**: High-load joints (hip, knee, ankle) are more prone to osteonecrosis due to increased mechanical demand and susceptibility to microtrauma [^notfound].
- **Systemic risk factors**: Corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse, and systemic diseases (e.g. lupus, sickle cell disease) increase the risk of osteonecrosis, particularly in the femoral and humeral heads [^c67fa878] [^e4331f1e].
- **Medication-related osteonecrosis**: Bisphosphonates and denosumab specifically target the jawbones, leading to MRONJ [^edc7d63f] [^a6b8a034].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Osteonecrosis can cause significant morbidity, including pain, joint dysfunction, and collapse, often necessitating surgical intervention [^c67fa878]. Early diagnosis with **MRI** [^68faa5df] and appropriate management — such as core decompression, joint-preserving procedures, or arthroplasty — are essential to prevent progression and preserve joint function [^7dbf9e5f].

---

Osteonecrosis most commonly affects the **femoral head**, followed by the humeral head, knee, wrist, talus, jaw, and metadiaphyseal regions of long bones. The predilection for these sites is influenced by vascular anatomy, mechanical stress, and systemic risk factors.

### Classification systems for osteonecrosis: an overview [^514099f2]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Currently a number of classification systems for osteonecrosis are in use. The use of different systems often leads to confusion and makes it difficult to compare the results of different methods of treatment. Because the management of osteonecrosis is determined in large part by the stage of the disease, it is important to use an effective and reliable method of staging and classification. This article provides an overview of the systems most commonly used so the reader can better understand and compare the outcome of studies that report their results using different methods of classification. The essential features of the ideal system are outlined to enable the reader to decide which of the available classification systems best meets these goals.

### Epidemiology, management, and systematic review of surgical trends for patients who have osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^73cb3daa]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteonecrosis is a debilitating condition characterized by bone tissue death and disrupted vascular circulation, most commonly affecting the femoral head (ONFH). Reported estimates of the annual incidence in the United States (US) range from 10,000 to 30,000 cases. Despite known risk factors, there is no consensus on the optimal management of early hip osteonecrosis due to the multifactorial etiology. This study aimed to assess the epidemiology and surgical trends of hip osteonecrosis in the US using a comprehensive national database, as well as review the current literature on historical and contemporary surgical trends for patients who have ONFH.

Methods

Data from a research network (2015 to 2024) were used to identify patients diagnosed with ONFH using ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10 th revision, Clinical Modification)codes. Patients who had osteonecrosis at other sites were excluded. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, and geographic distribution were characterized. Treatment trends were evaluated within one and five years of diagnosis. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review across three databases, resulting in a total of five articles. Articles met the inclusion criteria if they provided data regarding surgical trends of patients who have ONFH over at least a ten-year period.

Results

From the recent database, of 61,903 patients who have hip osteonecrosis, the majority were of idiopathic etiology (78.1%, n = 48,365). Men comprised 52.1% (n = 25,197) of the idiopathic cases, and the age at diagnosis ranged between 40 and 72 years. The Southern US had the highest prevalence of hip osteonecrosis (42%), followed by the Northeast (30%). Corticosteroid use was the most common risk factor (75%, n = 36,274), followed by dyslipidemias (49%, n = 23,699) and nicotine use (27%, n = 13,058). Total hip arthroplasty was the predominant treatment modality within one year (22.6%, n = 10,931) and five years (25.2%, n = 12,187). In our systematic review, we found that total hip arthroplasty (THA) was the most common procedure performed for patients who have ONFH, and joint-preserving procedures generally declined over the studies' time periods. However, joint-preserving procedures were more commonly performed in younger patients and appeared to increase in incidence over the studies' time periods. Studies using a database from Asian countries utilized more joint-preserving procedures than studies using a database based in the US.

Conclusions

Hip osteonecrosis accounts for 40% of the osteonecrosis burden in the US, and corticosteroid use was identified as the most common risk factor. Surgical interventions, particularly THA, are the primary modality of treatment, with limited utilization of other surgical and non-surgical management. Our systematic review confirmed that the incidence of THA has increased over the years compared to joint-preserving procedures, although the latter has become more common in younger patients. There also appears to be considerable geographic variation in surgical trends, as patients in South Korea and Japan are more likely to undergo joint-preserving procedures. These findings underscore the need for consensus-driven treatment guidelines.

### Associated risk factors, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment options for multifocal osteonecrosis: a systematic review [^e4331f1e]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multifocal osteonecrosis (MFON) is defined as the diagnosis of osteonecrosis in at least three distinct anatomic sites that can occur consecutively or concurrently. It is important for arthroplasty surgeons to be aware of and manage these patients appropriately. There is a paucity of data surrounding the characterization, diagnosis, and treatment of MFON. The purpose of this investigation was to systematically review the literature to identify 1) clinical presentation/epidemiology, 2) pathophysiology, 3) diagnostic modalities, and 4) treatment guidelines/algorithms of MFON.

Methods

Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review across three databases, resulting in a total of 12 articles. Articles met the inclusion criteria if they provided data regarding 1) clinical presentation/epidemiology, 2) pathophysiology, 3) diagnostic modalities, and 4) treatment guidelines/algorithms of MFON.

Results

There are many etiologies of MFON, though autoimmune diseases such as lupus and prior use of corticosteroids are most commonly implicated in the disease. The femoral head is the most common anatomic site involved, though other joints such as the knee, shoulder, and ankle can be commonly affected. Diagnosis is reserved for standard radiography and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for screening, with regional MRI reserved for additional staging of the disease. Treatment is similar to standard single or oligofocal osteonecrosis and involves joint preservation procedures if the joint(s) are found before collapse and the use of arthroplasty following collapse if non-operative modalities fail.

Discussion

Although MFON is a rare clinical condition, it is one that arthroplasty surgeons should be aware of and meticulously screen for in their patients. It is defined as the presence of osteonecrosis in three or more distinct anatomic sites either concurrently or consecutively. Arthroplasty surgeons should be wary of patients who have osteonecrosis and should be meticulous in screening these patients for multiple joint involvement.

Glucocorticoid administration is the most common cause of secondary osteoporosis and the leading cause of nontraumatic osteonecrosis. In patients receiving long-term therapy, glucocorticoids induce fractures in 30% to 50% and osteonecrosis in 9% to 40%. This article reviews glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and osteonecrosis, addressing the risk factors, pathogenesis, evaluation, treatment, and uncertainties in the clinical management of these disorders.

### Osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^c67fa878]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Osteonecrosis is a progressive disorder in which lack of sufficient blood supply leads to cell death, fracture, and collapse of the affected area. The condition is frequently associated with the femoral head, where progression can be debilitating and can ultimately necessitate total hip arthroplasty (THA). The etiology of osteonecrosis is complex with numerous contributing agents, most markedly trauma, steroid use, and alcohol. Treatment of osteonecrosis is controversial because no option has been overwhelmingly embraced, and little research has compared treatments. Researchers estimate that 20,000 new cases of osteonecrosis are diagnosed in the United States each year.The increasing incidence and debilitating progression of osteonecrosis suggest the need for additional investigation of effective and novel treatments, as well as the need for clearer understanding of available treatments. This review characterizes the current knowledge on etiology, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and clinical management of osteonecrosis, with an emphasis on recent developments.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® osteonecrosis: 2022 update [^5f845074]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Osteonecrosis is defined as bone death due to inadequate vascular supply. It is sometimes also called "avascular necrosis" and "aseptic necrosis" when involving epiphysis, or "bone infarct" when involving metadiaphysis. Common sites include femoral head, humeral head, tibial metadiaphysis, femoral metadiaphysis, scaphoid, lunate, and talus. Osteonecrosis is thought to be a common condition most commonly affecting adults in third to fifth decades of life. Risk factors for osteonecrosis are numerous and include trauma, corticosteroid therapy, alcohol use, HIV, lymphoma/leukemia, blood dyscrasias, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, Gaucher disease, and Caisson disease. Epiphyseal osteonecrosis can lead to subchondral fracture and secondary osteoarthritis whereas metadiaphyseal cases do not, likely explaining their lack of long-term sequelae. Early diagnosis of osteonecrosis is important: 1) to exclude other causes of patient's pain and 2) to allow for possible early surgical prevention to prevent articular collapse and need for joint replacements. Imaging is also important for preoperative planning. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: MASCC / ISOO / ASCO clinical practice guideline [^edc7d63f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ)—guideline scope and methods—addresses the question, “What are the recommended best practices for preventing and managing MRONJ in patients with cancer?” and targets adult patients with cancer who are receiving bone-modifying agents (BMAs) for any oncologic indication. The recommendations derive from a systematic review and a multidisciplinary Expert Panel process, and given the low volume of high-quality evidence, a majority of the recommendations are based on consensus using ASCO’s formal consensus process.

### Asymptomatic osteonecrosis: should it be treated? [^020b7416]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Currently, there is no consensus regarding the treatment of precollapse osteonecrosis, particularly for asymptomatic osteonecrosis. With approximately 10,000 to 20,000 new cases of osteonecrosis a year, no single surgeon or center has the kind of experience that is able to address the most important questions concerning this disease. The literature strongly documents that symptoms of osteonecrosis will progress. Although the literature also supports the progression of asymptomatic osteonecrosis to symptomatic osteonecrosis on to collapse, that support is less convincing. Progression is proportional to lesion size, with small lesions (< 15% of femoral head involvement by volume) unlikely to progress. Although the results of core decompression have been somewhat controversial, the weight of the literature supports both the efficacy and safety of the procedure. The decision to treat osteonecrosis with core decompression is primarily based upon lesion size and stage of disease and does not necessarily depend on whether the patient is symptomatic. As large lesions (> 30% of the femoral head) are less likely to be successfully treated by core decompression and small lesions (< 15% of the femoral head) are less likely to progress, asymptomatic lesions within these ranges can be observed. The literature supports the position that moderately sized lesions (15-30% of the femoral head) should be treated by core decompression (with or without bone grafting).

### Osteoradionecrosis: exposing the evidence not the bone [^f5370993]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteoradionecrosis is a relatively rare but potentially morbid and costly complication of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment are essential. Despite evidence guiding individual aspects of care for osteoradionecrosis, there is a lack of broad consensus on the overall diagnosis and management of this condition. This study comprehensively reviews the literature, with a focus on the past 10 years, to guide evaluation and treatment.

### Osteonecrosis: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^c6be9427]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides an update of the recent progress in etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of osteonecrosis.

Recent Findings

Concerning pathogenesis, there is evidence that there is a genetic predilection for those who are exposed to the two leading etiologic associations for osteonecrosis: corticosteroids and alcohol. Studies concerning the treatment of osteonecrosis indicate that most preservative (ie, joint-sparing) procedures available today have better results in the precollapse stages of the disease and in smaller lesions. Therefore, researchers continue to develop and modify diagnostic techniques, particularly relating to MRI, for the identification and quantification of osteonecrotic lesions. Advances concerning bone grafting and arthroplasty procedures have resulted in improved clinical outcomes for this patient population. The future treatment of osteonecrosis may involve genetic or cell-based therapies.

Summary

Although progress has been made, considerably more research is needed before we fully understand this disease. Hopefully, such research will lead to effective measures for saving the femoral head or, better yet, preventing osteonecrosis.

### Osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^d675a160]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Osteonecrosis continues to be a condition of widely variant etiologies, treatments, and developmental profiles. Because incidence continues to rise, increased understanding of the pathophysiology is necessary to promote developments of new treatments and corrective procedures. Although promising developments are being made in areas such as bone grafting and stem cell therapy, the field continues to lack an agreed-upon regimen to provide patients with osteonecrosis the greatest quality of life and delay their progression to debilitating injury, collapse, or joint arthroplasty. To more effectively understand this disease process, more data are needed. A national registry would be the most complete system to determine diagnostic and treatment directions. In the absence of such a coordinated effort, institutional registries and large cohort studies would help to make advances in this realm.

In the area of treatment, there are many potential avenues for improvement. Promising advancements in bone repair such as anabolic agents may play a role in promoting healing. In addition, more directed therapies for coincident conditions may reduce the secondary development of osteonecrosis from steroids and chemotherapy. With an expanded study of etiologies, prevention, and therapy, there is a reason to hope for advancements in reducing the burden of this disease.

### Relationship between systemic corticosteroids and osteonecrosis [^a8437b59]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Numerous reports describe osteonecrosis after oral corticosteroid therapy. It is still uncertain if corticosteroid treatment alone or in combination with other factors leads to the development of this condition. The literature presents controversial clinical and experimental data. The most affected site for osteonecrosis is the femoral head and therefore our considerations are concentrated at this site. Oral corticosteroids are commonly used in dermatology, especially in the treatment of connective tissue diseases and hypersensitive diseases. This clinical review evaluates the relationship between and the onset of femoral head necrosis. Although osteonecrosis of the femoral head can be caused by various conditions such as trauma, excess alcohol and hemoglobinopathies, studies indicate that treatment with corticosteroids is the most common cause of the condition. There is some controversy on the role of underlying disease and total corticosteroid dose administered, in the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. MRI scans are used to establish an early diagnosis. There are several surgical and nonsurgical options for disease management, dependent on the stage of disease, the age of the patient and other risk factors. In general, the risk for osteonecrosis is considered to be low under oral corticosteroid therapy. So far, no data can establish a direct relationship, but data still strongly suggest an existing cause and effect relationship. Further investigations are necessary for example, a large controlled prospective long-term study, to further refine an association between the corticosteroid dose, the duration of treatment and other risk factors. Dermatologists who prescribe oral corticosteroids, should always be aware of the potential risk of avascular femoral head necrosis and the patients should be informed about this severe complication of oral coricosteroid therapy.

### Emerging concepts in the management and treatment of osteonecrosis of the jaw [^b2bf3943]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Since the first description of bone necrosis in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy in 2004, there have been multiple retrospective, prospective, and case-control studies that have served to characterize the diagnosis, associated risk factors, and treatment of this new complication. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is at present associated with several risk factors that are identified across several disciplines in medicine and dentistry. With this level of broad-based recognition, new clinical and basic science research initiatives have begun and are likely to elucidate the etiopathogenesis of this disease process, significantly improving the level of disease management and prevention.

### Narrative [ corrected ] review: bisphosphonates and osteonecrosis of the jaws [^57e5540b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the jaws is a recently described adverse side effect of bisphosphonate therapy. Patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic carcinoma to the skeleton who are receiving intravenous, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are at greatest risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws; these patients represent 94% of published cases. The mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla (2:1 ratio), and 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure. Oversuppression of bone turnover is probably the primary mechanism for the development of this condition, although there may be contributing comorbid factors. All sites of potential jaw infection should be eliminated before bisphosphonate therapy is initiated in these patients to reduce the necessity of subsequent dentoalveolar surgery. Conservative débridement of necrotic bone, pain control, infection management, use of antimicrobial oral rinses, and withdrawal of bisphosphonates are preferable to aggressive surgical measures for treating this condition. The degree of risk for osteonecrosis in patients taking oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, for osteoporosis is uncertain and warrants careful monitoring.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ASCO/ISOO/MASCC 2024 guidelines recommend to view patients with a radiation dose to the jaw ≥ 50 Gy as at risk for developing osteoradionecrosis. Recognize that modifiable risk factors include poor oral hygiene, dentoalveolar surgeries, and tobacco use that further increase this lifelong risk.

### How common is ONJ caused by bone-modifying drugs?-NCI (...) [^f9d61e19]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

ONJ was thought to be a rare side effect of these therapies, which include denosumab and bisphosphonates like zoledronic acid. But a new study has found that this serious and painful side effect is more common than once thought. The study, which took place in Austria, found that nearly 9% of people with metastatic breast cancer developed ONJ after taking bone-modifying, or antiresorptive, medications. While the study focused on people with metastatic breast cancer, other types of cancer that start in or spread to the bone, such as multiple myeloma, lung, and prostate cancer, are also treated with bone-modifying medicines, pointed out Stanley Lipkowitz, M. D. , Ph. D. , chief of NCI’s Women’s Malignancies Branch. “Other cancers managed similarly could very well have a similar increased rate of osteonecrosis, ” said Dr. Lipkowitz, who wasn’t involved in the study.

“By having a longer follow-up, what they found is that with more time on therapy, you have a higher rate of, ” Dr. Lipkowitz said. The rate of ONJ was low for the first year. But it continued to rise with each year on the treatment, which is typically given indefinitely, he explained. That’s an important finding because breast cancer often spreads to the bones, Dr. Lipkowitz said. And with newer, more effective treatments for metastatic breast cancer, patients are living longer and are taking bone-modifying medications for longer, he added. Denosumab has a higher risk of jaw osteonecrosis To see how often ONJ occurred, Dr. Brunner and her colleagues screened a database for every person with breast cancer living in a certain Austrian state from 2000 to 2020. They found 639 people with breast cancer that had spread to the bone and who had received denosumab, a bisphosphonate, or both medicines. Both types of drugs were taken once per month.

Overall, 56, or 9%, of these patients developed ONJ, the researchers found. A higher percentage of people who took denosumab developed ONJ than those who took a bisphosphonate. People who took a bisphosphonate followed by denosumab had the highest rate of ONJ.

### Nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the humeral head [^675bca7b]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The humeral head is the second most common site for nontraumatic osteonecrosis after the femoral head, yet it has attracted relatively little attention. Osteonecrosis is associated with many conditions, such as corticosteroid use, sickle-cell disease, alcoholism, dysbarism (or caisson disease), Gaucher's disease, and other systemic conditions. The diagnosis is a clinical and radiographic one, the latter forming the basis for its staging. Treatment depends on the chronicity and severity of symptoms, as well as the degree of clinical and radiographic progression. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic debridement and core decompression for early osteonecrosis and hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder arthroplasty for more advanced disease. This report reviews osteonecrosis of the humeral head, with an emphasis on current treatment options.

### From the radiologic pathology archives imaging of osteonecrosis: radiologic-pathologic correlation [^71005b84]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis is common and represents loss of blood supply to a region of bone. Common sites affected include the femoral head, humeral head, knee, femoral/tibial metadiaphysis, scaphoid, lunate, and talus. Symptomatic femoral head osteonecrosis accounts for 10,000-20,000 new cases annually in the United States. In contradistinction, metadiaphyseal osteonecrosis is often occult and asymptomatic. There are numerous causes of osteonecrosis most commonly related to trauma, corticosteroids, and idiopathic. Imaging of osteonecrosis is frequently diagnostic with a serpentine rim of sclerosis on radiographs, photopenia in early disease at bone scintigraphy, and maintained yellow marrow at MR imaging with a serpentine rim of high signal intensity (double-line sign) on images obtained with long repetition time sequences. These radiologic features correspond to the underlying pathology of osseous response to wall off the osteonecrotic process and attempts at repair with vascularized granulation tissue at the reactive interface. The long-term clinical importance of epiphyseal osteonecrosis is almost exclusively based on the likelihood of overlying articular collapse. MR imaging is generally considered the most sensitive and specific imaging modality both for early diagnosis and identifying features that increase the possibility of this complication. Treatment subsequent to articular collapse and development of secondary osteoarthritis typically requires reconstructive surgery. Malignant transformation of osteonecrosis is rare and almost exclusively associated with metadiaphyseal lesions. Imaging features of this dire sequela include aggressive bone destruction about the lesion margin, cortical involvement, and an associated soft-tissue mass. Recognizing the appearance of osteonecrosis, which reflects the underlying pathology, improves radiologic assessment and is important to guide optimal patient management.

### ACR appropriateness criteria osteonecrosis of the hip [^eed3443b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the hip (Legg-Calvé-Perthes) is a common disease, with 10,000-20,000 symptomatic cases annually in the United States. The disorder affects both adults and children and is most frequently associated with trauma and corticosteroid usage. The initial imaging evaluation of suspected hip osteonecrosis is done using radiography. MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the hip. The clinical significance of hip osteonecrosis is dependent on its potential for articular collapse. The likelihood of articular collapse is significantly increased with involvement of greater than 30%-50% of the femoral head area, which is optimally evaluated by MRI, often in the sagittal plane. Contrast-enhanced MRI may be needed to detect early osteonecrosis of the hip in pediatric patients, revealing hypoperfusion. In patients with a contraindication for MRI, use of either CT or bone scintigraphy with SPECT (single-photon emission CT) are alternative radiologic methods of assessment. Imaging helps guide treatment, which may include core decompression, osteotomy, and ultimately, need for joint replacement. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Osteonecrosis: what to do, what to do! [^ec8fc6d6]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2003). Low credibility.

Despite extensive literature on the subject, the treatment approaches for osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) remain controversial. The literature presently available to the orthopaedist suggests that i) ONFH can be identified early; ii) there are reasonable treatments for early stages of ONFH; iii) no single treatment is sufficient for all hips; and iv) there is as yet no predictable permanent treatment for early ONFH. The author's recommended approach for the practicing orthopaedist includes the following: i) develop a high degree of clinical suspicion that the disease is present and understand the role of magnetic resonance imaging in making an accurate diagnosis; ii) understand and use an appropriate staging system for each hip diagnosed; iii) be comfortable with several treatment options for early ONFH or choose to refer to appropriate centers; and iv) become comfortable with the use of uncemented THA for end-stage ONFH. The field continues to need and should support better treatment studies, including randomized clinical trials.

### Which classification system is most useful for classifying osteonecrosis of the femoral head? [^01cda157]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) causes severe pain in affected patients, with collapse of the femoral head often leading to secondary osteoarthritis. The size and location of a necrotic lesion are important in determining the risk of collapse, and several classification systems have been proposed to categorize and quantify ONFH on this basis. The Steinberg classification, initially published in 1984, is based on lesion volume. Kerboul et al. proposed an angular method and initially classified hips based on radiographs, which has subsequently been modified to incorporate use of MRI. Finally, the Japanese Investigation Committee (JIC) classification is based on the location of the necrotic lesion. According to a systematic review of the natural history of untreated patients with asymptomatic ONFH, symptoms or collapse occurred in 394 (59%) of 664 hips, progression to collapse was indicated in 296 (49%) of 598 hips, and small and medially located necrotic lesions had a good prognosis.

However, there is no consensus regarding which of the classification systems in common use is most effective. In particular, there are few reports on the relationships among classifications based on volume, angle, or location, and no report of which we are aware compares the three classification systems in the same patient group in terms of interobserver reliability or the association with subsequent collapse of the femoral head.

We therefore compared the Steinberg, modified Kerboul, and JIC classifications of ONFH in terms of (1) the correlation among the three classification systems. We further examined (2) the inter- and intraobserver reliability of the three classification systems and (3) the association of higher grades within each classification and the risk of subsequent collapse.

### Etiology, pathogenesis, and early diagnosis of ischemic necrosis of the hip (...) [^96a093f3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

ISCHEMIC necrosis may occur in almost any bone of the skeleton. The most common site for ischemic necrosis is the head of the femur, and it is here that early diagnosis has proved to be most difficult. The patient often complains of pain, sometimes during a period of several months before any specific radiological findings become visible. It is possible to make the diagnosis earlier if clinical suspicion is high and certain specific roentgenograms are obtained. Many centers are using radioisotopes in an attempt to demonstrate changes before those observed radiologically. Although the computed tomographic scanner is an excellent method for confirming advanced disease, so far it has not proved useful in the diagnosis of early ischemic necrosis.

The Etiology of Ischemic Necrosis The causes of osteonecrosis may be subdivided into three categories: posttraumatic, nontraumatic: 2615–2617. doi:

### Osteonecrosis of the jaw and bisphosphonates in cancer: a narrative review [^9ecb7c4a]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis (BON) is a complication that almost exclusively affects the jaw bones. The clinical presentation of BON often mimics that of other conditions, such as routine dental disease, osteoradionecrosis or avascular necrosis; therefore, diagnosis can be difficult. As this complication has only been recognized within the past 10 years, management strategies for patients with BON are poorly defined. Physicians must choose between continuing the bisphosphonate therapy (to reduce the risk of skeletal complications in patients with metastatic bone disease or osteoporosis) and discontinuing the drug (to possibly improve the odds for tissue healing). A conservative or aggressive management strategy must be chosen with limited evidence that the outcome of either strategy will be successful. BON is most prevalent in patients with cancer using intravenous nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. The pathobiology of this complication is not fully understood and the diagnosis relies on the clinical manifestations of the condition. Future research should focus on the pathobiological mechanisms involved in the development of BON, which could help explain why this complication affects only a small number of those who use bisphosphonates, and also suggest strategies for prevention and management.

### An evidence-based guide to the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^7dbf9e5f]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a potentially devastating condition, the prevalence of which is increasing. Many joint-preserving forms of treatment, both medical and surgical, have been developed in an attempt to slow or reverse its progression, as it usually affects young patients. However, it is important to evaluate the best evidence that is available for the many forms of treatment considering the variation in the demographics of the patients, the methodology and the outcomes in the studies that have been published, so that it can be used effectively. The purpose of this review, therefore, was to provide an up-to-date, evidence-based guide to the management, both non-operative and operative, of non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

### Atypical fractures at non-classical sites associated with anti-resorptive therapy: a systematic review [^21bda816]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Osteoporosis is common, affecting more than 20% of women and 6% of men globally over the age of 50. Anti-resorptive drugs, bisphosphonates and denosumab, have been effective treatments for osteoporosis for more than 30 years. Rare complications of anti-resorptive therapy include medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures (AFF). The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) proposed a case definition for these atypical femoral fractures in 2010, which was updated in 2013. However, atypical fractures at non-classical sites have been increasingly described. We aimed to systematically identify atypical fracture cases excluded from the ASBMR AFF case definition in patients receiving anti-resorptive medication for longer than 3 yr. A structured search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cochrane, and Web of Sciences, and hand-searching of conference abstracts were undertaken. All full-text articles written in English describing an atypical fracture in patients (aged >18 yr) and receiving anti-resorptive medication for >3 yr were included, with data extracted and analyzed by two independent reviewers. Sixty-six articles were identified, describing 151 cases of atypical fractures in 114 individuals. The most frequent fracture site was the ulna, followed by the tibia. All patients were taking anti-resorptive treatment prior to or at the time of fracture, most frequently alendronate monotherapy (44%). Most commonly, fractures were transverse in nature (95%), following minimal or no trauma (96%), and non-comminuted (98%) with cortical thickening of the surrounding bone (69%). Anti-resorptive treatment was ceased following an atypical fracture in the majority (89%). Atypical fractures are rare and should not deter physicians from appropriate anti-resorptive therapy for osteoporosis. However, clinicians should be alert to their presence at additional sites to the femur. An update of the current ASBMR AFF case definition to include other skeletal sites could be timely.

### Role of nuclear medicine imaging in recognizing different causes of osteonecrosis of the jaw [^d85e6a77]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) among patients with cancer and metastatic bone disease being treated with bisphosphonates is as high as 10%, which dictates that an understanding of the risk factors, preventative measures, means of early diagnosis, and treatment is critical. Despite ONJ occurring in the clinical setting of intravenous bisphosphonates, there are other causes associated with higher risk of ONJ, such as multiple dental extractions. Overall, it is important for imaging health care professionals to recognize, describe, and understand ONJ to help minimize biopsies and allow proper treatment to begin as soon as possible.

### Osteonecrosis of the jaw and the role of bisphosphonates: a critical review [^f2f82bd3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), a condition characterized by necrotic exposed bone in the maxillofacial region, has been reported in patients with cancer receiving bisphosphonate therapy, and rarely in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis or Paget disease of bone receiving such therapy. In the absence of a uniform definition, the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), and other groups have established similar diagnostic criteria for bisphosphonate-related ONJ, which is more commonly reported in patients with advanced malignancies with skeletal metastases who receive higher doses, and is more rarely reported in patients with osteoporosis and Paget disease who receive lower doses. However, a critical review of the literature reveals that the etiology of ONJ remains unknown, and to date no direct causal link to bisphosphonates has been established. Despite an increased awareness of ONJ and recent improvements in preventive strategies, patients and physicians alike continue to express concern about the potential risks of bisphosphonate treatment in both oncologic and nononcologic settings. Although much remains to be learned about this condition, including its true incidence in various patient populations, its pathophysiology, and optimal clinical management, evidence to date suggests that the positive benefits of bisphosphonates in patients with malignant bone disease, osteoporosis, or Paget disease outweigh the relatively small risk of ONJ.

### Osteonecrosis of the femoral head: etiology, imaging and treatment [^ccb990b3]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a disabling clinical entity affecting young adults that usually leads to destruction of the hip joint. A high index of suspicion is necessary for the diagnosis due to the insidious onset of the bone infarcts and the lack of specific clinical signs at the early stages. Many etiology-associated factors have been identified reducing thus the number of idiopathic cases. A number of joint salvaging treatment options are available if early diagnosis can be achieved. MR imaging has been proved to be a highly accurate method both for early diagnosis and for staging of the disease. Replacement of the hip joint is the last resort for pain relief and function, although non-desirable because of the young age of the affected population.

### Pathophysiology of osteonecrosis of the jaws [^85e11387]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a multifactorial disease in patients with primary or metastatic bone malignancy or osteoporosis undergoing systemic antiresorptive therapy, where pathophysiology has not yet been fully determined. The staging of ONJ is based on severity of symptoms and extent of clinical and radiographic findings. Treatment strategies range from conservative local wound care to aggressive resective surgery of all necrotic bone. The first ONJ cases were reported in 2003 and 2004, and although significant progress has been made in our understanding of the disease, much more work needs to be done to completely explain its pathophysiology.

### Risk factors, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment options for COVID-Associated osteonecrosis: a systematic review [^9a08b5f0]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteonecrosis associated with COVID-19 is a relatively rare clinical entity, but with a high incidence during the pandemic. There is a paucity of data regarding the characterization of this group of osteonecrosis patients. The purpose of this investigation was to systematically review the literature to identify: 1) clinical presentation/epidemiology, 2) pathophysiology, 3) diagnostic modalities, and 4) treatment guidelines/algorithms of COVID-19 osteonecrosis.

Methods

Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review across three databases, resulting in a total of 10 articles. Articles met the inclusion criteria if they provided data regarding: 1) clinical presentation/epidemiology, 2) pathophysiology, 3) diagnostic modalities, and/or 4) treatment guidelines/algorithms of COVID-19 osteonecrosis.

Results

There was considerable variability in duration between COVID-19 infection and osteonecrosis symptoms. The clinical presentation of COVID-associated osteonecrosis is similar to standard symptoms, including joint pain and pain with weight-bearing. Corticosteroids tended to be the most identifiable associated risk factor for COVID-associated osteonecrosis. Diagnosis included radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for definitive diagnosis. Treatment varied depending on the rapidity of osteonecrosis progression, ranging from bisphosphonates and analgesics to joint-preserving procedures and total joint arthroplasty (TJA).

Discussion

Although COVID-associated osteonecrosis is a rare clinical condition, it is one that orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of and meticulously screen for in their patients. For patients inoculated with the COVID-19 virus, it is important for surgeons to use information regarding clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-associated osteonecrosis to screen and manage patients appropriately.

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, more specifically with respect to bone-modifying agents (monitoring), ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that osteonecrosis of the jaw is an uncommon but potentially serious complication of IV bisphosphonates and denosumab. Perform a comprehensive dental examination and provide appropriate preventive dentistry before bone-modifying therapy in all patients. Treat active oral infections and eliminate sites at high risk for infection. Advise patients to maintain excellent oral hygiene and avoid invasive dental procedures if possible while on therapy. Individualize continuation of a bone-targeting agent in patients with osteonecrosis of the jaw depending on a risk-benefit ratio and the severity of the bone disease.

### The effects of corticosteroids on bone: osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of the bone) [^e390716d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide information about risk factors for, diagnosis of, and potential treatments and prevention of avascular necrosis (AVN) in patients frequently given systemic corticosteroid therapy for the management of allergic and/or inflammatory diseases.

Data Sources

Articles on AVN cited in PubMed from 1975 through 2008.

Study Selection

Publications consisted of case reports, reviews of osteonecrosis, and animal and human studies (mostly open, nonrandomized, and observational).

Results

Case reports of rare and infrequent use of corticosteroids and the development of osteonecrosis are of great concern to physicians, but most patients affected may also be at risk of developing osteonecrosis because of repetitive systemic corticosteroid use with underlying hyperlipidemia, alcoholism, smoking, connective tissue disorders, and/or previous trauma to the affected area. The use of statins for patients with hyperlipidemias may be useful in decreasing the risk of osteonecrosis but is considered investigational. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive tool for diagnosing AVN early. Prophylaxis with bisphosphonates may be worthwhile in certain patients for the early management of pain due to AVN, but eventually surgical intervention is warranted in the treatment of osteonecrosis.

Conclusions

Recognition of risk factors and educating (enabling) the patient remain the most effective ways of preventing AVN caused by corticosteroid use.

### Osteonecrosis in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: incidence, risk factors, radiological patterns and evolution in a single-centre cohort [^e8679c09]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Currently, ~90% of children and adolescents affected with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) can be cured and become long‐term survivors.Thus, long‐term side‐effects of treatment become increasingly relevant. Osteonecrosis (ON) is one of the most common and debilitating therapy‐related sequelae of anti‐leukaemic treatment.Incidence of ON has been investigated in many studies, but results differ substantially, from 1.6%, as reported in the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)‐ALL 95, to 25% in the German Co‐operative Study Group childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (CoALL)‐07‐03 trials.The ON incidence rises up to 59% in the Total XV protocols, which planned a systematic screening in all patients regardless of symptoms.Reported incidence rates in ALL studies may depend on age eligibility, treatment strategy (cumulative dose of steroids and other drugs) and diagnostic approach, which can be limited to severely symptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms or even include screening procedures. In addition, censoring or not patients upon stem cell transplantation (SCT) and/or relapse may contribute substantially to the load of this complication.

Besides variations in diagnostics, what is still lacking is a universally accepted classification useful to predict clinical evolution and guide management and therapy. There are many radiological classification systems, developed with the aim to assess clinical relevance and consequences of ON lesions (Arlet‐Ficat, Steinberg, and Association Research Circulation Osseous [ARCO] classification are among the most common), but the major weakness of these scoring systems is joint specificity for the femoral head, whereas patients with cancer often have multiple sites in various bones involved by the ON process.,The Niinimäki classification has been proposed as a universal classification system for oncological patients, suitable for all joints, regardless of the site of injury.

In our study the incidence of ON was assessed in a cohort of paediatric patients with ALL during the whole observation time, not only during front‐line chemotherapy, but also after relapse and/or SCT. This approach may help to define the real risk of developing ON in a paediatric patient with ALL upfront, through the different stages of the disease and its therapy. We analysed sites and frequency of ON lesions and classified them according to radiological features. The aim of ON treatment is to avoid lesion progression that can lead to articular collapse, therefore a better understanding of the features that would possibly correlate with the lesion prognosis could play a crucial role.

Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaw—operational clinical characterization and classification is as follows: ORN of the jaw should be operationally characterized as: radiographic lytic or mixed sclerotic lesion of bone and/or visibly exposed bone and/or probe through a periodontal pocket or fistula (Figs 1A and 1B) occurring within an anatomical site previously exposed to a therapeutic dose of head and neck RT. To facilitate clinical implementation of the enclosed recommendations, the Panel has adopted the ClinRad classification system, which the Panel favored as “designed in order to be comprehensive enough to be used across providers and specialties” and “yet simple enough to communicate a stable intrinsic description of ORN as a recognizable disease state.” Unlike other necrotic states, direct biopsy or tissue sampling is neither routinely used nor recommended by this Panel, as the biopsy or tissue excision itself might engender disease progression.

### Osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^bf9215e0]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a progressive and debilitating condition with a wide variety of etiologies including trauma, steroid use, and alcohol intake. Diagnosis and staging are based on imaging including MRI at any stage and plain radiography in more advanced lesions. The only definitive treatment is total hip arthroplasty, although numerous treatments including disphosphonates and core decompression are used to delay the progression. Lack of satisfactory conservative measures suggests the need for additional research of osteonecrosis including large patient registries to further understand this condition.

### The frequency of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw and its associated risk factors [^56be54ce]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

This article provides the best current frequency estimate of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ), and identifies factors associated with the risk of developing osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) among patients exposed to relevant medications (ie, antiresorptive or antiangiogenic agents). MRONJ is a rare but serious complication of cancer treatment or osteoporosis management. This review confirms that antiresorptive medications such as oral or intravenous bisphosphonates and denosumab are the most common risk factors for developing ONJ. The risk of MRONJ is greater in patients with cancer than in those receiving antiresorptive treatments for osteoporosis by a factor of 10.

### Canadian consensus practice guidelines for bisphosphonate associated osteonecrosis of the jaw [^be52d664]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Following publication of the first reports of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in patients receiving bisphosphonates in 2003, a call for national multidisciplinary guidelines based upon a systematic review of the current evidence was made by the Canadian Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (CAOMS) in association with national and international societies concerned with ONJ. The purpose of the guidelines is to provide recommendations regarding diagnosis, identification of at-risk patients, and prevention and management strategies, based on current evidence and consensus. These guidelines were developed for medical and dental practitioners as well as for oral pathologists and related specialists.

Methods

The multidisciplinary task force established by the CAOMS reviewed all relevant areas of research relating to ONJ associated with bisphosphonate use and completed a systematic review of current literature. These evidence-based guidelines were developed utilizing a structured development methodology. A modified Delphi consensus process enabled consensus among the multidisciplinary task force members. These guidelines have since been reviewed by external experts and endorsed by national and international medical, dental, oral surgery, and oral pathology societies.

Results

RECOMMENDATIONS regarding diagnosis, prevention, and management of ONJ were made following analysis of all current data pertaining to this condition. ONJ has many etiologic factors including head and neck irradiation, trauma, periodontal disease, local malignancy, chemotherapy, and glucocorticoid therapy. High-dose intravenous bisphosphonates have been identified as a risk factor for ONJ in the oncology patient population. Low-dose bisphosphonate use in patients with osteoporosis or other metabolic bone disease has not been causally linked to the development of ONJ. Prevention, staging, and treatment recommendations are based upon collective expert opinion and current data, which has been limited to case reports, case series, surveys, retrospective studies, and 2 prospective observational studies.

Recommendations

In all oncology patients, a thorough dental examination including radiographs should be completed prior to the initiation of intravenous bisphosphonate therapy. In this population, any invasive dental procedure is ideally completed prior to the initiation of high-dose bisphosphonate therapy. Non-urgent procedures are preferably delayed for 3 to 6 months following interruption of bisphosphonate therapy. Osteoporosis patients receiving oral or intravenous bisphosphonates do not require a dental examination prior to initiating therapy in the presence of appropriate dental care and good oral hygiene. Stopping smoking, limiting alcohol intake, and maintaining good oral hygiene should be emphasized for all patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. Individuals with established ONJ are most appropriately managed with supportive care including pain control, treatment of secondary infection, removal of necrotic debris, and mobile sequestrate. Aggressive debridement is contraindicated.

Conclusion

Our multidisciplinary guidelines, which provide a rational evidence-based approach to the diagnosis, prevention, and management of bisphosphonate-associated ONJ in Canada, are based on the best available published data and the opinion of national and international experts involved in the prevention and management of ONJ.

Special Considerations

Table 5 presents the suggested approaches in i) dental procedures in low- and high-risk patients receiving antiresorptive treatment, and ii) patients receiving antiresorptives who develop ONJ.

Table 5. 
Recommendations for dental management in specific conditions

A balanced evaluation of the risk-to-benefit ratio of continuing or stopping antiresorptives should always be performed in such patients. A detailed medical history should be obtained, evaluating the duration and type of antiresorptives (current or past), concurrent pharmacological treatments, the presence of other risk factors for ONJ, and the risk of fracture or SRE. Clinical decision should also be made in relation to the invasiveness of the procedure.

Discontinuation of antiresorptive treatment in patients requiring dental procedures is particularly controversial because of low evidence to support strong recommendations. The following are the most accepted guidelines:

### Osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^a712bf89]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology and Pathogenesis

General Pathogenesis

Osteonecrosis occurs because of compromised blood flow or oxygen delivery to the bone, although the clinical presentation is a result of the repair process, rather than initial ischemia. In osteonecrosis, bone formation by osteoblasts is unable to match bone resorption by osteoclasts. This remodeling imbalance does not adequately replace the necrotic bone, leaving a region of structurally unsound bone tissues.

Trauma

Trauma is the most common cause of osteonecrosis,disrupting blood flow and leading to osteocyte death. Estimates of occurrence of traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head vary depending on the injury type; however, in meta-analysis of traumatic osteonecrosis, incidence has been found to be as high as 14.3%.The Garden classification categorizes femoral neck fractures and can be used to estimate the risk of osteonecrosis. Garden I (incomplete fracture) and Garden II (complete and nondisplaced) are considered stable and low risk, and can be repaired with internal fixation. Garden III (complete and partially displaced) and Garden IV (complete and completely displaced) have much higher rates of osteonecrosis with internal fixation (16%), and arthroplasty should be considered.Intertrochanteric hip fractures result in a low risk of osteonecrosis, noted at 0.95% after a 1-year follow-up.

Atraumatic Osteonecrosis

Atraumatic osteonecrosis encompasses a diverse array of causes. It is important to note that in atraumatic osteonecrosis, disease is frequently bilateral owing to systemic risk factors, with some estimates suggesting as high as 70% of the patients with unilateral osteonecrosis developing disease in the contralateral hip. The reasons for the sparing of one hip in the presence of a systemic risk factor are not well studied and may be because of subclinical presentation, differences in wear patterns between hips, underinvestigation of symptoms, or lack of coordinated follow-up.

### Epidemiology of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws: the utility of a national registry [^1693a216]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Little is known about the epidemiology of osteonecrosis of the jaws. To date, no population-based studies have rigorously evaluated risk factors, treatment factors, or outcomes. We aimed to perform such a study.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the literature for epidemiologic studies on osteonecrosis of the jaws.

Results

Current epidemiologic information is generally derived from anecdotal reports or case series from small institutions. Estimates that have been provided in some reports have questionable validity because of a lack of standardized case definitions, clearly defined source populations, and clear methods for obtaining (or confirming) full reporting. Population-based prospective registries are capable of answering and informing several of the outstanding questions about bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws/osteonecrosis of the jaws.

Conclusion

A population-based registry that collects systematic information on patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes is essential to filling the gaps in our knowledge and understanding of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: MASCC / ISOO / ASCO clinical practice guideline [^5e7cb117]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ)—general objectives and procedural considerations specify that treatment objectives for patients with an established diagnosis of MRONJ are to eliminate pain, control infection of the soft and hard tissues, and minimize the progression or occurrence of bone necrosis, and patients with established MRONJ should avoid elective dentoalveolar surgical procedures; there have been several reports of successful treatment outcomes for all stages after operative therapy and nonoperative therapy, and, with the exception of the more advanced cases of stage 3 disease or cases with a well-defined sequestrum, a more prudent approach is to consider operative therapies when nonoperative strategies have failed. Regardless of stage, areas of superficial necrotic bone that are an ongoing source of soft tissue irritation and loose bony sequestra should be removed or recontoured to optimize soft tissue healing, extraction of symptomatic teeth within exposed, necrotic bone should be considered, and most affected patients experience osteonecrosis of the jaw after dentoalveolar surgery.

### MRI of osteonecrosis [^68faa5df]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis is a relatively common condition, which may be idiopathic or secondary to a variety of clinical situations. It may involve the subarticular region of a joint, when it is commonly referred to as ischaemic necrosis, or the metaphyseal regions of long bones, when it is referred to as bone infarction. In both situations, early lesions may be radiographically occult. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very sensitive in identifying and characterizing osteonecrosis. This review illustrates the varied MRI features of osteonecrosis that enable a confident diagnosis to be made. Complications and differential diagnosis are also considered.

### Expert perspective: how, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^d27bb95f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The most concerning adverse events associated with both bisphosphonates and denosumab are atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). These adverse events are believed to stem, at least in part, from the profound and longer‐term suppression of bone remodeling. Although both conditions share a common pathophysiology related to the suppression of bone turnover, each has unique characteristics and potential mechanisms.

ONJ is characterized by exposed necrotic bone in the maxillofacial region, often following dental extractions or other invasive dental procedures. It is believed that prolonged suppression of bone turnover compromises the ability of the jawbone to repair microdamage and maintain vascularity, leading to localized necrosis. Additionally, factors such as local infection, reduced angiogenesis, and microbial biofilms play significant roles in the pathogenesis of ONJ.

AFFs occur along the subtrochanteric or diaphyseal regions of the femur and occur with minimal trauma. The pathogenesis involves oversuppression of bone turnover leading to reduced bone remodeling capacity, accumulation of microdamage, and altered bone material properties.

Both events are estimated to have an overall incidence of 1 of 1,000 to 1 of 10,000 in patients treated for osteoporosis.Despite the overall rarity and the typical modest severity of most cases of ONJ in osteoporosis, it occasionally can be very serious and lead to morbidity and even death. Further establishing causality of these events with bisphosphonates, ONJ rates approach 1% to 10% when potent intravenous bisphosphonates are administered as frequently as every month in the setting of malignancy.Because of the unusual depot effects of bisphosphonates, the risk of these longer‐term adverse effects with both treatments, and/or achievement of successful bone health outcomes, some clinicians and patients, such as the twins, will consider stopping these treatments after variable periods of use.

### Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: is pH the missing part in the pathogenesis puzzle? [^ab09c4f3]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is a side effect of bisphosphonate therapy, primarily diagnosed in patients with cancer and metastatic bone disease and receiving intravenous administrations of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. If diagnosis or treatment is delayed, BRONJ can develop to a severe and devastating disease. Numerous studies have focused on BRONJ, with possible pathomechanisms identified to be oversuppression of bone turnover, ischemia due to antiangiogenetic effects, local infections, or soft tissue toxicity. However, the precise pathogenesis largely remains elusive and questions of paramount importance await to be answered, namely 1) Why is only the jaw bone affected? 2) Why and how do the derivatives differ in their potency to induce a BRONJ? and 3) Why and when is BRONJ manifested? The present perspective reflects on existing theories and introduces the hypothesis that local tissue acidosis in the jaw bone offers a conclusive pathogenesis model and may prove to be the missing link in BRONJ.

### Osteoradionecrosis of the jaw: a mini review [^8b314868]. Frontiers in Oral Health (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on osteoradionecrosis of the jaw: 
- Definition: ORNJ is a complication of radiation therapy for head and neck, characterized by necrosis of the maxilla or mandible.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology involves radiation-induced damage to the blood vessels and bone cells in the jaw, leading to tissue hypoxia and impaired healing that ultimately results in necrosis of the bone tissue.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of osteoradionecrosis varies widely in the literature, ranging from 0.4% to 56% after radiotherapy, with a significant reduction in the modern era.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for osteoradionecrosis include high doses of radiation, poor oral hygiene and periodontal status, and dental extractions after radiotherapy. Alcohol use and smoking may also increase the risk.
- Disease course: The clinical course of osteoradionecrosis usually starts with pain, swelling, dysesthesia, and exposed bone in the mouth. As the condition progresses, complications can arise, including dysphagia, dysarthria, pathological fractures, fistula formation, and in severe cases, extra-mandibular osteoradionecrosis.

### Osteonecrosis: a more appropriate term than avascular necrosis-pathophysiologic rationale [^30ff1695]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-traumatic osteonecrosis has traditionally been attributed to vascular insufficiency, causing deprivation of oxygen and nutrients to the bone and subsequent bone death. The terminology used to describe this condition has varied widely, reflecting a lack of consensus regarding its underlying mechanisms. A thorough review of the literature reveals that the ultimate pathophysiologic event in the development of non-traumatic osteonecrosis is disrupted bone homeostasis, which may be induced by vascular insufficiency or caused by vascular-independent mechanisms. The continued use of the term "avascular necrosis" or "ischemic necrosis" presents major drawbacks, as it disproportionately emphasizes vascular insufficiency, directing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies primarily toward restoring blood flow. This narrow focus risks overlooking other equally or more relevant underlying mechanisms. In this manuscript, we critically evaluate the use of various terms for osteonecrosis, particularly "avascular necrosis" and "ischemic necrosis," and reinforce a previous shift towards adopting "osteonecrosis" as the preferred term. By advocating for the adoption of the term "osteonecrosis," we promote a more inclusive understanding of the multifactorial nature of the condition. This linguistic shift could also drive the development of innovative therapies that address not only vascular insufficiency but also the other underlying mechanisms contributing to bone necrosis.

### Osteonecrosis of the hip: novel approaches to evaluation and treatment [^0eba4e17]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

The treatment of osteonecrosis of the hip remains a dilemma. Contemporary basic science research focuses on establishing the molecular etiology of this disease with the hope of identifying targets for pharmacologic intervention. Researchers have identified specific genetic polymorphisms that may predispose its development and these may allow early diagnosis and treatment of at-risk patients. Refinements in magnetic resonance imaging aid in the staging of patients with osteonecrosis and findings appear to correlate with clinical outcome. Novel nonoperative and operative modalities for the treatment of osteonecrosis are also under investigation. The results of new pharmacologic and biophysical treatments appear beneficial in delaying, and possibly preventing, the progression of precollapse lesions. New bone grafting strategies may enhance the results of core decompression. Although the results of conventional total hip arthroplasty have improved, newer surface replacement systems provide satisfactory short-term outcomes and may preserve bone stock in younger patients. Further research is needed to clarify the roles of these emerging technologies in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the hip. Until there is convincing evidence of efficacy in randomized clinical trials, we recommend appropriate staging and core decompression with or without bone graft for precollapse lesions and total hip arthroplasty or surface replacement for advanced disease.

➤ Although multiple theories have been proposed, no one pathophysiologic mechanism has been identified as the etiology for the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. However, the basic mechanism involves impaired circulation to a specific area that ultimately becomes necrotic.➤ A variety of nonoperative treatment regimens have been evaluated for the treatment of precollapse disease, with varying success.

### Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in... [^022d4146]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

It is defined as exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that has persisted beyond eight weeks in a patient currently or previously treated with a bisphosphonate, and in the absence of a history of radiotherapy to the jaw. 3, 4 Bisphosphonates are prescribed orally and intravenously, with most patients who have osteoporosis taking low-dose oral therapy. On average, patients take oral bisphosphonates for 4. 6 years before developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. 5 The prevalence in patients taking oral bisphosphonates is very low, ranging from 0. 07 to
0. 10 percent, 2 although it is considerably higher in patients with cancer who are taking high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates. 3 Osteonecrosis related to bisphosphonates occurs almost exclusively in the jaw. Lesions can range in size and severity. . The etiology is unclear.

The jaw is an area of high bone turnover because of the presence of teeth and daily bone remodeling around the periodontal ligaments. 6 The alveolar bone has a turnover rate 10 times that of the long bone. 7 In the process of bone remodeling and turnover, old bones are resorbed by osteoclasts and new bones are formed by osteoblasts. Bisphosphonates bind to osteoclasts and accumulate at sites of high bone turnover. Hence, there is a higher concentration of bisphosphonates in the jaw. Some theories suggest, and there is some supporting evidence, that the necrosis is caused by the inhibition of bone remodeling secondary to the suppression of bone resorption. 6, 8, 9. 3, 10 Approximately 50 to 60 percent of cases were preceded by dentoalveolar surgery. 7, 8 Other contributing factors include local infection, corticosteroid use, and chemotherapy.

It has been argued that the jaw is particularly vulnerable to infection compared with other bones because of the thin oral mucosa and high oral microbial load. 11 The microorganism commonly found in necrotic bones is Actinomyces. 6, 8, 10 Antibiotic treatment for three weeks or longer has been suggested in combination with an antimicrobial oral rinse. 4, 6 Aggressive debridement or radical resection has produced mixed clinical results 3, 5.

### Increasing prevalence and risk factors for multifocal osteonecrosis in patients who have corticosteroid-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head: a 15-year multicenter study [^ff5fe8f5]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Multifocal osteonecrosis (MFON) is a rare condition affecting multiple bone sites, with limited epidemiological data available. This study investigated the frequency, trends, and risk factors for MFON in patients aged > 15 years who had corticosteroid-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) using data from a multicenter sentinel monitoring system in Japan.

Methods

Data from 658 patients between 2009 and 2023 were analyzed. The MFON was defined as osteonecrosis involving three or more separate anatomical sites. The frequency and trends of MFON were assessed across three 5-year periods. The risk factors for MFON were analyzed using data from 2014 onward, when smoking history data became available. The group with no necrosis other than that in the femoral head was defined as the non-MFON group, and the demographics and comorbidities were compared between the MFON and non-MFON groups. The risk factors were analyzed using univariate and logistic regression analyses.

Results

The frequency of MFON was 5.3% during the entire period and increased significantly over time (1.6, 7.4, and 8.0%; P < 0.01). The knee joint was the most common site of osteonecrosis, and all patients had knee joint involvement. The MFON group was younger (P < 0.001) and had more women (P < 0.05) than the non-MFON group and had significantly more patients who had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hematological tumors (both P < 0.01). The independent risk factors for MFON included age < 40 years (P < 0.05), SLE (P < 0.05), and hematological tumors (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The frequency of MFON in patients who had corticosteroid-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head was 5.3%. Young patients, those who have SLE, or those who have hematological tumors are at a higher risk of MFON and should be considered for MFON screening.

### Interventions for managing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^b0178fdb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse reaction experienced by some individuals to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab and antiangiogenic agents) and involves the progressive destruction of bone in the mandible or maxilla. Depending on the drug, its dosage, and the duration of exposure, the occurrence of this adverse drug reaction may be rare (e.g. following the oral administration of bisphosphonate or denosumab treatments for osteoporosis, or antiangiogenic agent-targeted cancer treatment) or common (e.g. following intravenous bisphosphonate for cancer treatment). MRONJ is associated with significant morbidity, adversely affects quality of life (QoL), and is challenging to treat.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the prophylaxis of MRONJ in people exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic drugs.To assess the effects of non-surgical or surgical interventions (either singly or in combination) versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the treatment of people with manifest MRONJ.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 23 November 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 23 November 2016), and Embase Ovid (23 May 2016 to 23 November 2016). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on language or publication status when searching the electronic databases; however, the search of Embase was restricted to the last six months due to the Cochrane Embase Project to identify all clinical trials and add them to CENTRAL.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one modality of intervention with another for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ. For 'prophylaxis of MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was the incidence of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, time-to-event, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. For 'treatment of established MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was healing of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, recurrence, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) (or rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included five RCTs (1218 participants) in the review. Three trials focused on the prophylaxis of MRONJ. Two trials investigated options for the treatment of established MRONJ. The RCTs included only participants treated with bisphosphonates and, thus, did not cover the entire spectrum of medications associated with MRONJ. Prophylaxis of MRONJOne trial compared standard care with regular dental examinations in three-month intervals and preventive treatments (including antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. The intervention seemed to lower the risk of MRONJ: RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39 (253 participants; low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not evaluated.As dentoalveolar surgery is considered a common predisposing event for developing MRONJ, one trial investigated the effect of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) for preventing MRONJ in people with cancer undergoing dental extractions. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of PRGF on MRONJ incidence when compared with standard treatment (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.51; 176 participants; very low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported. In another trial comparing wound closure by primary intention with wound closure by secondary intention after dental extractions in people treated with oral bisphosphonates (700 participants), no cases of intraoperative complications or postoperative MRONJ were observed. QoL was not investigated. Treatment of MRONJOne trial analysed hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment used in addition to standard care (antiseptic rinses, antibiotics, and surgery) compared with standard care alone. HBO in addition to standard care did not significantly improve healing from MRONJ compared with standard care alone (at last follow-up: RR 1.56; 95% CI 0.77 to 3.18; 46 participants included in the analysis; very low-quality evidence). QoL data were presented qualitatively as intragroup comparisons; hence, an effect estimate of treatment on QoL was not possible. Other secondary outcomes were not reported.The other RCT found no significant difference between autofluorescence- and tetracycline fluorescence-guided sequestrectomy for the surgical treatment of MRONJ at any timepoint (at one-year follow-up: RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; 34 participants included in the analysis; very low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylaxis of MRONJOne open-label RCT provided some evidence that dental examinations in three-month intervals and preventive treatments may be more effective than standard care for reducing the incidence of MRONJ in individuals taking intravenous bisphosphonates for advanced cancer. We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low.There is insufficient evidence to either claim or refute a benefit of either of the interventions tested for prophylaxis of MRONJ (i.e. PRGF inserted into the postextraction alveolus during dental extractions, and wound closure by primary or secondary intention after dental extractions). Treatment of MRONJAvailable evidence is insufficient to either claim or refute a benefit for hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an adjunct to conventional therapy. There is also insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about autofluorescence-guided versus tetracycline fluorescence-guided bone surgery.

### Osteonecrosis of the jaw and antiresorptive agents in benign and malignant diseases: a critical review organized by the ECTS [^463a7ee4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was performed under the auspices of the Clinical Action Group of the Policy and Consensus Committee of the ECTS. Detailed methodology is quoted in the Supplementary data. This review was not set up to make grade-based recommendations; given the lack of high-quality data, evidence would most likely be low, and this would render grade recommendations weak. The final manuscript has not been subjected to a membership hearing but has been approved for submission by the board of directors of the ECTS.

### Interventions for treating bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) [^ee177370]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bisphosphonate drugs can be used to prevent and treat osteoporosis and to reduce symptoms and complications of metastatic bone disease; however, they are associated with a rare but serious adverse event: osteonecrosis of the maxillary and mandibular bones. This condition is called bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw or BRONJ. BRONJ is diagnosed when people who are taking, or have previously taken, bisphosphonates have exposed bone in the jaw area for more than eight weeks in the absence of radiation treatment. There is currently no "gold standard" of treatment for BRONJ. The three broad categories of intervention are conservative approaches (e.g. mouth rinse, antibiotics), surgical interventions and adjuvant non-surgical strategies (e.g. hyperbaric oxygen therapy, platelet-rich plasma), which can be used in combination.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of any intervention aimed at treating BRONJ.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 15 December 2015: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Trials Register (20 September 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, CancerLit via PubMed, CINAHL via EBSCO and AMED via Ovid. We scanned the references cited in retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field, the first authors of included papers, study sponsors, other bisphosphonates investigators and pharmaceutical companies. We searched for ongoing trials through contact with trialists and by searching the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also conducted a grey literature search to September 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of any treatment for BRONJ with another treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the risk of bias in the included trials and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third review author.

Main Results

One small trial at high risk of bias met the inclusion criteria. The trial randomised 49 participants, most of whom had cancer. It compared standard care (defined as surgery, antibiotics and oral rinses at the discretion of the oral-maxillofacial surgeon) to standard care plus hyperbaric oxygen therapy (2 atmospheres twice a day for 40 treatments). The trial measured the percentage of participants who improved or healed at three, six, 12 and 18 months and last contact. It also measured mean weekly pain scores.At three months, the study found that the participants in intervention group were more likely to have an improvement in their osteonecrosis than the standard care group participants (risk ratio (RR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 3.74). There was no clear difference between the groups for the outcome 'healed' at three months (RR 3.60, 95% CI 0.87 to 14.82). There was no clear difference between the groups for improvement or healing when they were evaluated at six, 12 and 18 months and last contact.The study did not give any information on adverse events.Although the findings suggest adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen improved BRONJ, the quality of the evidence is very low since the only study was underpowered and was at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, cross-over of participants between groups and very high attrition (50% at 12 months and 80% at 18 months in this study, which was designed for an intended follow-up of 24 months).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide treatment of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). One small trial at high risk of bias evaluated hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) as an adjunct to "standard" care and could not confirm or refute the effectiveness of HBO. There are two ongoing trials of teriparatide treatment for BRONJ. We found no randomised controlled trials of any other BRONJ treatments. High quality randomised controlled trials are needed. We provide recommendations for their focus and design.

### The pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: so many hypotheses, so few data [^7644c5d3]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) has generated great interest in the medical and research communities yet remains an enigma, given its unknown pathogenesis. The goal of this review is to summarize the various proposed hypotheses underlying BRONJ. Although a role of the oral mucosa has been proposed, the bone is likely the primary tissue of interest for BRONJ. The most popular BRONJ hypothesis-manifestation of necrotic bone resulting from bisphosphonate--induced remodeling suppression--is supported mostly by indirect evidence, although recent data have shown that bisphosphonates significantly reduce remodeling in the jaw. Remodeling suppression would be expected, and has been shown, to allow accumulation of nonviable osteocytes, whereas a more direct cytotoxic effect of bisphosphonates on osteocytes has also been proposed. Bisphosphonates have antiangiogenic effects, leading to speculation that this could contribute to the BRONJ pathogenesis. Compromised angiogenesis would most likely be involved in post-intervention healing, although other aspects of the vasculature (eg, blood flow) could contribute to BRONJ. Despite infection being present in many BRONJ patients, there is no clear evidence as to whether infection is a primary or secondary event in the pathophysiology. In addition to these main factors proposed in the pathogenesis, numerous cofactors associated with BRONJ (eg, diabetes, smoking, dental extraction, concurrent medications) could interact with bisphosphonates and affect remodeling, angiogenesis/blood flow, and/or infection. Because our lack of knowledge concerning BRONJ pathogenesis results from a lack of data, it is only through the initiation of hypothesis-driven studies that significant progress will be made to understand this serious and debilitating condition.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: basic and translational science updates [^d2425bee]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, bisphosphonates had become the clinical pillar of excellence for treating metabolic bone disease, and thus their connection with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) caused significant concern. Over the past decade, progress has been made in understanding what is now referred to as medication-related ONJ (MRONJ), because of its connections to agents other than bisphosphonates, although in many respects the progress has been slow. This review highlights the key basic science and translational (animal) studies in the area of MRONJ and suggests areas of focus as the field moves into the next decade.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ)—risk factors and clinical interpretation note that significant risk factors and comorbid conditions contributing to MRONJ include pamidronate, zoledronic acid, and denosumab; estimates for risk after tooth extraction in oncology patients exposed to intravenous bisphosphonates range from 1.6% to 14.8%; a phase II study reported an exceptionally high incidence of MRONJ (20%) with a multi-drug regimen; a retrospective study and a case series suggest prophylactic antibiotics before oral surgery may reduce MRONJ risk, but firm conclusions cannot be drawn; MRONJ lesions occur more commonly in the mandible than in the maxilla and are more prevalent in areas with thin mucosa over bone prominences.

### Interventions for managing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^721d7b49]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse reaction experienced by some individuals to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab, and antiangiogenic agents), and involves the progressive destruction of bone in the mandible or maxilla. Depending on the drug, its dosage, and the duration of exposure, this adverse drug reaction may occur rarely (e.g. following the oral administration of bisphosphonate or denosumab treatments for osteoporosis, or antiangiogenic agent-targeted cancer treatment), or commonly (e.g. following intravenous bisphosphonate for cancer treatment). MRONJ is associated with significant morbidity, adversely affects quality of life (QoL), and is challenging to treat. This is an update of our review first published in 2017.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the prophylaxis of MRONJ in people exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic drugs. To assess the effects of non-surgical or surgical interventions (either singly or in combination) versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the treatment of people with manifest MRONJ.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 16 June 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies.  SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one modality of intervention with another for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ. For 'prophylaxis of MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was the incidence of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, time-to-event, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. For 'treatment of established MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was healing of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, recurrence, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) (or rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included 13 RCTs (1668 participants) in this updated review, of which eight were new additions. The studies were clinically diverse and examined very different interventions, so meta-analyses could not be performed. We have low or very low certainty about available evidence on interventions for the prophylaxis or treatment of MRONJ. 

Prophylaxis of MRONJ 
Five RCTs examined different interventions to prevent the occurrence of MRONJ. One RCT compared standard care with regular dental examinations at three-month intervals and preventive treatments (including antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. The intervention seemed to lower the risk of MRONJ (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39, 253 participants). Secondary outcomes were not evaluated. Dentoalveolar surgery is considered a common predisposing event for developing MRONJ and five RCTs tested various preventive measures to reduce the risk of postoperative MRONJ. The studies evaluated plasma rich in growth factors inserted into the postextraction alveolus in addition to standardised medical and surgical care versus standardised medical and surgical care alone (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.51, 176 participants); delicate surgery and closure by primary intention versus non-traumatic tooth avulsion and closure by secondary intention (no case of postoperative MRONJ in either group); primary closure of the extraction socket with a mucoperiosteal flap versus application of platelet-rich fibrin without primary wound closure (no case of postoperative MRONJ in either group); and subperiosteal wound closure versus epiperiosteal wound closure (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.56, 132 participants).  

Treatment of MRONJ 
Eight RCTs examined different interventions for the treatment of established MRONJ; that is, the effect on MRONJ cure rates.  One RCT analysed hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment used in addition to standard care (antiseptic rinses, antibiotics, and surgery) compared with standard care alone (at last follow-up: RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.18, 46 participants).  Healing rates from MRONJ were not significantly different between autofluorescence-guided bone surgery and conventional bone surgery (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37, 30 participants). Another RCT that compared autofluorescence- with tetracycline fluorescence-guided sequestrectomy for the surgical treatment of MRONJ found no significant difference (at one-year follow-up: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30, 34 participants).  Three RCTs investigated the effect of growth factors and autologous platelet concentrates on healing rates of MRONJ: platelet-rich fibrin after bone surgery versus surgery alone (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22, 47 participants), bone morphogenetic protein-2 together with platelet-rich fibrin versus platelet-rich fibrin alone (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.29, 55 participants), and concentrated growth factor and primary wound closure versus primary wound closure only (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.34, 28 participants).   Two RCTs focused on pharmacological treatment with teriparatide: teriparatide 20 μg daily versus placebo in addition to standard care (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.95, 33 participants) and teriparatide 56.5 μg weekly versus teriparatide 20 μg daily in addition to standard care (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.44, 12 participants).

Authors Conclusions

Prophylaxis of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw 
One open-label RCT provided some evidence that dental examinations at three-month intervals and preventive treatments may be more effective than standard care for reducing the incidence of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in individuals taking intravenous bisphosphonates for advanced cancer. We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be very low. 
There is insufficient evidence to either claim or refute a benefit of the interventions tested for prophylaxis of MRONJ in patients with antiresorptive therapy undergoing dentoalveolar surgery. Although some interventions suggested a potential large effect, the studies were underpowered to show statistical significance, and replication of the results in larger studies is pending. 

Treatment of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw 
The available evidence is insufficient to either claim or refute a benefit, in addition to standard care, of any of the interventions studied for the treatment of MRONJ.

### The issue with incidence: a scoping review of reported medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) incidence around the globe [^ad74718b]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Summary of evidence

It is well documented that further evidence regarding MRONJ is required to support prevention, management and understanding of the natural course of this condition and facilitate evidence-based communication with patients regarding risk. Good quality data on MRONJ patients can be difficult to garner for multiple reasons. As MRONJ case numbers can be low, it is difficult to gather large amounts of data due to the sporadic presentation of these patients to clinicians. Additionally, patients often have large numbers of variables, such as multiple comorbidities, medications and complex needs, which can make the combination of data challenging. This scoping review was designed to mitigate some of these factors.

Although there is significant heterogeneity in study type, size, follow-up period and variables examined in the included studies, one of the strengths of this review is the inclusion of data from over a million participants across a large number of studies.

### Post-traumatic osteonecrosis of the proximal humerus [^8858f656]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic osteonecrosis of the proximal humerus represents a challenging problem to the surgeon. It is commonly seen following multi-fragmentary fractures of the proximal humerus which may affect the long-term functional recovery after such injuries. This review summarises the current evidence on risk factors, reasons why estimating its epidemiology is difficult, the vascular supply of the humeral head, classification, and management options.

### Current concepts on the pathogenesis and natural history of steroid-induced osteonecrosis [^f275ef92]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of non-traumatic osteonecrosis is more complex than that of traumatic osteonecrosis, and corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis presents the greatest challenge because of the multiple effects of corticosteroids on multi-system pathways; these pathways include the effects of corticosteroids on osteoblast differentiation, osteoblast and osteoclast apoptosis, lipid metabolism, coagulation pathways, and calcium metabolism. These pathways are frequently interrelated with each other, which makes the pathogenesis even more difficult to understand. Host factors and underlying disease have been shown to play a significant role in the risk of developing osteonecrosis, and our understanding of the pathogenesis must be able to explain why some patients are at greater risk than others. Identification of genetic variants that convey additional risk will also help to personalize the way we deliver care, both in the prevention and treatment of osteonecrosis. Further understanding of the intricate immunologic and genetic pathways contributing to osteonecrosis is at the forefront of research and may soon lead to viable and less invasive non-surgical therapeutic strategies.

### The issue with incidence: a scoping review of reported medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) incidence around the globe [^f84d01a6]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Within the included studies, the sampling technique, where specified, was largely systematic sampling between two time points to collect data on all cases meeting specific inclusion criteria. However, many studies were not explicit regarding the sampling approach, making it difficult to determine whether selection bias was potentially a cause for concern or not.

There was variation in the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the identified studies, as perhaps expected, given the variation in aims of individual studies; 31 studies (34%) did not provide explicit criteria. Additionally, it was noted that some studies (n=10; 10.8%) stated the exclusion of patients with dental infections or those requiring dental treatment/extractions. This was most common in clinical trials of oncology medications.

The duration of the follow-up period of included studies was unspecified in 35 studies (38%). Several included a follow-up period with a lower limit of <3 months (n=8); most studies, however, included a follow-up period of over 1 year (n=46; 52%) (see online supplemental table 1). It should be noted that the definition of follow-up period varied across studies and study designs. In some, follow-up referred to the duration of time on antiresorptive agents, particularly in observational studies. Others referred to the period of follow-up after the end of an experimental treatment period, typically in RCTs, particularly in some of the larger extension RCTs.

Results—characteristics of studies and evidence-based recommendations report that a total of 132 papers met the eligibility criteria—10 randomized controlled trials, 75 retrospective studies, and 47 prospective studies. Due to the limitations of the available evidence, the guideline relied on formal consensus for most recommendations, and the only two recommendations that were deemed evidence based by the Expert Panel were those for coordination of care to reduce the risk of MRONJ (Recommendation 2.1) and avoidance of elective dentoalveolar surgery during BMA therapy (Recommendation 2.3).
