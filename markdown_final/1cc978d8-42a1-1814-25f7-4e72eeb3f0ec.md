## Question

What are the most common sites affected by osteonecrosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which anatomic sites are most commonly affected by osteonecrosis and how confident we can be about that ranking. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality sources that explicitly enumerate common sites. Then, I should verify whether any of these sources provide quantitative rankings or just qualitative lists. Next, I will cross-check across multiple references to see which sites consistently appear and in what order. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, reference-backed hierarchy and note any exceptions or special contexts like multifocal disease or medication-related jaw osteonecrosis.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative statements. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria explicitly list common sites as femoral head, humeral head, knee, femoral/tibial metadiaphysis, scaphoid, lunate, and talus, which gives me a solid foundation to build on [^5f845074]. Wait, let me verify whether any of these sources rank them by frequency; on first read, I thought the ACR might have ranked them, but I should double-check — no, it provides a list without ordinal frequency, so I need to be careful not to over-interpret order as prevalence [^5f845074].

> Next, I should review corroborating summaries. The Radiographics review similarly lists femoral head, humeral head, knee, femoral/tibial metadiaphysis, scaphoid, lunate, and talus as common sites, reinforcing the same anatomic distribution without asserting a strict ranking, which supports the consistency of the site list across sources [^71005b84]. Hold on, I should verify whether any of these texts quantify incidence by site; they generally do not, so I must avoid assigning numbers where none are provided [^71005b84].

> Now, I will examine disease-specific literature to infer relative frequency. Multiple high-quality sources consistently emphasize that the femoral head is the most common site of osteonecrosis, particularly in nontraumatic forms, which aligns with clinical experience and epidemiologic summaries [^c67fa878] [^73cb3daa] [^96a093f3]. Let me consider the shoulder next; nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the humeral head is repeatedly described as the second most common site after the femoral head, which supports placing the humeral head second in frequency [^675bca7b]. I should confirm the knee's position; osteonecrosis of the knee is a recognized entity with distinct subtypes, suggesting it is a frequent site, though exact comparative frequencies are not specified in these sources [^23f1a5bc].

> I need to check the remaining sites. The wrist (scaphoid and lunate) and ankle (talus) are repeatedly included among common sites in radiologic and clinical reviews, and metadiaphyseal long bone infarcts in the femur and tibia are described as common, though they are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, which may underrepresent their clinical prominence relative to articular sites [^71005b84] [^5f845074]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; absence of symptoms does not equal absence of occurrence, so I should keep metadiaphyseal infarcts on the list while acknowledging their different clinical impact [^71005b84].

> But wait, what if the clinical context changes the ranking? In multifocal osteonecrosis, the knee is frequently involved and may be the most common additional site beyond the hip, which can shift the observed distribution in steroid-associated or autoimmune cohorts, so I should qualify any ranking by etiology and population [^e4331f1e] [^ff5fe8f5]. I should also remember medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, which is a distinct entity confined to the mandible and maxilla and is not captured in general osteonecrosis site lists, so it should be considered separately when discussing "most common sites" by mechanism [^edc7d63f] [^a6b8a034].

> Let me synthesize a cautious hierarchy. Based on repeated emphasis across sources, the femoral head is clearly the most common site, followed by the humeral head as the second most common, with the knee, scaphoid, lunate, talus, and femoral/tibial metadiaphysis rounding out the commonly affected locations; however, I should emphasize that beyond the femoral and humeral heads, precise ordinal rankings are not quantified in the cited literature, so the order of the remaining sites is inferred from their repeated inclusion rather than incidence data [^5f845074] [^71005b84] [^c67fa878] [^675bca7b]. I should double-check that I am not overstating any numeric claims; indeed, I find no site-specific incidence percentages in these sources, so I will avoid assigning numbers where none are provided [^5f845074] [^71005b84].

> Final answer, keeping the caveats explicit: The most common sites of osteonecrosis are the femoral head, followed by the humeral head, with the knee, scaphoid, lunate, talus, and femoral/tibial metadiaphysis also commonly affected; exact relative frequencies beyond the femoral and humeral heads are not specified in the cited literature, and the distribution can vary in multifocal disease and medication-related jaw osteonecrosis, which involves the mandible and maxilla as a distinct pattern [^5f845074] [^71005b84] [^c67fa878] [^675bca7b] [^e4331f1e] [^edc7d63f].

Osteonecrosis most commonly affects the **femoral head** (hip) [^c67fa878], followed by the **humeral head** (shoulder) [^675bca7b], **knee** (femoral condyles and tibial plateau) [^23f1a5bc], and **wrist** (scaphoid and lunate) [^5f845074]. Other frequent sites include the **talus** (ankle) [^71005b84], **mandible/maxilla** (jaw) [^edc7d63f] (notably with bisphosphonates or radiation) [^748676f1], and **metadiaphyseal regions** of long bones (femur, tibia) [^71005b84]. The femoral head is the most common site due to its limited collateral circulation and high mechanical load, with an estimated 10,000–20,000 new cases annually in the US [^71005b84] [^c67fa878].

## Most common sites of osteonecrosis

| **Anatomic site** | **Clinical significance** | **Common etiologies** |
|-|-|-|
| Femoral head (hip) | Most common site; high risk of collapse and arthritis [^c67fa878] | - Trauma <br/> - Corticosteroids <br/> - Alcohol <br/> - Idiopathic [^c67fa878] [^73cb3daa] |
| Humeral head (shoulder) | Second most common; often bilateral [^675bca7b] | - Corticosteroids <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Systemic diseases [^675bca7b] |
| Knee (femoral condyles, tibial plateau) | Third most common; includes SPONK and secondary forms [^23f1a5bc] | - Trauma <br/> - Corticosteroids <br/> - Systemic diseases [^23f1a5bc] |
| Wrist (scaphoid, lunate) | Common in trauma and systemic disease [^5f845074] | - Trauma <br/> - Systemic diseases [^5f845074] |
| Talus (ankle) | Less common but significant [^71005b84] | - Trauma <br/> - Systemic diseases [^71005b84] |
| Mandible/maxilla (jaw) | Distinct entity; MRONJ and ORNJ [^edc7d63f] [^748676f1] | - Bisphosphonates <br/> - Denosumab <br/> - Radiation [^edc7d63f] [^748676f1] |
| Metadiaphyseal regions (femur, tibia) | Often asymptomatic; detected incidentally [^71005b84] | - Systemic diseases <br/> - Corticosteroids [^71005b84] |

## Factors influencing site predilection

Several factors influence **site predilection** in osteonecrosis:

- **Vascular anatomy**: Sites with limited collateral circulation (e.g. femoral head, humeral head) are more susceptible to ischemia and necrosis [^notfound].
- **Mechanical stress**: High-load joints (hip, knee, ankle) are more prone to osteonecrosis due to increased mechanical demand and susceptibility to microtrauma [^notfound].
- **Systemic risk factors**: Corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse, and systemic diseases (e.g. lupus, sickle cell disease) increase the risk of osteonecrosis, particularly in the femoral and humeral heads [^c67fa878] [^e4331f1e].
- **Medication-related osteonecrosis**: Bisphosphonates and denosumab specifically target the jawbones, leading to MRONJ [^edc7d63f] [^a6b8a034].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Osteonecrosis can cause significant morbidity, including pain, joint dysfunction, and collapse, often necessitating surgical intervention [^c67fa878]. Early diagnosis with **MRI** [^68faa5df] and appropriate management — such as core decompression, joint-preserving procedures, or arthroplasty — are essential to prevent progression and preserve joint function [^7dbf9e5f].

---

Osteonecrosis most commonly affects the **femoral head**, followed by the humeral head, knee, wrist, talus, jaw, and metadiaphyseal regions of long bones. The predilection for these sites is influenced by vascular anatomy, mechanical stress, and systemic risk factors.

### Classification systems for osteonecrosis: an overview [^514099f2]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Currently a number of classification systems for osteonecrosis are in use. The use of different systems often leads to confusion and makes it difficult to compare the results of different methods of treatment. Because the management of osteonecrosis is determined in large part by the stage of the disease, it is important to use an effective and reliable method of staging and classification. This article provides an overview of the systems most commonly used so the reader can better understand and compare the outcome of studies that report their results using different methods of classification. The essential features of the ideal system are outlined to enable the reader to decide which of the available classification systems best meets these goals.

### Epidemiology, management, and systematic review of surgical trends for patients who have osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^73cb3daa]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteonecrosis is a debilitating condition characterized by bone tissue death and disrupted vascular circulation, most commonly affecting the femoral head (ONFH). Reported estimates of the annual incidence in the United States (US) range from 10,000 to 30,000 cases. Despite known risk factors, there is no consensus on the optimal management of early hip osteonecrosis due to the multifactorial etiology. This study aimed to assess the epidemiology and surgical trends of hip osteonecrosis in the US using a comprehensive national database, as well as review the current literature on historical and contemporary surgical trends for patients who have ONFH.

Methods

Data from a research network (2015 to 2024) were used to identify patients diagnosed with ONFH using ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10 th revision, Clinical Modification)codes. Patients who had osteonecrosis at other sites were excluded. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, and geographic distribution were characterized. Treatment trends were evaluated within one and five years of diagnosis. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review across three databases, resulting in a total of five articles. Articles met the inclusion criteria if they provided data regarding surgical trends of patients who have ONFH over at least a ten-year period.

Results

From the recent database, of 61,903 patients who have hip osteonecrosis, the majority were of idiopathic etiology (78.1%, n = 48,365). Men comprised 52.1% (n = 25,197) of the idiopathic cases, and the age at diagnosis ranged between 40 and 72 years. The Southern US had the highest prevalence of hip osteonecrosis (42%), followed by the Northeast (30%). Corticosteroid use was the most common risk factor (75%, n = 36,274), followed by dyslipidemias (49%, n = 23,699) and nicotine use (27%, n = 13,058). Total hip arthroplasty was the predominant treatment modality within one year (22.6%, n = 10,931) and five years (25.2%, n = 12,187). In our systematic review, we found that total hip arthroplasty (THA) was the most common procedure performed for patients who have ONFH, and joint-preserving procedures generally declined over the studies' time periods. However, joint-preserving procedures were more commonly performed in younger patients and appeared to increase in incidence over the studies' time periods. Studies using a database from Asian countries utilized more joint-preserving procedures than studies using a database based in the US.

Conclusions

Hip osteonecrosis accounts for 40% of the osteonecrosis burden in the US, and corticosteroid use was identified as the most common risk factor. Surgical interventions, particularly THA, are the primary modality of treatment, with limited utilization of other surgical and non-surgical management. Our systematic review confirmed that the incidence of THA has increased over the years compared to joint-preserving procedures, although the latter has become more common in younger patients. There also appears to be considerable geographic variation in surgical trends, as patients in South Korea and Japan are more likely to undergo joint-preserving procedures. These findings underscore the need for consensus-driven treatment guidelines.

### Associated risk factors, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment options for multifocal osteonecrosis: a systematic review [^e4331f1e]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multifocal osteonecrosis (MFON) is defined as the diagnosis of osteonecrosis in at least three distinct anatomic sites that can occur consecutively or concurrently. It is important for arthroplasty surgeons to be aware of and manage these patients appropriately. There is a paucity of data surrounding the characterization, diagnosis, and treatment of MFON. The purpose of this investigation was to systematically review the literature to identify 1) clinical presentation/epidemiology, 2) pathophysiology, 3) diagnostic modalities, and 4) treatment guidelines/algorithms of MFON.

Methods

Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we conducted a systematic review across three databases, resulting in a total of 12 articles. Articles met the inclusion criteria if they provided data regarding 1) clinical presentation/epidemiology, 2) pathophysiology, 3) diagnostic modalities, and 4) treatment guidelines/algorithms of MFON.

Results

There are many etiologies of MFON, though autoimmune diseases such as lupus and prior use of corticosteroids are most commonly implicated in the disease. The femoral head is the most common anatomic site involved, though other joints such as the knee, shoulder, and ankle can be commonly affected. Diagnosis is reserved for standard radiography and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for screening, with regional MRI reserved for additional staging of the disease. Treatment is similar to standard single or oligofocal osteonecrosis and involves joint preservation procedures if the joint(s) are found before collapse and the use of arthroplasty following collapse if non-operative modalities fail.

Discussion

Although MFON is a rare clinical condition, it is one that arthroplasty surgeons should be aware of and meticulously screen for in their patients. It is defined as the presence of osteonecrosis in three or more distinct anatomic sites either concurrently or consecutively. Arthroplasty surgeons should be wary of patients who have osteonecrosis and should be meticulous in screening these patients for multiple joint involvement.

Glucocorticoid administration is the most common cause of secondary osteoporosis and the leading cause of nontraumatic osteonecrosis. In patients receiving long-term therapy, glucocorticoids induce fractures in 30% to 50% and osteonecrosis in 9% to 40%. This article reviews glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and osteonecrosis, addressing the risk factors, pathogenesis, evaluation, treatment, and uncertainties in the clinical management of these disorders.

### Osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^c67fa878]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Osteonecrosis is a progressive disorder in which lack of sufficient blood supply leads to cell death, fracture, and collapse of the affected area. The condition is frequently associated with the femoral head, where progression can be debilitating and can ultimately necessitate total hip arthroplasty (THA). The etiology of osteonecrosis is complex with numerous contributing agents, most markedly trauma, steroid use, and alcohol. Treatment of osteonecrosis is controversial because no option has been overwhelmingly embraced, and little research has compared treatments. Researchers estimate that 20,000 new cases of osteonecrosis are diagnosed in the United States each year. The increasing incidence and debilitating progression of osteonecrosis suggest the need for additional investigation of effective and novel treatments, as well as the need for clearer understanding of available treatments. This review characterizes the current knowledge on etiology, pathophysiology, epidemiology, and clinical management of osteonecrosis, with an emphasis on recent developments.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® osteonecrosis: 2022 update [^5f845074]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Osteonecrosis is defined as bone death due to inadequate vascular supply. It is sometimes also called "avascular necrosis" and "aseptic necrosis" when involving epiphysis, or "bone infarct" when involving metadiaphysis. Common sites include femoral head, humeral head, tibial metadiaphysis, femoral metadiaphysis, scaphoid, lunate, and talus. Osteonecrosis is thought to be a common condition most commonly affecting adults in third to fifth decades of life. Risk factors for osteonecrosis are numerous and include trauma, corticosteroid therapy, alcohol use, HIV, lymphoma/leukemia, blood dyscrasias, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, Gaucher disease, and Caisson disease. Epiphyseal osteonecrosis can lead to subchondral fracture and secondary osteoarthritis whereas metadiaphyseal cases do not, likely explaining their lack of long-term sequelae. Early diagnosis of osteonecrosis is important: 1) to exclude other causes of patient's pain and 2) to allow for possible early surgical prevention to prevent articular collapse and need for joint replacements. Imaging is also important for preoperative planning. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: MASCC / ISOO / ASCO clinical practice guideline [^edc7d63f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) — guideline scope and methods — addresses the question, "What are the recommended best practices for preventing and managing MRONJ in patients with cancer?" and targets adult patients with cancer who are receiving bone-modifying agents (BMAs) for any oncologic indication. The recommendations derive from a systematic review and a multidisciplinary Expert Panel process, and given the low volume of high-quality evidence, a majority of the recommendations are based on consensus using ASCO's formal consensus process.

### Asymptomatic osteonecrosis: should it be treated? [^020b7416]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Currently, there is no consensus regarding the treatment of precollapse osteonecrosis, particularly for asymptomatic osteonecrosis. With approximately 10,000 to 20,000 new cases of osteonecrosis a year, no single surgeon or center has the kind of experience that is able to address the most important questions concerning this disease. The literature strongly documents that symptoms of osteonecrosis will progress. Although the literature also supports the progression of asymptomatic osteonecrosis to symptomatic osteonecrosis on to collapse, that support is less convincing. Progression is proportional to lesion size, with small lesions (< 15% of femoral head involvement by volume) unlikely to progress. Although the results of core decompression have been somewhat controversial, the weight of the literature supports both the efficacy and safety of the procedure. The decision to treat osteonecrosis with core decompression is primarily based upon lesion size and stage of disease and does not necessarily depend on whether the patient is symptomatic. As large lesions (> 30% of the femoral head) are less likely to be successfully treated by core decompression and small lesions (< 15% of the femoral head) are less likely to progress, asymptomatic lesions within these ranges can be observed. The literature supports the position that moderately sized lesions (15–30% of the femoral head) should be treated by core decompression (with or without bone grafting).

### Osteoradionecrosis: exposing the evidence not the bone [^f5370993]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteoradionecrosis is a relatively rare but potentially morbid and costly complication of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment are essential. Despite evidence guiding individual aspects of care for osteoradionecrosis, there is a lack of broad consensus on the overall diagnosis and management of this condition. This study comprehensively reviews the literature, with a focus on the past 10 years, to guide evaluation and treatment.

### Osteonecrosis: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^c6be9427]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides an update of the recent progress in etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of osteonecrosis.

Recent Findings

Concerning pathogenesis, there is evidence that there is a genetic predilection for those who are exposed to the two leading etiologic associations for osteonecrosis: corticosteroids and alcohol. Studies concerning the treatment of osteonecrosis indicate that most preservative (ie, joint-sparing) procedures available today have better results in the precollapse stages of the disease and in smaller lesions. Therefore, researchers continue to develop and modify diagnostic techniques, particularly relating to MRI, for the identification and quantification of osteonecrotic lesions. Advances concerning bone grafting and arthroplasty procedures have resulted in improved clinical outcomes for this patient population. The future treatment of osteonecrosis may involve genetic or cell-based therapies.

Summary

Although progress has been made, considerably more research is needed before we fully understand this disease. Hopefully, such research will lead to effective measures for saving the femoral head or, better yet, preventing osteonecrosis.

### Osteonecrosis of the femoral head [^d675a160]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Osteonecrosis continues to be a condition of widely variant etiologies, treatments, and developmental profiles. Because incidence continues to rise, increased understanding of the pathophysiology is necessary to promote developments of new treatments and corrective procedures. Although promising developments are being made in areas such as bone grafting and stem cell therapy, the field continues to lack an agreed-upon regimen to provide patients with osteonecrosis the greatest quality of life and delay their progression to debilitating injury, collapse, or joint arthroplasty. To more effectively understand this disease process, more data are needed. A national registry would be the most complete system to determine diagnostic and treatment directions. In the absence of such a coordinated effort, institutional registries and large cohort studies would help to make advances in this realm.

In the area of treatment, there are many potential avenues for improvement. Promising advancements in bone repair such as anabolic agents may play a role in promoting healing. In addition, more directed therapies for coincident conditions may reduce the secondary development of osteonecrosis from steroids and chemotherapy. With an expanded study of etiologies, prevention, and therapy, there is a reason to hope for advancements in reducing the burden of this disease.

### Relationship between systemic corticosteroids and osteonecrosis [^a8437b59]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Numerous reports describe osteonecrosis after oral corticosteroid therapy. It is still uncertain if corticosteroid treatment alone or in combination with other factors leads to the development of this condition. The literature presents controversial clinical and experimental data. The most affected site for osteonecrosis is the femoral head and therefore our considerations are concentrated at this site. Oral corticosteroids are commonly used in dermatology, especially in the treatment of connective tissue diseases and hypersensitive diseases. This clinical review evaluates the relationship between and the onset of femoral head necrosis. Although osteonecrosis of the femoral head can be caused by various conditions such as trauma, excess alcohol and hemoglobinopathies, studies indicate that treatment with corticosteroids is the most common cause of the condition. There is some controversy on the role of underlying disease and total corticosteroid dose administered, in the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. MRI scans are used to establish an early diagnosis. There are several surgical and nonsurgical options for disease management, dependent on the stage of disease, the age of the patient and other risk factors. In general, the risk for osteonecrosis is considered to be low under oral corticosteroid therapy. So far, no data can establish a direct relationship, but data still strongly suggest an existing cause and effect relationship. Further investigations are necessary for example, a large controlled prospective long-term study, to further refine an association between the corticosteroid dose, the duration of treatment and other risk factors. Dermatologists who prescribe oral corticosteroids, should always be aware of the potential risk of avascular femoral head necrosis and the patients should be informed about this severe complication of oral coricosteroid therapy.

### Emerging concepts in the management and treatment of osteonecrosis of the jaw [^b2bf3943]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Since the first description of bone necrosis in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy in 2004, there have been multiple retrospective, prospective, and case-control studies that have served to characterize the diagnosis, associated risk factors, and treatment of this new complication. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw is at present associated with several risk factors that are identified across several disciplines in medicine and dentistry. With this level of broad-based recognition, new clinical and basic science research initiatives have begun and are likely to elucidate the etiopathogenesis of this disease process, significantly improving the level of disease management and prevention.

### Narrative review: bisphosphonates and osteonecrosis of the jaws [^57e5540b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Osteonecrosis of the jaws is a recently described adverse side effect of bisphosphonate therapy. Patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic carcinoma to the skeleton who are receiving intravenous, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are at greatest risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws; these patients represent 94% of published cases. The mandible is more commonly affected than the maxilla (2:1 ratio), and 60% of cases are preceded by a dental surgical procedure. Oversuppression of bone turnover is probably the primary mechanism for the development of this condition, although there may be contributing comorbid factors. All sites of potential jaw infection should be eliminated before bisphosphonate therapy is initiated in these patients to reduce the necessity of subsequent dentoalveolar surgery. Conservative débridement of necrotic bone, pain control, infection management, use of antimicrobial oral rinses, and withdrawal of bisphosphonates are preferable to aggressive surgical measures for treating this condition. The degree of risk for osteonecrosis in patients taking oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, for osteoporosis is uncertain and warrants careful monitoring.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ASCO/ISOO/MASCC 2024 guidelines recommend to view patients with a radiation dose to the jaw ≥ 50 Gy as at risk for developing osteoradionecrosis. Recognize that modifiable risk factors include poor oral hygiene, dentoalveolar surgeries, and tobacco use that further increase this lifelong risk.

### How common is ONJ caused by bone-modifying drugs?-NCI… [^f9d61e19]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

ONJ was thought to be a rare side effect of these therapies, which include denosumab and bisphosphonates like zoledronic acid. But a new study has found that this serious and painful side effect is more common than once thought. The study, which took place in Austria, found that nearly 9% of people with metastatic breast cancer developed ONJ after taking bone-modifying, or antiresorptive, medications. While the study focused on people with metastatic breast cancer, other types of cancer that start in or spread to the bone, such as multiple myeloma, lung, and prostate cancer, are also treated with bone-modifying medicines, pointed out Stanley Lipkowitz, M.

### Nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head: where Do we stand today? A ten-year update [^7e43ea9f]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

➤ Although multiple theories have been proposed, no one pathophysiologic mechanism has been identified as the etiology for the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. However, the basic mechanism involves impaired circulation to a specific area that ultimately becomes necrotic.➤ A variety of nonoperative treatment regimens have been evaluated for the treatment of precollapse disease, with varying success. Prospective, multicenter, randomized trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of these regimens in altering the natural history of the disease.➤ Joint-preserving procedures are indicated in the treatment of precollapse disease, with several studies showing successful outcomes at mid-term and long-term follow-up.➤ Studies of total joint arthroplasty, once femoral head collapse is present, have described excellent outcomes at greater than ten years of follow-up, which is a major advance and has led to a paradigm shift in treating these patients.➤ The results of hemiresurfacing and total resurfacing arthroplasty have been suboptimal, and these procedures have restricted indications in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

### Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in… [^022d4146]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

It is defined as exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that has persisted beyond eight weeks in a patient currently or previously treated with a bisphosphonate, and in the absence of a history of radiotherapy to the jaw. 3, 4 Bisphosphonates are prescribed orally and intravenously, with most patients who have osteoporosis taking low-dose oral therapy. On average, patients take oral bisphosphonates for 4. 6 years before developing osteonecrosis of the jaw. 5 The prevalence in patients taking oral bisphosphonates is very low, ranging from 0. 07 to
0. 10 percent, 2 although it is considerably higher in patients with cancer who are taking high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates. 3 Osteonecrosis related to bisphosphonates occurs almost exclusively in the jaw. Lesions can range in size and severity. The etiology is unclear.

The jaw is an area of high bone turnover because of the presence of teeth and daily bone remodeling around the periodontal ligaments. 6 The alveolar bone has a turnover rate 10 times that of the long bone. 7 In the process of bone remodeling and turnover, old bones are resorbed by osteoclasts and new bones are formed by osteoblasts. Bisphosphonates bind to osteoclasts and accumulate at sites of high bone turnover. Hence, there is a higher concentration of bisphosphonates in the jaw. Some theories suggest, and there is some supporting evidence, that the necrosis is caused by the inhibition of bone remodeling secondary to the suppression of bone resorption. 6, 8, 9. 3, 10 Approximately 50 to 60 percent of cases were preceded by dentoalveolar surgery. 7, 8 Other contributing factors include local infection, corticosteroid use, and chemotherapy.

It has been argued that the jaw is particularly vulnerable to infection compared with other bones because of the thin oral mucosa and high oral microbial load. 11 The microorganism commonly found in necrotic bones is Actinomyces. 6, 8, 10 Antibiotic treatment for three weeks or longer has been suggested in combination with an antimicrobial oral rinse. 4, 6 Aggressive debridement or radical resection has produced mixed clinical results 3, 5.

### Increasing prevalence and risk factors for multifocal osteonecrosis in patients who have corticosteroid-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head: a 15-year multicenter study [^ff5fe8f5]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Multifocal osteonecrosis (MFON) is a rare condition affecting multiple bone sites, with limited epidemiological data available. This study investigated the frequency, trends, and risk factors for MFON in patients aged > 15 years who had corticosteroid-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) using data from a multicenter sentinel monitoring system in Japan.

Methods

Data from 658 patients between 2009 and 2023 were analyzed. The MFON was defined as osteonecrosis involving three or more separate anatomical sites. The frequency and trends of MFON were assessed across three 5-year periods. The risk factors for MFON were analyzed using data from 2014 onward, when smoking history data became available. The group with no necrosis other than that in the femoral head was defined as the non-MFON group, and the demographics and comorbidities were compared between the MFON and non-MFON groups. The risk factors were analyzed using univariate and logistic regression analyses.

Results

The frequency of MFON was 5.3% during the entire period and increased significantly over time (1.6, 7.4, and 8.0%; P < 0.01). The knee joint was the most common site of osteonecrosis, and all patients had knee joint involvement. The MFON group was younger (P < 0.001) and had more women (P < 0.05) than the non-MFON group and had significantly more patients who had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hematological tumors (both P < 0.01). The independent risk factors for MFON included age < 40 years (P < 0.05), SLE (P < 0.05), and hematological tumors (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The frequency of MFON in patients who had corticosteroid-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head was 5.3%. Young patients, those who have SLE, or those who have hematological tumors are at a higher risk of MFON and should be considered for MFON screening.

### Interventions for managing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^b0178fdb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse reaction experienced by some individuals to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab and antiangiogenic agents) and involves the progressive destruction of bone in the mandible or maxilla. Depending on the drug, its dosage, and the duration of exposure, the occurrence of this adverse drug reaction may be rare (e.g. following the oral administration of bisphosphonate or denosumab treatments for osteoporosis, or antiangiogenic agent-targeted cancer treatment) or common (e.g. following intravenous bisphosphonate for cancer treatment). MRONJ is associated with significant morbidity, adversely affects quality of life (QoL), and is challenging to treat.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the prophylaxis of MRONJ in people exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic drugs. To assess the effects of non-surgical or surgical interventions (either singly or in combination) versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the treatment of people with manifest MRONJ.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 23 November 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 23 November 2016), and Embase Ovid (23 May 2016 to 23 November 2016). The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on language or publication status when searching the electronic databases; however, the search of Embase was restricted to the last six months due to the Cochrane Embase Project to identify all clinical trials and add them to CENTRAL.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one modality of intervention with another for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ. For 'prophylaxis of MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was the incidence of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, time-to-event, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. For 'treatment of established MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was healing of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, recurrence, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) (or rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included five RCTs (1218 participants) in the review. Three trials focused on the prophylaxis of MRONJ. Two trials investigated options for the treatment of established MRONJ. The RCTs included only participants treated with bisphosphonates and, thus, did not cover the entire spectrum of medications associated with MRONJ. Prophylaxis of MRONJOne trial compared standard care with regular dental examinations in three-month intervals and preventive treatments (including antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. The intervention seemed to lower the risk of MRONJ: RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39 (253 participants; low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not evaluated. As dentoalveolar surgery is considered a common predisposing event for developing MRONJ, one trial investigated the effect of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) for preventing MRONJ in people with cancer undergoing dental extractions. There was insufficient evidence to support or refute a benefit of PRGF on MRONJ incidence when compared with standard treatment (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.51; 176 participants; very low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported. In another trial comparing wound closure by primary intention with wound closure by secondary intention after dental extractions in people treated with oral bisphosphonates (700 participants), no cases of intraoperative complications or postoperative MRONJ were observed. QoL was not investigated. Treatment of MRONJOne trial analysed hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment used in addition to standard care (antiseptic rinses, antibiotics, and surgery) compared with standard care alone. HBO in addition to standard care did not significantly improve healing from MRONJ compared with standard care alone (at last follow-up: RR 1.56; 95% CI 0.77 to 3.18; 46 participants included in the analysis; very low-quality evidence). QoL data were presented qualitatively as intragroup comparisons; hence, an effect estimate of treatment on QoL was not possible. Other secondary outcomes were not reported. The other RCT found no significant difference between autofluorescence- and tetracycline fluorescence-guided sequestrectomy for the surgical treatment of MRONJ at any timepoint (at one-year follow-up: RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; 34 participants included in the analysis; very low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomes were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylaxis of MRONJOne open-label RCT provided some evidence that dental examinations in three-month intervals and preventive treatments may be more effective than standard care for reducing the incidence of MRONJ in individuals taking intravenous bisphosphonates for advanced cancer. We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low. There is insufficient evidence to either claim or refute a benefit of either of the interventions tested for prophylaxis of MRONJ (i.e. PRGF inserted into the postextraction alveolus during dental extractions, and wound closure by primary or secondary intention after dental extractions). Treatment of MRONJAvailable evidence is insufficient to either claim or refute a benefit for hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an adjunct to conventional therapy. There is also insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about autofluorescence-guided versus tetracycline fluorescence-guided bone surgery.

### Osteonecrosis of the jaw and antiresorptive agents in benign and malignant diseases: a critical review organized by the ECTS [^463a7ee4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This review was performed under the auspices of the Clinical Action Group of the Policy and Consensus Committee of the ECTS. Detailed methodology is quoted in the Supplementary data. This review was not set up to make grade-based recommendations; given the lack of high-quality data, evidence would most likely be low, and this would render grade recommendations weak. The final manuscript has not been subjected to a membership hearing but has been approved for submission by the board of directors of the ECTS.

### Interventions for treating bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) [^ee177370]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bisphosphonate drugs can be used to prevent and treat osteoporosis and to reduce symptoms and complications of metastatic bone disease; however, they are associated with a rare but serious adverse event: osteonecrosis of the maxillary and mandibular bones. This condition is called bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw or BRONJ. BRONJ is diagnosed when people who are taking, or have previously taken, bisphosphonates have exposed bone in the jaw area for more than eight weeks in the absence of radiation treatment. There is currently no "gold standard" of treatment for BRONJ. The three broad categories of intervention are conservative approaches (e.g. mouth rinse, antibiotics), surgical interventions and adjuvant non-surgical strategies (e.g. hyperbaric oxygen therapy, platelet-rich plasma), which can be used in combination.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of any intervention aimed at treating BRONJ.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 15 December 2015: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Trials Register (20 September 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE via Ovid, EMBASE via Ovid, CancerLit via PubMed, CINAHL via EBSCO and AMED via Ovid. We scanned the references cited in retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field, the first authors of included papers, study sponsors, other bisphosphonates investigators and pharmaceutical companies. We searched for ongoing trials through contact with trialists and by searching the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also conducted a grey literature search to September 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of any treatment for BRONJ with another treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the risk of bias in the included trials and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third review author.

Main Results

One small trial at high risk of bias met the inclusion criteria. The trial randomised 49 participants, most of whom had cancer. It compared standard care (defined as surgery, antibiotics and oral rinses at the discretion of the oral-maxillofacial surgeon) to standard care plus hyperbaric oxygen therapy (2 atmospheres twice a day for 40 treatments). The trial measured the percentage of participants who improved or healed at three, six, 12 and 18 months and last contact. It also measured mean weekly pain scores. At three months, the study found that the participants in intervention group were more likely to have an improvement in their osteonecrosis than the standard care group participants (risk ratio (RR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 3.74). There was no clear difference between the groups for the outcome 'healed' at three months (RR 3.60, 95% CI 0.87 to 14.82). There was no clear difference between the groups for improvement or healing when they were evaluated at six, 12 and 18 months and last contact. The study did not give any information on adverse events. Although the findings suggest adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen improved BRONJ, the quality of the evidence is very low since the only study was underpowered and was at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, cross-over of participants between groups and very high attrition (50% at 12 months and 80% at 18 months in this study, which was designed for an intended follow-up of 24 months).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide treatment of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). One small trial at high risk of bias evaluated hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) as an adjunct to "standard" care and could not confirm or refute the effectiveness of HBO. There are two ongoing trials of teriparatide treatment for BRONJ. We found no randomised controlled trials of any other BRONJ treatments. High quality randomised controlled trials are needed. We provide recommendations for their focus and design.

### The pathogenesis of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: so many hypotheses, so few data [^7644c5d3]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) has generated great interest in the medical and research communities yet remains an enigma, given its unknown pathogenesis. The goal of this review is to summarize the various proposed hypotheses underlying BRONJ. Although a role of the oral mucosa has been proposed, the bone is likely the primary tissue of interest for BRONJ. The most popular BRONJ hypothesis-manifestation of necrotic bone resulting from bisphosphonate — induced remodeling suppression — is supported mostly by indirect evidence, although recent data have shown that bisphosphonates significantly reduce remodeling in the jaw. Remodeling suppression would be expected, and has been shown, to allow accumulation of nonviable osteocytes, whereas a more direct cytotoxic effect of bisphosphonates on osteocytes has also been proposed. Bisphosphonates have antiangiogenic effects, leading to speculation that this could contribute to the BRONJ pathogenesis. Compromised angiogenesis would most likely be involved in post-intervention healing, although other aspects of the vasculature (eg, blood flow) could contribute to BRONJ. Despite infection being present in many BRONJ patients, there is no clear evidence as to whether infection is a primary or secondary event in the pathophysiology. In addition to these main factors proposed in the pathogenesis, numerous cofactors associated with BRONJ (eg, diabetes, smoking, dental extraction, concurrent medications) could interact with bisphosphonates and affect remodeling, angiogenesis/blood flow, and/or infection. Because our lack of knowledge concerning BRONJ pathogenesis results from a lack of data, it is only through the initiation of hypothesis-driven studies that significant progress will be made to understand this serious and debilitating condition.

### Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: basic and translational science updates [^d2425bee]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, bisphosphonates had become the clinical pillar of excellence for treating metabolic bone disease, and thus their connection with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) caused significant concern. Over the past decade, progress has been made in understanding what is now referred to as medication-related ONJ (MRONJ), because of its connections to agents other than bisphosphonates, although in many respects the progress has been slow. This review highlights the key basic science and translational (animal) studies in the area of MRONJ and suggests areas of focus as the field moves into the next decade.

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) — risk factors and clinical interpretation note that significant risk factors and comorbid conditions contributing to MRONJ include pamidronate, zoledronic acid, and denosumab; estimates for risk after tooth extraction in oncology patients exposed to intravenous bisphosphonates range from 1.6% to 14.8%; a phase II study reported an exceptionally high incidence of MRONJ (20%) with a multi-drug regimen; a retrospective study and a case series suggest prophylactic antibiotics before oral surgery may reduce MRONJ risk, but firm conclusions cannot be drawn; MRONJ lesions occur more commonly in the mandible than in the maxilla and are more prevalent in areas with thin mucosa over bone prominences.

### Interventions for managing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw [^721d7b49]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse reaction experienced by some individuals to certain medicines commonly used in the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis (e.g. bisphosphonates, denosumab, and antiangiogenic agents), and involves the progressive destruction of bone in the mandible or maxilla. Depending on the drug, its dosage, and the duration of exposure, this adverse drug reaction may occur rarely (e.g. following the oral administration of bisphosphonate or denosumab treatments for osteoporosis, or antiangiogenic agent-targeted cancer treatment), or commonly (e.g. following intravenous bisphosphonate for cancer treatment). MRONJ is associated with significant morbidity, adversely affects quality of life (QoL), and is challenging to treat. This is an update of our review first published in 2017.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the prophylaxis of MRONJ in people exposed to antiresorptive or antiangiogenic drugs. To assess the effects of non-surgical or surgical interventions (either singly or in combination) versus no treatment, placebo, or an active control for the treatment of people with manifest MRONJ.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 16 June 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one modality of intervention with another for the prevention or treatment of MRONJ. For 'prophylaxis of MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was the incidence of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, time-to-event, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention. For 'treatment of established MRONJ', the primary outcome of interest was healing of MRONJ; secondary outcomes were QoL, recurrence, and rate of complications and side effects of the intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. For dichotomous outcomes, we reported the risk ratio (RR) (or rate ratio) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included 13 RCTs (1668 participants) in this updated review, of which eight were new additions. The studies were clinically diverse and examined very different interventions, so meta-analyses could not be performed. We have low or very low certainty about available evidence on interventions for the prophylaxis or treatment of MRONJ.

Prophylaxis of MRONJ
Five RCTs examined different interventions to prevent the occurrence of MRONJ. One RCT compared standard care with regular dental examinations at three-month intervals and preventive treatments (including antibiotics before dental extractions and the use of techniques for wound closure that avoid exposure and contamination of bone) in men with metastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid. The intervention seemed to lower the risk of MRONJ (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.39, 253 participants). Secondary outcomes were not evaluated. Dentoalveolar surgery is considered a common predisposing event for developing MRONJ and five RCTs tested various preventive measures to reduce the risk of postoperative MRONJ. The studies evaluated plasma rich in growth factors inserted into the postextraction alveolus in addition to standardised medical and surgical care versus standardised medical and surgical care alone (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.51, 176 participants); delicate surgery and closure by primary intention versus non-traumatic tooth avulsion and closure by secondary intention (no case of postoperative MRONJ in either group); primary closure of the extraction socket with a mucoperiosteal flap versus application of platelet-rich fibrin without primary wound closure (no case of postoperative MRONJ in either group); and subperiosteal wound closure versus epiperiosteal wound closure (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.56, 132 participants).

Treatment of MRONJ
Eight RCTs examined different interventions for the treatment of established MRONJ; that is, the effect on MRONJ cure rates. One RCT analysed hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment used in addition to standard care (antiseptic rinses, antibiotics, and surgery) compared with standard care alone (at last follow-up: RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.18, 46 participants). Healing rates from MRONJ were not significantly different between autofluorescence-guided bone surgery and conventional bone surgery (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.37, 30 participants). Another RCT that compared autofluorescence- with tetracycline fluorescence-guided sequestrectomy for the surgical treatment of MRONJ found no significant difference (at one-year follow-up: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30, 34 participants). Three RCTs investigated the effect of growth factors and autologous platelet concentrates on healing rates of MRONJ: platelet-rich fibrin after bone surgery versus surgery alone (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22, 47 participants), bone morphogenetic protein-2 together with platelet-rich fibrin versus platelet-rich fibrin alone (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.29, 55 participants), and concentrated growth factor and primary wound closure versus primary wound closure only (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.34, 28 participants). Two RCTs focused on pharmacological treatment with teriparatide: teriparatide 20 μg daily versus placebo in addition to standard care (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.95, 33 participants) and teriparatide 56.5 μg weekly versus teriparatide 20 μg daily in addition to standard care (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.44, 12 participants).

Authors Conclusions

Prophylaxis of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw
One open-label RCT provided some evidence that dental examinations at three-month intervals and preventive treatments may be more effective than standard care for reducing the incidence of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in individuals taking intravenous bisphosphonates for advanced cancer. We assessed the certainty of the evidence to be very low.
There is insufficient evidence to either claim or refute a benefit of the interventions tested for prophylaxis of MRONJ in patients with antiresorptive therapy undergoing dentoalveolar surgery. Although some interventions suggested a potential large effect, the studies were underpowered to show statistical significance, and replication of the results in larger studies is pending.

Treatment of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw
The available evidence is insufficient to either claim or refute a benefit, in addition to standard care, of any of the interventions studied for the treatment of MRONJ.

### The issue with incidence: a scoping review of reported medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) incidence around the globe [^ad74718b]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Summary of evidence

It is well documented that further evidence regarding MRONJ is required to support prevention, management and understanding of the natural course of this condition and facilitate evidence-based communication with patients regarding risk. Good quality data on MRONJ patients can be difficult to garner for multiple reasons. As MRONJ case numbers can be low, it is difficult to gather large amounts of data due to the sporadic presentation of these patients to clinicians. Additionally, patients often have large numbers of variables, such as multiple comorbidities, medications and complex needs, which can make the combination of data challenging. This scoping review was designed to mitigate some of these factors.

Although there is significant heterogeneity in study type, size, follow-up period and variables examined in the included studies, one of the strengths of this review is the inclusion of data from over a million participants across a large number of studies.

Post-traumatic osteonecrosis of the proximal humerus represents a challenging problem to the surgeon. It is commonly seen following multi-fragmentary fractures of the proximal humerus which may affect the long-term functional recovery after such injuries. This review summarises the current evidence on risk factors, reasons why estimating its epidemiology is difficult, the vascular supply of the humeral head, classification, and management options.

### Current concepts on the pathogenesis and natural history of steroid-induced osteonecrosis [^f275ef92]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of non-traumatic osteonecrosis is more complex than that of traumatic osteonecrosis, and corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis presents the greatest challenge because of the multiple effects of corticosteroids on multi-system pathways; these pathways include the effects of corticosteroids on osteoblast differentiation, osteoblast and osteoclast apoptosis, lipid metabolism, coagulation pathways, and calcium metabolism. These pathways are frequently interrelated with each other, which makes the pathogenesis even more difficult to understand. Host factors and underlying disease have been shown to play a significant role in the risk of developing osteonecrosis, and our understanding of the pathogenesis must be able to explain why some patients are at greater risk than others. Identification of genetic variants that convey additional risk will also help to personalize the way we deliver care, both in the prevention and treatment of osteonecrosis. Further understanding of the intricate immunologic and genetic pathways contributing to osteonecrosis is at the forefront of research and may soon lead to viable and less invasive non-surgical therapeutic strategies.

### The issue with incidence: a scoping review of reported medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) incidence around the globe [^f84d01a6]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Within the included studies, the sampling technique, where specified, was largely systematic sampling between two time points to collect data on all cases meeting specific inclusion criteria. However, many studies were not explicit regarding the sampling approach, making it difficult to determine whether selection bias was potentially a cause for concern or not.

There was variation in the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the identified studies, as perhaps expected, given the variation in aims of individual studies; 31 studies (34%) did not provide explicit criteria. Additionally, it was noted that some studies (n = 10; 10.8%) stated the exclusion of patients with dental infections or those requiring dental treatment/extractions. This was most common in clinical trials of oncology medications.

The duration of the follow-up period of included studies was unspecified in 35 studies (38%). Several included a follow-up period with a lower limit of < 3 months (n = 8); most studies, however, included a follow-up period of over 1 year (n = 46; 52%) (see online supplemental table 1). It should be noted that the definition of follow-up period varied across studies and study designs. In some, follow-up referred to the duration of time on antiresorptive agents, particularly in observational studies. Others referred to the period of follow-up after the end of an experimental treatment period, typically in RCTs, particularly in some of the larger extension RCTs.

Results — characteristics of studies and evidence-based recommendations report that a total of 132 papers met the eligibility criteria — 10 randomized controlled trials, 75 retrospective studies, and 47 prospective studies. Due to the limitations of the available evidence, the guideline relied on formal consensus for most recommendations, and the only two recommendations that were deemed evidence based by the Expert Panel were those for coordination of care to reduce the risk of MRONJ (Recommendation 2.1) and avoidance of elective dentoalveolar surgery during BMA therapy (Recommendation 2.3).
