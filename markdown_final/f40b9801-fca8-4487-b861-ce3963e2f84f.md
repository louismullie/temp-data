## Question

whats is the guideline directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), including the four foundational classes, dosing targets, sequencing, titration cadence, special populations, and implementation strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current definition of HFrEF and the overarching goals of therapy. Then, I should verify the four foundational medication classes and their evidence base. Next, I will review target doses and titration intervals, followed by sequencing strategies and the timing of optimization. After that, I need to check special populations and secondary therapies. Finally, I will examine implementation gaps and practical solutions, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with contemporary guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical context. HFrEF is defined as LVEF ≤ 40% in the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline, and the primary goals of GDMT are to reduce mortality, reduce HF hospitalizations, improve symptoms and functional status, and slow disease progression, which justifies early, aggressive, and concurrent initiation of foundational therapies when feasible [^116XNrcD] [^114bS3nc] [^1177sF5r].

> I will now examine the four foundational classes. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify that each class has robust mortality benefit and contemporary endorsement. The 2022 guideline codifies quadruple therapy comprising an ARNI (preferred over ACEi/ARB when feasible), an evidence-based beta-blocker, an MRA, and an SGLT2 inhibitor, with diuretics used as needed for congestion, and this framework is reinforced by the 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway emphasizing rapid implementation of all four classes [^114wqUK4] [^1177sF5r] [^117FkYVe].

> Next, I should review target doses and titration cadence. Let me think about the trial-proven targets and practical intervals. For ARNI, the target is sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg twice daily; for ACEi/ARB, representative targets include lisinopril 20–40 mg daily or valsartan 160 mg twice daily; for beta-blockers, carvedilol 25–50 mg twice daily or metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily; for MRAs, spironolactone 25–50 mg daily or eplerenone 50 mg daily; and for SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin 10 mg daily, with titration as frequently as every 1–2 weeks toward target doses unless limited by tolerability, and the ACC pathway provides explicit starting and target dosing tables to operationalize this [^113eDiob] [^113J4evF] [^112U2zWv].

> Wait, let me verify sequencing and timing. Historically, a linear approach was common, but contemporary guidance prioritizes early, concurrent initiation of all four classes with individualized sequencing, aiming to reach target or maximally tolerated doses within about 2–3 months, and even faster in decompensated presentations when stabilized, given the mortality and hospitalization benefits accrue early and compound with combination therapy [^1177sF5r] [^116qe276] [^113J4evF].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and secondary therapies. For Black patients with persistent symptoms despite GDMT, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate is recommended and should be titrated to target doses. In symptomatic HFrEF with elevated heart rate and LVEF ≤ 35%, ivabradine can be added. In high-risk patients with recent worsening HF on GDMT, vericiguat may be considered. And in iron deficiency, IV ferric carboxymaltose improves functional status and quality of life, all aligned with guideline recommendations [^113eDiob] [^114bS3nc] [^114NTmfD] [^111VxUmP].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to HF with improved EF (HFimpEF). Even if LVEF recovers to > 40%, patients should continue GDMT to prevent relapse, as discontinuation increases risk of recurrence. This is a Class I recommendation in the 2022 guideline and is reflected in quality measures emphasizing continuation of therapy [^112pY9XM] [^113C8aiz] [^1124F7g3].

> Next, I should review implementation gaps and solutions. Real-world data show persistent underuse and underdosing of GDMT, with only a small fraction achieving target doses across classes. Barriers include hypotension, renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, bradycardia, and clinical inertia, and strategies such as navigator-led remote titration, EHR-embedded algorithms, and team-based care improve uptake and dose optimization, while forced-titration frameworks remind us that landmark trials used protocolized uptitration with repeated attempts to reach targets despite minor lab or vital sign changes [^113B9jVh] [^1141WmbP] [^115WHcBa] [^111Hrp3C] [^115wzxmU].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. GDMT for HFrEF centers on four foundational classes — ARNI (or ACEi/ARB if ARNI not feasible), evidence-based beta-blocker, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitor — with diuretics for congestion. Initiation should be early and concurrent when possible, titrated every 1–2 weeks toward trial-proven target doses within 2–3 months, individualized for comorbidities and tolerability, and continued even if EF improves. Adjuncts like hydralazine/nitrate, ivabradine, vericiguat, and IV iron are layered for selected patients, and structured implementation strategies are essential to close the gap between evidence and practice [^113J4evF] [^1177sF5r] [^113eDiob] [^112pY9XM] [^114bS3nc].

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) comprises four foundational classes: **ARNI (or ACEi/ARB), beta-blocker, MRA, and SGLT2i** [^113J4evF] [^117XmZx2], with diuretics for symptom control [^114wqUK4]. These therapies reduce mortality and hospitalizations [^117GR3ro] and should be initiated early, titrated to target or maximally tolerated doses within 3 months [^1177sF5r] [^116qe276], and continued even if ejection fraction improves [^112pY9XM]. Secondary options include hydralazine/nitrate for persistent symptoms or intolerance, ivabradine for elevated heart rate, and vericiguat for recent worsening HF [^117FkYVe] [^111VxUmP]. GDMT should be individualized and monitored for hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia [^114bS3nc].

## Core components of GDMT

The **four foundational classes** are:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical benefits** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ARNI | Sacubitril/valsartan | Dual inhibition of neprilysin and angiotensin II receptor | - Reduced mortality <br/> - HF hospitalizations <br/> - Improved quality of life [^112xChpH] |
| Beta-blocker | - Metoprolol succinate <br/> - Carvedilol <br/> - Bisoprolol | - Reduce sympathetic activity <br/> - Improve ventricular function | - Reduced mortality <br/> - HF hospitalizations <br/> - Improved symptoms [^114p8N7W] |
| MRA | - Spironolactone <br/> - Eplerenone | Aldosterone receptor antagonism | - Reduced mortality <br/> - HF hospitalizations <br/> - Improved symptoms [^112xChpH] |
| SGLT2i | - Dapagliflozin <br/> - Empagliflozin | - Glycemic control <br/> - Diuretic effect <br/> - Reduced myocardial stress | - Reduced mortality <br/> - HF hospitalizations <br/> - Improved symptoms [^112xChpH] |

---

Diuretics are used for **symptom control** — managing congestion and fluid overload — and are essential for relieving dyspnea and edema [^114VxH5m].

---

## Implementation strategy

- **Initiation**: Start GDMT as early as possible, ideally during hospitalization or soon after discharge [^117AQkVA] [^116zMmGz].
- **Titration**: Titrate to target or maximally tolerated doses within 3 months, monitoring for hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalemia [^114bS3nc] [^116qe276].
- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up every 3–6 months to assess efficacy, tolerability, and adherence [^116rCMFn].
- **Continuation**: Continue GDMT even if ejection fraction improves to prevent relapse [^112pY9XM] [^1124F7g3].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hypotension**: Adjust dosing or sequencing of medications as needed [^114bS3nc].
- **Renal dysfunction**: Monitor closely and adjust doses accordingly [^114bS3nc].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Particularly with MRAs, monitor potassium and adjust therapy [^114bS3nc].
- **Comorbidities**: Individualize therapy based on patient-specific factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation [^1177sF5r].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Hydralazine/nitrate**: For persistent symptoms or intolerance to ARNI/ACEi/ARB, particularly in Black patients [^114DnZD1] [^114bS3nc].
- **Ivabradine**: For elevated heart rate despite optimal beta-blocker therapy [^notfound].
- **Vericiguat**: For recent worsening HF despite optimal GDMT [^114NTmfD] [^111VxUmP].

---

## Barriers to implementation

- **Clinical inertia**: Underutilization and underdosing of GDMT remain common [^113B9jVh] [^111Hrp3C].
- **Patient factors**: Adherence, comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors [^113G29WS].
- **System factors**: Limited access, cost, and healthcare disparities [^11565rDa].

## Outcomes associated with GDMT

GDMT significantly reduces **mortality, HF hospitalizations, and cardiovascular events**, and improves quality of life and functional status [^117GR3ro] [^1137shJK].

---

GDMT for HFrEF comprises four foundational classes (**ARNI, beta-blocker, MRA, SGLT2i**) with diuretics for symptom control. Early initiation, titration to target doses, and ongoing monitoring are essential for optimal outcomes.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^111J8md4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The proposed framework reminds practitioners that these 'forced‐titration strategies' are the basis for current class I recommendations about the use of combinations of neurohormonal antagonists. If subtarget doses are prescribed, physicians are asked if they faithfully utilized the 'forced‐titration strategy' used in the landmark trials. Using the proposed framework, it is possible for a clinician to fully describe the status of heart failure therapy for each patient with a reduced ejection fraction in a single line of four words or less.

As a first step towards implementation of our framework, we suggest that authors should refrain from using the terms, 'guideline‐directed medical therapy' or 'optimal medical therapy' as a description of background therapy. Whenever possible, investigators should provide a granular description of how trial‐based strategies and target doses of neurohormonal antagonists were actually utilized in their study population. Table 1 may be used as one of several possible templates.

The proposed framework should increase practitioner awareness about the use of unproven subtarget doses that are prescribed outside the structure of forced‐titration strategies. Our proposal would also allow clinical investigators to precisely describe the adequacy of background medical therapy in clinical studies. The framework is a starting point for initiating the community‐wide discourse that is desperately needed to enhance adherence to evidence‐based treatments for patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Our proposal can be expanded to include other treatments for heart failure (e.g. devices), but this initial effort is best served by being focused, rather than inclusive. Prospective evaluation and validation of the merits of the proposed framework are warranted. 4

### County-level variation in triple guideline-directed medical therapy in Heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction [^113G29WS]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend simultaneous initiation of multidrug guideline-directed medical therapy classes for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate county-level variation in use of triple guideline-directed medical therapy, defined as simultaneous prescription fills for beta-blockers, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Methods

We conducted a cohort study using Medicare Fee-for-Service claims data (parts A, B, and D between 2013 and 2019). Features of counties including area-level indicators of poverty, employment, and educational attainment and aggregated patient-level sociodemographic and medical history variables were compared by quintiles of triple therapy use. A multilevel logistic regression model was constructed to estimate the contextual effect of clustering by counties, which was expressed as a median OR.

Results

304,857 patients from 2,600 counties (83% of all U.S. counties) were included. The median for triple therapy use was 14.3% (IQR: 10.3%-18.8%) across included counties with a wide variation (range: 0%-54.5%). Compared to counties in the highest use quintile, counties in lowest triple therapy use quintile had worse area-level indicators of socioeconomic status (% unemployment 6.8% vs 6.2%). Counties in lowest quintile had higher proportion of Black patients (13.3% vs 5.7% in highest quintile) and patients with low-income subsidy (29.3% vs 25.8% in highest quintile). The median OR was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.28–1.33).

Conclusions

We observed variation in triple therapy use across counties in the United States with suboptimal local use patterns correlating with indicators of socioeconomic disadvantage.

### Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: medical management [^114bS3nc]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has advanced in recent decades, and patients are surviving longer. The goals of HFrEF treatment are to reduce mortality, hospitalizations, and the severity of symptoms while improving functional status and quality of life. Treatments shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, known as guideline-directed medical therapy, include renin-angiotensin system/neprilysin inhibitors, beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Guidelines recommend initiation with target dose titration within 6 to 12 weeks of diagnosis. Secondary therapies such as digoxin, hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate, ivabradine, and vericiguat are indicated in certain patients with persistent or worsening symptoms. Guideline-directed medical therapy may require dosage adjustment due to adverse effects such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, and worsening kidney function. Intravenous iron replacement is recommended in patients with iron deficiency to improve functional status and quality of life. Device and interventional therapies may be indicated in those with prolonged QRS duration to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac death. Point-of-care ultrasonography can help diagnose heart failure and assess effectiveness of diuretic therapy.

### Factors associated with maintenance of an improved ejection fraction: an echocardiogram-based registry study [^111WjA23]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Heart failure with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF) has been increasingly recognized as a distinct clinical entity, with unique characteristics that differ from the long‐established syndromes of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. HFimpEF is currently defined by an initial clinical presentation of heart failure and an accompanying left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, with subsequent improved LVEF on follow‐up imaging. While these patients can now be identified with routine echocardiography, assessing and stratifying their likelihood for maintained LVEF > 40%, as well as their risk for future cardiac events, remains a challenge. While current guidelines support continuing patients with HFimpEF on the same guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) recommended for all patients with HFrEF, evidence remains relatively limited as to which characteristics are key prognostic indicators in this heterogeneous group of patients.

A randomized trial aimed to assess the phased withdrawal of GDMT in patients with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and improved ejection fraction (EF) demonstrated a higher rate of HFrEF relapse in patients that discontinue GDMT. These findings encouraged the revision of the terminology from heart failure with recovered EF to HFimpEF, since studies have demonstrated that the improved EF does not represent a true recovery of normal cardiac function. Factors associated with HFimpEF have been previously described. Evidence to date suggests that younger age, female sex, and the lack of history of ischemic heart disease have all been associated with initial improvement in EF. However, factors associated with maintenance of an improved LVEF remain largely unknown.

Using a large cohort of patients with HFrEF who demonstrated subsequent improvement in LVEF, we assessed the clinical characteristics and therapeutic interventions associated with maintaining an improved LVEF beyond 9 months after the initial improvement phase.

### Heart failure in Europe: guideline-directed medical therapy use and decision making in chronic and acute, pre-existing and de novo, heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction-the ESC EORP heart failure III registry [^112xChpH]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) affects more than 64 million people worldwide and is increasing in prevalence, especially HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Mortality and risk of HF hospitalization remain high and quality of life and functional capacity are poor.

Since the first heart transplantation in 1967, there has been remarkable development of medical therapy beyond diuretics and digitalis. Current class I guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in the form of the four foundational classes — angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi), beta‐blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2/1 inhibitors (SGLT2/1i) — antagonizes or modulates neurohormonal activation and additionally has favourable effects on the heart, kidney, vasculature and on inflammation and metabolism. The clinical effects extend to important improvements in quality of life and reductions in the risk of hospitalization for HF, and cardiovascular (CV) or all‐cause mortality. While for many decades GDMT was available only for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), SGLT2/1i are now recommended across the ejection fraction (EF) spectrum, and the remaining three foundational drug classes may also be considered in HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF).

Despite these advances, outcomes over time have been suggested both to be improving and to be worsening. The major reason is poor implementation of existing therapy. Implementation science analyses have described quality indicators and reasons for poor initiation, up‐titration, adherence, and persistence. However, there have been no comprehensive studies of therapeutic decision making (i.e. changes in medical therapy) according to acute and outpatient HF care, chronic and de novo HF, and across the different EF categories. The rationale and design of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF III Registry have been described. Here we present the first co‐primary analysis from the HF III Registry, providing a comprehensive analysis of contemporary HF characteristics and GDMT decisions.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy in severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: an analysis from the HELP-HF registry [^114GzX5N]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Persistent symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and poor tolerance of GDMT are hallmarks of patients with advanced heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, real-world data on GDMT use, dose, and prognostic implications are lacking.

Methods and Results

We included 699 consecutive patients with HFrEF and at least one 'I NEED HELP' marker for advanced HF enrolled in a multicentre registry. Beta-blockers (BB) were administered to 574 (82%) patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ACEi/ARB/ARNI) were administered to 381 (55%) patients and 416 (60%) received mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). Overall, ≥ 50% of target doses were reached in 41%, 22%, and 56% of the patients on BB, ACEi/ARB/ARNI and MRA, respectively. Hypotension, bradycardia, kidney dysfunction and hyperkalaemia were the main causes of underprescription and/or underdosing, but up to a half of the patients did not receive target doses for unknown causes (51%, 41%, and 55% for BB, ACEi/ARB/ARNI and MRA, respectively). The proportions of patients receiving BB and ACEi/ARB/ARNI were lower among those fulfilling the 2018 HFA-ESC criteria for advanced HF. Treatment with BB and ACEi/ARB/ARNI were associated with a lower risk of death or HF hospitalizations (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48–0.84, and HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58–0.95, respectively).

Conclusions

In a large, real-world, contemporary cohort of patients with severe HFrEF, with at least one marker for advanced HF, prescription and uptitration of GDMT remained limited. A significant proportion of patients were undertreated due to unknown reasons suggesting a potential role of clinical inertia either by the prescribing healthcare professional or by the patient. Treatment with BB and ACEi/ARB/ARNI was associated with lower mortality/morbidity.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113S3RSy]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — hypertension — Clinical trials assessing the impact of goal blood pressure reduction on outcomes in patients with HFrEF and hypertension are lacking, and the optimal blood pressure goal and antihypertensive regimen are not known; antihypertensive therapy is associated with a decrease in incident heart failure in the general population with a more stringent SBP target < 120 mm Hg, whereas low blood pressure not due to antihypertensive treatment has been associated with poor outcomes in HFrEF. Nevertheless, hypertension in patients with HFrEF represents an opportunity to maximize guideline‑directed medical therapy (GDMT) to goal blood pressures defined by the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^117SCKvy]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The care of patients with chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction should be determined by the evidence from large‐scale randomized controlled trials that form the basis of accepted standards of practice. Numerous guideline documents have issued recommendations to clinicians. 1, 2 These describe the treatments that should be prescribed (class I); those that are appropriate but are not mandated (class II); and those that should not be used (class III). However, guidelines typically do not describe what constitutes an acceptable standard of care. As a result of this uncertainty, practitioners who adhere to only one or two recommendations could contend that they are treating patients with heart failure 'in accordance with the guidelines'.

### Contemporary implementation of guideline-directed medical and device therapies in heart failure: insights from the central / Eastern Europe quality of care centres survey [^112gyEip]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The Central/Eastern Europe (CEE) Quality of Care Centres (QCC) Survey evaluated the implementation of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMT) and device use at discharge after heart failure (HF) hospitalization in CEE, where GDMT underutilization remains a concern.

Methods and Results

Between March 2024 and January 2025, 2251 patients (mean age 70.0years, 60.4% male) were enrolled at discharge from 21 centres across 12 CEE countries. The patient population included HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (55.5%), HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (15.3%) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (27.9%). In the total population, from admission to discharge there was a increase in the use of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) (17.1% to 34.3%), beta-blockers (69.4% to 92.4%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) (44.0% to 82.1%) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) (30.8% to 79.9%), with a reduction in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use (all p < 0.05). Similar trends were observed across HF phenotypes, including HFrEF (increased use of ARNI, 26.3% to 55.1%, beta-blockers, 69.8% to 95.3%, MRA 49.5% to 89.0%, and SGLT2I 36.2% to 79.8%, and lower ACEI use, all p < 0.05). At discharge, 53.5% of patients received quadruple therapy (63.9% with HFrEF), while ≥ 50% target doses of titratable drugs were achieved in 18.8% (17.8% in HFrEF). Predictors of GDMT underuse included older age, lower education, living alone, non-ischaemic HF, higher ejection fraction, chronic kidney disease, hypotension, hyperkalaemia, prolonged hospitalization, and residual oedema. Among eligible HFrEF patients, 21.3% were discharged with, or referred for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and 17.4% for cardiac resynchronization therapy.

Conclusions

The CEE-QCC Survey highlights substantial in-hospital GDMT implementation and up-titration, though device use remains limited. Targeted strategies are needed to enhance guideline implementation and ensure optimal HF care across the CEE region.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to general principles, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to titrate guideline-directed medication dosing in patients with HFrEF to achieve target doses shown to be efficacious in RCTs to reduce cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalizations unless not well tolerated.

### Determinants of guideline-directed medical therapy implementation during heart Failure hospitalization [^114DnZD1]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has evolved considerably since the initial publication of the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) management guidelines in 1995. In addition to diuretics, major guidelines, now provide Class I recommendations for use of beta-blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system [angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)], mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, hydralazine with nitrate in Black patients, and most recently, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is), all of which improve outcomes in patients with HFrEF. The cumulative effects of these medications result in mortality reductions of up to 70 to 80%. Unfortunately, guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMTs) are not optimally utilized in the HFrEF population. Because socially vulnerable populations have particularly poor HF outcomes, attention has focused on variability in GDMT utilization related to socioeconomic characteristics. Available information, however, is discordant with some studies finding evidence of discrepancies in treatment between racial and ethnic groups, while others have failed to detect differences in GDMT utilization.,

An important limitation of many prior studies of GDMT implementation is that medication classes were assessed individually, without consideration of dose, or accounting for contraindications to specific drug classes. In clinical practice, however, avoidance of some GDMTs with continued use of others is determined on an individualized basis according to patient-specific contraindications. Thus, a measure that assesses GDMT for HFrEF in combination, while considering specific contraindications in individuals, would provide more accurate insights regarding GDMT utilization in clinical practice. Accordingly, we quantified GDMT optimization by modifying the Heart Failure Collaboratory's optimal medical therapy (OMT) score, which considers the use of multiple agents in combination, to account for indications and contraindications of specific drugs used to treat an individual patient.

### Head-to-head comparison between recommendations by the ESC and ACC / AHA / HFSA heart failure guidelines [^111624Dr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations represent the core messages of guidelines, and are particularly important when the body of scientific evidence is rapidly growing, as in the case of heart failure (HF). The main messages from two latest major HF guidelines, endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America (ACC/AHA/HFSA), are partially overlapping, starting from the four pillars of treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction. Some notable differences exist, in part related to the timing of recent publications (most notably, the Universal Definition of HF paper and the EMPEROR-Preserved trial), and in part reflecting differing views of the natural history of HF (with a clear differentiation between stages A and B HF in the ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines). Different approaches are proposed to specific issues such as risk stratification and implantable cardioverter defibrillator use for primary prevention in HFrEF patients with non-ischaemic aetiology. The ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines put a greater emphasis on some issues that are particularly relevant to the US setting, such as the cost-effectiveness of therapies and the impact of health disparities on HF care. A comparison between guideline recommendations may give readers a deeper understanding of the ESC and ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines, and help them apply sensible approaches to their own practice, wherever that may be in the world. A comparison may possibly also help further harmonization of recommendations between future guidelines, by identifying why some areas have led to conflicting recommendation, even when ostensibly reviewing the same published evidence.

### Heart failure in Europe: guideline-directed medical therapy use and decision making in chronic and acute, pre-existing and de novo, heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction-the ESC EORP heart failure III registry [^116nF8vS]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Implementation of guideline‐directed medical therapy

A key objective of HF III is assessment of quality of care and adherence to the ESC HF guidelines. Patients were enrolled in 2018–2020, during which time the 2016 ESC HF guidelines were applicable, with class I recommendations for ACEi/ARB/ARNi, beta‐blockers and MRAs. In the present analysis, we provide detailed data on these three fundamental drug categories. SGLT2/1i were emerging as beneficial in reducing HF events in patients with diabetes but not yet indicated specifically for HF.

In HFrEF, use of ACEi/ARB/ARNi and beta‐blockers was highly variable depending on EF, pre‐existing versus de novo HF, and acute versus outpatient setting. However, after enrolment in HF III and optimization during the baseline encounter (whether in‐hospital or as outpatient), use of these drug classes reached nearly 90% at discharge from an AHF event and over 90% after an outpatient visit. Use of ARNi in HFrEF was far less than one third prior to enrolment, and was initiated in about 10% at the baseline encounter, resulting in about 30% use after an outpatient encounter and 10–20% use after an AHF encounter. The 29% use of ARNi was relatively modest, despite several years having passed since the pivotal PARADIGM‐HF trial and the 2016 guidelines recommending ARNi in HFrEF. The present study was conducted in 2018–2020 and cannot meaningfully assess SGLT2i use, but very recent data suggest that SGLT2i implementation, has been more rapid than ARNi in the present HF III as well as in other cohorts and registries. There are several potential explanations. Traditional HFrEF treatments such as ACEi and beta‐blockers were also slow to be implemented. The design of PARADIGM‐HF and recommendations in ensuing guidelines was to first treat with ACEi and then switch to ARNi, which may delay initiation of ARNi. ARNi is also more expensive than ACEi/ARB. In contrast, before they were shown effective in dedicated HF trials, SGLT2i had already received attention for their dramatic and unexpected effects on HF outcomes in CV outcome trials, and both the HF and primary care communities were primed for rapid implementation of SGLT2i once the HF trials were published. MRA use in HFrEF was higher, with more than 70% regardless of the type of encounter, which is considerably higher than that reported in other registries, and may reflect a greater comfort with medication side effects, among the HF III providers as compared to those in other more general settings.

### Rationale and design of a navigator-driven remote optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^116oUsLp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although optimal pharmacological therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is carefully scripted by treatment guidelines, many eligible patients are not treated with guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in clinical practice. We designed a strategy for remote optimization of GDMT on a population scale in patients with HFrEF leveraging nonphysician providers. An electronic health record‐based algorithm was used to identify a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of heart failure (HF) and ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40% receiving longitudinal follow‐up at our center. Those with end‐stage HF requiring inotropic support, mechanical circulatory support, or transplantation and those enrolled in hospice or palliative care were excluded. Treating providers were approached for consent to adjust medical therapy according to a sequential, stepped titration algorithm modeled on the current American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) HF Guidelines within a collaborative care agreement. The program was approved by the institutional review board at Brigham and Women's Hospital with a waiver of written informed consent. All patients provided verbal consent to participate. A navigator then facilitated medication adjustments by telephone and conducted longitudinal surveillance of laboratories, blood pressure, and symptoms. Each titration step was reviewed by a pharmacist with supervision as needed from a nurse practitioner and HF cardiologist. Patients were discharged from the program to their primary cardiologist after achievement of an optimal or maximally tolerated regimen. A navigator‐led remote management strategy for optimization of GDMT may represent a scalable population‐level strategy for closing the gap between guidelines and clinical practice in patients with HFrEF.

The 2013 (with updates in 2016 and 2017) American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide practical evidence-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of both acute and chronic heart failure (HF). Both guidelines address noninvasive and invasive testing to establish the diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Extensive trial evidence supports the use of guideline-directed medical therapy and device-based therapies for the optimal management of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Specific recommendations are also provided for HF with preserved ejection fraction although the evidence is substantially weaker. Management of medical comorbidities is now addressed in both guidelines. Acute HF and end-stage disease requiring advanced therapies are also discussed. This review compares specific recommendations across the spectrum of HF phenotypes and disease severity, highlights areas where differences exist, and lists consequential studies published since the latest guidelines.

### Clinical profile, health care costs, and outcomes of patients hospitalized for heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction [^115DRAkN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Many patients with heart failure (HF) have severely reduced ejection fraction but do not meet threshold for consideration of advanced therapies (ie, stage D HF). The clinical profile and health care costs associated with these patients in US practice is not well described. Methods and Results We examined patients hospitalized for worsening chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ≤ 40% from 2014 to 2019 in the GWTG-HF (Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure) registry, who did not receive advanced HF therapies or have end-stage kidney disease. Patients with severely reduced EF defined as EF ≤ 30% were compared with those with EF 31% to 40% in terms of clinical profile and guideline-directed medical therapy. Among Medicare beneficiaries, postdischarge outcomes and health care expenditure were compared. Among 113348 patients with EF ≤ 40%, 69% (78589) had an EF ≤ 30%. Patients with severely reduced EF ≤ 30% tended to be younger and were more likely to be Black. Patients with EF ≤ 30% also tended to have fewer comorbidities and were more likely to be prescribed guideline-directed medical therapy ("triple therapy" 28.3% versus 18.2%, P < 0.001). At 12-months postdischarge, patients with EF ≤ 30% had significantly higher risk of death (HR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.08–1.18]) and HF hospitalization (HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.09–1.19]), with similar risk of all-cause hospitalizations. Health care expenditures were numerically higher for patients with EF ≤ 30% (median US$22648 versus $21392, P = 0.11). Conclusions Among patients hospitalized for worsening chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in US clinical practice, most patients have severely reduced EF ≤ 30%. Despite younger age and modestly higher use of guideline-directed medical therapy at discharge, patients with severely reduced EF face heightened postdischarge risk of death and HF hospitalization.

Classification of HF by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) — definitions and thresholds are specified: LVEF is considered important in classifying patients because of differing prognosis, treatment responses, and trial selection, and randomized controlled trials with survival benefit have mainly enrolled patients with an LVEF ≤ 35% or ≤ 40%, often labeled HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In this guideline, HFrEF is defined as LVEF ≤ 40%. HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents at least 50% of the HF population and has been variably classified as LVEF > 40%, > 45%, or ≥ 50%; in this guideline, the threshold for HFpEF is an LVEF ≥ 50%.

### Lessons toto for optimizing heart Failure medications [^115fUL8P]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is an established global public health burden that affects 64 million people worldwide. Hospitalizations for heart failure cost ∼$24,000 each and account for 65% of all medical costs for this morbid syndrome. Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is the cornerstone for reducing heart failure hospitalizations, prolonging survival, and reducing costs. The 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America heart failure guidelines recommend the initiation of 4 classes of medications in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker if use of ARNI is not feasible, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. These medications may be initiated either simultaneously or sequentially, with the goal of achieving target doses studied in landmark clinical trials.

Third, physicians may be unaware of the directions that were provided to investigators in clinical trials regarding the uptitration of neurohormonal antagonists. In these trials, physicians were required to increase the dose of the study medication to the specified target dose in a standardized manner, and to make an ongoing and concerted effort to achieve and maintain the target dose, even if patients experienced unwanted changes in blood pressure, renal function, or electrolytes. Reaching values for systolic blood pressure or heart rate in the 'normal range' was not considered a valid reason for interruption of the forced‐titration strategy. For example, many physicians mistakenly believe that systolic blood pressures of 100–120 mmHg are sufficiently low to prevent further dose uptitration. 41 However, in the landmark clinical trials, physicians were typically advised to continue uptitration as long as the systolic blood pressure was > 85–90 mmHg, if patients were not experiencing recurrent symptoms related to hypotension. Similarly, in trials of beta‐blockers, investigators were required to uptitrate to target doses even if the heart rate on a subtarget dose declined to 65 bpm. These strategies are contrary to commonly‐held beliefs that patients with chronic heart failure require certain levels of perfusion pressure or that they need a heart rate of 70–80 bpm to maintain cardiac output.

### Medical therapy for heart failure with Reduced ejection fraction: the CHAMP-HF registry [^113B9jVh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines strongly recommend patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) be treated with multiple medications proven to improve clinical outcomes, as tolerated. The degree to which gaps in medication use and dosing persist in contemporary outpatient practice is unclear.

Objectives

This study sought to characterize patterns and factors associated with use and dose of HFrEF medications in current practice.

Methods

The CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) registry included outpatients in the United States with chronic HFrEF receiving at least 1 oral medication for management of HF. Patients were characterized by baseline use and dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Patient-level factors associated with medication use were examined.

Results

Overall, 3,518 patients from 150 primary care and cardiology practices were included. Mean age was 66 ± 13 years, 29% were female, and mean EF was 29 ± 8%. Among eligible patients, 27%, 33%, and 67% were not prescribed ACEI/ARB/ARNI, beta-blocker, and MRA therapy, respectively. When medications were prescribed, few patients were receiving target doses of ACEI/ARB (17%), ARNI (14%), and beta-blocker (28%), whereas most patients were receiving target doses of MRA therapy (77%). Among patients eligible for all classes of medication, 1% were simultaneously receiving target doses of ACE/ARB/ARNI, beta-blocker, and MRA. In adjusted models, older age, lower blood pressure, more severe functional class, renal insufficiency, and recent HF hospitalization generally favored lower medication utilization or dose. Social and economic characteristics were not independently associated with medication use or dose.

Conclusions

In this contemporary outpatient HFrEF registry, significant gaps in use and dose of guideline-directed medical therapy remain. Multiple clinical factors were associated with medication use and dose prescribed. Strategies to improve guideline-directed use of HFrEF medications remain urgently needed, and these findings may inform targeted approaches to optimize outpatient medical therapy.

### Heart failure in Europe: guideline-directed medical therapy use and decision making in chronic and acute, pre-existing and de novo, heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction-the ESC EORP heart failure III registry [^114eTxwE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics in acute heart failure and outpatient heart failure and in, and

Patients with AHF versus outpatient visits were more commonly treated by general cardiologists and more commonly had de novo HF, suggesting that outpatient HF visits are mostly patients with established HF and that many patients do not receive a diagnosis until hospitalized. The clinical characteristics and haemodynamic profiles suggest that congestion was common and considerable in AHF, but far from universal, highlighting the variability and complexity of presentation and signs and symptoms of patients with AHF.

In most registries and cohorts, HFrEF represents roughly half of patients, and HFmrEF and HFpEF together the other half. HFpEF appears to be increasing the most. The recent change in the definition of HFmrEF from 40–49% to 41–49%has had a considerable effect on reducing the size of the HFmrEF proportion. This is due to digit bias, where EF is often reported in increments of 5%. In the ESC HF Long‐Term Registry, 21% had HFmrEF defined as 40–49%, 7% had EF 'exactly' 40%, and thus these 7% were reclassified as HFrEF, leaving only 14% with HFmrEF with the new 41–49% definition. In the present HF III, the distribution of HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF was 57%, 17% and 26%, thus still a meaningful proportion with HFmrEF. The proportions who have changed EF over time prior to enrolment in HF III is not reported but will be available in future follow‐up analysis of HF III.

The different EF categories have previously been extensively characterized and were largely confirmed in the present analysis, suggesting that on average, HFrEF and HFmrEF are similar in most characteristics, including age, predominance of men and underlying ischaemic heart disease, with the main difference being that HFrEF is more severe, with higher NYHA class, NT‐proBNP and CV and HF event rates than HFmrEF. In contrast, patients with HFpEF are older, more commonly women, with more commonly atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities.

Which strategies are effective for the use of life‐prolonging drugs in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction?

In the landmark trials with neurohormonal antagonists, investigators were required to follow a forced‐titration strategy to achieve and maintain treatment with specified target doses for long periods of time. Therapy was initiated at a low dose, and the doses were progressively increased in planned increments at specific time intervals, until the target dose was achieved or unless patients experienced clinically meaningful or serious adverse events, which persisted or recurred despite adjustment of other medications. In general, asymptomatic changes in vital signs and laboratory tests were not considered to represent events that would prevent uptitration to target doses. If the study medication was discontinued or the dose was decreased, these were considered to be temporary events, and investigators were strongly encouraged to reinstitute treatment and achieve target doses. Importantly, in most trials, the target dose was the same for every patient in the study, and a large majority achieved and were continued on target doses for the duration of the trial. Patients were maintained on subtarget doses only if the use of higher doses had been shown to threaten clinical stability. This 'forced‐titration' strategy ensured that few patients were maintained for long periods on the doses that had been used for initiation of treatment.

However, in clinical practice, these forced‐titration strategies are followed very infrequently. As a result, most patients are not receiving all mandated classes of drugs, and when treated, they commonly receive doses that were prescribed at the time of initiation of treatment. 3, 4, 5 Although these subtarget dosing regimens may have benefits, their ability to prolong life has not been established.

Rationale and recommendations for dosing of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction emphasize outcome benefits and titration to target or maximally tolerated doses. The rationale states that use of guideline-recommended beta blockers "has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF, and studies have supported a dose-response relationship of beta blockers with improved outcomes", and that "treating at less than the target dose may result in worse clinical outcomes" with "the percentage of patients achieving these doses is low and remains low over time". It adds, "Treatment with a beta blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual incremental increases in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated. Clinicians should make every effort to achieve the target doses of the beta blockers shown to be effective in major clinical trials". The 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline specifies, "Use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (eg, bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality" with "(Class I, Level of Evidence: A)". The 2017 ACC decision pathway adds, "After a diagnosis of heart failure is made, GDMT should be initiated and therapies should be adjusted no more frequently than every 2 weeks to target doses (or maximally tolerated doses)" and "To achieve the maximal benefits of GDMT in patients with chronic HFrEF, therapies must be initiated and titrated to maximally tolerated doses".

This document describes performance measures for heart failure that are appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs and is meant to serve as a focused update of the "2020 ACC/AHA Clinical Performance and Quality Measures for Adults With Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Performance Measures". The new performance measures are taken from the "2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines" and are selected from the strongest recommendations (Class 1 or Class 3). In contrast, quality measures may not have as much evidence base and generally comprise metrics that might be useful for clinicians and health care organizations for quality improvement but are not yet appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs. New performance measures include optimal blood pressure control in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and the use of guideline-directed medical therapy in hospitalized patients. New quality measures include the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction, the optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy prior to intervention for chronic secondary severe mitral regurgitation, continuation of guideline-directed medical therapy for patients with heart failure with improved ejection fraction, identifying both known risks for cardiovascular disease and social determinants of health, patient-centered counseling regarding contraception and pregnancy risks for individuals with cardiomyopathy, and the need for a monoclonal protein screen to exclude light chain amyloidosis when interpreting a bone scintigraphy scan assessing for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.

The update harmonizes with the 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA HF Guideline and ECDP documents concerning optimization of therapy in chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and Figure 1 places increased emphasis on establishing all 4 pillars of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HFrEF in the hospital, when possible, along with ensuring appropriate follow-up to monitor tolerance and continue titration. The figure also now includes sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibition; given the robust evidence for safety and efficacy of SGLT inhibitors, their use can be considered earlier than or concomitant with neurohormonal antagonists such as beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs). For initiation strategies, patients may have a new HFrEF diagnosis, in which case initiation of all 4 pillars of GDMT should be attempted; patients with chronic HF on partial GDMT should receive personalized therapy to fill in gaps, considering a switch from an ACE inhibitor/ARB to ARNI, if appropriate, and caution is required for patients with chronic Class IV HF with decompensated HF, some of whom may not tolerate neurohormonal antagonists, even in low doses.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy in newly diagnosed heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the community [^115qmBa6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) dramatically improves outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Our goal was to examine GDMT use in community patients with newly diagnosed HFrEF.

Methods and Results

We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents with newly diagnosed HFrEF (EF ≤ 40%) 2007–2017. We excluded patients with contraindications to medication initiation. We examined the use of beta-blockers, HF beta-blockers (metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, bisoprolol), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIS), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) in the first year after HFrEF diagnosis. We used Cox models to evaluate the association of being seen in an HF clinic with the initiation of GDMT. From 2007 to 2017, 1160 patients were diagnosed with HFrEF (mean age 69.7 years, 65.6% men). Most eligible patients received beta-blockers (92.6%) and ACEis/ARBs/ARNIs (87.0%) in the first year. However, only 63.8% of patients were treated with an HF beta-blocker, and few received MRAs (17.6%). In models accounting for the role of an HF clinic in initiation of these medications, being seen in an HF clinic was independently associated with initiation of new GDMT across all medication classes, with a hazard ratio (95% CI) of 1.54 (1.15–2.06) for any beta-blocker, 2.49 (1.95–3.20) for HF beta-blockers, 1.97 (1.46–2.65) for ACEis/ARBs/ARNIs, and 2.14 (1.49–3.08) for MRAs.

Conclusions

In this population-based study, most patients with newly diagnosed HFrEF received beta-blockers and ACEis/ARBs/ARNIs. GDMT use was higher in patients seen in an HF clinic, suggesting the potential benefit of referral to an HF clinic for patients with newly diagnosed HFrEF.

### Heart failure in Europe: guideline-directed medical therapy use and decision making in chronic and acute, pre-existing and de novo, heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction-the ESC EORP heart failure III registry [^11557nbG]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Medication use and medication decisions and changes for combinations of ejection fraction categories, acute heart failure versus outpatient heart failure, and de novo versus pre‐existing heart failure. Bars show treatment at presentation (before acute heart failure event and before outpatient heart failure clinic visit), treatment decisions, and treatment at discharge for acute heart failure and after the clinic visit for outpatient heart failure. The sum of the bars is the percentage treated after the encounter, reflecting treatment decisions and implementation of guideline‐directed medical therapy in Europe. ACE‐I, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; ARNi, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor; HFmrEF, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SGLT2/1i, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2/1 inhibitor.

As an example, among patients enrolled with de novo AHF, beta‐blockers were used at presentation and continued in 38% in HFrEF, 42% in HFmrEF, and 48% in HFpEF, started in 53%, 36%, and 32%, respectively, and stopped in 0.2%, 3.0% and 2.5%, respectively. ARNi was used after the visit in 9.1–38% of HFrEF, depending on whether pre‐existing or not and whether AHF or outpatient HF. The equivalent for SGLT2/1i over the entire EF spectrum was 0.7–8.4% (enrolment occurred in 2018–2020) and for MRAs in HFrEF 69–79%. The key percentages reflecting quality of care were use of EF‐specific GDMT after the encounter, and these were in HFrEF: RASi 89%, ARNi 29%, beta‐blocker 92%, MRA 78%, and oral loop diuretics 85%; HFmrEF oral loop diuretics 81%, and HFpEF oral loop diuretics 80%.

Given the current state of affairs, most practitioners who claim that patients are receiving 'guideline‐directed medical therapy' are making a judgment that is not based on objective criteria. 8 No set of standards has been developed to define 'optimal medical therapy'. Anyone who asserts that their patients are being managed appropriately is providing a well‐intentioned (but personal) opinion, since no one has defined what combination of treatments should be considered 'optimal', 'acceptable', 'adequate', 'reasonable' or 'guideline‐directed'.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^115Wmqtv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

### New medications for heart failure [^114hCeMn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure is common and results in substantial morbidity and mortality. Current guideline-based therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, including beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists aim to interrupt deleterious neurohormonal pathways and have shown significant success in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure. Continued efforts to further improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have led to the first new-in-class medications approved for heart failure since 2005, ivabradine and sacubitril/valsartan. Ivabradine targets the If channels in the sinoatrial node of the heart, decreasing heart rate. Sacubitril/valsartan combines a neprilysin inhibitor that increases levels of beneficial vasodilatory peptides with an angiotensin receptor antagonist. On a background of previously approved, guideline-directed medical therapies for heart failure, these medications have shown improved clinical outcomes ranging from decreased hospitalizations in a select group of patients to a reduction in all-cause mortality across all pre-specified subgroups. In this review, we will discuss the previously established guideline-directed medical therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the translational research that led to the development of these new therapies, and the results from the major clinical trials of ivabradine and sacubitril/valsartan.

### Heart failure with mid-range (borderline) ejection fraction: clinical implications and future directions [^114aGZa5]. JACC: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with borderline ejection fraction was first defined in 2013 in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines as the presence of the typical symptoms of HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 41% to 49%. In 2016, the European Society of Cardiology specified HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) as LVEF of 40% to 49%. This range of LVEF is less well studied compared with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Although there are effective, guideline-directed medical therapies for patients with HFrEF, no therapies thus far show measurable benefit in HFpEF. Patients with HFmrEF have a clinical profile and prognosis that are closer to those of patients with HFpEF than those of HFrEF, with certain distinctions. Whether these patients represent a unique and dynamic HF group that may benefit from targeted therapies known to be beneficial in patients with HFrEF, such as neurohormonal blockade, requires further study. This review summarizes what is known about the clinical epidemiology, pathophysiology, and prognosis for patients with HFmrEF and how these features compare with the more well-studied HF groups. Although recommended treatments currently focus on aggressive management of comorbidities, we summarize the studies that identify a potential signal for beneficial therapies. Future studies are needed to not only better characterize the HFmrEF population but to also determine effective management strategies to reduce the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality burden on this phenotype of patients with HF.

### Impact of implantable cardioverter defibrillators on mortality in heart failure receiving quadruple guideline-directed medical therapy: a propensity score-matched study [^112mKbX8]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the contemporary approach to Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) therapy, there is a robust recommendation that the four cornerstones of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), evidence-based beta-blockers (BB), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) constitute the fundamental standard for medical therapy in HFrEF patients. Each of these four therapeutic interventions has received the highest class of recommendation due to their distinct contributions to reducing mortality. Importantly, their benefits manifest within days without overlapping.

The landmark MADIT-II (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II) showed a significant reduction in all-cause mortality with prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement in patients with ischemic HFrEF with no arrhythmia qualifier but with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) lower than 30% derived benefit from ICD. However, in the MADIT-II trial, 64% of patients used beta-blockers, and 88% used ACEi or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) without any MRAs or SGLT-2 inhibitors. More recently, in 2016, the DANISH (Defibrillator Implantation in Patients with Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure) trial enrolled participants with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and LVEF ≤ 35% in either an ICD or standard care arm. While there was no observed reduction in the primary endpoint of total mortality, a notable decrease in the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) was evident. In the DANISH trial, the usage rates of beta-blockers, ACEi or ARB, and MRA were 96%, 92%, and 59%, respectively. Notably, SGLT-2i were not part of the therapeutic regimen in this trial.

Nevertheless, the currently available evidence is insufficient to ascertain whether ICD therapy maintains its efficacy in preventing death for patients receiving contemporary guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF. In this real-world trial, our objective was to investigate the persistence of the benefit derived from ICD therapy in patients adhering to quadruple guideline-directed medical therapy for HFrEF.

### Misconceptions and facts about heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^11544xUj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a significant driver of morbidity and mortality. There are common misconceptions regarding the disease processes underlying heart failure and best practices for therapy. The terms heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are not interchangeable terms. Key therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction target the underlying disease processes, not the left ventricular ejection fraction alone. The absence of congestion does not rule out heart failure. Patients with cardiac amyloidosis can also present with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A rise in serum creatinine in acute heart failure exacerbation is not associated with tubular injury. Guideline directed medical therapy should be continued during acute exacerbations of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and should be started in the same hospitalization in new diagnoses. Marginal blood pressure is not a relative contraindication to optimal guideline directed medical therapy. Guideline directed medical therapy should be continued even if ejection fraction improves. There are other therapies that provide significant benefit besides the four key medications in guideline directed medical therapy.

### Underrepresentation of women in reduced ejection heart failure clinical trials with improved mortality or hospitalization [^1122QvMX]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials have played a pivotal role in advancing the treatment of heart failure and improving patient outcomes. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of new therapies in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) typically evaluate cardiovascular (CV) outcome benefits through the key endpoints of CV mortality or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF).HFrEF RCTs that observe a significant benefit in CV mortality or HHF are likely to influence the HFrEF practice landscape.

The lifetime risk of HFrEF for men and women is 1 in 5, and the incidence increases disproportionately with age for women compared to men. There are established sex differences in CV physiology, drugs' pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, effectiveness, safety, and outcomes. For example, women with HFrEF have more symptoms and signs, poorer health-related quality of life, and greater functional and psychological impairment than men. Certain traditional risk factors such as diabetes portend a worse prognosis in women with HFrEF compared to men, and sex-specific risks such as peripartum cardiomyopathy, breast cancer therapy, and stress cardiomyopathy make HFrEF in women a unique disease process.CV trials have also suggested modification of treatment effect based on sex, with women experiencing differential outcomes compared with men in prior RCTs evaluating guideline-directed medical therapy. Therefore, adequate representation of women is crucial in HFrEF trials.

Prior work has reported that trials with statistically significant results had a significantly lower representation of women than those that did not. Given that underrepresentation of women in CV trials has been documented, we extended prior work by only analyzing HFrEF trials that reduced mortality or heart failure hospitalizations and explored factors that may influence lower trial representation in this subgroup. Additionally, these trials are more likely to be practice-changing and incorporated into clinical guidelines. To our knowledge, this will be the first study analyzing trials in the same time frame as the recent 2022 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) guidelines for the management of heart failure.

### Improving care for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) – A polypill-based strategy… [^1139cBcW]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure is a leading global public health problem with more than 26 million prevalent cases around the world. 1 The disease burden associated with HF has increasingly shifted from high-income countries to low- and middle-income countries due to population growth, aging, and increasing prevalence of HF risk factors. Patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction from low- and middle-income countries experience a higher 1-year mortality rate than those in high-income countries despite being almost 1 decade younger. 2 Guideline-directed medical therapy consisting of β-blockers, renin angiotensin system blockers with neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists substantially reduces mortality among patients with HFrEF by an estimated 63% vs placebo. based on a network meta-analysis of 57 randomized trials.

3 These medicines are among the most cost-effective interventions and are thus included as the "highest priority" interventions recommended by the Disease Control Priorities Project. 4 Evidence has demonstrated. a further 2. 3% absolute risk reduction in all-cause mortality at 18 months from sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, likely adding another drug class to the recommended regimens. 5 Global inequalities in GDMT and HFrEF mortality may widen as use of SGLT2 inhibitors increases in high-income countries.

### Health equity in heart failure [^11565rDa]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The treatment of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has substantially developed over the past decades. More than ever before, the application of appropriate evidence-based medical therapy for HFrEF is associated with remarkable improvements in survival, noteworthy increases in quality of life, and a marked reduction in symptomatic HF sufficient to warrant hospitalization. These enhanced clinical outcomes are driven by the "four pillars" of HF therapy: 1) evidence-based beta blockers, 2) Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors /angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, 3) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and most recently, 4) sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Despite robust evidence from well-conducted randomized clinical trials, guideline-directed medical therapies with established cardiovascular benefits remain significantly underutilized in clinical practice, particularly among under-represented minority populations. This phenomenon has led to class 1 level recommendations from the 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America Guidelines to address HF disparities among vulnerable populations as follows. In this article, we highlight the difference between health equality and health equity and discuss the need to address equity in the treatment of heart failure, ensuring that the impressive progress made in the treatment of HFrEF is equally beneficial to all individuals. We discuss strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate disparities in the determinants of health that particularly affect marginalized groups, including the socioeconomic determinants and racism as a threat to public health. Finally, we discuss and propose a combination of the four pillars of ethics with the four pillars of GDMT to optimize and personalize treatment of all patients with HFrEF, to achieve true equity in the treatment of HF.

### Optimisation of diagnosis and treatment of heart failure in a primary care setting [^112FXPqk]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF), a chronic, progressive condition, occurs when the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands for blood and oxygen.HF results from a structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. In the USA, approximately 5.7 million adults are living with HFand occurrence rates increase with age.HF is a growing healthcare burden with 2012 cost estimates around $30.7 billion.HF is a leading diagnosis for hospitalisation and hospital readmissions. From 2009 to 2012, the median risk-standardised 30-day readmission rate for HF was 23.0%. The overall implications of HF include a negative impact on patients' quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased number of avoidable hospitalisations.

HF with reduced ejection fraction is defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40%. The 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force guidelines for HF management include the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), in conjunction with evidence-based beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists for patients with reduced ejection fraction. The 2017 focused update of HF guidelines recommends the use of an ARBs with an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor for the treatment of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. As HF is one of the leading causes of emergency department visits and hospitalisation readmissions, diagnosing and managing HF based on guideline-directed medical therapy have become a priority.

### Titration of medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117SSeYZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have medical therapy titrated to target doses derived from clinical trials, as tolerated. The degree to which titration occurs in contemporary U.S. practice is unknown.

Objectives

This study sought to characterize longitudinal titration of HFrEF medical therapy in clinical practice and to identify associated factors and reasons for medication changes.

Methods

Among 2,588 U.S. outpatients with chronic HFrEF in the CHAMP-HF (Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure) registry with complete medication data and no contraindications to medical therapy, use and dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) were examined at baseline and at 12-month follow-up.

Results

At baseline, 658 (25%), 525 (20%), 287 (11%), and 45 (2%) patients were receiving target doses of MRA, beta-blocker, ACEI/ARB, and ARNI therapy, respectively. At 12 months, proportions of patients with medication initiation or dose increase were 6% for MRA, 10% for beta-blocker, 7% for ACEI/ARB, and 10% for ARNI; corresponding proportions with discontinuation or dose decrease were 4%, 7%, 11%, and 3%, respectively. Over 12 months, < 1% of patients were simultaneously treated with target doses of ACEI/ARB/ARNI, beta-blocker, and MRA. In multivariate analysis, across the classes of medications, multiple patient characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of initiation or dose increase (e.g., previous HF hospitalization, higher blood pressure, lower ejection fraction) and discontinuation or dose decrease (e.g., previous HF hospitalization, impaired quality of life, more severe functional class). Medical reasons were the most common reasons for discontinuations and dose decreases of each therapy, but the relative contributions from patient preference, health team, and systems-based reasons varied by medication.

Conclusions

In this contemporary U.S. registry, most eligible HFrEF patients did not receive target doses of medical therapy at any point during follow-up, and few patients had doses increased over time. Although most patients had no alterations in medical therapy, multiple clinical factors were independently associated with medication changes. Further quality improvement efforts are urgently needed to improve guideline-directed medication titration for HFrEF.

### Real-world analysis of guideline-based therapy after hospitalization for heart failure [^115VbAz8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a disabling, progressive clinical syndrome characterized by inadequate ventricular filling or ejection of blood. 1 In the United States, > 650 000 people are diagnosed with HF annually, and incidence increases with age 2; estimated 5‐year mortality after diagnosis is ≈50%. 3, 4 Over 20% of patients have an HF‐related hospitalization in the year after diagnosis. 5, 6 Outcomes following HF‐related hospitalization are poor; within 30 days of hospital discharge, 25% of patients are readmitted, and 10% of patients die. 7, 8

Approximately half of patients with HF have a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), characterized by systolic dysfunction and defined clinically by a left‐ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%. 1 The American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that patients with HFrEF receive dual therapy with beta‐blockers (BBs) in combination with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) if patients tolerate ACEIs or ARBs. 1, 9, 10 In patients who remain symptomatic despite these therapies, the addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) is recommended as triple therapy. Diuretics are used for symptomatic management of fluid retention. Most patients with HFrEF (> 98%) are candidates for guideline‐directed medical therapy, having no absolute contraindications to treatment. 11 Despite the availability and efficacy of these therapies, suboptimal use in real‐world clinical practice remains high. 11, 12, 13 As intolerance accounts for only ≈5% to 20% of underutilization in treated patients, 14 the need for prudent initiation and uptitration of HF therapies persists.

### Cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^112Jp5XM]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction produces substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Dapagliflozin is the first sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Objective

To examine the cost-effectiveness of adding dapagliflozin to guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in patients with or without diabetes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This economic evaluation developed and used a Markov cohort model that compared dapagliflozin and guideline-directed medical therapy with guideline-directed medical therapy alone in a hypothetical cohort of US adults with similar clinical characteristics as participants of the Dapagliflozin in Patients with Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection Fraction (DAPA-HF) trial. Dapagliflozin was assumed to cost $4192 annually. Nonparametric modeling was used to estimate long-term survival. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses examined the impact of parameter uncertainty. Data were analyzed between September 2019 and January 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in 2020 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.

Results

The simulated cohort had a starting age of 66 years, and 41.8% had diabetes at baseline. Median (interquartile range) survival in the guideline-directed medical therapy arm was 6.8 (3.5–11.3) years. Dapagliflozin was projected to add 0.63 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 0.25–1.15) QALYs at an incremental lifetime cost of $42 800 (95% UI, $37 100-$50 300), for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $68 300 per QALY gained (95% UI, $54 600-$117 600 per QALY gained; cost-effective in 94% of probabilistic simulations at a threshold of $100 000 per QALY gained). Findings were similar in individuals with or without diabetes but were sensitive to drug cost.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, adding dapagliflozin to guideline-directed medical therapy was projected to improve long-term clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and be cost-effective at current US prices. Scalable strategies for improving uptake of dapagliflozin may improve long-term outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

### Global impact of optimal implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure… [^1137shJK]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the potential number of lives saved with optimal implementation of quadruple guideline-directed medical therapy on a global level. Findings Globally, an estimated 1. 19 million deaths per year could be prevented with optimization of GDMT, with more than 1 million lives saved in the Eastern Mediterranean and African, Southeast Asian, and Western Pacific regions combined. Meaning Improving utilization of GDMT could lead to considerable mortality benefits on a global level. Even partial improvements in the use of GDMT has the potential to result in a substantial number of lives saved. Importance Guideline-directed medical therapy remains underutilized on a global level, with significant disparities in access to treatment worldwide. The potential global benefits of quadruple therapy on patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have not yet been estimated.

Objective To assess the projected population-level benefit of optimal GDMT use globally among patients with HFrEF. Design, Setting, and Participants Estimates for HFrEF prevalence, contraindications to GDMT, treatment rates, and the number needed to treat for all-cause mortality at 12 months were derived from previously published sources. Potential lives saved from optimal implementation of quadruple therapy among patients with HFrEF was calculated globally and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for uncertainty in the existing data. 867 004–26 184 996) eligible for but not receiving angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, 12 223 700 eligible for but not receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and 21 229 170 eligible for but not receiving sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.

Optimal implementation of quadruple GDMT could potentially prevent 1 188 277 deaths over 12 months. A large proportion of deaths averted were projected in Southeast Asia, Eastern Mediterranean and Africa, and the Western Pacific regions. Conclusions and Relevance.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) after hospitalization in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): treatment gaps. Nearly half (46%) of patients with HFrEF have no changes made to oral GDMT in the 12 months after hospitalization despite many being discharged on suboptimal doses. From claims-based studies, 42% of patients with HFrEF are not prescribed any GDMT within 30 days post-index hospitalization, and 45% are prescribed either no oral GDMT or monotherapy within 1-year post-index hospitalization. From CHAMP-HF, initiation or dose increases of beta blockers, ACEi-ARB-ARNi, and MRA occur in ≤ 10% of patients with HFrEF within 1 year of hospitalization. Very few eligible patients with HFrEF receive target doses of beta blockers (18.7%), ACEi-ARB (10.8%), or ARNi (2.0%), and less than 10% of patients with HFrEF are on target doses of ACEi-ARB-ARNi, beta blockers, and MRA within 12 months of an index hospitalization.

### Rationale and design of a navigator-driven remote optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^112nKWxZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although optimal pharmacological therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is carefully scripted by treatment guidelines, many eligible patients are not treated with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in clinical practice. We designed a strategy for remote optimization of GDMT on a population scale in patients with HFrEF leveraging nonphysician providers. An electronic health record-based algorithm was used to identify a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of heart failure (HF) and ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40% receiving longitudinal follow-up at our center. Those with end-stage HF requiring inotropic support, mechanical circulatory support, or transplantation and those enrolled in hospice or palliative care were excluded. Treating providers were approached for consent to adjust medical therapy according to a sequential, stepped titration algorithm modeled on the current American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) HF Guidelines within a collaborative care agreement. The program was approved by the institutional review board at Brigham and Women's Hospital with a waiver of written informed consent. All patients provided verbal consent to participate. A navigator then facilitated medication adjustments by telephone and conducted longitudinal surveillance of laboratories, blood pressure, and symptoms. Each titration step was reviewed by a pharmacist with supervision as needed from a nurse practitioner and HF cardiologist. Patients were discharged from the program to their primary cardiologist after achievement of an optimal or maximally tolerated regimen. A navigator-led remote management strategy for optimization of GDMT may represent a scalable population-level strategy for closing the gap between guidelines and clinical practice in patients with HFrEF.

### Four pillars of heart failure: contemporary pharmacological therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117SdzcV]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

How did we get here?

Heart failure guidelines are based around inhibition of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems, two fundamental pathways which drive the pathophysiology of HFrEF using ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and beta-blockers. In both Europeanand American guidelinesadditional therapies are recommended for patients who 'remain symptomatic' with persistently impaired left ventricular (LV) function despite maximally tolerated doses of ACEi and beta-blockers. These guidelines differ subtly regarding the timing of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) relative to other therapies but are otherwise broadly similar, advocating a linear approach. This attempts to avoid 'unnecessary' treatments in patients who 'respond' but has several important limitations. First, while guidelines do not stipulate a time interval between alterations to therapy, the need for further assessment and re-evaluation of LV function inevitably results in delays initiating additional agents as well as contributing further follow-up and imaging costs. In clinical practice it typically takes many months before patients receive optimised doses of these medications, and many never do, even where integrated hospital and community care is available. Second, the barrier of 'response' is confusing and misplaced: does 'response' mean asymptomatic or merely improved? In our experience, while patients often feel better, they rarely become asymptomatic (NYHA (New York Heart Association) class 1), an observation supported by real-world data even in those receiving ARNI. Moreover, we should consider whether a highly subjective and poorly reproducible assessment is appropriate to determine our allocation of life-saving treatments. Hence, criteria requiring repeat assessment act as a barrier to initiating additional therapies such as MRA or ARNI, which are regarded as 'second-line' due to the hierarchical framework which places greater emphasis on therapies based on the chronological sequence in which the trials were performed. There is no logical basis to assume that drug classes trialled earliest would be the most beneficial, yet this is what guidelines imply. Therefore, if we are to make progress, future guidelines must address these limitations and incorporate the Four Pillars of Heart Failure into a comprehensive disease modifying programme for all people living with HFrEF.

### How to manage heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: practical guidance for clinicians [^113Fz8uh]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Although patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%) comprise nearly half of those with chronic heart failure, evidence-based treatment options for this population have historically been limited. Recently, however, emerging data from prospective, randomized trials enrolling patients with HFpEF have greatly altered the range of pharmacologic options to modify disease progression in selected patients with HFpEF. In the context of this evolving landscape, clinicians are increasingly in need of practical guidance regarding the best approach to management of this growing population. In this review, the authors build on the recently published heart failure guidelines by integrating contemporary data from recent randomized trials to provide a contemporary framework for diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of patients with HFpEF. Where gaps in knowledge persist, the authors provide "best available" data from post hoc analyses of clinical trials or data from observational studies to guide management until more definitive studies are available.

### ACCF and AHA release guidelines on the management of heart… [^114LmApW]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice Treatment of stage A heart failure should focus on reducing modifiable risk factors, including management of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. To prevent symptomatic heart failure, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers should be used in all patients with stage B or C heart failure who have a reduced ejection fraction. Patients with stage C heart failure and fluid retention should be treated with diuretics in addition to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. Repeat measurement of ejection fraction and measurement of the severity of structural remodeling are useful in patients who have had a significant change in clinical status, experienced or recovered from a clinical event, undergone treatment that may have had a significant effect on cardiac function, or who may be candidates for device therapy. Patients with atherosclerotic disease are at increased risk of heart failure.

Aggressive treatment of hyperlipidemia with statins reduces the risk of heart failure in at-risk patients; long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors may also reduce risk. STAGE B As with patients with stage A heart failure, patients with stage B heart failure should maintain control of hyperlipidemia and hypertension. ACE inhibitors should be used to prevent symptomatic heart failure and reduce mortality in patients with stage B heart failure and a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and reduced ejection fraction. Angiotensin receptor blockers are an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. Beta blockers should also be used to reduce mortality in these patients, and statins should be used to prevent symptomatic heart failure and cardiovascular events.

Blood pressure should be controlled in accordance with clinical practice guidelines in patients with stage B heart failure and structural cardiac abnormalities — including left ventricular hypertrophy — who do not have a history of MI or acute coronary syndrome. ACE inhibitors and beta blockers should be used in all patients with a reduced ejection fraction to prevent symptomatic heart failure, even if they do not have a history of MI. To prevent sudden death, placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is reasonable in patients with stage B heart failure and asymptomatic ischemic cardiomyopathy who are at least 40 days post-MI, have a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% or less, are on appropriate medical therapy, and have a reasonable expectation of survival with good functional status for more than one year.

Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers that have negative inotropic effects may be harmful in asymptomatic patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction and no symptoms of heart failure after MI.

Concluding remarks and future directions

Despite compelling evidence that several neurohormonal antagonists used in combination have a striking effect to prolong survival in patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, most eligible patients are not receiving all recommended classes of drugs, and treated patients are usually prescribed subtarget doses. Typically, patients are receiving doses that are used for initiation of treatment; these doses are maintained for long periods of time, and no or little attempt is made to achieve target doses or show that patients are intolerant of higher doses. As a result, the vast majority of patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction in clinical practice are receiving treatments that have been demonstrated to exert meaningful effect on the natural history of the disease.

The failure of physicians to treat patients with trial‐proven regimens has numerous complex causes. However, an important contributor to the current state of affairs is the fact that physicians can readily claim that the use of subtarget doses is fully compatible with recommendations of current guidelines. Practice guidelines do not describe what regimens are acceptable, adequate or reasonable; thus, most treatments can be labelled as consistent with 'guideline‐directed medical therapy'.

Perhaps, adherence to the trial‐proven regimens might be markedly improved if physicians were asked to document the degree to which a patient's treatment adheres to or deviates from the strategies that were used to demonstrate the benefits of the neurohormonal antagonists that have demonstrated survival benefits. All of the landmark trials were 'strategy trials', i.e. the studies mandated a standardized forced‐titration treatment plan to a target dose. Investigators were required to increase the dose at specified increments and intervals to achieve a target dose, even if the patient experienced asymptomatic but unwanted changes in vital signs or laboratory tests. Investigators were also required to make repeated efforts to achieve and maintain target doses, often adjusting concomitant medications to improve the likelihood of tolerance. 'Forced‐titration strategies' were an essential element of every trial that demonstrated a survival benefit.

Critical factors that contribute to the widespread failure to achieve and maintain target doses of neurohormonal antagonists

Why are most patients with chronic heart failure treated for long periods of time with only one or two drugs or with doses that are much lower than the doses that have been shown to prolong life? There are several contributory factors.

First, many physicians may be unfamiliar with the doses of neurohormonal antagonists that have been shown to prolong survival in chronic heart failure. The target doses of most neurohormonal antagonists used to treat heart failure are typically higher than the doses of the drugs when they are used to treat other cardiovascular disorders. For example, the usual doses of candesartan and valsartan used for the treatment of hypertension (4–8 mg daily and 40–80 mg daily, respectively) are far lower than the target doses in the large‐scale trials in heart failure (32 and 320 mg daily, respectively). 30, 31 Similarly, the optimal dose for losartan for heart failure (150 mg daily) is higher than that approved in the US for any cardiovascular indication 19; the commonly prescribed dose of 50 mg daily appears to be inferior to ACE inhibitors with respect to mortality reduction. 32, 33 The dose of metoprolol succinate used for hypertension or angina is 25–100 mg daily, but the target dose used in the landmark heart failure trial was 200 mg daily. 34

### Remote optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1141WmbP]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Optimal treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is scripted by treatment guidelines, but many eligible patients do not receive guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in clinical practice.

Objective

To determine whether a remote, algorithm-driven, navigator-administered medication optimization program could enhance implementation of GDMT in HFrEF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this case-control study, a population-based sample of patients with HFrEF was offered participation in a quality improvement program directed at GDMT optimization. Treating clinicians in a tertiary academic medical center who were caring for patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less (identified through an electronic health record-based search) were approached for permission to adjust medical therapy according to a sequential titration algorithm modeled on the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association heart failure guidelines. Navigators contacted participants by telephone to direct medication adjustment and conduct longitudinal surveillance of laboratory tests, blood pressure, and symptoms under supervision of a pharmacist, nurse practitioner, and heart failure cardiologist. Patients and clinicians declining to participate served as a control group.

Exposures

Navigator-led remote optimization of GDMT compared with usual care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Proportion of patients receiving GDMT in the intervention and control groups at 3 months.

Results

Of 1028 eligible patients (mean [SD] values: age, 68 [14] years; ejection fraction, 32% [8%]; and systolic blood pressure, 122 [18] mm Hg; 305 women (30.0%); 892 individuals [86.8%] in New York Heart Association class I and II), 197 (19.2%) participated in the medication optimization program, and 831 (80.8%) continued with usual care as directed by their treating clinicians (585 [56.9%] general cardiologists; 443 [43.1%] heart failure specialists). At 3 months, patients participating in the remote intervention experienced significant increases from baseline in use of renin-angiotensin system antagonists (138 [70.1%] to 170 [86.3%]; P < .001) and β-blockers (152 [77.2%] to 181 [91.9%]; P < .001) but not mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (51 [25.9%] to 60 [30.5%]; p = 0.14). Doses for each category of GDMT also increased from baseline in the intervention group. Among the usual-care group, there were no changes from baseline in the proportion of patients receiving GDMT or the dose of GDMT in any category.

Conclusions and Relevance

Remote titration of GDMT by navigators using encoded algorithms may represent an efficient, population-level strategy for rapidly closing the gap between guidelines and clinical practice in patients with HFrEF.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^111g1HZG]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Why are patients receiving subtarget doses of critical treatments?

In clinical practice, physicians initiate treatment at a low 'starting dose', but most patients continue to receive the starting dose for long periods of time, often indefinitely, with no or minimal uptitration. When new treatments are initiated at low doses during a hospitalization for heart failure, these doses are typically maintained following discharge. 25 This pattern of practice is prevalent whether patients are treated by primary care physicians or by heart failure specialists.

A striking example is the prescribing of sacubitril/valsartan. The drug is commonly initiated at 24/26 mg twice daily, but is uptitrated only in a small fraction of patients. 26 In contrast, few patients received long‐term treatment with 24/26 mg twice daily in the large‐scale clinical trial that established the survival benefit of neprilysin inhibition (PARADIGM‐HF). 27, 28 All patients in that trial received target doses of the drug at randomization, and > 70% were maintained on this dose for the duration of the study 27; yet, in clinical practice, < 25% of patients are ever titrated to the target dose of 97/103 mg twice daily. Interestingly, 40% of the patients who required temporary dose reduction in PARADIGM‐HF were subsequently restored to target doses. In contrast, in clinical practice, the vast majority of dose reductions are permanent, leading to indefinite treatment with subtarget doses.

The approach to treating life‐threatening heart failure in clinical practice differs markedly from that used by oncologists to treat life‐threatening cancers. Cancer specialists initiate simultaneous therapy with multiple‐drug regimens at target doses and down‐titrate only if serious adverse reactions occur that cannot be mitigated with additional treatments. Efforts to prolong life are valued far more highly than efforts to minimize drug toxicity. In striking contrast, the treatment of heart failure is routinely initiated with low doses of a single drug; additional therapies are added at a later time; and avoidance of adverse effects represents the clinical priority. The difference in the two approaches is medically inexplicable, since heart failure is more lethal than most forms of cancer. 29 Furthermore, the median improvement in survival produced by most treatments for heart failure exceeds that for most therapies for metastatic cancer.

### Incremental benefit of drug therapies for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a network meta-analysis [^117GR3ro]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

A network meta-analysis (NMA) of all recommended drug groups for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), including their combinations, was performed to assess the relative efficacy and incremental benefit.

Methods and Results

A search was made in biomedical databases for randomized controlled trials published between 1987 and 2017 on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), ivabradine (IVA), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI). A total of 58 relevant trials were identified. The relative efficacy of each treatment group (or combination) in terms of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause hospitalizations and hospitalizations for heart failure, per patient-year of follow-up, were combined in a random-effects Bayesian NMA. The pairwise comparison between each regimen and for each outcome was estimated. The NMA was dominated by 15 large-scale trials with between 1984 and 18898 patient-years of follow-up. Combinations of drug groups showed incremental benefits on outcomes over single groups. The most effective combinations were ARNI+BB+MRA and ACEI+BB+MRA+IVA, showing reductions in all-cause mortality (vs. placebo) of 62% and 59%, respectively; hazard ratios were 0.38 [credible interval (CrI) 0.20–0.65] and 0.41 (CrI 0.21–0.70); and in all-cause hospitalizations with reductions of 42% for both. These two combinations were also the most effective for the other outcomes studied.

Conclusion

Our analysis shows that the incremental use of combinations of disease-modifying therapies has resulted in the progressive improvement in mortality and hospitalization outcomes in HFrEF. Our findings support the current guideline recommendations.

### HFSA 2010 comprehensive heart failure practice guideline [^114LajLN]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome characterized by high mortality, frequent hospitalization, reduced quality of life, and a complex therapeutic regimen. Knowledge about HF is accumulating so rapidly that individual clinicians may be unable to readily and adequately synthesize new information into effective strategies of care for patients with this syndrome. Trial data, though valuable, often do not give direction for individual patient management. These characteristics make HF an ideal candidate for practice guidelines. The 2010 Heart Failure Society of America comprehensive practice guideline addresses the full range of evaluation, care, and management of patients with HF.

Proposal for a new framework for describing the degree of adherence to evidence‐based treatment

Given the broad range of possible reasons why physicians do not prescribe and uptitrate drugs that prolong survival in chronic heart failure, how can we objectively describe the adequacy of treatment in individual patients? Although it is possible to simply record the doses of drugs, such an approach provides no information about whether the practitioner actually utilized the forced‐titration strategies that were shown to be effective in prolonging life in large‐scale clinical trials.

It is appealing to simply ask physicians to describe why target doses of drugs were not prescribed, but such an approach would be impossible to implement. Imagine asking each practitioner to document at each visit the ability of patients to tolerate each drug class, the nature of the adverse event that prevented uptitration, the steps that were taken to enhance tolerability, and whether failure to achieve target doses was related to misconceptions held by the prescribing clinician. The reasons for failing to achieve target doses varies from patient to patient and may change over time in the same patient. Additionally, there may be many simultaneous reasons for a decision to maintain subtarget doses.

Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Although important progress has been made in the management of HF, this condition remains a common cause of morbidity and death. Since the publication of the previous sets of guidelines for the management of HF, new diagnostic and therapeutic options for HF have emerged. Now, both the ESC and the ACC/AHA/HFSA have simultaneously published an update of their guidelines incorporating, among others, recommendations for the use of new pharmacological therapies for the treatment of HF. For this Viewpoint article, we have asked the chairs of the ESC Task Force, the chairs of the ACC/AHA/HFSA Writing Committee, and an independent opinion leader in the field to offer their expert insight into the new guidelines, highlighting what is new, what the main differences are between the two sets of guidelines, and what steps should be taken to improve the guidelines in future updates.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). High credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure performance and quality measures — scope and updates are delineated as follows: The document describes performance measures for heart failure appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs, and the new performance measures are taken from the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure and selected from the strongest recommendations (Class 1 to Class 3). In contrast, quality measures may not have as much evidence base, are intended for quality improvement, and are not yet appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs. New performance measures include optimal blood pressure control in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and use of guideline-directed medical therapy in hospitalized patients. New quality measures include sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction; optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy prior to intervention for chronic secondary severe mitral regurgitation; continuation of guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with improved ejection fraction; identifying high known risks for cardiovascular disease and social determinants of health; patient-centered counseling regarding contraception and pregnancy risks for individuals with cardiomyopathy; and a monoclonal protein screen to exclude light chain amyloidosis when interpreting a bone scintigraphy scan assessing for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.

### Intensity of guideline-directed medical therapy for coronary heart disease and ischemic heart failure outcomes [^117A87te]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The impact of guideline-directed medical therapy for coronary heart disease in those hospitalized with acute heart failure is unknown.

Methods

We studied guideline-directed medical therapies for coronary disease: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, and statins. Using inverse probability of treatment weighting the propensity score, we examined associations of guideline-directed medical therapy intensity (categorized as low [0–1], high [2–3], or very high [4] number of drugs) with mortality in 1873 patients with angina, troponin elevation, or prior myocardial infarction.

Results

At discharge, 0–1, 2–3, and 4 medications were prescribed in 467 (25%), 705 (38%), and 701 (37%) patients, respectively. Relative to those prescribed 0–1 drugs (reference), all-cause mortality was lower with 2–3 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28–0.84, P = 0.009) or all 4 drug classes (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33–0.96, P = 0.034) over 181–365 days, with similar reductions present from 0–180 days. In those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, mortality trended lower with 2–3 drug classes (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.18–1.02, P = 0.054) and was significantly reduced with 4 drugs (HR 0.32, 95%CI 0.12–0.84, P = 0.021) during 0–180 day follow-up. In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, all-cause mortality was reduced during both 0–180 and 181–365 days when discharged on 2–3 (HR 0.30 for 181–365 days, 95%CI 0.14–0.64, P = 0.002) or all 4 drug classes (HR 0.43, 95%CI 0.19–0.95, P = 0.038).

Conclusions

Increasing guideline-directed medical therapy intensity for coronary heart disease resulted in lower mortality in patients with acute ischemic heart failure with both preserved and reduced ejection fractions.

### Drug therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: what is the 'right' dose? [^114ZouV8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

In the past few years, two new therapies have received a class I recommendation in guidelines for the treatment of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and four agents – a renin–angiotensin system blocker or sacubitril/valsartan, a beta‐blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) and a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor – are advised for most patients, in addition to a diuretic, as needed. Collectively, recent guidance documents on the treatment of HFrEF have suggested a prioritization of early introduction of all key pharmacological treatments over the up‐titration of the dose of these therapies. This change in emphasis has surprised many prescribers aware of the focus of previous guidelines on attaining the 'target dose' of each of the evidence‐based drugs for HFrEF. Although up‐titration of dose, guided by patient tolerability, remains important, introduction of each guideline‐recommended therapy may be the more important first step, with dose titration the second, recognizing the trade‐offs between the benefits of initiating a new therapy and up‐titrating the dose of current therapy. Here we revisit the evidence regarding the dosing of pharmacological therapy in heart failure and the background to the changed emphasis in recent guidance.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^111NNmY2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Numerous guideline documents have issued recommendations to clinicians concerning the treatment of chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. However, guidelines do not describe what constitutes an acceptable standard of care, and thus, practitioners who adhere to only a small fraction of the recommendations might claim that they are treating patients 'in accordance with the guidelines'. As a result, < 1% of patients with heart failure are receiving all life-prolonging treatments at trial-proven doses. A major impediment to the widespread adoption of trial-based treatments is a lack of any existing framework that would allow physicians to describe the adequacy of care. To address this deficiency, we propose a novel simple approach that would ask practitioners if a patient had been treated using the dosing algorithm that had been shown to be effective for each drug class. The proposed framework recognizes that all landmark survival trials in heart failure were 'strategy trials', i.e. the studies mandated a standardized forced-titration treatment plan that required timely uptitration to specified target dose unless patients experienced clinically meaningful, intolerable or serious adverse events, which persisted or recurred despite adjustment of other medications. Adherence to trial-proven regimens might be improved if physicians were asked to describe the degree to which a patient's treatment adhered to or deviated from the strategies that had been used to demonstrate the survival benefits of neurohormonal antagonists. The proposed framework should also promote practitioner self-awareness about the lack of evidence supporting the current widespread use of subtarget doses that are non-adherent with trial-proven forced-titration strategies.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117FkYVe]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) initiation and titration for HFrEF emphasize early, rapid implementation of the 4-drug regimen based on contemporary evidence. Established pharmacological therapies for chronic HFrEF include angiotensin II receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), evidence-based beta-blockers, sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors, mineralocorticoid antagonists, loop diuretic agents, hydralazine/isosorbide dinitrate, ivabradine, and vericiguat, and in contrast, use of digoxin as a treatment for HFrEF lacks contemporary data and is focused on rate control in atrial fibrillation in those with low blood pressure. Using a therapeutic standard 4-drug regimen (ARNI, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid antagonist, SGLT inhibitor), 4-class initiation reduced the hazard of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for HF compared with ACE inhibitor/ARB plus a beta-blocker (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.3–0.47). Among patients admitted with acute HF, a high-intensity strategy targeting doses within 6 weeks of discharge was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with a reduced risk of 180-day all-cause death or HF readmission compared with usual care. In higher-risk HFrEF with worsening symptoms, vericiguat was superior to placebo in reducing HF hospitalization and/or cardiovascular death and subsequently received a Class 2b recommendation in the updated 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guideline. The document notes the need for more frequent follow-ups, especially after initiation or titration, which may be in-person or virtual depending on patient stability and adjustments.

### Contemporary outpatient management of patients with worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: rationale and design of the CHART-HF study [^115L9ZVL]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and worsening HF events (WHFE) represent a distinct subset of patients with a substantial comorbidity burden, greater potential for intolerance to medical therapy, and high risk of subsequent death, hospitalization and excessive healthcare costs. Although multiple therapies have been shown to be efficacious and safe in this high-risk population, there are limited real-world data regarding factors that impact clinical decision-making when initiating or modifying therapy. Likewise, prior analyses of US clinical practice support major gaps in medical therapy for HFrEF and few medication changes during longitudinal follow-up, yet granular data on reasons why clinicians do not initiate or up-titrate guideline-directed medication are lacking.

Methods

We designed the CHART-HF study, an observational study of approximately 1,500 patients comparing patients with and without WHFE (WHFE defined as receipt of intravenous diuretics in the inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department setting) who had an index outpatient visit in the US between 2017 and 2019. Patient-level data on clinical characteristics, clinical outcomes, and therapy will be collected from 2 data sources: a single integrated health system, and a national panel of cardiologists. Furthermore, clinician-reported rationale for treatment decisions and the factors prioritized with selection and optimization of therapies in real-world practice will be obtained. To characterize elements of clinician decision-making not documented in the medical record, the panel of cardiologists will review records of patients seen under their care to explicitly note their primary reason for initiating, discontinuing, and titrating medications specific medications, as well as the reason for not making changes to each medication during the outpatient visit.

Conclusions

Results from CHART-HF have the potential to detail real-world US practice patterns regarding care of patients with HFrEF with versus without a recent WHFE, to examine clinician-reported reasons for use and non-use of guideline-directed medical therapy, and to characterize the magnitude and nature of clinical inertia toward evidence-based medication changes for HFrEF.

### Physician perceptions, attitudes, and strategies towards implementing guideline-directed medical therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. A survey of the heart failure association of the ESC and the ESC council for cardiology practice [^1131Tx26]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

Recent guidelines recommend four core drug classes (renin-angiotensin system inhibitor/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor [RASi/ARNi], beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [MRA], and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor [SGLT2i]) for the pharmacological management of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We assessed physicians' perceived (i) comfort with implementing the recent HFrEF guideline recommendations; (ii) status of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) implementation; (iii) use of different GDMT sequencing strategies; and (iv) barriers and strategies for achieving implementation.

Methods and Results

A 26-question survey was disseminated via bulletin, e-mail and social channels directed to physicians with an interest in HF. Of 432 respondents representing 91 countries, 36% were female, 52% were aged < 50years, and 90% mainly practiced in cardiology (30% HF). Overall comfort with implementing quadruple therapy was high (87%). Only 12% estimated that > 90% of patients with HFrEF without contraindications received quadruple therapy. The time required to initiate quadruple therapy was estimated at 1–2weeks by 34% of respondents, 1month by 36%, 3months by 24%, and ≥ 6months by 6%. The average respondent favoured traditional drug sequencing strategies (RASi/ARNi with/followed by beta-blocker, and then MRA with/followed by SGLT2i) over simultaneous initiation or SGLT2i-first sequences. The most frequently perceived clinical barriers to implementation were hypotension (70%), creatinine increase (47%), hyperkalaemia (45%) and patient adherence (42%).

Conclusions

Although comfort with implementing all four core drug classes in patients with HFrEF was high among physicians, a majority estimated implementation of GDMT in HFrEF to be low. We identified several important perceived clinical and non-clinical barriers that can be targeted to improve implementation.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) clinical assessment — after guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is initiated and titrated, patients with chronic HFrEF should be evaluated regularly, with a reasonable interval every 3 to 6 months, though many may need more frequent follow-up to monitor stability and further titration. Cardiac rehabilitation is helpful but underused, and virtual care for outpatient GDMT titration has been useful and is expected to play an increasingly larger role, particularly for medication titration. High-risk features summarized by "I NEED HELP" should trigger consideration for referral for an advanced heart failure consultation.

### 2024 update to the 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on performance measures [^115mdt1U]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2024). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for adults with heart failure — scope and key additions to measures: This document describes performance measures for heart failure that are appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs and the performance measures are taken from the "2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" and are selected from the strongest recommendations (Class 1 or 3). Quality measures are also provided that are not yet ready for public reporting or pay-for-performance but might be useful to clinicians and health care organizations for quality improvement. For all measures, if the clinician determines the care is not appropriate for the patient based on objective evidence or if the patient declines treatment, that patient is excluded; patients after heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device placement are excluded. Additions include blood pressure control in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction as a performance measure and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors added as a performance measure for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and as a quality measure for heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction. To optimize medical therapy, a performance measure is added for initiation of optimal guideline-directed medical therapy in hospitalized patients, and quality measures are added for optimization prior to intervention for chronic secondary severe mitral regurgitation and for continuation of therapy for patients with heart failure with improved ejection fraction. Additional quality measures emphasize targeting both known risks for cardiovascular disease and social determinants of health plus patient-centered counseling regarding contraception and pregnancy risks for individuals with cardiomyopathy, and a performance measure is added for a monoclonal protein screen to exclude light chain amyloidosis when interpreting a bone scintigraphy scan assessing for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.

### A computable algorithm for medication optimization in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^115WHcBa]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), clinical trials have established the benefit of medications, and as national guidelines, that recommend those therapies, but it has been well documented that this knowledge can take years to be broadly implemented into practice. The registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-Based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient Setting prospective cohort study recently demonstrated low use of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in U.S. patients with HFrEF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) were only used in 79.6% of patients, beta-blockers were only used in 86% of patients, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) were only used in 36.1% of patients. More recently, the Change the Management of Patients with Heart Failure registry has also demonstrated the need for further GDMT optimization.

To address these issues, the American College of Cardiology published an expert consensus decision pathway for optimizing heart failure (HF) treatment that recommended the use of electronic health records (EHRs) to reduce errors, improve decision support, and facilitate guideline adherence. This led our research group to create an Application Programming Interface (API) using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HFrEF guidelines. The objective of this study was to validate that the API appropriately recommended GDMT from clinical trial data and to determine if the API-generated information about medication optimization was associated with clinical outcomes.

Hospital initiation and titration of ARNI and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT): Initiation of ARNI during an acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization is feasible after hemodynamic stabilization; in PIONEER-HF, up to 25% of patients developed hypotension when treated with sacubitril/valsartan, and ensuring that patients are not volume-depleted at initiation may help avoid this. TRANSITION demonstrated that about one-half of patients could achieve the target dose within 10 weeks after in-hospital initiation or soon after discharge, and following discharge, ongoing efforts toward GDMT optimization (including titration to target doses whenever possible) should continue. STRONG HF showed that intensive and rapid initiation and titration of GDMT with in-person follow-up after hospitalization was safe and tolerated and resulted in a reduction in 180-day HF hospitalizations and/or CV deaths.

### Optimizing foundational therapies in patients with HFrEF: how Do we translate these findings into clinical care? [^117DxQTu]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the high risk of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), there is an urgent need for the initiation and titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) that can reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines are now emphasizing the need for early and rapid initiation of therapies that have cardiovascular benefit. Recognizing that there are many barriers to GDMT initiation and optimization, health care providers should aim to introduce the 4 pillars of quadruple therapy now recommended by most clinical practice guidelines: angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. A large proportion of patients with HFrEF do not have clinical contraindications to GDMT but are not treated with these therapies. Early initiation of low-dose combination therapy should be tolerated by most patients. However, patient-related factors such as hemodynamics, frailty, and laboratory values will need consideration for maximum tolerated GDMT. GDMT initiation in acute heart failure hospitalization represents another important avenue to improve use of GDMT. Finally, removal of therapies that do not have clear cardiovascular benefit should be considered to lower polypharmacy and reduce the risk of adverse side effects. Future prospective studies aimed at guiding optimal implementation of quadruple therapy are warranted to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF.

Table 27 — Women with heart failure (HF) show sex-specific patterns in risk and outcomes. In Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants with new-onset HF, odds of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) were higher in women, with EF ≥ 45% and 2.8-fold higher odds than in men. In OPTIMIZE-HF, women with acute HF had lower 1y mortality (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89–0.97) yet were more likely not to receive optimal guideline-directed medical therapy. Additional outcomes noted include overall more favorable survival than men, lower patient-reported quality of life for women with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and greater transplant waitlist mortality for women but equivalent survival after heart transplantation or LVAD implantation.
