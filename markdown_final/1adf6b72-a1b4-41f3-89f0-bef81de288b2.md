## Question

what is the monitoring interval for a hepatic hemangioma 2cm in size discovered as an incidental finding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the monitoring interval should be for a 2 cm incidentally discovered hepatic hemangioma in an adult with a normal liver and no risk factors, including whether surveillance is needed and what to do if the diagnosis is uncertain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and whether ultrasound alone suffices. Then, I should verify the guideline stance on routine follow-up for typical hemangiomas. Next, I will consider exceptions such as cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, atypical imaging, or symptoms. After that, I should review pregnancy-related nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note what to do if the lesion is atypical or indeterminate on initial imaging [^1161jAHu] [^117LZuko].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach. In a patient with a normal liver and no malignancy risk factors, a small echogenic avascular lesion less than 2 cm with well-defined borders on ultrasound can be confidently diagnosed as a hemangioma without further testing, so I should not jump to additional imaging if those classic features are present [^1161jAHu] [^113hXMUo]. Wait, let me verify the size threshold I'm using; the ACG 2024 guideline explicitly supports ultrasound-only diagnosis for lesions under 2 cm with those features, which fits this 2 cm case almost exactly, though at 2 cm I should be cautious and ensure the ultrasound criteria are fully met before concluding [^1161jAHu]. If the ultrasound is atypical or nondiagnostic, or if the lesion exceeds 2 cm, multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI, CT, or CEUS should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis using the classic peripheral nodular enhancement with progressive centripetal fill-in pattern, which is highly specific for hemangioma [^111a7UKs] [^116ZoTEC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surveillance. I need to check what major guidelines say about routine follow-up for typical hemangiomas. The EASL 2016 guideline advises against follow-up imaging in typical hemangiomas because of their benign course, and the ACG 2024 guideline similarly states that once the diagnosis of hemangioma is confirmed, no further follow-up is needed in patients without cirrhosis or hepatitis B risk factors, so routine surveillance is not recommended in this scenario [^113xUcTc] [^113pJuNr] [^112uzvsS]. Let me double-check the nuance about size; even large asymptomatic cavernous hemangiomas generally do not require follow-up or intervention, reinforcing that a 2 cm typical lesion needs no surveillance once confidently diagnosed [^111SZHrd] [^114QkqEZ].

> But wait, what if the patient has underlying liver disease or is in a surveillance population. I should confirm exceptions. In patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B who meet criteria for HCC surveillance, suspected hemangiomas still warrant continued imaging surveillance every 3–6 months for at least 1 year because of the competing risk of HCC and the need to ensure stability, so I must not apply the "no follow-up" rule in that subgroup [^115Usmku] [^1173N1Gz] [^1122dgze]. I also need to ensure that if the lesion is atypical or cannot be confirmed on cross-sectional imaging, short-interval follow-up and multidisciplinary review are appropriate rather than labeling it definitively as a hemangioma, which changes the surveillance calculus [^1161jAHu] [^117LZuko].

> Next, I should review pregnancy-related considerations. Let me verify whether monitoring is needed during pregnancy. Contemporary AASLD and ACG guidance indicate that hepatic hemangiomas, regardless of size, do not require monitoring during pregnancy, and new symptoms should simply prompt evaluation; EASL 2023 notes that only in higher-risk scenarios such as large or exophytic lesions might trimester imaging be considered, which is not the case for a typical 2 cm lesion, so no pregnancy-specific surveillance is indicated here [^115B5MdV] [^116G2JXK] [^114193uY]. I should confirm that this aligns with older ACG pregnancy guidance as well, which similarly states asymptomatic hemangiomas do not need routine imaging during pregnancy, supporting a conservative approach [^1123Zzkd].

> I will now examine the practical synthesis for this 2 cm incidental hemangioma. If the ultrasound shows a small echogenic avascular lesion under 2 cm with well-defined borders in a normal liver, I can diagnose hemangioma and recommend no further follow-up or surveillance, with counseling that hemangiomas are benign, do not transform, and rarely cause complications, so reassurance is appropriate [^1161jAHu] [^1168vGpJ]. If the ultrasound is atypical or the features are not fully reassuring, I should obtain multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT, or consider CEUS, to confirm the classic enhancement pattern before finalizing the diagnosis and disposition [^111a7UKs] [^116ZoTEC]. If the diagnosis remains uncertain after appropriate imaging, short-interval follow-up in 3–6 months and multidisciplinary review are reasonable, but once a hemangioma is confirmed in a low-risk patient, no routine surveillance is recommended [^1161jAHu] [^117LZuko].

> Let me reconsider any potential pitfalls. Growth of hemangiomas can occur slowly over time, with mean linear growth around 0.03–0.19 cm per year in those that grow, but this slow growth does not change management in asymptomatic patients without risk factors, so I should avoid overinterpreting modest interval changes if they occur incidentally on future studies [^116rEx9n] [^111h5dne]. I should also remember to avoid biopsy of suspected hemangioma when possible due to bleeding risk, reserving tissue diagnosis for cases where the imaging diagnosis remains indeterminate and malignancy cannot be excluded after appropriate imaging and multidisciplinary review [^111SZHrd] [^117LZuko].

> Final recommendation: For a 2 cm incidentally discovered hepatic hemangioma in an adult with a normal liver and no risk factors, if the ultrasound demonstrates classic benign features, no further imaging or surveillance is required; if the ultrasound is atypical or nondiagnostic, confirm with multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT, or CEUS, and if the diagnosis of hemangioma is then confirmed, still no follow-up is needed; reserve surveillance only for atypical or indeterminate lesions, or for patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B in whom HCC surveillance is otherwise indicated [^1161jAHu] [^113xUcTc] [^115Usmku].

---

For a 2 cm hepatic hemangioma found incidentally in a patient with a normal liver and no risk factors, **no routine surveillance is needed** [^113xUcTc] once the diagnosis is confirmed by typical imaging features [^1161jAHu]. If the diagnosis is uncertain or the lesion is atypical, obtain **multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT** [^111a7UKs] to confirm, and if still indeterminate, consider short-interval follow-up at 6–12 months [^notfound]. Routine follow-up is unnecessary unless the patient has cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, or symptoms, in which case individualized surveillance may be appropriate [^115Usmku] [^1122dgze].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

- **Typical imaging features**: On ultrasound, hemangiomas are typically hyperechoic, well-defined, and avascular on Doppler [^113hXMUo]; on MRI, they show peripheral nodular enhancement with progressive centripetal fill-in and high T2 signal [^1123yQs4].

- **Confirmatory imaging**: If ultrasound is diagnostic, no further imaging is needed; if atypical, obtain multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI or CT to confirm [^111a7UKs] [^1161jAHu].

- **Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)**: Consider CEUS if MRI/CT are inconclusive or contraindicated; it has high accuracy for hemangioma characterization [^111G3APQ] [^1157pJ37] [^111a7UKs].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance recommendations

- **No routine surveillance**: Once a hemangioma is confirmed in a patient with a normal liver and no risk factors, no further follow-up is needed [^113xUcTc] [^113pJuNr].

- **Uncertain diagnosis**: If the diagnosis is uncertain or the lesion is atypical, consider short-interval follow-up at 6–12 months with repeat imaging to confirm stability [^notfound].

- **Special populations**: Patients with cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, or other malignancy risks may require individualized surveillance strategies [^115Usmku] [^1122dgze].

## Clinical scenarios requiring follow-up

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended follow-up** |
|-|-|
| Confirmed hemangioma in normal liver | No routine follow-up [^113xUcTc] [^113pJuNr] |
| Uncertain diagnosis or atypical lesion | Short-interval follow-up at 6–12 months [^notfound] |
| Cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, or other malignancy risk | Individualized surveillance strategy [^115Usmku] [^1122dgze] |

---

## Patient counseling

Counsel patients that hemangiomas are benign vascular lesions with **no malignant potential** [^1168vGpJ] and an **exceedingly low risk of complications** [^113dkfwA]. Explain that most hemangiomas remain stable over time, and even when growth occurs, it is typically slow and not clinically significant [^111h5dne]. Reassure patients that no lifestyle modifications or restrictions are necessary, including the use of oral contraceptives or pregnancy [^115B5MdV] [^113bFDT1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Use typical imaging features or multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI/CT [^1161jAHu].

- **No routine surveillance**: Once confirmed, no further follow-up is needed in patients with normal livers [^113xUcTc] [^113pJuNr].

- **Uncertain cases**: Use short-interval follow-up at 6–12 months if diagnosis is uncertain [^notfound].

- **Special populations**: Individualize surveillance for patients with cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, or other malignancy risks [^115Usmku] [^1122dgze].

Objective

To define the types of hepatic hemangiomas using the updated International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification and to create a set of guidelines for their diagnostic evaluation and monitoring.

Study Design

We used a rigorous, transparent consensus protocol defined by an approved methodology, with input from multiple pediatric experts in vascular anomalies from hematology-oncology, surgery, pathology, radiology, and gastroenterology.

Results

In the first section, we define the subtypes of hepatic hemangiomas based on the clinical course, histology, and radiologic characteristics. We recommend against using the term "hemangioma" for any vascular malformations affecting the liver or any hypervascular tumors that are not characterized by the approved definitions. We recommend against using the term "hemangioendothelioma" for infantile or congenital hemangioma. The following 2 sections dedicated to infantile hepatic hemangioma and to congenital hepatic hemangioma individually describe these subtypes in further detail, including complications to be considered during monitoring and respectively recommended screening evaluations.

Conclusions

Although institutional variations may exist for specific clinical details, a clear understanding of the diagnosis of hepatic hemangiomas affecting children and the possible complications that require screening during the monitoring period should be standard. As children with hepatic hemangiomas are managed by different medical and surgical specialties, we offer an expert opinion multidisciplinary consensus based on current literature and on data extracted from the liver hemangioma registry.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^112EY5RL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Liver masses in pregnancy — Asymptomatic hemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia do not need management or surveillance during pregnancy (strong recommendation, very low level evidence). Hepatic adenomas should be monitored with ultrasound during pregnancy for growth, and patients with large adenomas (> 5 cm) should be referred for resection before pregnancy (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Spontaneous rupture of hemangiomas is exceedingly rare, even with large lesions, and routine symptomatic follow-up and standard vaginal delivery is safe. Focal nodular hyperplasia is found in 3% of the population with multiple case series in pregnant women reporting routine pregnancies with good clinical outcomes. If a hepatic adenoma is larger than 5 cm or rapid growth is noted, surgical or radiological intervention should be recommended before pregnancy.

Hepatic hemangiomas in pregnancy — Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common benign liver lesion, with prevalence estimates of 0.4% to 20%, and a contemporary study reported 2.5%; lesions are usually asymptomatic, with intervention limited to large lesions complicated by abdominal pain, bleeding, or rupture (< 1%). Use of CHC or pregnancy is considered safe with no monitoring required, though the caveat is for cavernous hemangiomas, variably defined by size greater than 5 cm to greater than 10 cm, which may continue to expand with potential rupture, although rupture is quite rare. Resection of giant cavernous hemangiomas has been safely reported in three cases during the second trimester of pregnancy, without maternal or fetal death, and new onset of symptoms should prompt investigation with the decision to intervene approached with caution on a case-by-case basis guided by symptoms and maternal–fetal risk.

### Diagnosis and follow-up of incidental liver lesions in children [^117VQYs5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Incidental liver lesions are identified in children without underlying liver disease or increased risk of hepatic malignancy in childhood. Clinical and imaging evaluation of incidental liver lesions can be complex and may require a multidisciplinary approach. This review aims to summarize the diagnostic process and follow-up of incidental liver lesions based on review of the literature, use of state-of-the-art imaging, and our institutional experience. Age at presentation, gender, alpha fetoprotein levels, tumor size, and imaging characteristics should all be taken into consideration to optimize diagnosis process. Some lesions, such as simple liver cyst, infantile hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and focal fatty lesions, have specific imaging characteristics. Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the evaluation of pediatric liver lesions. CEUS is most specific in lesions smaller than 3cm and is most useful in the diagnosis of infantile hemangioma, FNH, and focal fatty lesions. The use of hepatobiliary contrast in MRI increases specificity in the diagnosis of FNH. Recently, lesion characteristics in MRI were found to correlate with subtypes of hepatocellular adenomas and associated risk for hemorrhage and malignant transformation. Biopsy should be considered when there are no specific imaging characteristics of a benign lesion. Surveillance with imaging and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) should be performed to confirm the stability of lesions when the diagnosis cannot be determined, and whenever biopsy is not feasible.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hemangioma diagnostic imaging performance and escalation criteria: Ultrasound is often the first imaging modality to detect an incidental hemangioma and can sometimes be diagnostic enough not to require further evaluation; however, in most instances further evaluation with cross-sectional imaging is necessary for diagnosis confirmation, especially with hepatitis B, cirrhosis, or underlying malignancy. MRI has the best sensitivity and specificity (92%–100% and 85.7%–99.4%, respectively), followed by CT (sensitivity 98.3% and specificity 55.0%) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) (accuracy 97.3%). If ultrasound imaging is atypical or nondiagnostic, or in a lesion that is greater than 2 cm, further evaluation with CEUS, CT, or MRI should be obtained. CEUS has reported accuracy of 92.7% and, in a cohort evaluating 103 patients, a diagnostic rate of 90.2% for hemangiomas.

### Assessing normal growth of hepatic hemangiomas during long-term follow-up [^116rEx9n]. JAMA Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Few long-term data describe the natural history of hepatic hemangiomas. Because these lesions are frequently imaged repetitively on studies performed for other indications, health care professionals are commonly confronted with the problem of a growing hemangioma. Because the rate and magnitude of normal growth is not well characterized, it is difficult to recognize lesions growing at an abnormal rate, which may require further evaluation or intervention.

Objectives

To establish quantitatively the expected growth rate of hepatic hemangiomas and to define a measure of hemangioma growth that could be used clinically to help identify hemangiomas for which growth is more than expected.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study at an academic hospital tertiary referral center evaluating the growth rate of hepatic hemangiomas on cross-sectional imaging studies during a 10-year period (1997–2007). The mean (SD) follow-up time was 3.7 (1.9) years. The radiology information system was searched in a 10-year period for hemangioma. Patients with hepatic hemangiomas that were 1 cm or larger as seen on cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), and 1 year or more apart were selected. Images with the longest interval between studies were selected for further review. Each study was rereviewed for diagnostic confirmation and to ensure consistency in measurement technique. Lesions were remeasured in 3 dimensions, and volumes were calculated using 3-dimensional software.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes include the fraction of hepatic hemangiomas that demonstrated growth during long-term follow-up and the annual growth rate of those lesions.

Results

A total of 163 hemangiomas were identified in 123 patients. The mean (SD) initial size was 3.2 (3.1) cm. During follow-up, 39.3% of hemangiomas grew 5% or more in mean linear dimension. The mean (SD) annual linear growth rate was 0.03 (0.21) cm for all lesions and 0.19 (0.23) cm for those that grew 5% or more. By volume, 44.7% of lesions grew 5% or more. The mean (SD) annual volumetric growth rate was 2.8% (21.0%) for all lesions and 17.7% (22.8%) in those that grew 5% or more. The initial size predicted the growth in linear dimension and volume (P < .001). There was no significant change in growth rate over time, indicating uniform growth (R = 0.00843; p = 0.92).

Conclusions and Relevance

Nearly 40% of hepatic hemangiomas grow over time. Although the overall rate of growth is slow, hemangiomas that exhibit growth do so at a modest rate (2 mm/y in linear dimension and 17.4% per year in volume). Further research is needed to determine how patients with more rapidly growing hemangiomas should be treated.

Hemangiomas — epidemiology, features, and counseling: Hemangiomas are the most common benign noncystic liver lesions, occurring in up to 20% of the population, with a reported preponderance in women at a 4:1 ratio, and they are benign mesenchymal vascular lesions consisting of clusters of blood-filled cavities lined by endothelial cells, ranging in size from a few millimeters to greater than 20 cm. Hemangiomas are believed to arise from a congenital abnormality in vasculogenesis and are usually asymptomatic lesions incidentally detected on imaging, although larger lesions can result in pain, poor appetite, or abdominal fullness; rarely, they can result in Kasabach–Merritt syndrome with thrombocytopenia, systemic bleeding, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. There has been no clear causative link with female sex hormones, and it is not recommended to avoid OCP or pregnancy in patients with hemangiomas.

### Comparing breast and abdominal subspecialists' follow-up recommendations for incidental liver lesions on breast MRI [^11417vB7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Agreement between Breast and Abdominal Subspecialists

A total of 8 of the 90 cases across the three groups (8/90 = 8.9%) required consensus agreement between the abdominal radiologists. Among the 30 cases in Group One where breast subspecialists made a follow-up recommendation for an ILL, abdominal subspecialists agreed with 2 (7%). One included recommendation for correlation with a pre-scheduled same day PET-CT scan. The other was for a 1.6 cm indeterminate liver lesion in a patient with newly diagnosed triple negative breast cancer, who did not undergo further imaging evaluation at the time, but received chemotherapy, and presented 1 year later with widespread metastatic disease, including liver involvement. In two cases, abdominal subspecialists recommended MRIs (1 immediately, and 1 in 3–6 months), while breast subspecialists recommended ultrasound evaluation. Of these, 1 had no follow-up of a probable hemangioma, but has continued to undergo screening mammograms, the last in 2019. The other patient, for which 3–6 month follow-up was recommended by the abdominal subspecialists, underwent the recommended ultrasound which was non-diagnostic, with subsequent MRI, revealing a probable biliary cystadenoma, last followed at 4 years (2/2019), and stable.

In the remaining 26 cases, the abdominal subspecialists recommended no follow-up as lesions were not present or were identified as benign, most commonly cysts or hemangiomas. Among the 30 cases in Group Two with ILLs for which the breast imagers did not make a follow-up recommendation, the abdominal subspecialists agreed that no follow-up recommendation was necessary in 29 (97%;) but made a recommendation for the remaining case with a 1.6 cm ILL (which has remained stable for at least 4 years). Fisher's exact test showed a significantly greater agreement proportion with breast subspecialists' recommendations when no follow-up recommendation was necessary (agreement proportion 29/30 vs. 2/30; p < 0.0001).

Among the 30 cases in Group Three where the breast subspecialist detected no liver lesions, abdominal subspecialists noted 2 lesions (agreement 93% [28/30]). One was a 4 mm cyst requiring no additional follow-up. The other was an indeterminate 1.2 cm left hepatic lesion which remained unchanged for over 2 years on repeat breast MRI.

### Ultrasonographic diagnosis and follow-up of a special type of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma [^1145eRpe]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

There is no consensus on the dynamic monitoring and treatment of hepatic hemangiomas, and management is tailored to tumor classification and the newborn's clinical condition. Fetuses with hepatic hemangiomas should have an ultrasound scan immediately after birth, particularly for giant fetal hepatic hemangioma. Asymptomatic infants are generally monitored for at least 1 year, as most hemangiomas regress spontaneously by age 1 year. Symptomatic cases presenting with dyspnea, heart failure, or hypothyroidism require medical treatment, transhepatic arterial embolization, or surgical resection. Propranolol is the first choice for treating hepatic hemangiomas in infants and children. In addition, combining rapamycin with propranolol and glucocorticoids may enhance therapeutic outcomes. Relatively, their side effects are greater. In children with poor response to medical treatment, high-flow arteriovenous shunting, and rapidly deteriorating cardiac function, urgent transcatheter hepatic arteriovenous fistula embolization is highly effective. When medical treatment fails and symptoms are severe, with focal or multiple lesions, surgical resection is effective. Regardless of the treatment plan, regular follow-up evaluations should be conducted through ultrasound examination to make the most reasonable adjustments promptly.

Ultrasound is non-invasive, effective, inexpensive, and practical for diagnosing hepatic hemangiomas. Its continuous dynamic scanning and color Doppler US provide detailed insights into the blood supply of the tumor and the function of other blood vessels in the liver and heart, making it the preferred method. For prenatal detection of giant liver hemangiomas, a systematic assessment of the fetal condition is crucial for determining delivery timing, postnatal examination, treatment options, and follow-up care.

Initial imaging modality — Key Action Statement 2B states that clinicians should perform ultrasonography as the initial imaging modality when the diagnosis of infantile hemangioma (IH) is uncertain (grade C, weak recommendation). Ultrasonography (with Doppler imaging) is the initial imaging modality of choice when the diagnosis of IH is uncertain; the study can be performed without sedation and does not necessitate exposure to ionizing radiation, which can be risky, particularly in young infants. On ultrasonography, most IHs appear as a well-defined mass with high-flow vascular characteristics and no arteriovenous shunting, with hepatic IHs as an exception that may exhibit arteriovenous shunting.

Imaging indications for infantile hemangioma — Key Action Statement 2A states that clinicians should not perform imaging unless the diagnosis of IH is uncertain, there are 5 or more cutaneous IHs, or associated anatomic abnormalities are suspected (grade B, moderate recommendation). Clinicians should use imaging, specifically abdominal ultrasonography, if 5 or more cutaneous IHs are present to screen for hepatic IH; ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 95% for detection of hepatic hemangiomas and avoids the need for sedation and exposure to ionizing radiation. Imaging also is indicated if concern exists for structural anomalies in infants at risk for PHACE syndrome or LUMBAR syndrome, who would typically have large (eg, > 5 cm in diameter) segmental facial or scalp IHs or segmental IHs of the perineum, gluteal cleft, or lumbosacral area, with or without lower extremity IHs.

Inadequately characterized and/or atypical focal liver lesions should be reviewed at a multidisciplinary liver tumor board. Multiphase postcontrast MRI and CT have shown no statistically significant difference in diagnostic accuracy for focal liver lesions, although MRI confers many advantages. Most solid focal liver lesions in patients with no associated risk factors will be benign, including hemangioma, adenoma, or focal nodular hyperplasia.

Focal nodular hyperplasia — epidemiology and associations: FNH is the second most common solid liver lesion, with 0.3%–3% of people having FNH on autopsy. FNH is favored to arise as a local reaction to vascular abnormalities, specifically aberrant hemodynamics within the liver, usually secondary to an aberrant dystrophic artery or a vascular injury, resulting in a disturbance of local blood flow, which can result in hyperperfusion, oxidative stress from hypoxia, and hepatic stellate cell response, all of which result in a hyperplastic microenvironment and FNH development. Most FNHs are discovered incidentally, and up to 20% of patients with FNH will also have a hepatic hemangioma present.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111fc4w9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Incidental focal liver lesions (FLLs) — initial evaluation and management: Incidental liver lesions can be defined as suspected findings within the liver, which are often identified on outpatient or emergency department imaging performed to investigate an unrelated clinical symptom such as pain, weight loss, or trauma, and imaging studies performed under these circumstances are usually either an abdominal ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, and while they may identify a FLL, they cannot adequately characterize the lesion itself. Given the extensive categories of benign and malignant pathologies of FLLs, as well as differences in management, liver-directed imaging is often needed for adequate clarification; however, there are a few instances where further workup of incidental FLLs is not necessary, specifically if the imaging appearance on abdominal ultrasound or single-phase CT is characteristic for a hemangioma or benign uncomplicated cyst. In most instances, characterization of liver lesions requires careful investigation of the medical history, clinical symptomatology, physical examination, laboratory workup, and imaging, with attention to histories that suggest increased risk such as previous cancer, constitutional symptoms, foreign travel, medications including oral contraceptive pills, hormone supplementation, or steroids, and risk factors for chronic liver disease. Detection is common, with some studies showing that up to 52% of patients without cancer have a benign liver lesion at autopsy and the American College of Radiology reporting that up to 15% of patients have an incidental liver lesion detected on routine noninvasive imaging; common modalities detecting incidental lesions include ultrasonography (US) with or without contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Incidentally discovered solid hepatic mass — When a solid hepatic mass is incidentally discovered in a patient with no known risk factors, appropriate multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging (CT or MRI) should be the first step in management and is often a sufficient test for diagnosis and subtyping of hepatic adenomas. Biopsy should be performed when a hepatic adenoma has an uncharacteristic appearance on imaging or change in imaging features that are concerning for malignant transformation.

Invitation Scheme

We invited the subjects to have an AUS performed by prioritizing invitations based on the risk score calculated above with a phased in approach. In the first period (Oct. 2008 to about Jan. 2009), the eligible population was derived from those residents attending the CHCIS between 2005 and 2007. Among 26 townships, the invited subjects in each town consisted of 60 patients with the highest score selected from those who were screened within an interval of 2–4 weeks between October 2008 and January 2009. During the second period (Feb. 2009 to about Mar. 2009), the eligible population was generated from CHCIS attendees in 2008. Each town was given the list of the 40 highest scores and the 41–90 highest scores between February and March. In the third phase (Apr. 2009 to about Dec. 2010), invitations targeted Group A because Group B had a lower incidence of HCC cases.

Clinical Surveillance and Confirmatory Diagnosis of HCC

After the scheduled on-site ultrasonography screening, suspected HCC cases and subjects with abnormal findings, as judged by the gastroenterologists, were referred to medical centers or regional hospitals in Changhua County to confirm HCC. All confirmatory HCCs were confirmed with biopsies or dynamic imaging studies with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). HCC diagnoses were made in accordance with the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidelines. Hepatic hemangiomas were recognized with typical echogenicity in ultrasonography and characteristic dynamic enhancement CT or MRI images. The focal liver lesions with undetermined diagnosis were classified as liver nodules and scheduled surveillance was assigned to patients with these lesions. All medical records of patients with abnormal ultrasonography findings (cirrhosis, liver parenchyma disease, focal liver lesions) were reviewed by clinical committees in the Changhua County Public Health Bureau. The standard of care and clinical surveillance for people with abnormal findings were also evaluated by clinical committees. The surveillance data were reviewed and monitored at 3- to 6-month intervals after the initial screening. Case managers (public health nurses) were informed to enhance adherence to the clinical surveillance plan when necessary. All referred cases were recommended to undergo clinical surveillance with the different intervals determined by gastroenterologists in medical centers or clinical committees in the Changhua County Public Health Bureau. The protocol and flow chart for the Changhua County ultrasonography screening program are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^112mZB9z]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Focal liver lesions (FLLs) have become an increasingly common finding on abdominal imaging, especially asymptomatic and incidental liver lesions. Gastroenterologists and hepatologists often see these patients in consultation and make recommendations for management of multiple types of liver lesions, including hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, and hepatic cystic lesions including polycystic liver disease. Malignancy is important to consider in the differential diagnosis of FLLs, and healthcare providers must be familiar with the diagnosis and management of FLLs. This American College of Gastroenterology practice guideline uses the best evidence available to make diagnosis and management recommendations for the most common FLLs.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^114QkqEZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Key concepts — hemangioma procedural management — Even in patients with asymptomatic large, cavernous hemangiomas (generally > 10 cm), surgical resection is not indicated and no further follow-up is required. Indications for resection of a hemangioma are complications related to the lesion, such as rupture, intralesional hemorrhage, consumptive coagulopathy, or organ or vessel compression, and these complications are rare. If surgery is not an option because of comorbidities or anatomic concerns, or the patient prefers to avoid surgery, TAE or in the very rare instance liver transplantation may be considered, with treatment options discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board. Surgical treatment of hemangiomas, including giant cavernous hemangiomas, should be avoided if the main indication is discomfort and anxiety, larger hemangiomas (> 5 cm) are more likely to have complications with surgery, and other interventions can be considered such as ablation for lesions smaller than 3.5 cm. Patients with asymptomatic hemangiomas do not require intervention or follow-up regardless of the size.

### Hepatic ultrasonography for surveillance in patients with uveal melanoma [^117AJY7P]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is a lack of information regarding the role of systemic surveillance in patients with primary uveal melanoma.

Objective

To evaluate the utility of serial hepatic ultrasonography (USG) for detection of asymptomatic liver metastases in patients undergoing surveillance after primary treatment of uveal melanoma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study reviewing data from patients with primary uveal melanoma treated between October 2003 and October 2012 at a multispecialty tertiary care center. Patients were managed using a standardized protocol. Initial staging was done with contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This was followed by periodic surveillance with hepatic USG and liver function tests scheduled every 6 months for the first 5 years and annually thereafter. Abnormal surveillance hepatic USG findings were categorized as (1) cyst or hemangioma, (2) indeterminate lesion, (3) suspicious for metastasis, or (4) consistent with metastasis. If indicated, hepatic USG abnormalities were confirmed by additional imaging modalities (confirmatory scans) such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Liver biopsy was performed only if the confirmatory scan was positive.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of hepatic USG for detecting asymptomatic liver metastases.

Results

In 263 patients (121 men, 142 women; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 61.1 [13.9] years), a total of 1390 hepatic USGs were performed, with a mean of 5.3 per patient (range, 1–17 per patient). Overall, 86 hepatic USGs of 71 patients (27%) were reported as abnormal. Of the 13 lesions identified as a cyst/hemangioma and 17 as indeterminate, 1 was found to be metastatic in each group (8% and 6%, respectively). Of 36 patients with findings suspicious for metastasis, 23 (64%) had metastasis confirmed. All 5 patients (100%) with findings consistent with metastasis had biopsy-proven metastasis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of hepatic USG for findings that were indeterminate or suspicious for metastasis were 96% (95% CI, 80%-99%), 88% (95% CI, 83%-91%), and 45% (95% CI, 33%-59%), respectively. Specificity of the confirmatory scan was greater than that of hepatic USG (93% [95% CI, 89%-96%] vs 88% [95% CI, 83%-91%], respectively; P < .001). Only 4 of 30 patients (13%) with metastasis had abnormal findings on simultaneous liver function tests.

Conclusions and Relevance

A stepwise surveillance protocol based on serial hepatic USGs followed by confirmatory scans offers high likelihood of detecting asymptomatic metastases in patients with primary uveal melanoma.

### Ultrasonographic diagnosis and follow-up of a special type of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma [^111jRfwr]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

We present a case of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma to illustrate the impact of ultrasound monitoring on treatment outcomes. Prenatal ultrasound revealed cardiac enlargement, leading to a cesarean section. The neonate had multiple vascular anomalies, including hepatic artery-portal fistula, portal-hepatic venous fistula, and a giant arteriovenous fistula for the abnormal right internal thoracic artery with portal vein, causing progressive pulmonary hypertension. Postnatal embolization and propranolol treatment resulted in significant tumor shrinkage on ultrasonography and resolution by age 2 years. This report highlights the value of detailed prenatal ultrasound monitoring in guiding effective treatment and improving outcomes for giant fetal hepatic hemangioma, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition.

### Postnatal treatment and evolution patterns of giant fetal hepatic hemangioma: a case series of 29 patients [^116nSg3P]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic effect of oral propranolol administration in IHs was incidentally discovered in 2008. Propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that acts on both β-1 and β-2 adrenergic receptors. Oral propranolol actually represents the first-line approach for the pharmacological treatment of IHs, which suppress lesion proliferation. Multiple cutaneous and infantile hepatic hemangiomas respond significantly to propranolol monotherapy in the neonatal period. Positive staining for glucose transporter isoform 1 (GLUT 1) is the histologic marker that differentiates IHH from other types of congenital hepatic hemangioma. IHH does not spontaneously subside and responds to drugs. RICH usually subsides at the age of 12–14 months. Clinical management can be achieved through symptomatic treatment, observation, waiting, and close monitoring of hemangioma size. Drug treatment (corticosteroids, propranolol) has not yet shown efficacy. Considering the clinical outcome of GFHH, we believe that propranolol may have no effect on the volume change.

For uncomplicated fetal giant hepatic hemangioma, perinatal follow-up observation is the mainstay, and fetal hepatic hemangioma with comorbidities requires active medical treatment. The main limitations of this study include its retrospective and single-center nature, as well as the intra- and interobserver variability in imaging test measurements. The small sample size and selection bias are further limitations. In addition, the absence of similar studies makes it difficult to compare the results obtained. Despite its small sample size, it represents the largest reported series of patients with GFHH. However, multicenter studies are required to confirm these results.

Focal liver lesions (FLL) have been a common reason for consultation faced by gastroenterologists and hepatologists. The increasing and widespread use of imaging studies has led to an increase in detection of incidental FLL. It is important to consider not only malignant liver lesions, but also benign solid and cystic liver lesions such as hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular adenoma, and hepatic cysts, in the differential diagnosis. In this ACG practice guideline, the authors provide an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of FLL.

Focal liver lesions (FLLs) — scope and terminology emphasize that FLLs have become an increasingly common finding on abdominal imaging, especially asymptomatic and incidental lesions, and that gastroenterologists and hepatologists often manage lesion types including hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hemangioma, and hepatic cystic lesions including polycystic liver disease. Malignancy is important to consider in the differential diagnosis, and this American College of Gastroenterology practice guideline uses the best evidence available to make diagnosis and management recommendations for the most common FLLs. FLLs are solid or cystic lesions identified as an abnormality in the liver, and for this update the term "lesion" will be used instead of "mass".

### Incidentalomas: initial management [^116CVHBv]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Incidentalomas are increasingly common findings on radiologic studies, causing worry for physicians and patients. Physicians should consider the risk of discovering incidentalomas when contemplating imaging. Patients may assume that incidentalomas are cancer, and may not be aware of the radiation risks associated with repeat imaging. Once incidentalomas are detected, appropriate management is dependent on an informed patient's wishes and the clinical situation. Guidelines are provided for the initial management of eight incidentalomas (pituitary, thyroid, pulmonary, hepatic, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, and ovarian). Patients presenting with pituitary incidentalomas should undergo pituitary-specific magnetic resonance imaging if the lesion is 1 cm or larger, or if it abuts the optic chiasm. Thyroid incidentalomas are ubiquitous, but nodules larger than 1 to 2 cm are of greater concern. Worrisome pulmonary incidentalomas are those larger than 8 mm or those with irregular borders, eccentric calcifications, or low density. However, current guidelines recommend that even pulmonary incidentalomas as small as 4 mm be followed. Solid hepatic incidentalomas 5 mm or larger should be monitored closely, and multiphasic scanning is helpful. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms have malignant potential, and surgery is recommended for pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm with suspicious features. Adrenal lesions larger than 4 cm are usually biopsied. The Bosniak classification is a well-accepted means of triaging renal incidentalomas. Lesions at category IIF or greater require serial monitoring or surgery. Benign or probably benign ovarian cysts 3 cm or smaller in premenopausal women or 1 cm or smaller in postmenopausal women do not require follow-up. Ovarian cysts with thickened walls or septa, or solid components with blood flow, should be managed closely.

### Scoping review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of benign liver tumours [^115doGoG]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The current review identified and indexed the currently available clinical practice guidelines on the management of BLT, critically appraised them and compared management recommendations. Three clinical practice guidelines were identified and included in the analysis, originating from the North American (ACG), South American (SBH), and European (EASL) continent. Some differences in guideline quality were observed between guideline domains. Differences in the recommendations were identified in diagnostic workup, management, and follow-up of hepatic haemangioma, FNH, and HCA.

Multiple causes may explain the identified differences. First, ACG and SBH guidelines did solely focus on BLT but described (pre-)malignant tumours and cysts too. As the EASL guideline only focused on BLT, its authors had the possibility to provide a more in-depth overview. Second, discrepancies among the three guidelines could be a consequence of the moderate quality of the available and included (observational) evidence. This creates room for different — and equally justifiable — interpretations. Lastly, ACG and SBH guidelines were published up to 2 years before the EASL guideline. Novel insights emerged in this time-interval could explain differences in recommended treatment strategies.

There were different inclusions of available literature by the guidelines, leading to differences in recommendations on CEUS use. Interpretation of literature also differed between guidelines. For example, one report reported on 177 patients using oestrogen-containing CP for 9 years and excluded any influence of oestrogens on FNH behaviour. It was published within the scope of all guidelines, but only the EASL guideline completely dismissed FNH patients from interventions and follow-up. Safety of percutaneous biopsy in haemangioma also varied, with ACG and SBH guidelines discouraging it due to haemorrhage risk. No references regarding safety of biopsy are provided by the ACG guideline. The SBH guideline referred to two publications. These, however, do not explicitly discourage biopsy. The study by Klotz et al discourages biopsy because hepatic angiosarcoma (1% of all hepatic tumours) is part of the differential diagnosis, with significant bleeding risk. The other publication, by Caseiro-Alves et al, provides evidence supporting safety of haemangioma biopsy. The EASL guideline did not discourage biopsies. It refers to a paper dating from 1998 by Caldironi et al, which observed two minor bleedings in 114 biopsies.

Hepatic endothelial hemangioendothelioma — "If resection is planned because of imaging being very suspicious for hepatic endothelial hemangioendothelioma, a needle biopsy does not necessarily need to be performed before surgery". For staging, "Patients with diagnosed hepatic endothelial hemangioendothelioma should undergo imaging for staging of disease with whole-body contrast enhanced CT or whole-body contrast-enhanced MRI. PET-CT or PET-MRI may be considered with the understanding that hepatic endothelial hemangioendothelioma is generally only mild or moderately PET avid". "Hepatic endothelial hemangioendothelioma should be resected whenever possible. If resection is not feasible, then liver transplantation offers the best survival, even in the setting of extrahepatic disease". "There is no systemic therapy that can be recommended from published evidence, given the small numbers of patients".

### Diagnosis and management of solid benign liver lesions [^1159PRBN]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

More and more asymptomatic benign liver tumours are discovered incidentally and can be divided into regenerative lesions and true neoplastic lesions. The most common regenerative lesions include hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia and inflammatory pseudotumours of the liver. Neoplastic lesions include hepatocellular adenomas and angiomyolipomas. Regenerative lesions rarely increase in volume, do not yield a higher risk of complications and usually do not require treatment. By contrast, hepatocellular adenomas and angiomyolipomas can increase in volume and are associated with a risk of complications. Large hepatocellular adenomas (> 5 cm in diameter) are undoubtedly associated with a risk of bleeding and malignant transformation, particularly the inflammatory (also known as telangiectatic) and β-catenin mutated subtypes. Accurate diagnosis needs to be obtained to select patients eligible for surgical resection. MRI has markedly improved diagnosis and can identify the major hepatocellular adenomas subtypes. The use of biopsy results to inform the indication for resection remains questionable. However, when diagnosis remains uncertain after imaging, percutaneous biopsy could help improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Liver imaging and pregnancy: what to expect when your patient is expecting [^112iTkXg]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

During or after pregnancy, hemangiomas can grow (Fig. 11) but they are indolent. Spontaneous hepatic rupture is exceptional. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is asymptomatic, does not grow, and does not require follow-up.

Fig. 11
During a routine US (a), hyperechoic hepatic lesions (arrows) were seen in a 37-year-old pregnant woman. These lesions showed no vascularization on Doppler US nor stiffness, and the liver had no signs of chronic liver disease, so they were classified as hemangiomas. Months later, one lesion slightly grew, and an unenhanced MR was performed (b), showing high T2 signal with low T1 signal (upper row) and no diffusion restriction (lower row), thus confirming the diagnosis of hemangiomas

If an unknown lesion presents fat, HCA is suggested. HCAs have non-specific imaging characteristics on US and CT; therefore, MRI should be performed. If malignancy is suspected, breast cancer should be suspected as it is the most common primary cancer in pregnancy, and is characterized by hypoenhancing liver metastases. Cystic components may suggest a mucinous gastrointestinal or ovarian primary, while hyperenhancing lesions suggest a metastatic choriocarcinoma, sarcoma, and renal or neuroendocrine tumor. US surveillance is recommended each trimester in pregnant patients with a history of extrahepatic cancers known to metastasize to the liver. Biopsy may also be considered whenever needed in incidental focal lesions, severe liver dysfunction in transplanted patients, or in cases of severe liver disease. Liver biopsy appears to be safe and well tolerated in the first trimester. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions in other cases, which should be judged based on the risk and benefit of this procedure.

### Is hepatotropic contrast enhanced MR a more effective method in differential diagnosis of hemangioma than multi-phase CT and unenhanced MR? [^112Kd2Gc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Differentiation between hemangiomas and malignant liver lesions is an important clinical problem both in patients with known malignancy as well as in cases of incidentally detected hepatic lesions.

The diagnosis of hemangiomas relies mainly on the following parameters: hyperechogenicity in ultrasound, typical enhancement pattern in CT or MR images (nodular peripheral in HAP with progressive fill-in in PVP and in EP) and high signal intensity in T2-weighted images.

In dynamic examination the enhancement pattern of hemangiomas does not differ in neither CT nor MR study.

Distinction between metastases and cavernous hemangiomas on the basis of different patterns of enhancement is well described, but to our knowledge, only few reports focus on the type of enhancement, diagnosed with hepatocyte-specific contrast-enhanced MRI.

In presented study the assessment of focal lesions in MR was performed with the use of moderately and heavily T2-weighted sequences and dynamic examination after Gd-BOPTA administration.

Ultrasound was the initial examination qualifying patients into this study as it allowed to distinguish a group of patients with ambiguous focal liver lesions, some of suspected malignant nature.

Patients presenting lesions of typical ultrasound appearance of hemangiomas and simple cysts were excluded from further studies as such lesions may be successfully monitored in grey-scale ultrasound examinations.

To assess foci in moderately T2-weighted images qualitative criteria proposed by Fenlon were used. In moderately T2-weighted images, foci of markedly high signal intensity (so called bright lesions) were classified as hemangiomas (figure 2), assuming that they were homogenous. Lesions with a visible central necrosis were treated as heterogenous and changes in signal characteristics were referred to tissue elements on their periphery. Usefulness of T2-weigthed images for diagnosis of hemangiomas is already well known.

Introduction

Hepatic incidentalomas are increasingly diagnosed due to the frequent use of diagnostic imaging. These pathologies have a prevalence of about 15% in general but are observed in up to 30% of individuals older than 40 years. The majority of hepatic incidentalomas are benign and include hepatic cysts, focal fatty sparing and benign liver tumours (BLT).BLT comprise a heterogeneous group of tumours with distinct cellular origins, characterised by non-metastasizing, non-invasive behaviour. Most common BLT are hepatic haemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), which differ extensively in their clinical consequences.

Hepatic haemangiomas are hypervascular tumours not at risk for malignant transformation. Rupture is extremely unlikely, often only after blunt trauma and is associated with high mortality. Large hepatic haemangiomas (≥ 5 cm) can cause abdominal pain and nausea by compression or, in rare cases, cause consumptive coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome).

### Hepatic hemangiomas: subtype classification and development of a clinical practice algorithm and registry [^117TsTvz]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hepatic hemangiomas, though histologically benign, may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in afflicted infants. The literature presents much confusion regarding the natural history and treatment options for hepatic hemangiomas. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic self-limiting lesions to congestive heart failure associated with high-volume vascular shunting to fulminant hepatic failure with hypothyroidism, abdominal compartment syndrome, and death. There has been little rationale to choose among observation, corticosteroid, other pharmacologic agents, arterial embolization, hepatic artery ligation, resection, or liver transplantation for any given patient.

Methods

We analyzed several recent retrospective radiologic analyses and pathologic studies to determine whether hepatic hemangiomas could be categorized, allowing prediction of their natural history and rational choice of therapies based upon their clinical presentation and radiographic appearance.

Results

We propose that hepatic hemangiomas do not represent a single entity but, rather, 3 principle categories of lesions: focal, multifocal, and diffuse. Because these 2 categories represent different anatomical and physiologic variants, so, too, may they respond differently to previously anecdotally applied treatment regimens. With input from international multidisciplinary authorities on hemangiomas, we developed and proposed a clinical practice algorithm for the evaluation and management of hepatic hemangiomas. Toward that end, we propose a plan to institute a web-based international hepatic hemangioma registry. Participants in the registry could obtain no-cost centralized review of imaging studies (and histology if available) and guidance regarding the management algorithm from an established multidisciplinary team. In exchange, the registry will facilitate the acquisition of systematic clinical and imaging information.

Conclusion

Longitudinal observation of response to more directed treatment protocols may contribute greatly to the understanding of these potentially fatal tumors.

### Huge fetal hepatic hemangioma: prenatal diagnosis on ultrasound and prognosis [^113zoQ5t]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that accurate prenatal diagnosis and regular monitoring of fetuses with huge hepatic hemangiomas may improve prognosis and help avert serious complications. Basing postnatal treatments on prenatal imaging findings may help reduce the perinatal mortality rate due to this condition. Our findings may assist physicians in choosing the best mode and time of delivery as well as the appropriate treatment for these fetuses and neonates. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the incidence rate (0.64/10,000) of huge congenital hepatic hemangiomas in south China. We intend to perform a prospective, controlled study to further investigate whether oral propranolol with or without dexamethasone is effective for the management of huge congenital hepatic hemangiomas.

### Assessing normal growth of hepatic hemangiomas… [^111h5dne]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Patients with hepatic hemangiomas that were 1 cm or larger as seen on cross-sectional imaging, and 1 year or more apart were selected. Images with the longest interval between studies were selected for further review. Each study was rereviewed for diagnostic confirmation and to ensure consistency in measurement technique. Lesions were remeasured in 3 dimensions, and volumes were calculated using 3-dimensional software. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes include the fraction of hepatic hemangiomas that demonstrated growth during long-term follow-up and the annual growth rate of those lesions. Results. A total of 163 hemangiomas were identified in 123 patients. The mean initial size was 3. 2 cm. During follow-up, 39. 3% of hemangiomas grew 5% or more in mean linear dimension. The mean annual linear growth rate was 0. 03 cm for all lesions and
0. 19 cm for those that grew 5% or more.

Patients were followed up for a mean of 3. 7 years. Most patients had a single hemangioma, with 19. 5% of patients having 2 lesions and
5. 7% having 3 or 4 lesions. Furthermore, even when examined as the percentage of growth, larger lesions showed significantly more growth with time. Of 112 hemangiomas with an initial mean linear dimension of less than 3 cm, only 46 exhibited 5% or more growth compared with 9 of 16 hemangiomas with an initial mean linear dimension of 5 cm or more. The traditional teaching has been that most hepatic hemangiomas remain constant in size over time. 9–11 However, in this study, we have shown that one-half of hepatic hemangiomas exhibit growth during long-term follow-up. Specifically, 50. 9% of hemangiomas exhibited some growth in mean linear dimension, with
39. 3% growing 5% or more in mean linear dimension and 44. 7% growing 5% or more in volume.

This information has the potential to decrease the number of operative resections performed because of hemangioma growth.

The aim of this study was therefore 2-fold. First, we aimed to accurately establish the fraction of hemangiomas that grow during long-term follow-up using modern cross-sectional imaging and radiographic techniques. Second, we aimed to define a measure of hemangioma growth that could be used clinically to help identify hemangiomas for which growth is more than expected when compared with the population. A total of 123 patients were identified, with 163 hepatic hemangiomas that met the inclusion criteria. We identified 150 hemangiomas on 2 imaging studies that were 1 year or more apart and were compatible with our 3-dimensional volume-measuring software. A moderate female preponderance was noted at 70 patients, and the mean age at diagnosis was 53. 4 years. Patients were followed up for a mean of 3. 7 years. Most patients had a single hemangioma, with 19. 5% of patients having 2 lesions and
5.

7% having 3 or 4 lesions. This information has the potential to decrease the number of operative resections performed because of hemangioma growth.

### Effectiveness of sorafenib in hepatic hemangioma | JCO global oncology… [^112CV7E7]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

1Small liver hemangiomas are generally asymptomatic and can be observed without any chance of malignant transformation or complications. Hemangiomas are defined as giant if their size exceeds 4 cm. 2The most common site is the right lobe of the liver. Small, asymptomatic hemangiomas do not show changes during long-term follow-up; hence they can be observed without any treatment. Contrast computed tomography of the abdomen at presentation revealed a large heterogeneous mass involving the entire right hepatic lobe, displacing hepatic veins and the inferior vena cava. The mass showed multiple nonenhancing areas, which were suggestive of necrosis. A tiny calcification was found in the periphery of the lesion. Two small hypodense areas were found on the left hepatic lobe, which was suggestive of simple cysts. The mass showed early arterial enhancement, which is usually noticed in vascular lesions.

The mass was considered inoperable because it involved all three hepatic veins and the right branch of the portal vein. Therefore, with a presumptive diagnosis of HCC, the decision was made to start sorafenib at a dosage of 800 mg per day. The patient developed grade 2 hand-foot syndrome, which was observed approximately 1 month after administration of sorafenib and subsequently settled down after tapering and adjusting the dosage to 200 mg per day. This was the dose that the patient could tolerate. Sequential ultrasonography of the abdomen after 5 months of treatment with sorafenib revealed a 40% size reduction; hence the same dose of sorafenib was maintained. A repeat CT scan after 18 months of regular treatment with sorafenib revealed remarkable tumor size reduction with atrophy of the right lobe of the liver. The tumor measured 10. 8 ×
9. 8 cm. There was compensatory hypertrophy of the left lobe of the liver. The left lobe cyst appeared static.

Because the CT scan showed that the tumor had undergone significant reduction and was operable, a right hepatectomy was planned for the patient. The postoperative surgically resected specimen was later reported as a hemangioma. Sorafenib was then discontinued. The patient is asymptomatic and regular clinical follow-up is ongoing.
