## Question

What is the best pharmacologic therapy for NAFLD?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the best pharmacologic therapy for NAFLD is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease spectrum and who actually needs pharmacotherapy. Then, I should verify which agents have the strongest evidence and what outcomes they improve. Next, I will review safety, contraindications, and special populations. After that, I need to check what to avoid and why. Finally, I will integrate a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and acknowledge emerging therapies and the role of lifestyle, which remains foundational even when drugs are used.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: NAFLD spans simple steatosis to NASH with fibrosis, and only those with biopsy-proven NASH and at least stage 2 fibrosis (or high-risk features) are generally considered for liver-directed pharmacotherapy, because simple steatosis has an excellent prognosis and does not warrant drug therapy by itself [^bfee9d3c] [^26dde287] [^a30dfba6].

> Wait, let me verify the core principle before jumping to drugs: lifestyle modification with weight loss, Mediterranean-style diet, and regular physical activity is first-line for all patients, and pharmacotherapy is adjunctive for those with NASH and fibrosis who fail lifestyle alone or need additional benefit, so I should not overstate any drug as "best" without anchoring it to lifestyle and risk stratification [^a30dfba6] [^1f6d25dd] [^d95f6348].

> I will now examine the agents with the most consistent histologic benefit in NASH. Pioglitazone has randomized evidence showing improved NASH resolution in non-diabetic adults, with meta-analytic support for steatosis and inflammation, though fibrosis benefit is modest and not guaranteed, and weight gain and fluid retention are notable risks; guidelines allow consideration in biopsy-proven NASH, including patients with diabetes, but long-term safety in NASH remains uncertain [^7b9b572a] [^4c194504] [^8e0d5415].

> Next, I should review vitamin E. High-dose α-tocopherol 800 IU/day improved NASH resolution in non-diabetic adults in PIVENS and is guideline-supported for this subgroup, but it does not improve fibrosis and carries long-term safety concerns; importantly, it is not recommended for patients with diabetes, NAFLD without biopsy, or cirrhosis, so I need to be precise about eligibility [^c24567fc] [^981ad166] [^4c194504].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Semaglutide in a phase 2 trial showed higher NASH resolution rates versus placebo, with weight loss likely mediating benefit; however, fibrosis improvement was not statistically significant, and current guidance positions GLP-1 RAs as reasonable for their approved indications (T2DM/obesity) in NASH given cardiometabolic benefit, rather than as a liver-specific therapy, so I should not overclaim antifibrotic effects [^bd5dcf43] [^4c194504] [^8e0d5415].

> Let me consider the newest option. Resmetirom (Rezdiffra) became the first FDA-approved therapy in 2024 for adults with noncirrhotic NASH and moderate to advanced fibrosis (F2–F3), showing significantly higher rates of NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement versus placebo at 12 months; I should confirm that this applies to noncirrhotic disease and that it is used with diet and exercise, and I need to remember that long-term clinical outcomes are still being studied [^7aba3a7f].

> But wait, what about obeticholic acid? I initially thought it was FDA-approved, but hold on, I should verify — obeticholic acid showed histologic improvements in the FLINT trial and subsequent studies, yet it is not currently approved for NASH, so I must not list it among approved options even though it remains investigational for some patients [^4f3162af].

> I need to ensure I clearly state what to avoid. Metformin, ursodeoxycholic acid, DPP-4 inhibitors, omega-3 fatty acids, ezetimibe, and silymarin should not be used to treat NASH because they lack meaningful histologic benefit; statins are not for treating NASH per se but are indicated for cardiovascular risk reduction and are safe in NAFLD/NASH, including compensated cirrhosis, with caution in decompensated disease [^9287d87e] [^4c194504] [^a1b0f685].

> Let me synthesize a risk-stratified answer. For low-risk patients with simple steatosis or F0–F1 fibrosis, no liver-directed pharmacotherapy is recommended; management is lifestyle-only. For high-risk patients with biopsy-proven NASH and F2–F3 fibrosis, resmetirom is now the first approved option and can be considered alongside lifestyle; pioglitazone or vitamin E remain reasonable off-label alternatives in selected adults without diabetes, with shared decision-making about benefits and risks. For patients with T2DM, prioritizing GLP-1 RAs or pioglitazone for their metabolic and liver effects is sensible, while remembering that GLP-1 RAs are not yet approved specifically for NASH. In compensated cirrhosis, statins are appropriate for cardiovascular risk, but disease-specific pharmacotherapy data are limited and resmetirom was not studied in cirrhosis, so I should be cautious and individualize decisions [^a30dfba6] [^4c194504] [^8e0d5415] [^7aba3a7f].

> I should double-check special populations. In pediatrics, vitamin E is the only agent with supportive histologic data in NASH, and biopsy confirmation is required before pharmacotherapy; metformin does not improve histology and should not be used as a liver-directed therapy in children with NASH [^e90ad64e] [^e336ae71].

> Next, I should review emerging directions. Combination therapy targeting metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic pathways is a key strategy under investigation to overcome modest monotherapy response rates, and ongoing trials will clarify which combinations are safe and effective; until then, I need to avoid extrapolating beyond available data [^46a54f36] [^f026dfc4].

> Finally, I need to emphasize that even when pharmacotherapy is used, sustained weight loss and cardiometabolic risk reduction remain essential to improve liver outcomes and overall survival; without lifestyle change, drug effects are likely attenuated, so the "best" therapy is best understood as lifestyle plus a carefully selected, evidence-based pharmacologic adjunct in the right patients, with resmetirom now offering the most definitive option for noncirrhotic NASH with significant fibrosis [^a30dfba6] [^7aba3a7f].

---

The best pharmacologic therapy for NAFLD is **lifestyle modification first** [^a30dfba6] (weight loss, Mediterranean diet, exercise) for all patients, with pharmacotherapy reserved for those with biopsy-proven NASH and fibrosis [^bfee9d3c]. Among medications, **pioglitazone or vitamin E** are the most evidence-based options for NASH with fibrosis [^4c194504], but neither is FDA-approved for NAFLD/NASH and both have modest efficacy and safety concerns [^4c194504]. GLP-1 agonists (e.g. semaglutide) are promising for NASH resolution and cardiometabolic benefit [^bd5dcf43] but are not yet approved for NASH [^4c194504]. No single drug is superior for all patients; **individualize therapy** based on fibrosis stage, diabetes, and risk profile, and prioritize lifestyle and comorbidity management [^2ac90809].

---

## Lifestyle modifications: cornerstone of therapy

Lifestyle modification is the **foundation of NAFLD management** [^a30dfba6], with weight loss, dietary changes, and physical activity providing significant histologic and biochemical improvements [^172b4966].

- **Weight loss**: Aim for 3–5% weight loss to improve steatosis; 7–10% for NASH resolution and fibrosis regression [^a30dfba6].
- **Diet**: Mediterranean diet is recommended; limit saturated fats, refined carbs, and added sugars [^a30dfba6].
- **Exercise**: At least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity [^a30dfba6].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy: current options and evidence

Pharmacotherapy is reserved for patients with **biopsy-proven NASH and fibrosis** [^bfee9d3c], as simple steatosis has a benign prognosis and does not warrant drug therapy [^26dde287]. Currently, **no medications are FDA-approved** for NAFLD/NASH [^4c194504], though some agents have evidence of benefit.

| **Medication** | **Evidence summary** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Pioglitazone | - Improves NASH histology [^7b9b572a] <br/> - Modest fibrosis benefit <br/> - Weight gain and fluid retention are concerns [^7b9b572a] | Consider in biopsy-proven NASH with fibrosis, especially with T2DM [^4c194504] |
| Vitamin E | - Improves NASH histology in non-diabetic adults [^c24567fc] <br/> - No fibrosis benefit <br/> - Long-term safety uncertain [^c24567fc] | Consider in non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH [^c24567fc] |
| GLP-1 agonists (e.g. semaglutide) | - Promising for NASH resolution [^bd5dcf43] <br/> - Cardiometabolic benefits <br/> - Limited fibrosis data | Consider for patients with T2DM/obesity; not yet approved for NASH [^4c194504] |
| Obeticholic acid | - Histologic improvement in trials [^4f3162af] <br/> - Pruritus and dyslipidemia are concerns | Not approved; consider in trials or select cases [^notfound] |
| Statins | - No direct NASH benefit <br/> - Cardiovascular risk reduction [^a1b0f685] | Use for dyslipidemia and CVD risk reduction [^a1b0f685] |

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Several agents are in late-phase trials, including **FXR agonists, PPAR agonists, and FGF21 analogs** [^ec55f4a3]. Combination therapy targeting multiple pathways (metabolic, inflammatory, fibrotic) is a key strategy to improve outcomes [^f026dfc4].

---

## Individualized treatment approach

Therapy should be **tailored** to fibrosis stage, metabolic comorbidities, and patient preferences. For low-risk patients (F0–F1), emphasize lifestyle; for high-risk patients (F2–F3), consider pioglitazone or vitamin E, with GLP-1 agonists for those with T2DM/obesity [^4c194504].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no single "best" pharmacologic therapy** for NAFLD; lifestyle modification is first-line, and pharmacotherapy is reserved for NASH with fibrosis. Pioglitazone and vitamin E are the most evidence-based options, while GLP-1 agonists are promising but not yet approved for NASH. Individualize treatment, address comorbidities, and monitor for adverse effects.

### Current therapeutic strategies in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^6ec24ed2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis through steatohepatitis (NASH) to increasing fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis. NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and has now become the most common cause of liver disease in Western countries, with the more advanced stages of disease being associated with an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality. The optimal management of patients with NAFLD remains a clinical challenge. The aim of this study is to describe established and emerging strategies for the treatment of NAFLD. Relevant research and review articles were identified by searching PubMed. Selected articles referenced in these publications were also examined. Good quality randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the need for multifaceted lifestyle interventions in patients with NAFLD including the need for diet, exercise and behavioural counselling. Despite several trials of pharmacological agents, no highly effective treatment yet exists, with surgery representing the mainstay for advanced disease. A multidisciplinary approach, with a major focus on lifestyle change, represents best treatment pending the development of new therapeutic options.

### Why Do lifestyle recommendations fail in most patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? [^d78576d8]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been recognized as a major health burden. The efficacy and safety profile of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease remains uncertain; therefore, lifestyle modification is the first line of treatment. Based on available data, patients should optimally achieve at least a 5% to 10% weight reduction for histologic improvement. There is no clear consensus on the optimal diet or exercise regimen. Sustainability of any intervention is key to success; however, compliance has been a major issue in clinical trials. This finding underscores the importance of multidisciplinary strategies to achieve targeted weigh loss.

### Pharmacological interventions for non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NAFLD): an attempted network meta-analysis [^4ea30de0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (commonly called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) is liver steatosis in the absence of significant alcohol consumption, use of hepatotoxic medication, or other disorders affecting the liver such as hepatitis C virus infection, Wilson's disease, and starvation. NAFLD embraces the full spectrum of disease from pure steatosis (i.e. uncomplicated fatty liver) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), via NASH-cirrhosis to cirrhosis. The optimal pharmacological treatment for people with NAFLD remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the available pharmacological treatments according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta-analysis, and instead, assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions using standard Cochrane methodology.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.com to August 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in participants with NAFLD. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various pharmacological interventions compared with each other or with placebo or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on an available participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified 77 trials including 6287 participants that met the inclusion criteria of this review. Forty-one trials (3829 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes. Only one trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. All other trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains. Overall, all the evidence was very low quality. Thirty-five trials included only participants with non-alcohol related steatohepatitis (NASH) (based on biopsy confirmation). Five trials included only participants with diabetes mellitus; 14 trials included only participants without diabetes mellitus. The follow-up in the trials ranged from one month to 24 months. We present here only the comparisons of active intervention versus no intervention in which two or more trials reported at least one of the following outcomes: mortality at maximal follow-up, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life, the outcomes that determine whether a treatment should be used. Antioxidants versus no interventionThere was no mortality in either group (87 participants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence). None of the participants developed serious adverse events in the trial which reported the proportion of people with serious adverse events (87 participants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence). There was no evidence of difference in the number of serious adverse events between antioxidants and no intervention (rate ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.19; 254 participants; 2 trials; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Bile acids versus no interventionThere was no evidence of difference in mortality at maximal follow-up (OR 5.11, 95% CI 0.24 to 107.34; 659 participants; 4 trials; very low quality evidence), proportion of people with serious adverse events (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.88; 404 participants; 3 trials; very low quality evidence), or the number of serious adverse events (rate ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.54; 404 participants; 3 trials; very low quality evidence) between bile acids and no intervention. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Thiazolidinediones versus no interventionThere was no mortality in either group (74 participants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence). None of the participants developed serious adverse events in the two trials which reported the proportion of people with serious adverse events (194 participants; 2 trials; very low quality evidence). There was no evidence of difference in the number of serious adverse events between thiazolidinediones and no intervention (rate ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.05; 357 participants; 3 trials; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Source of fundingTwenty-six trials were partially- or fully-funded by pharmaceutical companies that would benefit, based on the results of the trial. Twelve trials did not receive any additional funding or were funded by parties with no vested interest in the results. The source of funding was not provided in 39 trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the very low quality evidence, we are very uncertain about the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for people with NAFLD including those with steatohepatitis. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials with sufficiently large sample sizes are necessary.

### Pharmacotherapy for NASH: current and emerging [^a0df6ab6]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prominent forms of chronic liver disease worldwide, reflecting the epidemic of global obesity. Those with the progressive variant of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are at significantly increased risk of multisystem morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies for NASH. Given the disease burden, there is an important unmet need for pharmacologic treatment options for this patient population. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH are complex and reflected by the myriad of therapies, with different targets, currently under investigation. In broad strokes, drug development has focused on modulation of metabolic pathways, inflammatory cascades, and/or mechanisms impacting fibrosis. Although much progress has been made in enhancing our understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis, development of pharmacologic treatments has been hindered by challenges in clinical trial enrollment and complexities in clinical trial design. The compounds in phase IIa have provided promising results in terms of potential benefits on various aspects of histopathology. Agents in later stages of development have shown fairly modest results in terms of reduction of hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis. If longer term safety and efficacy are established among heterogeneous cohorts, these medications may help mitigate potential morbidity and mortality for this burgeoning patient population.

### Treatment of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: current views and perspectives [^5bf40e7b]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is considered a component of the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity. Problems still exist concerning non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients in clinical practice, for example: (a) how to diagnose non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its type; (b) how to select patients candidate to treatment; (c) how to treat selected patients. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but only non-alcoholic steatohepatitis evolves into cirrhosis and the absolute risk of mortality for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is low. As yet, no tools, other than liver biopsy, are available to differentiate the various types of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many drugs are, currently, under study to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, even if well-performed trials are until necessary to define the best treatment. At the moment, the entity of the problem and the characteristics of patients frequently put the physician, in clinical practice, to choose the therapeutic approach arbitrarily which is considered more effective for each individual patient. Probably the future will consider the possibility of treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with more than one drug, by considering the various aspects and degree of this syndrome. Actually each physician should select the individual treatment on the basis of his/her knowledge and experience, by never forgetting the old saying 'primum non nocere'. However, the epidemiological entity of the problem, the characteristics of the patients, generally young, the frequent lack of clinical evidence of involvement of the liver, are all the factors that require vast well-performed clinical trials in order to define the best therapeutic approach for each individual patient.

### Current treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^2d05be3f]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of liver disease in the United States and is strongly associated to the metabolic syndrome. In this review, we will discuss the evidence behind the current recommendations on lifestyle modifications and available treatment options for NAFLD.

Recent Findings

The unrelenting rise in obesity and diabetes epidemic has led to a large healthcare burden from NAFLD and it is projected to continue to grow over the next two decades. Lifestyle modification that leads to weight loss is effective at treating NAFLD, but these modifications require a multidisciplinary approach for success in the real world. Multiple pharmacologic treatment options have been studied with promising results, but none have been approved for treatment in the United States. Clinical trials are on-going to study further pharmacologic treatment alternatives.

Summary

NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in United States, and an independent risk factor for mortality. Implementation of lifestyle modifications through a multidisciplinary approach and careful selection of patients for pharmacologic interventions will be essential for successful management of NAFLD.

### Current efforts and trends in the treatment of NASH [^38b863b3]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Of all the aspects of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the slowest advances have occurred in the therapeutic field. Thirty-five years after its formal description and after 15 years of intense scrutiny from researchers worldwide, there is still no approved drug for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatits (NASH). In the meantime, progress in the understanding of pathophysiology, diagnosis - both invasive and non-invasive, epidemiology and even natural history have been substantial or, at times, spectacular. In contrast, hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy underwent constant improvement and even before the great acceleration of the past few years, patients were already being offered approved therapies that were increasingly more efficient. What then explains such a slow pace of therapeutic advances in NASH, and will this change in the near future? Here we will review commonly-held myths that have diverted attention from therapy of NASH, obstacles that have slowed down industrial development of drugs for this indication, and recent achievements that will create better conditions for drug development programs. We will also briefly review current knowledge of non-pharmacological and pharmacological management in this early era of NASH therapies.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^3838b61b]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to a third of the population in many developed countries. Between 10% and 30% of patients with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis. There are metabolic risk factors common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, so patients with NASH have an increased risk of liver-related and cardiovascular death. Management of patients with NAFLD depends largely on the stage of disease, emphasising the importance of careful risk stratification. There are four main areas to focus on when thinking about management strategies in NAFLD: lifestyle modification, targeting the components of the metabolic syndrome, liver-directed pharmacotherapy for high risk patients and managing the complications of cirrhosis.

### Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: emerging molecular targets and therapeutic strategies [^2602db32]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2016). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - the most common chronic liver disease - encompasses a histological spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Over the next decade, NASH is projected to be the most common indication for liver transplantation. The absence of an effective pharmacological therapy for NASH is a major incentive for research into novel therapeutic approaches for this condition. The current focus areas for research include the modulation of nuclear transcription factors; agents that target lipotoxicity and oxidative stress; and the modulation of cellular energy homeostasis, metabolism and the inflammatory response. Strategies to enhance resolution of inflammation and fibrosis also show promise to reverse the advanced stages of liver disease.

### Pathogenesis and novel treatment options for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^5bcfba7d]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease affects 20–40% of the population. Its active form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is characterised by hepatocyte injury, liver inflammation, and progression of fibrosis, and has emerged as one of the most important causes of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Weight reduction of 10% by dietary restriction and regular exercise is sufficient to reverse NASH in most patients, but in practice this reduction is often not achieved. Available drugs such as vitamin E, pioglitazone, and pentoxifylline have borderline efficacy, but are limited by potential side-effects and toxicities, and do not improve liver fibrosis. However, basic and translational research has improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of NASH, thereby identifying several promising new treatment targets. Several drugs are in phase 2 and 3 development and could enter clinical practice in the near future. In this Review, we discuss the pathogenesis, treatment evaluation, existing therapies, and potential new treatments for NASH.

### Pharmacologic treatment strategies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^8049ddcb]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common form of liver disease, associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the aggressive subtype of NAFLD, can cause progressive fibrosis leading to cirrhosis. With the obesity epidemic, there is an increased health care burden from NASH, one of the most common causes of liver transplantation in the United States. There currently are no Food and Drug Administration-approved medical therapies for NASH. There exists a need for therapeutics to correct the drivers of NASH and to reverse or halt fibrosis progression. This article reviews pharmacologic therapeutics being developed to treat NASH.

### The efficacy and safety of statins for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^ab06cd95]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is an emerging liver disease in Western countries and the most frequent cause of incidental elevation of serum liver enzymes. Dyslipidaemia is frequently observed in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and treatment of dyslipidaemia plays a critical role in the overall management of these patients. Moreover, coronary artery disease remains the most common cause of death. Statins are effective lipid-lowering agents, associated with a lowering the risk of cardiovascular events in several interventional randomized clinical trials. However, statins are often underused in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and many physicians are concerned about the prescription of statins to patients with unexplained persistent elevation of liver enzymes or active liver disease. Based on currently available data, statin therapy, at low-to-moderate doses, seems to be safe and has low liver toxicity. Treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is recommended and may also improve liver function tests. In these patients, the risks of not taking statins could outweigh the risks of taking the drug. Conversely, the usefulness of statins for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is still a matter of debate and randomized clinical trials of adequate size and duration are required.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^ec55f4a3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a wide spectrum of pathologies ranging from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), characterized by simple steatosis without inflammation, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by steatosis of the liver accompanied by inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, which can lead to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Apart from lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, a Mediterranean diet and physical activity, only a few NAFLD-specific pharmacological treatment options such as Vitamin E and Pioglitazone are considered by current international guidelines. However, recently randomized controlled trials with GLP-1 agonists, FXR and PPAR ligands as well as other agents have been published and may expand the therapeutic armamentarium for NAFLD in the near future. Finally, knowledge about treating complications of end-stage liver disease due to NASH becomes an increasingly important cornerstone in the treatment of the broad disease spectrum of NAFLD. In this review, we summarize currently available and future treatment options for patients with NAFLD that may help internal medicine specialists treat the complete clinical spectrum of this highly prevalent liver disease.

### Pharmacological agents for NASH [^a1bd11e4]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

NASH is a common liver disease that increases liver-related mortality and reduces survival. The need for optimal management of NASH is therefore a priority for today's practicing hepatologist. The rationale for specific pharmacological therapy for NASH is based on the potential for disease progression and the difficulties that many patients have successfully implementing, in the long term, diet and lifestyle changes. Even in those that succeed, limited evidence exists that severe liver injury in patients with NASH can be reversed by diet and lifestyle measures alone. This Review provides a personal and critical assessment of the histological efficacy and safety of agents tested in randomized trials in patients with NASH.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^4210cfcf]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Use of available medications for NASH — although there are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of NASH at any disease stage, there are medications approved for other indications that have shown benefits for NASH in clinical trials and should be considered under specific circumstances.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^b4b190e8]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has emerged a major challenge because of it prevalence, difficulties in diagnosis, complex pathogenesis, and lack of approved therapies. As the burden of hepatitis C abates over the next decade, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will become the major form of chronic liver disease in adults and children and could become the leading indication for liver transplantation. This overview briefly summarizes the most recent data on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Ongoing clinical trials are focused on an array of disease mechanisms and reviewed here are how these treatments fit into the current paradigm of substrate overload lipotoxic liver injury. Many of the approaches are directed at downstream events such as inflammation, injury and fibrogenesis. Addressing more proximal processes such as dysfunctional satiety mechanisms and inappropriately parsimonious energy dissipation are potential therapeutic opportunities that if successfully understood and exploited would not only address fatty liver disease but also the other components of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia.

### The diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: practice guideline by the American Gastroenterological Association, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and American College of Gastroenterology [^172b4966]. Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) — an intensive lifestyle intervention randomized 31 obese persons with NASH to intensive lifestyle changes (diet, behaviour modification and 200 minutes a week of moderate physical activity for 48 weeks) versus structured basic education alone, with the intensive arm achieving 9.3% weight loss (versus 0.2% in the dietary counseling alone arm) and improvements in steatosis, necrosis and inflammation but not fibrosis; participants with ≥ 7% weight loss had significant histologic improvement, and similar patterns were observed in another study where ≥ 5% body weight loss improved steatosis and ≥ 9% produced broader histologic improvements. Regarding pharmacologic weight loss, in one trial orlistat did not improve body weight or liver histology, and another trial could not evaluate histologic effects because most patients did not undergo a follow-up biopsy.

### Management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^db710f7c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a very common medical condition, driven by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, ultimately producing a severe chronic liver disease and increased cardiovascular risk. Most people are asymptomatic for a long time, and their daily life is unaffected, leading to difficulty in identifying and managing people who slowly progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), NASH-cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite advances in the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and the identification of liver fibrosis as the strongest factor in predicting disease progression, no specific treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies. Outside controlled trials, treatment is generally limited to lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss. Pioglitazone remains the drug of choice to reduce progression of fibrosis in people with diabetes, although it is often used off-label in the absence of diabetes. Vitamin E is mainly used in children and may be considered in adults without diabetes. Several drugs are under investigation according to the agreed targets of reduced NASH activity without worsening of fibrosis or improving fibrosis without worsening of NASH. Anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic agents and metabolism modulators have been tested in either phase III or phase IIb randomized controlled trials; a few failed, and others have produced marginally positive results, but only a few are being tested in extension studies. The development of non-invasive, easily repeatable surrogate biomarkers and/or imaging tools is crucial to facilitate clinical studies and limit liver biopsy.

### NASH drug treatment development: challenges and lessons [^eec5d8bc]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Although NAFLD is tightly linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes, this liver disease also affects individuals who do not have obesity. NAFLD increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers. There is currently no licensed pharmacotherapy for NAFLD, despite numerous clinical trials in the past two decades. Currently, the reason so few drugs have been successful in the treatment of NAFLD in a trial setting is not fully understood. As cardiovascular disease is the predominant cause of mortality in people with NAFLD, future pharmacotherapies for NAFLD must consider associated cardiometabolic risk factors. The successful use of glucose-lowering drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with NAFLD indicates that this strategy is important, and worth developing further. Greater public awareness of NAFLD is needed because collaboration between all stakeholders is vital to enable a holistic approach to successful treatment.

### Therapeutic approaches for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^038b6105]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

NAFLD is a worldwide epidemic associated with metabolic and endocrine pathologies. The most evidenced approach is lifestyle intervention, which lacks long-term efficacy. Therefore, prevention merits more attention, since the pharmaceutical options currently available are limited. Although multiple pharmacotherapies are in development, response rates appear modest, mainly for fibrosis treatment. From different phase II trials, antidiabetic drugs seem promising, both in mono- or bitherapy. Derivatives of PPAR molecules may have an interesting future, as well. As a general recommendation, we propose early screening and recognition of the problem, to deliver optimal treatment once an approved pharmacological armamentarium becomes available.

### Therapeutic approaches for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^6302754f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) have been reported as a novel worldwide epidemic, very often associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Both conditions have also been shown to be associated with a number of endocrine pathologies. Despite the epidemic, the complex pathophysiology and major complications, ranging from metabolic disturbances (diabetes and more) to cardiovascular disease, people with NASH are left with very few management options. The best and most approved therapeutic option is lifestyle intervention. Although pharmacotherapies based on pathophysiological background are in development, response rates appear modest, mainly for fibrosis treatment, which is the reason for lack of approved drug therapy. Previous drugs analyzed, such as pioglitazone and vitamin E, show weak efficacy. From different phase II trials, antidiabetic (injectable) drugs seem to be promising, both in mono- or bitherapy. Also, derivatives of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors may have an interesting future, as well. For that reason, more focus should be given on prevention of this novel disease entity. In view of this booming epidemic, with a background of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and the important medical consequences, early recognition, prevention and intervention of NAFLD/NASH seems appropriate. In this review, we will focus on the different current and future therapeutic intervention options, taking into consideration the complex pathophysiology of this disease.

Abstract

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in western populations, and is closely associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. The burden of disease is set to rise exponentially, and this is further compounded by the lack of good medications. In addition, these patients tend to have multiple comorbidities that may not be adequately managed. In this article, we review the biological basis of potential therapies in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the current drugs being tested in clinical trials, as well some practical considerations in managing patients in the clinic.

Introduction

In the context of therapies for liver diseases, the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a major unmet need. Therefore, treatment of NASH is a major focus of drug development worldwide. Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved therapies for NASH. As of December 2019, 84 interventional studies were ongoing and had enrolled patients to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of treatments for NASH. Most of these trials are testing new drugs as monotherapy with some trials investigating combination therapy for the treatment of NASH.

It is now well accepted that fibrosis stage is a major predictor of liver-related morbidity and mortality. FDA and EMA guidance documents indicate that for clinical approval of new drugs for the treatment of NASH, trials should include patients who have significantly higher risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation, as defined as those who have biopsy-proven NASH with stage 2 fibrosis or higher. The regulatory approval pathway for pharmacological therapies for NASH requires therapies to show clinical benefit in improving liver-related outcomes for full regulatory approval, which may take several years due to low event rates. To expedite drug development, liver histological improvements have been accepted as a surrogate for clinical improvements for a subpart H approval process. The subpart H approval endpoints include either one-stage improvement in liver fibrosis or resolution of NASH. This approval is contingent on showing clinical benefits over long-term follow-up for full approval.

### How would you manage this patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^a7e0c484]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common diagnosis in the United States and other developed countries, has been increasing in prevalence. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recently published updated practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing NAFLD, including the following recommendations: Routine screening for NAFLD in high-risk groups is not advised because of uncertainties surrounding test and treatment options, along with a lack of knowledge about cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits. Noninvasive studies, including biomarkers from laboratory tests and liver stiffness measured through elastography, are clinically useful tools for identifying advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with NAFLD who are at increased risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or advanced fibrosis. Weight loss of at least 3% to 5% generally reduces NASH, but greater weight loss (7% to 10%) is needed to improve most histopathologic features, including fibrosis. Pharmacologic therapies (such as pioglitazone and vitamin E) should be considered only in patients with biopsy-proven NASH. Patients with NAFLD should not consume heavy amounts of alcohol, although insufficient data exist to provide advice about other levels of alcohol use. Here, 2 clinicians with expertise in this area debate whether to screen for NAFLD in primary care, how to monitor patients with NAFLD, and what interventions should be used to manage this condition.

### Evaluation and management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^2e537a85]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a spectrum of liver diseases which occurs in the absence of alcohol consumption in amounts considered injurious to the liver. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We present an integrated approach that utilizes both clinical and laboratory studies to diagnose and manage a patient with suspected non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The goals of treatment include (1) correction of the underlying risk factors, (2) avoidance of factors that promote progression of liver disease, and (3) specific treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^6190c7dd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become increasingly recognized as the most common cause of abnormal liver enzymes in the last few decades and is among the most common forms of chronic liver disease in the Western world and across the globe. With the growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes, NAFLD is estimated to affect about one-quarter of the US population. Although most patients with NAFLD have nonprogressive bland steatosis, a minority of patients develop the histological subtype of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related death. This is especially true when NASH patients have type 2 diabetes. Treatment of NAFLD should therefore be directed towards patients with established NASH. Sustained weight loss seems to improve insulin resistance and associated NASH. In fact, weight loss with bariatric surgery leads to biochemical and histological improvement in morbidly obese patients with NASH. Several pharmacologic agents have been studied in an effort to improve insulin resistance and pro-inflammatory mediators potentially responsible for the development and progression of NASH. While some studies have shown initial promise, none has established long-term efficacy using randomized clinical trials. This paper briefly reviews the epidemiology, natural history, and pathophysiology of NAFLD and NASH and then focuses on the clinical trials of various therapeutic modalities for NAFLD. These include weight loss agents, bariatric surgery, insulin-sensitizing agents, lipid-lowering agents, antioxidants, probiotics, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, cytoprotective and other novel agents.

Principles of management of NAFLD

Management of patients with NAFLD depends largely on the stage of disease, emphasising the importance of careful risk stratification. There are four main areas to focus on when thinking about management strategies in NAFLD: lifestyle modification, targeting the components of the metabolic syndrome, liver-directed pharmacotherapy for high risk patients and managing the complications of cirrhosis (figure 1).

Figure 1
Management strategies in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

All patients with NAFLD require advice about lifestyle modification aimed at weight loss and increased physical activity, as well as treatment of any associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia). For patients with simple steatosis, which carries a relatively benign liver-related prognosis, this can be done in a primary care setting. Patients with steatohepatitis and fibrosis are at highest risk of developing progressive liver disease so require more aggressive lifestyle modification and if this fails can be considered for liver-directed pharmacotherapy with pioglitazone or vitamin E. For patients who have progressed to cirrhosis, surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential and some treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of HCC. Interventions for the treatment of NAFLD are summarised in table 1.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^a30dfba6]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease — management of patients at low risk of advanced fibrosis emphasizes lifestyle measures: Low risk is defined as having a FIB-4 score < 1.3, LSM < 8.0 kPa by transient elastography, or a liver biopsy fibrosis stage of F0–F1; for these patients, we recommend therapeutic lifestyle interventions, and specific pharmacologic treatment targeting liver steatosis is not necessary; management should focus on lifestyle interventions to modify unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factors, with particular efforts to promote weight loss in overweight or obese patients; all patients should receive education about nutritional strategies, regular physical activity, and avoiding excess alcohol intake; given that even low alcohol intake is associated with increased risks for advanced liver disease and cancer in individuals with NAFLD, adults with NAFLD should restrict alcohol consumption to reduce liver-related events; there are no large, long-term behavioral modification or pharmacotherapy studies regarding weight loss in NAFLD, but weight loss of any magnitude should be encouraged, and reversal of steatosis may be observed with even modest weight loss (approximately 5%), although most studies suggest that a greater decrease (up to 10%) is needed to improve steatohepatitis or fibrosis.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries, and consists of a spectrum of histopathological changes that range in severity from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis to cirrhosis. The use of pharmacological agents as adjunctive therapy to lifestyle modification is crucial, because weight loss is often difficult to achieve and maintain. The purpose of this review is to analyze the most recent literature pertaining to current therapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications.

Recent Findings

Recent studies suggest that vitamin E may improve liver histology in NASH without affecting insulin resistance; however, long-term risks remain to be studied. Pioglitazone is beneficial in improving liver histology and insulin resistance, but is associated with weight gain. Emerging data suggest that pentoxifylline may also be beneficial in improving serum aminotransferase and liver histology in patients with biopsy-proven NASH.

Summary

Ongoing research evaluating potential pharmacological agents for NASH is critical, because these patients are at an increased risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The current therapies being used for the treatment of NASH include the use of vitamin E and pioglitazone, in addition to dietary counseling and regular exercise.

### Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: the therapeutic challenge of a global epidemic [^e680f881]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The treatment of NASH has been proven to be challenging to date. Many questions regarding the pathogenesis of this condition as well as the type and duration of treatment remain unanswered. The ideal therapeutic strategy should include interventions that are safe, not costly, successful in decreasing mortality and associated co-morbidities and also realistic in terms of application and sustainability over time. Future studies should be more homogeneous regarding disease definitions and modes of assessing treatment effects (e.g. use of liver biopsy). Clinically important outcome measures should be investigated and patient populations studied should be clearly defined (e.g. diabetics or not). Randomized design provides the highest level of evidence and hence should be preferentially used in therapeutic trials for NASH.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: new treatments [^06db4ad8]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of liver dysfunction in the western world because of its close association with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a particular health concern due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with progressive disease. At present, without specific targeted pharmacological therapies, the mainstay of therapy remains weight loss through dietary modification and lifestyle change; thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent evidence for current and emerging therapies in NASH.

Recent Findings

Some existing medications, including pioglitazones and angiotensin receptor antagonists, may be repurposed to help treat this condition. Vitamin E may improve histology in NASH, but safety issues limit its use. Recently, a number of novel agents specifically targeting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis have entered clinical trials, including the farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic acid, which has shown significant histological improvements in steatohepatitis and fibrosis.

Summary

Diet/lifestyle modification remains the mainstay of treatment. For patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis, current liver-directed pharmacotherapy with vitamin E and pioglitazone offer some benefits; obeticholic acid appears promising and is currently being tested. Comorbidities must be diagnosed and treated; cardiovascular disease remains a primary cause of death in these patients.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease review: diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes [^dccc89b7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of abnormal serum aminotransferase levels in both developed and developing countries. Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subset of NAFLD, are at risk for progressive liver disease and in need of effective treatment options. A practical approach may be pursued by identifying patients with NAFLD with the highest likelihood for histologic evidence of NASH. Despite decades of clinical trials, no single treatment can be recommended to all patients with NASH. Importantly, there is no evidence that pioglitazone or vitamin E improves fibrosis. Bariatric surgeries may improve hepatic histology in morbidly obese patients with NASH, although randomized clinical trials are lacking. Currently, NASH is the second leading etiology of liver disease among adults awaiting liver transplantation in the United States. The primary and secondary prevention of NAFLD may require aggressive strategies for managing obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects almost a third of the Western population, and the burden of the disease is set to rise exponentially. 1 Current drug therapies for the resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are limited in their efficacy, and there are no FDA‐approved drugs for NASH. 2 In this article, we review the potential therapeutic targets for NASH and their biological rationale, the current state of drugs in clinical trials, as well as some practical considerations as to how we manage NASH in the clinic.

### Treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^072a3c46]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease comprises a range of disorders from steatosis and steatohepatitis through to cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can progress to cirrhosis and liver-related death. Therefore, managing this common disorder is becoming an important public health issue. Lifestyle measures are commonly suggested but robust data are lacking. Trials with antioxidants (vitamin E, betaine) as well as cytoprotectants (ursodeoxycholic acid) have been disappointing. While data for insulin sensitizers such as metformin are less conclusive, thiazolidinediones appear promising. However, not all patients respond to thiazolidinediones. Moreover, issues related to weight gain, cardiovascular risk need to be addressed. The use of endocannabinoid antagonists and insulin secretagogues are novel strategies to combat this disorder.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): why you should care, when you should worry, what you should do [^d066d9a3]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

For the diabetologist, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is important at both ends of its spectrum. It is an early warning sign of future risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. It may also lead to late life-threatening sequela of diabetes mellitus in the event of progression to liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. This review will highlight the recent progress in understanding the natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and in developing a rational approach to its diagnosis, staging, and management. The pandemic prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Western countries necessitates both a high index of suspicion to identify cases and a non-invasive approach to staging, which is best achieved with clinical/biochemical panels and transient elastography. Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of management. Recent clinical trials provide support for pharmacologic therapies directed at the metabolic syndrome and at protecting the liver but more data are needed. Bariatric surgery is appropriate for high-risk patients who fail conservative management. Patients with liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma may be candidates for liver transplantation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and protocol registration

This systematic review and network meta‐analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses (PRISMA) extension statement for network meta‐analysis. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of RCTs evaluating pharmacological interventions for MASLD, followed by a network meta‐analysis to compare the relative efficacy and safety of different treatment options.

2.2 Search strategy

A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the following electronic databases from inception to December 2024: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Web of Science. The search strategy was developed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and free‐text keywords related to MASLD and pharmacological interventions. The detailed search strategy for PubMed/MEDLINE is presented below, with similar strategies adapted for other databases:

# 1 'Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease' [Mesh] OR 'Non‐alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease' [Mesh].

Statin use in NAFLD/NASH includes safety context and treatment guidance: Patients with NAFLD and NASH are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and although elevated aminotransferases are not uncommon in patients receiving statins, serious liver injury from statins is rarely seen in clinical practice; there are no RCTs with histological endpoints which investigated statins to treat NASH. Given the lack of evidence to show that patients with NAFLD and NASH are at increased risk for serious drug induced liver injury from statins, statins can be used to treat dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD and NASH.

### Management of cardiometabolic complications in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a review of the literature with recommendations [^e6363aab]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of liver conditions characterized by significant lipid deposition within hepatocytes. As an overarching diagnosis, NAFLD contains a continuum of progressive liver diseases ranging from isolated liver steatosis to necroinflammatory states leading to end-stage liver disease. Nonalcoholic fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are distinguished by their histologic patterns, with the former exhibiting steatosis without fibrosis or inflammation. This important distinction provides clinicians a timeline within the NAFLD staging to target appropriate interventions against modifiable risk factors. NAFLD is likely formed in response to metabolic imbalances that damage the livers adaptive capacity. Metabolic conditions leading to steatosis mirror common cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Acknowledging the common risk factors for development and progression of NAFLD, it is unsurprising the first-line management focuses on the treatment of metabolic syndrome with an emphasis on weight reduction in obese populations. The purpose of this review is to provide a detailed summary of the literature as well as outline the current treatment recommendations for patients with NAFLD with a detailed focus on pharmacologic antiobesity interventions.

NAFLD — Off-label pharmacologic management addresses comorbidities and clarifies what is and is not appropriate for NASH. There are no FDA-approved medications for NAFLD, but drugs for comorbidities with potential benefit may be considered. Semaglutide can be considered for its approved indications in NASH because it confers cardiovascular benefit and improves NASH; pioglitazone improves NASH and can be considered for NASH in T2DM; vitamin E can be considered in select individuals without diabetes as it improves NASH. Available data on semaglutide, pioglitazone, and vitamin E do not show an antifibrotic benefit and these compounds have not been carefully studied in cirrhosis. Metformin, UDCA, DPP-4, statins, and silymarin should not be used to treat NASH due to lack of meaningful histological benefit. Statins are safe and recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction across NAFLD, including compensated cirrhosis; in decompensated cirrhosis, data are limited but use could be considered in high cardiovascular risk with careful monitoring. Hypertriglyceridemia management includes lifestyle changes and omega-3 fatty acids, icosapent ethyl, or fibrates.

### Non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^ece56f65]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent form of chronic liver disease that poses challenges in diagnosis and risk stratification. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the more progressive form of NAFLD, is particularly challenging to diagnose in the absence of histology. Liver biopsy is infrequently performed due to its invasive nature, potential for sampling error, and lack of inter-rater reliability. Non-invasive tests that can accurately identify patients with at-risk NASH (ie, individuals with biopsy-proven NASH with NAFLD activity score [NAS] ≥ 4 and fibrosis stage ≥ 2) are key tools to identify candidates for pharmacologic therapy in registrational trials for the treatment of NASH-related fibrosis. With emerging pharmacotherapy, non-invasive tests are required to track treatment response. Lastly, there is an unmet need for non-invasive tests to assess risk for clinical outcomes including progression to cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, liver-related mortality, and overall mortality. In this Review we examine advances in non-invasive tests to diagnose and monitor NAFLD and NASH.

### Combination therapy for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: rationale, opportunities and challenges [^f026dfc4]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment combinations for NASH

There are several reasons for treating patients with NASH with a combination of drugs, as shown in figure 2.

Figure 2
Rationale for combination therapy to treat non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Drugs with different mechanisms of action targeting hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis could be combined. Ideally, such combinations should be safe and have positive effects beyond the liver such as weight loss, cardiovascular protection, insulin sensitisation and lipid reduction.

Increasing response rate with combination therapy

Trials of drugs as monotherapy for the treatment of NASH have reported response rates < 32% in comparison with placebo. Combination of two or more therapies may increase these response rates, meaning that the proportion of patients improving is larger with the combination than with a monotherapy. This strategy aims to convert non-responders or partial responders to monotherapy into responders. Given the heterogeneity in the drivers of fibrosis and NASH among the spectrum of patients with NASH, it is likely that multiple mechanistic pathways may need to be targeted to achieve an optimal histological response. In order to enhance the response rates for either one-stage improvement in fibrosis or resolution of NASH, one can speculate that two or three distinct pathways would need to be targeted to optimise response, for example, by combining drugs with metabolic activity along with predominantly anti-inflammatory activity may further enhance the likelihood of a histological response.

Insulin sensitizing agent — metformin has shown aminotransferase reductions without consistent histologic benefit in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): early small, open-label studies showed reductions in insulin resistance and aminotransferases but no significant histology improvement; an open-label trial of 110 patients treated with metformin 2 grams/day (55 patients), vitamin E 800 IU/day (28 patients) or dietary-induced weight loss (27 patients) for 12 months found greater aminotransferase improvement with metformin but only modest histologic change in the subset of 17 patients with paired biopsies. In a 48-week open-label study in 26 patients, metformin improved NASH activity in only 30% of patients, with confounding weight loss (19% lost more than 10 kilograms), and a larger randomized trial (n = 48) also reported lack of efficacy; overall, a meta-analysis concluded that 6–12 months of metformin plus lifestyle intervention did not improve aminotransferases or liver histology compared with lifestyle alone, regardless of dose or diabetes status.

Thiazolidinediones in adults with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) — pioglitazone efficacy, safety, and recommendation: In the PIVENS multicenter RCT, 247 non-diabetic patients with NASH were randomized to pioglitazone (30 mg/day), vitamin E (800 IU/day), or placebo for 24 months, and the primary endpoint was improvement in NAS ≥ 2 points with prespecified ballooning and lobular inflammation or steatosis changes and no fibrosis worsening; the primary endpoint was achieved in 19% with placebo, 34% with pioglitazone (p = 0.04 vs. placebo) and 43% with vitamin E (p = 0.001 vs. placebo), but because a p-value of 0.025 was required the study concluded that pioglitazone did not meet the primary end point; a key secondary end point favored pioglitazone (47% vs. 21%, p = 0.001), and weight gain occurred (4.7 kg, p < 0.001). A meta-analysis of 5 RCTs found pioglitazone improved steatosis (OR 4.05, 95% CI 2.58–6.35) and inflammation (OR 3.53, 95% CI 2.21–5.64), but not fibrosis (OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.87–2.24). Regarding cardiovascular outcomes, a meta-analysis of 19 trials enrolling 16,390 patients with T2DM reported a significant reduction (~18%) in death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (p = 0.005) but a higher rate of congestive heart failure with pioglitazone (2.3% vs. 1.8%, p = 0.002). Guideline recommendation: Pioglitazone can be used to treat steatohepatitis in patients with biopsy-proven NASH, noting most trial participants were non-diabetic and long term safety and efficacy in NASH is not established (Strength – 1, Evidence – B).

Limitations of pharmacologic treatment

Currently, there are no FDA-approved drugs for treating NASH. However, for some patients, a number of therapeutic options with varying efficacy are available, as listed in Table 3. Pioglitazone compared to placebo in nondiabetic patients showed a favorable improvement in NASH (34% vs. 19%, P = 0.04; number needed to treat = 6.9). The same study, the PIVENS (pioglitazone or vitamin E vs. placebo in nondiabetic patients with NASH) trial, showed that the daily use of 800 IU of vitamin E significantly reduced steatosis and inflammation (43% vs. 19%, P = 0.001; number needed to treat = 4.2). However, some safety concerns have been raised with regard to the use of vitamin E and pioglitazone; these include postmenopausal bone loss, risk of bladder cancer, hemorrhagic stroke and prostate cancer. Other medications such as pentoxifylline have shown favorable results, though larger clinical studies are required to evaluate its therapeutic role.

Pharmacologic treatment options in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

Research in the past decade has led to the development of novel therapies. Obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, was investigated for treating non-cirrhotic NASH patients in the farnesoid X nuclear receptor ligand obeticholic acid for non-cirrhotic, NASH (FLINT) trial. Comparing 25 mg of obeticholic acid per day with placebo, interim analysis showed that the efficacy criterion had been met, leading to discontinuation of the trial. Histological data showed significant improvement in steatohepatitis in 45% of patients vs. 21% of patients who received placebo. Obeticholic acid was also associated with weight loss. Its potential clinical efficacy and long-term safety are pending the results of a phase III clinical trial (NCT02548351).

The last decade has seen many studies examining the prevalence and natural history of NAFLD in the United States and it is clear that this disease is likely to be an important cause of liver-related morbidity in the future. Several pharmacologic therapies have shown some promise; currently, vitamin E and insulin-sensitizing agents such as pioglitazone can be considered in appropriate cases. Conservative measures to promote weight loss still have a role to play, but the obesity epidemic in the Western World has reached such proportions that bariatric surgery is proving to be an attractive option for patients with a BMI greater than 35 to 40 kg/m2. Well-designed prospective studies are required to ensure that all of these therapies are safe and effective in the long term. Newer agents will likely be investigated as the pathogenesis of NAFLD and fibrosis progression in NASH are further elucidated.

### Emerging therapeutic approaches for the treatment of NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^d7c61119]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most prevalent liver disease in the world, yet there are still no approved pharmacological therapies to prevent or treat this condition. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of severity, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although NASH is linked to an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis and has now become the leading cause of liver failure-related transplantation, the majority of patients with NASH will ultimately die as a result of complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiometabolic diseases. Importantly, NAFLD is closely linked to obesity and tightly interrelated with insulin resistance and T2DM. Thus, targeting these interconnected conditions and taking a holistic attitude to the treatment of metabolic disease could prove to be a very beneficial approach. This Review will explore the latest relevant literature and discuss the ongoing therapeutic options for NAFLD focused on targeting intermediary metabolism, insulin resistance and T2DM to remedy the global health burden of these diseases.

### Diagnosis… [^84782338]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

- Weight loss is key to managing NAFLD and NASH; lifestyle interventions, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, and bariatric surgery all improve liver disease. From the AFP Editors. Management Management of NAFLD is primarily focused on lifestyle changes. A few medications have disease-oriented evidence of benefit but have not been studied for their effect on patient outcomes. MEDICATIONS Pioglitazone increases resolution of NASH, especially in patients with advanced fibrosis. Pioglitazone commonly causes weight gain and heart failure and carries a small risk of bladder cancer. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists increase the resolution of steatohepatitis. Whether this improvement is due to the medication or the weight loss is unknown. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors improve hepatic steatosis on imaging, but no biopsy evidence is available. Metformin does not appear to improve steatohepatitis or fibrosis.

SURGERY Bariatric surgery leads to resolution of NASH in two-thirds of patients and fibrosis improvement in 40%. Yet, nearly 1 in 8 patients will have worsening of fibrosis after bariatric surgery. One study, with five-year follow-up after bariatric surgery, demonstrated resolution of NASH in 90% of patients and improvement in fibrosis in 70%. If cirrhosis and stage 3 fibrosis are present, the surgical risks may outweigh the benefits. Endoscopic bariatric procedures lack evidence for patients with NASH. Little evidence exists to guide treatment of NAFLD in children. Lifestyle advice has been shown to improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis in some children, whereas others worsened. Metformin and vitamin E do not improve steatohepatitis in children with NASH. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are recommended based on evidence of reducing obesity. Do we need another reason to encourage lifestyle changes, and will this diagnosis be the motivating factor.

The benefit of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may simply be tied to the weight loss they cause. The evidence for pioglitazone is more complicated. With only disease-oriented evidence from five trials including just more than 500 patients, the authors of the meta-analysis referenced by the guideline note that trials were too small to allow assessment for adverse events.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^3511f864]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To summarize the cornerstone of every treatment in all patients with NAFLD should contain the following three components:
Mediterranean diet aiming to reduce the average daily calorie intake by at least 500–1000 kcal.
Weight loss induced by diet and physical activity aiming at losing at least 3–5% of body weight.
Moderate physical activity aiming at 150–200 min/week — also in patients with NAFLD‐associated advanced chronic liver disease.

Pharmacological treatment options

Guideline‐recommended pharmacological treatment options for NAFLD patients are scarce and currently, only Vitamin E and the proliferator‐activated receptor gamma (PPAR‐y) ligand Pioglitazone are recommended for selected patients by the European‐ and American Association for the Study of the Liver.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: new treatments [^74d248ce]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver dysfunction in the western world because of its close association with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia; it is therefore considered the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. A particular health concern is patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with accompanying hepatocellular injury that can lead to progressive liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as increased cardiovascular risk. At present, there is no approved therapy for NASH and the optimal treatment remains uncertain; effective therapies are thus a research priority to reduce the anticipated burden of liver disease.

### High rates of ineligibility for participation in trials of new therapies in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a systematic review [^9f796e5c]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is common and there are a number of treatments in development. Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and significant fibrosis are thought to be the population most in need of treatment. Identification of this group requires liver biopsy. The aim of this study was to identify the proportion of patients screened for phase 2 randomised controlled trials who subsequently entered these studies.

Methods

Large, multicentre, phase 2 randomised controlled trials of pharmacological therapies for NASH were identified by systematic review. The pooled proportion of potential participants who entered the trials was estimated by meta-analysis. The reasons for trial ineligibility were separately extracted and analysed.

Results

Thirteen reports of 14 trials were included. Overall, there were 4014 screened individuals included in the quantitative analyses and 53% were subsequently enrolled in a trial. Considering trials in which the entry criteria matched the current paradigm for treatment, that is, the presence of NASH and significant fibrosis, only 35% of screened individuals were eligible for trial entry. More than half of ineligible individuals were excluded on the basis of liver histology most often due to insufficient disease activity with or without insufficient fibrosis.

Conclusion

The majority of patients considered at risk of NASH and fibrosis sufficient for treatment in randomised controlled trials are ineligible for trial entry. Most often, this is due to ineligible liver histology. These findings have implications for the design of future trials in NASH and for the applicability of treatments after licensing.

NAFLD/NASH guideline — vitamin E therapy: Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) administered at a daily dose of 800 IU/day improves liver histology in non-diabetic adults with biopsy-proven NASH and therefore it should be considered as a first line pharmacotherapy for this patient population (Strength − 1, Quality − B). Until further data supporting its effectiveness become available, vitamin E is not recommended to treat NASH in diabetic patients, NAFLD without liver biopsy, NASH cirrhosis, or cryptogenic cirrhosis (Strength − 1, Quality − C).

### Effectiveness of phosphatidylcholine in alleviating steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiometabolic comorbidities (MANPOWER study) [^f7fbe216]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

According to the AASLD, the management of NAFLD should consist of treating the liver disease as well as the associated metabolic comorbidities, such as obesity, hyperlipidaemia, insulin resistance and T2DM. The significant progress that has been made in previous years in understanding the pathogenesis of NAFLD has led to an increase of medical therapies targeting various aspects of the fat accumulation and injury pathways. However, there is still no 'gold-standard' pharmacological therapy for NAFLD. Interestingly, current US guidelines on NAFLD treatment indicate that only patients with biopsy-proven NASH should be treated pharmacologically with either pioglitazone or with high-dose vitamin E. However, there have been lingering concerns about the long-term safety of both these agents. Bariatric surgery is another option that can be considered in otherwise obese individuals with NAFLD or NASH. Though the metabolic disturbances, as well as the long-term complications of NAFLD, are surmountable through lifestyle interventions (ie, dietary modifications, weight loss and exercise), poor implementation and reduced adherence to lifestyle intervention programmes would ultimately diminish their efficacy.

In the largest clinical trial (PIVENS), the pure form of rr α-tocopherol was administered at 800 IU/day for 96 weeks, and the primary endpoint was achieved more often with vitamin E than placebo (42% vs. 19%, P < 0.001, number needed to treat = 4.4). The page also notes a concern about the controversial issue of whether vitamin E increases all-cause mortality.

Treatment Of NAFLD — Lifestyle factors, metabolic comorbidities and NAFLD‐specific therapies

According to current guidelines pharmacotherapy in NASH patients should be reserved for those with significant fibrosis (≥ F2) and those with less severe disease but at high risk of disease progression (i.e. metabolic syndrome, diabetes).

Nevertheless, it needs to be emphasized that once a diagnosis of NAFLD is established patients have increased overall mortality compared to non‐NAFLD patients. However, this increased mortality mostly comes from cardiovascular‐ rather than from liver‐related outcomes; furthermore, cancer‐related mortality is among the leading causes of mortality in NAFLD patients, mainly driven by extrahepatic malignancies followed by hepatocellular carcinoma. Most importantly, once a diagnosis of NASH and/or advanced fibrosis (i.e. fibrosis stage 3 or cirrhosis) and/or portal hypertension is confirmed patients are at an increased risk for liver‐related complications (i.e. hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma) and liver‐related mortality. Therefore, lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying metabolic conditions should be performed in all NAFLD patients, while specific pharmacological treatment should mainly be aimed at patients with biopsy‐proven NASH and fibrosis. A short summary of a possible treatment algorithm for patients with NAFLD has been summarized in Fig. 2.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes

Weight loss and cardiovascular risk reduction are critical components of the management of patients with both NAFLD and T2DM. There is robust evidence to demonstrate the cardiovascular benefit of specific classes of glucose lowering agents, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). In addition, both classes of agent promote weight loss and may have a beneficial impact on the liver. In line with published guidance, we would advocate a low threshold for the preferential use of agents that lower weight and reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with NAFLD to treat their diabetes. Accordingly, in people with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes, treatment with glucose lowering agents that promote weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risk should be considered (recommendation 30, Table 1).

Service considerations

Research and clinical trials

Patients with NAFLD should be considered for research studies and offered the opportunity to participate in clinical trials where available (Recommendation 31, Table 1). It is recognised in other disease areas that increased participation in research is associated with improved clinical outcomes for patients. NAFLD is a relatively recently described entity with substantial unmet need in terms of understanding of its natural history, diagnostic tests, and treatment to prevent disease progression. These needs can only be addressed through the engagement of people with NAFLD with research. Where research studies are available, these should be offered to appropriate patients to consider participation.

Multidisciplinary care for people with NAFLD

Given the strong relationship between NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome, patients with fatty liver frequently have associated metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidity and a holistic approach to their management is advised. Comprehensive management of NAFLD requires expertise in clinical hepatology for the diagnosis, staging of NAFLD and management of hepatic comorbidity. Diabetes is often present in advanced NAFLD and this, with optimisation of cardio-metabolic risk factors requires relevant expertise. Lifestyle intervention and health promotion are required to assist sustainable health improvement. International guidelines highlight the multi-disciplinary nature of interventions in NAFLD, and the feasibility and utility of a multi-disciplinary clinic has been demonstrated. Therefore, management of patients with advanced NAFLD in secondary care should be by multidisciplinary teams with expertise in clinical hepatology, management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle intervention and health promotion (diet and exercise/physical activity) (Recommendation 32, Table 1).

### Probiotics for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and / or steatohepatitis [^c37bd670]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease comprises a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Probiotics have been proposed as a treatment option because of their modulating effect on the gut flora that could influence the gut-liver axis.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of probiotics for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and/or steatohepatitis.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (July 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2006), and EMBASE (1980 to May 2006). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials evaluating probiotic treatment in any dose, duration, and route of administration versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The diagnosis was made by history of minimal or no alcohol intake, imaging techniques showing hepatic steatosis and/or histological evidence of hepatic damage, and by exclusion of other causes of hepatic steatosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We had planned to extract data in duplicate and analyse results by intention-to-treat.

Main Results

No randomised clinical trials were identified. Preliminary data from two pilot non-randomised studies suggest that probiotics may be well tolerated, may improve conventional liver function tests, and may decrease markers of lipid peroxidation.

Authors' Conclusions

The lack of randomised clinical trials makes it impossible to support or refute probiotics for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review [^791ac363]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its subtype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis affect approximately 30% and 5%, respectively, of the US population. In patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, half of deaths are due to cardiovascular disease and malignancy, yet awareness of this remains low. Cirrhosis, the third leading cause of death in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is predicted to become the most common indication for liver transplantation.

Objectives

To illustrate how to identify patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease at greatest risk of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis; to discuss the role and limitations of current diagnostics and liver biopsy to diagnose nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; and to provide an outline for the management of patients across the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Evidence Review

PubMed was queried for published articles through February 28, 2015, using the search terms NAFLD and cirrhosis, mortality, biomarkers, and treatment. A total of 88 references were selected, including 16 randomized clinical trials, 44 cohort or case-control studies, 6 population-based studies, and 7 meta-analyses.

Findings

Sixty-six percent of patients older than 50 years with diabetes or obesity are thought to have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with advanced fibrosis. Even though the ability to identify the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis subtype within those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease still requires liver biopsy, biomarkers to detect advanced fibrosis are increasingly reliable. Lifestyle modification is the foundation of treatment for patients with nonalcoholic steatosis. Available treatments with proven benefit include vitamin E, pioglitazone, and obeticholic acid; however, the effect size is modest (< 50%) and none is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The association between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cardiovascular disease is clear, though causality remains to be proven in well-controlled prospective studies. The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma is increasing and up to 50% of cases may occur in the absence of cirrhosis.

Conclusions and Relevance

Between 75 million and 100 million individuals in the United States are estimated to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its potential morbidity extends beyond the liver. It is important that primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and other specialists be aware of the scope and long-term effects of the disease. Early identification of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may help improve patient outcomes through treatment intervention, including transplantation for those with decompensated cirrhosis.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^999d8e78]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in many developed countries. Up to a third of the population have evidence of steatosis on imaging, with the majority (70%–90%) having simple steatosis. However, 10%–30% of subjects with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis, which puts patients at risk of liver-related complications. Due to the metabolic risk factors that are common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, patients with NASH have an increased risk of cardiovascular death as well as liver-related mortality. In the first part of this review, we discussed the diagnosis and staging of patients with NAFLD and the importance of risk stratification. Here we will discuss the management of patients with NAFLD.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: what does the primary care physician need to know? [^c381a079]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States and is soon to be the leading cause of liver transplantation. Patients at the greatest risk are those with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In 2019 the American Diabetes Association guidelines called, for the first time, for clinicians to screen for steatohepatitis and fibrosis all patients with type 2 diabetes and liver steatosis or abnormal plasma aminotransferases. This requires primary care physicians to be aware of key aspects related to the diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD, as well as to when to refer to a specialist. Unfortunately, there is still significant medical inertia as clinicians remain unaware of its high morbidity/mortality. Early diagnosis in the primary care setting is critical to prevent progression to end-stage liver disease. Patients with NAFLD are also at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Despite general perception to the contrary, weight loss by lifestyle intervention or bariatric surgery and several pharmacological treatments (eg, vitamin E in nondiabetics, pioglitazone or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in patients with or without diabetes) can often be successful to reverse steatohepatitis and prevent disease progression.

### A meta-analysis of randomized trials for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^0f3fbd5d]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a histological spectrum ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD carries a higher risk of cardio-metabolic and liver-related complications, the latter being confined to NASH and demanding specific treatment. We assessed the efficacy of proposed treatments for NAFLD/NASH by reviewing reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on online databases and national and international meeting abstracts through January 2010. Primary outcome measure was histological improvement; secondary outcome was biochemical improvement; improvement in radiological steatosis was also evaluated. Two reviewers extracted articles using predefined quality indicators, independently and in duplicate. Main outcomes of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were pooled using random-effects or fixed-effects models. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots. Forty-nine RCTs (30 in NASH) were included: 23 RCTs (22 in NASH, 1 in NAFLD) had post-treatment histology. Most RCTs were small and did not exceed 1-year duration. Weight loss, thiazolidinediones (especially pioglitazone), and antioxidants were most extensively evaluated. Weight loss was safe and dose-dependently improved histological disease activity in NASH, but more than 50% of patients failed to achieve target weight loss. Thiazolidinediones improved steatosis and inflammation but yielded significant weight gain. RCTs with antioxidants yielded conflicting results and were heterogeneous with respect to type and dose of drug, duration, implementation of lifestyle intervention. Among the other agents, pentoxifylline, telmisartan and L-carnitine improved liver histology in at least 1 RCT in NASH; polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ameliorated biochemical and radiological markers of NAFLD. Other approaches yielded negative results.

Conclusion

Well-designed RCTs of adequate size and duration, with histological endpoints, are needed to assess long-term safety and efficacy of proposed treatments on patient-oriented clinical outcomes.

Abstract

Non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a wide spectrum of pathologies ranging from non‐alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), characterized by simple steatosis without inflammation, to non‐alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by steatosis of the liver accompanied by inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, which can lead to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Apart from lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, a Mediterranean diet and physical activity, only a few NAFLD‐specific pharmacological treatment options such as Vitamin E and Pioglitazone are considered by current international guidelines. However, recently randomized controlled trials with GLP‐1 agonists, FXR and PPAR ligands as well as other agents have been published and may expand the therapeutic armamentarium for NAFLD in the near future. Finally, knowledge about treating complications of end‐stage liver disease due to NASH becomes an increasingly important cornerstone in the treatment of the broad disease spectrum of NAFLD. In this review, we summarize currently available and future treatment options for patients with NAFLD that may help internal medicine specialists treat the complete clinical spectrum of this highly prevalent liver disease.

### FDA approves first treatment for patients with liver… [^7aba3a7f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved Rezdiffra for the treatment of adults with noncirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with moderate to advanced liver scarring, to be used along with diet and exercise. "Previously, patients with NASH who also have notable liver scarring did not have a medication that could directly address their liver damage, " said Nikolay Nikolov, M. D., acting director of the Office of Immunology and Inflammation in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Today's approval of Rezdiffra will, for the first time, provide a treatment option for these patients, in addition to diet and exercise". To enroll in the trial, patients needed to have a liver biopsy showing inflammation due to NASH with moderate or advanced liver scarring.

In the trial, 888 subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of the following: placebo; 80 milligrams of Rezdiffra; or 100 milligrams of Rezdiffra; once daily, in addition to standard care for NASH, which includes counseling for healthy diet and exercise. At 12 months, liver biopsies showed that a greater proportion of subjects who were treated with Rezdiffra achieved NASH resolution or an improvement in liver scarring as compared with those who received the placebo. A total of 26% to 27% of subjects who received 80 milligrams of Rezdiffra and 24% to 36% of subjects who received 100 milligrams of Rezdiffra experienced NASH resolution and no worsening of liver scarring, compared to 9% to 13% of those who received placebo and counseling on diet and exercise. The range of responses reflects different pathologists' readings.

In addition, a total of 23% of subjects who received 80 milligrams of Rezdiffra and 24% to 28% of subjects who received 100 milligrams of Rezdiffra experienced an improvement in liver scarring and no worsening of NASH, compared to 13% to 15% of those who received placebo, depending on each pathologist's readings.

### Rates of and factors associated with placebo response in Trials of pharmacotherapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^0e18f227]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

It is important to know the extent of the placebo effect in designing randomized controlled trials for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to accurately calculate sample size and define treatment endpoints.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the placebo groups from randomized controlled trials of adults with NASH that provided histologic and/or magnetic resonance image-based assessments. We identified trials through a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus, from each database's inception through January 2, 2018.

Results

We identified 39 randomized controlled trials, comprising 1463 patients who received placebo. Histologic assessment data (the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity scores, NAS) were available from 956 patients; magnetic resonance spectroscopy data were available from 295 patients and magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction measurements from 61 patients. Overall, 25% of patients given placebo had an improvement in NAS by 2 or more points (95% CI, 21%-29%) with a small amount of heterogeneity (I² = 27%). There were improvements by at least 1 point in steatosis scores of 33% ± 3% of patients, in hepatocyte ballooning scores of 30% ± 3% of patients, in lobular inflammation scores of 32% ± 3% of patients, and in fibrosis scores of 21% ± 3% of patients, with a moderate amount of heterogeneity among trials (I² range, 51%-63%). Patients given placebo had a statistically significant improvement in NAS (by 0.72 ± 0.19), with a large amount of heterogeneity (I² = 96%). Univariate and multivariate meta-regression showed that trials with a higher baseline NAS, those conducted in South America, and those in which patients had a decrease in body mass index, were associated with greater improvements in NAS among patients given placebo. Patients given placebo had significant reductions in intrahepatic triglyceride, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (by 1.45% ± 0.54%) with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 40%), and in magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction (by 2.43 ± 0.89), without heterogeneity (I² = 0). Mean serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases decreased significantly (by 11.7 ± 3.8 U/L and 5.9 ± 2.1 U/L, respectively; P < .01 for both).

Conclusions

In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of NASH, patients given placebo have significant histologic, radiologic, and biochemical responses. The placebo response should be considered in designing trials of agents for treatment of NASH.

### Emerging advances in the pharmacologic treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis And related cirrhosis [^9189a345]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Current status of combination therapy

Taking into account the complex pathophysiology of NASH and the limited efficacy of the agents tested thus far, it seems reasonable that a one-drug approach might not be appropriate. Combining drugs that have complementary mechanisms of action might increase treatment efficacy. In this context, regimens that include a drug with a primarily metabolic mechanism of action (for example by targeting PPARs), combined with a drug that has anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic mechanisms of action (for example by targeting FXR), might help increase or maximize response rates. It is important to note that drugs that have been already evaluated as monotherapy without showing individual effects should not be discarded, as they may exert synergistic effects in a combination regimen. Another way that combination treatment might be helpful is by decreasing the side effects of a certain drug that may otherwise limit its overall performance. Lastly, the inclusion of antidiabetic drugs, in particular those that lead to a significant weight loss, like the GLP-1 analogs, may help improve both liver-related and diabetes-related outcomes.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^76a538dc]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

High-risk nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) management emphasizes cardiometabolic care and specific medication guidance. In high-risk patients, we recommend following standards of care for managing diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, and when possible, preference should be given to diabetes medications with known efficacy in NASH (ie, GLP-1RAs and pioglitazone). Of note, pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and among SGLT2 inhibitors randomized controlled trials have reported a placebo-subtracted reduction in steatosis of approximately 20% with unknown effects on liver histology. Statins can be prescribed to patients with F2–F3 and Child A or B cirrhosis, and a meta-analysis including 13 studies and 121,058 patients showed a 46% reduction in hepatic decompensation (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46–0.62) and 46% lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47–0.61). However, statins do not appear to extend survival in Child class C cirrhosis and, because data in decompensated cirrhosis remain limited, use in these patients should be avoided. There is no safe threshold for alcohol intake in patients with advanced fibrosis.

### Lifestyle modifications for nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease: a network meta-analysis [^1f6d25dd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases the risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and requirement for liver transplantation. There is uncertainty surrounding the relative benefits and harms of various lifestyle interventions for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different lifestyle interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of the different lifestyle interventions according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in people with NAFLD, whatever the method of diagnosis, age, and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to perform a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and to calculate the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios (RaRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-participant analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. However, the data were too sparse for the clinical outcomes. We therefore performed only direct comparisons (head-to-head comparisons) with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods.

Main Results

We included a total of 59 randomised clinical trials (3631 participants) in the review. All but two trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 33 different interventions, ranging from advice to supervised exercise and special diets, or a combination of these and no additional intervention were compared in these trials. The reference treatment was no active intervention. Twenty-eight trials (1942 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The follow-up ranged from 1 month to 24 months. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. The follow-up period in the trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 24 months. During this short follow-up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality were sparse. This is probably because of the very short follow-up periods. It takes a follow-up of 8 years to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. It is therefore unlikely that differences by clinical outcomes will be noted in trials with less than 5 years to 10 years of follow-up. In one trial, one participant developed an adverse event. There were no adverse events in any of the remaining participants in this trial, or in any of the remaining trials, which seemed to be directly related to the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effects of the lifestyle interventions compared with no additional intervention (to general public health advice) on any of the clinical outcomes after a short follow-up period of 2 months to 24 months in people with nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease. Accordingly, high-quality randomised clinical trials with adequate follow-up are needed. We propose registry-based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (a study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of participants to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice), comparing aerobic exercise and dietary advice versus standard of care (exercise and dietary advice received as part of national health promotion). The reason for the choice of aerobic exercise and dietary advice is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes which may translate to clinical benefit. The outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health-related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource use measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare use after a minimum follow-up of eight years, to find meaningful differences in the clinically important outcomes.

### Community pathways for the early detection and risk stratification of chronic liver disease: a narrative systematic review [^bceaa4a4]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with chronic liver disease are often diagnosed during an index presentation to hospital with decompensated cirrhosis or liver-related events, and these presentations are associated with high mortality. However, there is often a long asymptomatic phase, in which there is an opportunity for earlier diagnosis and interventions to prevent progression to advanced disease. Therefore, strategies for early diagnosis and interventions (including behavioural changes and pharmacological treatments) that prevent patients progressing to cirrhosis and its associated complications probably have substantial benefits for patients and health-care services. Many community pathways have been generated. Some pathways focus on abnormal liver function tests as a starting point to diagnose liver disease. Other pathways target groups at greater risk of chronic liver disease-particularly people with harmful alcohol consumption, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. This systematic review summarises the existing strategies available for the early detection or risk stratification of liver disease, focusing primarily on alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conducting randomised clinical trials that compare different strategies will be essential to elucidate which pathways are acceptable to patients, feasible, provide high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of liver disease, improve liver-related outcomes, and are most cost-effective at the population level.

### Pediatric non alcoholic fatty liver disease: more on novel treatment targets [^84e7e911]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The mainstay treatment of non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) based on weight loss and/or lifestyle changes is most often unsuccessful at all ages, thus requiring the implementation of pharmacological strategies. Targeting insulin resistance and oxidative stress has recently proven unsatisfactory. Among a number of proposed innovative approaches targeting novel pathomechanisms, probiotics appear an interesting and reasonable option acting on gut-liver axis malfunction through the modulation of diet-driven, obesogenic, and inflammatory intestinal microbiota. A combined multiple pharmacological therapy directed simultaneously towards novel and old pathomechanisms (including, e.g., insulin resistance, oxidative stress, gut-liver axis, apoptosis) along with lifestyle interventions however might be necessary both in adult and pediatric NAFLD therapy.

### Practical management of the increasing burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^1c08cde3]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Obesity-induced liver disease (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) describes a spectrum from steatosis through steatohepatitis to cirrhosis. Its prevalence is rising in tandem with societal rates of obesity which through consequent insulin resistance and fat deposition in hepatocytes lead to hepatocyte death and attempts at repair, which if persistent, lead to activation of liver fibrogenic cells. NAFLD, which may also progress to primary liver cancer, is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease in affluent countries. There is currently no single accurate diagnostic test besides a liver biopsy. The decision to consider a liver biopsy will be informed by the presence of insulin resistance determined by comparatively easy-to-measure factors together with other putative markers of progression such as hypertension. If a liver biopsy is performed, patients with steatosis with no evidence of inflammation may be less aggressively managed while those with steatohepatitis, since they have a faster trajectory to cirrhosis, should be managed more robustly. Besides lifestyle changes and increased aerobic exercise other strategies include considering referral to centres with ongoing clinical trials. Emerging treatments include α1 adrenoceptors antagonists, angiotensin receptor blockers, glitazones and vitamin E.

### Nutritional supplementation for nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease: a network meta-analysis [^e5b01289]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the requirement for liver transplantation. Uncertainty surrounds relative benefits and harms of various nutritional supplements in NAFLD. Currently no nutritional supplement is recommended for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

- To assess the benefits and harms of different nutritional supplements for treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis
- To generate rankings of different nutritional supplements according to their safety and efficacy SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) for people with NAFLD, irrespective of method of diagnosis, age and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods whenever possible and calculated differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance.

Main Results

We included in the review a total of 202 randomised clinical trials (14,200 participants). Nineteen trials were at low risk of bias. A total of 32 different interventions were compared in these trials. A total of 115 trials (7732 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 28 months. The follow-up period in trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 28 months. During this follow-up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality were sparse. We did not calculate effect estimates for mortality because of sparse data (zero events for at least one of the groups in the trial). None of the trials reported that they measured overall health-related quality of life using a validated scale. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions on serious adverse events (number of people or number of events). We are very uncertain about effects on adverse events of most of the supplements that we investigated, as the evidence is of very low certainty. However, people taking PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acid) may be more likely to experience an adverse event than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta-analysis results: OR 4.44, 95% CrI 2.40 to 8.48; low-certainty evidence; 4 trials, 203 participants; direct evidence: OR 4.43, 95% CrI 2.43 to 8.42). People who take other supplements (a category that includes nutritional supplements other than vitamins, fatty acids, phospholipids, and antioxidants) had higher numbers of adverse events than those not receiving an active intervention (network meta-analysis: rate ratio 1.73, 95% CrI 1.26 to 2.41; 6 trials, 291 participants; direct evidence: rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.25 to 2.40; low-certainty evidence). Data were sparse (zero events in all groups in the trial) for liver transplantation, liver decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. So, we did not perform formal analysis for these outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about effects of other antioxidants (antioxidants other than vitamins) compared to no active intervention on liver cirrhosis (HR 1.68, 95% CrI 0.23 to 15.10; 1 trial, 99 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about effects of interventions in any of the remaining comparisons, or data were sparse (with zero events in at least one of the groups), precluding formal calculations of effect estimates. Data were probably because of the very short follow-up period (2 months to 28 months). It takes follow-up of 8 to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes are noted in trials providing less than 5 to 10 years of follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about effects of nutritional supplementation compared to no additional intervention on all clinical outcomes for people with non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease. Accordingly, high-quality randomised comparative clinical trials with adequate follow-up are needed. We propose registry-based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of patients to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice) comparing interventions such as vitamin E, prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics, PUFAs, and no nutritional supplementation. The reason for the choice of interventions is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes, which may translate to clinical benefit. Outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health-related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource utilisation measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare utilisation after minimum follow-up of 8 years (to find meaningful differences in clinically important outcomes).

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: a network meta-analysis [^f824619b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), encompasses a spectrum of liver disorders marked by excessive fat accumulation in hepatocytes, in the absence of significant alcohol consumption.MASLD is strongly linked to metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, which collectively drive its development and progression. The disease ranges from simple steatosis to more severe stages, including steatohepatitis, fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis, which can significantly impair liver function and overall health. The global prevalence of MASLD is rising steadily, mirroring the increasing rates of metabolic disorders. It is estimated that approximately 25% of the global population is affected by MASLD, with the prevalence even higher among individuals with obesity or diabetes. This growing burden underscores the urgent need for targeted therapeutic interventions. MASLD is not only a leading cause of chronic liver disease but also a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which remains the primary cause of mortality in these patients. Addressing liver steatosis and fibrosis is essential for halting disease progression and preventing life‐threatening complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, effective management can help mitigate extra‐hepatic complications, including cardiovascular morbidity.

### The role of lifestyle changes in the management of chronic liver disease [^78f574fb]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe liver disease has significant effects on an individual's quality of life (QOL) as well as their life expectancy. The treatment of many of these conditions involves multi-drug regimens which can be associated with a variety of side effects. Although therapy with prescription medication is often unavoidable, maximizing lifestyle interventions can play a key role in maintenance of overall health augmenting medical therapy in patients with chronic liver disease. Recently published studies have advanced our understanding of how various lifestyle interventions may improve the pathology and symptoms related to specific liver diseases, thereby improving quality of life for these patients.

Lifestyle modifications are strongly recommended for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as patients who have undergone liver transplantation. Even when efficacious pharmacologic interventions are identified, lifestyle changes will likely represent an adjuvant treatment because new drugs are inevitably expensive and may have unanticipated adverse effects after prolonged use. These lifestyle modifications typically encompass both dietary intervention and physical activity goals. Unfortunately, these straightforward goals are surprisingly hard to achieve in an environment of copious amounts of high-calorie food and busy daily routines that seem to preclude time for exercise. Many of these difficulties can only be overcome by a culture change that values wholesome foods and regular exercise over the convenience of prepared foods and sedentary activities. In the following sections we will discuss the current evidence for non-pharmacological, lifestyle interventions in the management of some of the most common causes of chronic liver disease including NAFLD, chronic HCV infection, as well as in the liver transplant population.

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^bfb2d8b6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly becoming the most common type of chronic liver disease worldwide. From the spectrum of NAFLD, it is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that predominantly predisposes patients to higher risk for development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is growing evidence that the risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is not uniform among all patients with NASH. In fact, NASH patients with increasing numbers of metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, visceral obesity and dyslipidemia are at a higher risk of mortality. Additionally, patients with higher stage of liver fibrosis are also at increased risk of mortality. In this context, NASH patients with fibrosis are in the most urgent need of treatment. Also, the first line of treatment for NASH is lifestyle modification with diet and exercise. Nevertheless, the efficacy of lifestyle modification is quite limited. Additionally, vitamin E and pioglitazone may be considered for subset of patients with NASH. There are various medications targeting one or more steps in the pathogenesis of NASH being developed. These drug regimens either alone or in combination, may provide potential treatment option for patients with NASH.

### Comparative effectiveness of pharmacological interventions for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^beb29cd8]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect treatment comparisons to assess the comparative effectiveness of pharmacological agents for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Through systematic literature review, we identified nine randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) including 964 patients with biopsy-proven NASH, comparing vitamin E, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), pentoxifylline, or obeticholic acid to one another or placebo. The primary outcome was improvement in fibrosis stage; secondary outcomes were improvement in ballooning degeneration, lobular inflammation, and steatosis. We reported relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from direct meta-analysis and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) from Bayesian network meta-analysis, and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise quality of evidence. Moderate-quality evidence supports the use of pentoxifylline (RR, 0.26; 95% CrI: 0.05–1.00) and obeticholic acid (RR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.70–0.95) over placebo in improving fibrosis. High-quality evidence supports the effect of vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic acid over placebo in improving ballooning degeneration. All four interventions seemed to have at least moderate-quality evidence over placebo to improve steatosis. Moderate-quality evidence supports that TZDs, pentoxifylline, and obeticholic acid decrease lobular inflammation. All the head-to-head comparisons were supported by very-low-quality evidence except for superiority of TZDs over vitamin E on improving steatosis and lobular inflammation, which had moderate-quality evidence.

Conclusions

Based on direct and network meta-analysis, pentoxifylline and obeticholic acid improve fibrosis, and vitamin E, TZDs, and obeticholic acid improve ballooning degeneration in patients with NASH. Future comparative trials of combination therapies targeting distinct histological features are warranted.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^bd5dcf43]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, the current EASL guidelines state that Pioglitazone "could be used" for the treatment of patients with NASH and significant fibrosis, while the AASLD suggests that it "may be used" for treating biopsy‐proven NASH patients with and without a type 2 diabetes.

Other pharmacological treatment options

Apart from Vitamin E and Pioglitazone, several trials testing mechanistically different types of medication in NAFLD have been published throughout the last few years and have shown promising results. However, none have yet made their way into national‐ or international guidelines. Nevertheless, we will outline the most important clinical findings in the following chapters, stratified by pharmacological mechanisms of action, while a detailed review of emerging therapeutic targets for NAFLD can be found elsewhere.

GLP‐1 agonists

The glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist semaglutide has shown a significantly higher percentage of patients with NASH resolution (and no worsening of fibrosis) compared to placebo in a 72‐week, double‐blind phase 2 trial involving 320 patients with biopsy‐confirmed NASH and fibrosis stage 1–3 40. Improvement in fibrosis stage was seen in 43% of NASH patients and 33% of placebo patients, but this difference was not statistically significant. Importantly, around 38% of patients in the study had no (!) diabetes mellitus, however all had at least a BMI > 25. Also of note, the semaglutide dosage used (0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 mg once‐daily) was significantly higher than in its main indication (treatment of diabetes mellitus type II). A previous study investigating the efficacy of the GLP‐1 agonist liraglutide in 52 overweight patients with clinical evidence of NASH showed a significantly higher rate of NASH resolution in the liraglutide group compared to placebo. Most importantly, 9% in the liraglutide group versus 36% in the placebo (p = 0.04) group showed a progression of fibrosis. A recent meta‐analysis consisting of 11 RCTs that investigated GLP‐1 agonists in NAFLD patients concluded that their overall clinical effect lies mainly in NASH resolution rather than fibrosis improvement.

Thus current guidelines do not recommend GLP‐1 agonists for patients with NAFLD outside their labeled indications (treatment of diabetes mellitus and/or obesity).

Recent data suggested possible positive effects of dual GLP‐1/Glucagone or GLP‐1/GIP Receptor ligands and those might be promising future targets, although further studies are needed to prove their clinical efficacy.

### Vitamin E for people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^aae335f3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting an estimated 3 in 10 people. The available treatment is far from optimal. Diet and lifestyle changes to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance are the basic management of NAFLD, but these are difficult to achieve and maintain. Vitamin E has shown beneficial effects on oxidative stress, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. However, there is uncertainty about the effects of vitamin E for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of vitamin E alone, or vitamin E in combination with other vitamins or minerals, versus placebo or no intervention in people with NAFLD.

Search Methods

We used recommended Cochrane search methods. The latest search was performed on 2 February 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials that compared vitamin E alone, or in combination with other vitamins or minerals, at any dose, duration, and route of administration, versus placebo or no intervention, in people with NAFLD of any age, sex, or ethnic origin. We included participants with imaging techniques or histology-proven NAFLD and minimal alcohol intake, and participants with steatohepatitis who had liver biopsies.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, non-serious adverse events, biochemical response, and imaging assessment of the degree of fatty liver.

Risk Of Bias

We used Cochrane's RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias for each of the predefined outcomes.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We included 16 randomised clinical trials involving 1066 paediatric and adult participants with NAFLD. Experimental groups received vitamin E alone (14 trials) or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C (2 trials). Control groups received placebo in 13 trials and no intervention in three trials. Daily dosages of oral vitamin E ranged from 298 international units (IU) to 1000 IU. Co-interventions were lifestyle and low-calorie diet interventions in 13 trials, ursodeoxycholic acid in one trial, unchanged diet and physical activity in one trial, and baseline treatments for type 2 diabetes in one trial. Nine trials had more than two intervention groups, but we used only the groups in which vitamin E alone or vitamin E in combination with vitamin C were compared with placebo or no intervention. In total, 7.9% (84/1066) of participants dropped out. Follow-up ranged from 2 months to 24 months.

Synthesis Of Results

Vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 3.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 20.86; 3 trials, 351 participants; very low certainty evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.30 to 12.01; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. There were no data on liver-related mortality or liver-related morbidity. The effects of vitamin E versus placebo or no intervention on physical health-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) 0.74, 95% CI -0.52 to 2.01; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); psychosocial health-related quality of life (MD -0.57, 95% CI -4.11 to 2.97; 2 trials, 251 participants; higher scores indicate better quality of life; very low certainty evidence); and non-serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; 2 trials, 283 participants; very low certainty evidence) are also very uncertain. There were no data on proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely slightly reduces serum alanine transaminase (ALT) (MD -9.29, 95% CI -13.69 to -4.89; 11 trials, 708 participants; moderate certainty evidence) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (MD -4.90, 95% CI -7.24 to -2.57; 11 trials, 695 participants; moderate certainty evidence) levels compared with placebo or no intervention. Vitamin E may slightly reduce serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels (MD -5.21, 95% CI -9.88 to -0.54; 5 trials, 416 participants; very low certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Vitamin E plus vitamin C versus placebo There were no data on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on reducing serum ALT (MD -0.50, 95% CI -4.58 to 3.58; 2 trials, 133 participants; very low certainty evidence), AST (MD 0.09, 95% CI -3.39 to 3.57; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (MD 1.58, 95% CI -3.22 to 6.38; 1 trial, 88 participants; very low certainty evidence) are very uncertain. We identified three ongoing trials, and six trials are awaiting classification.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know if long-term treatment (18 months to 24 months) with vitamin E administered alone affects all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, quality of life, or non-serious adverse events in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo or no intervention. We found no data on liver-related mortality, liver-related morbidity, or proportion of participants without a decrease in liver enzymes. Vitamin E likely reduces ALT and AST slightly when compared with placebo, but whether this has any impact on the clinical course in people with NAFLD is unknown. The trials on vitamin E plus vitamin C did not report on all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality, serious adverse events, liver-related morbidity, health-related quality of life, or non-serious adverse events. Given the very low certainty evidence, we do not know the effects of vitamin E plus vitamin C on liver enzymes in people with NAFLD when compared with placebo.

### Drugs improving insulin resistance for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and / or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^d67839b3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by fat accumulation in the liver, which may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. It is suspected in persons with elevated aminotransferase levels and features of insulin resistance (or metabolic) syndrome. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is not clear and there is no universal treatment.

Objectives

To assess beneficial and harmful effects of drugs improving insulin resistance for NAFLD and/or NASH.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and The Chinese Biomedical Database until February 2006.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of drugs improving insulin resistance for patients with NAFLD or NASH.

Data Collection and Analysis

We evaluated the methodological quality of the randomised clinical trials by the generation of the allocation section, allocation concealment, and follow-up. Two independent observers extracted data from each trial. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

Only three randomised clinical trials could be included. Two of the trials had unclear allocation concealment. None was blinded regarding outcome assessment. In two trials, metformin was associated with significantly higher normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase (OR fixed 2.83, 95% CI 1.27 to 6.31 versus diet and OR fixed 7.75, 95% CI 2.37 to 25.35 versus vitamin E) and improvement of liver echographic response (OR fixed 5.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 25.21). An improvement of fatty infiltration was observed in a limited number of patients undergoing liver biopsy. In the single pioglitazone trial, a statistically significant improvement of NASH histology was demonstrated.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, there is insufficient data to either support or refute the use of drugs improving insulin resistance for patients with NAFLD, although current limited information suggests a favourable role of drugs improving insulin resistance. It is advisable to carry out large randomised trials on this topic employing clinically relevant outcome measures and adequate methodology, including blinded outcome assessment.

Alcohol use in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is addressed with defined thresholds and directives: The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines heavy or at-risk drinking as more than 4 drinks on any day or more than 14 drinks per week in men or more than 3 drinks on any day or 7 drinks per week in women, and heavy alcohol consumption is a risk factor for chronic liver disease and should be avoided by patients with NAFLD and NASH. Patients with NAFLD should not consume heavy amounts of alcohol. (Strength – 1, Quality – B). No recommendation can be made with regards to non-heavy consumption of alcohol by individuals with NAFLD.
