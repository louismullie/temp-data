## Question

What is recommended for the soft tissue calcifications found on xray

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage soft tissue calcifications identified on plain radiographs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming that the density truly represents calcification versus ossification or a foreign body. Then, I should verify the anatomic location to narrow the differential. Next, I will consider key clinical contexts such as trauma, renal disease, and inflammatory arthropathies. After that, I need to decide when advanced imaging is warranted and which modality to choose. Then, I should review when laboratory testing is indicated. Finally, I will outline management by etiology and close with red flags and follow-up principles, ensuring I continuously check assumptions against the literature at each step [^112iNPPj] [^112JjjGT].

> Let me first confirm the nature of the density on the radiograph, because mistaking ossification for calcification or a foreign body can misdirect management; true calcifications typically show amorphous, cloudlike densities with attenuation roughly 100–400 HU on CT, whereas ossifications display cortical/trabecular bone architecture with higher HU and a zonal maturation pattern, and foreign bodies often have sharp geometric edges and characteristic shapes such as glass or metal, so I should double-check morphology and consider CT attenuation if uncertain [^113SkfHh] [^114S6JLv].

> Wait, let me verify the exact location next, since location drives a focused differential; intra-tendinous calcifications point toward hydroxyapatite deposition disease, intra-articular linear calcifications suggest CPPD, periarticular multiloculated masses raise tumoural calcinosis, intramuscular or subcutaneous calcifications with a zonal pattern indicate myositis ossificans, vascular ring-and-arc or tram-track densities reflect arterial calcification, and phleboliths with central lucency imply venous malformation, so I should carefully map the calcification to tendon, joint, muscle, vessel, or skin and subcutis before proceeding [^115B3rYa] [^112JjjGT] [^115fDh9C].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to integrate clinical context because it refines pretest probabilities, for example trauma or surgery suggesting heterotopic ossification, chronic kidney disease or dialysis raising metastatic calcification, and inflammatory rheumatic disease prompting calcinosis cutis, so I should confirm history of burns, recent injections, CKD, scleroderma or dermatomyositis, and crystal arthropathy symptoms before labeling the calcification [^115Jckiu] [^111851bY] [^1151uKfc].

> I will now examine whether advanced imaging is necessary; if the radiograph is diagnostic and the patient is asymptomatic, no further imaging may be needed, but if the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesion is deep, there is concern for neoplasm, or surgical planning is required, then MRI is the modality of choice for soft tissue characterization and local staging, while CT better depicts subtle mineralization patterns and cortical involvement; ultrasound can be a useful first-line triage for superficial masses and can identify phleboliths, but I should remember MRI can underestimate calcification and must be correlated with radiographs to avoid misinterpretation [^114K7tDY] [^1179PG8i] [^112zrbLD] [^113SkfHh].

> Let me consider laboratory evaluation when I suspect a metabolic cause; I should confirm serum calcium and phosphate, renal function, and parathyroid hormone, and if collagen vascular disease is suspected, add autoimmune serologies, because hypercalcemia with elevated calcium-phosphate product supports metastatic calcification, whereas normal mineral levels favor dystrophic calcification; I need to ensure I do not over-order tests in clearly localized, traumatic dystrophic cases where labs are unlikely to change management [^111851bY] [^113RT9pz].

> Next, I should review management by etiology; for calcific tendinopathy, conservative care with NSAIDs, rest, and physiotherapy is first-line, and if pain is refractory in the resorptive phase, image-guided aspiration and corticosteroid injection can be considered, with most cases resolving spontaneously; for CPPD, treat acute flares and address underlying metabolic contributors; for heterotopic ossification, early conservative management with NSAIDs and radiation can be considered in high-risk patients, with surgical excision delayed until maturity; for tumoural calcinosis in CKD, optimize mineral metabolism, restrict calcium-based binders if calcification is present, and consider sodium thiosulfate in refractory cases; for calcinosis cutis in systemic sclerosis, prioritize infection prevention and treat superinfection promptly, reserving surgery for severe, function-limiting disease; for phleboliths within venous malformations, reassurance and symptom-directed care are typical, with sclerotherapy or surgical options for symptomatic lesions [^112pvXbi] [^115oHtKS] [^1151uKfc].

> But wait, what if the calcification pattern is atypical or the mass is growing; I should double-check for red flags that mandate urgent oncologic workup, including periarticular soft tissue mass with faint calcifications in a young adult suggesting synovial sarcoma, destructive bone changes, or a new deep mass without clear benign features, in which case I should obtain MRI and refer to a sarcoma center for biopsy planning, remembering that mineralization can be central in sarcoma but peripheral in heterotopic ossification, and that biopsy must be planned along future resection lines to avoid contamination [^111MYBk8] [^111qY5Ta] [^114K7tDY].

> I need to ensure follow-up is appropriate; for benign-appearing dystrophic calcifications with reassuring clinical context, clinical observation may suffice, whereas for indeterminate lesions or post-treatment calcifications, interval imaging can document stability, and in patients with CKD or systemic disease, periodic assessment of calcium-phosphate product and targeted imaging of involved regions can help detect progression early and guide therapy adjustments [^111851bY] [^1122dHT2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost attributed a periarticular calcified mass solely to HADD, but I should verify that multilocular periarticular calcifications with fluid-fluid levels are more typical of tumoural calcinosis rather than simple calcific tendinopathy, so I should correct that assumption and align the differential with the characteristic location and morphology before committing to a diagnosis [^111851bY] [^115B3rYa].

> In summary, I should confirm calcification versus ossification or foreign body, localize precisely, integrate clinical context, escalate to MRI or CT when needed, order targeted labs when metabolic disease is suspected, treat according to the specific etiology, and maintain vigilance for malignancy red flags, verifying each step against imaging-pathology correlations and guideline-based principles to avoid misclassification and unnecessary procedures [^112iNPPj] [^114K7tDY] [^111qY5Ta].

Soft tissue calcifications on X-ray are managed by **identifying the cause** and **targeting therapy** [^111ZagKi]. Most calcifications are benign and need no treatment; however, **metabolic causes** (hypercalcemia, CKD, hyperparathyroidism) require correction of calcium–phosphate balance and referral to endocrinology or nephrology [^112Uei2h] [^113RT9pz]. For **dystrophic calcifications** (tendinopathy, myositis ossificans, calcinosis cutis), use conservative care, physical therapy, and surgery if symptomatic or function-limiting [^112pvXbi] [^1151uKfc]. Suspected neoplastic calcifications need MRI or CT and urgent oncology referral [^114K7tDY] [^111qY5Ta]. Always correlate with clinical context, check serum calcium and phosphate, and escalate care for red flags (pain, rapid growth, systemic symptoms) [^111851bY].

---

## Classification of soft tissue calcifications

Soft tissue calcifications are broadly classified as **dystrophic**, **metastatic**, or **idiopathic**:

- **Dystrophic calcification**: Occurs in damaged or degenerated tissues with normal calcium–phosphate levels; accounts for > 95% of cases [^112iNPPj].

- **Metastatic calcification**: Associated with abnormal calcium–phosphate metabolism (e.g. hypercalcemia, chronic kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism) [^111851bY].

- **Idiopathic calcification**: Occurs without identifiable cause (e.g. tumoral calcinosis) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

### Initial clinical assessment

During the initial assessment, obtain a **focused history** covering trauma, chronic illness, medications, and systemic symptoms, and perform a **physical examination** to characterize location, size, consistency, mobility, and tenderness [^112Fkdh8].

---

### Laboratory evaluation

Order **serum calcium and phosphate** to screen for metabolic causes, and check **renal function and parathyroid hormone** if metastatic calcification is suspected [^111851bY].

---

### Imaging evaluation

- **Plain radiography**: Initial modality to characterize calcifications and guide further imaging [^113f8483].

- **Ultrasound**: Useful for superficial lesions and to distinguish solid from cystic masses [^1179PG8i].

- **CT**: Defines anatomy, extent, and relationship to adjacent structures; detects subtle calcifications [^112zrbLD].

- **MRI**: Gold standard for soft tissue characterization, particularly for neoplastic lesions [^1179PG8i].

---

## Management strategies based on etiology

### Dystrophic calcifications

#### Calcific tendinopathy (hydroxyapatite deposition disease)

- **Conservative management**: NSAIDs, rest, physical therapy, and ultrasound-guided aspiration/injection for refractory cases [^112pvXbi].

- **Surgical intervention**: Reserved for persistent, symptomatic cases refractory to conservative therapy [^notfound].

---

#### Myositis ossificans

For myositis ossificans, **conservative management** includes NSAIDs, physical therapy, and observation, with **surgical excision** considered only after maturation (typically > 6 months) if function is impaired [^notfound].

---

#### Calcinosis cutis (systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis)

Management of calcinosis cutis includes **medical therapy** — colchicine, bisphosphonates, or sodium thiosulfate for symptomatic relief [^notfound] — and **surgical intervention** for severe, refractory cases impacting function or quality of life [^1151uKfc].

---

### Metastatic calcifications

#### Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hyperparathyroidism

- **Medical management**: Phosphate binders, calcimimetics, and control of calcium–phosphate product [^1164xEGi].

- **Dialysis**: Optimize dialysis regimen to control calcium–phosphate balance [^notfound].

- **Parathyroidectomy**: Consider for refractory hyperparathyroidism [^notfound].

---

#### Hypercalcemia of malignancy

Treat the **underlying malignancy** and use **bisphosphonates or denosumab** to lower calcium.

---

### Idiopathic calcifications

For idiopathic tumoral calcinosis, **conservative management** with observation and NSAIDs is appropriate, and **surgical excision** is reserved for symptomatic or function-limiting lesions.

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is indicated for **persistent pain or functional impairment** despite conservative therapy, for **rapid growth or suspicion of malignancy**, and for **severe cosmetic deformity**.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include periodic clinical assessment of symptoms and function, with **repeat imaging** (ultrasound, CT, or MRI) as needed to monitor progression or recurrence.

---

## Potential complications of untreated calcifications

Untreated calcifications can cause **chronic pain and functional impairment** and may lead to **neurovascular compression**. They may also indicate or progress due to **underlying metabolic or neoplastic disease**.

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Effective management often requires **coordination among**:

- **Radiologists**: Imaging characterization and guidance [^114K7tDY].

- **Endocrinologists**: Management of metabolic causes [^113RT9pz].

- **Rheumatologists**: Management of inflammatory conditions [^1151uKfc].

- **Orthopedic surgeons**: Surgical intervention when indicated [^111nMGPW].

- **Oncologists**: Management of neoplastic calcifications [^111MYBk8].

---

Soft tissue calcifications on X-ray require a **structured approach**: classify the calcification, evaluate clinically and with labs/imaging, and tailor therapy to the cause. Most are benign and managed conservatively, but metabolic, inflammatory, or neoplastic causes need targeted treatment and multidisciplinary care.

Referral and assessment

Regional diagnostic services

Each regional sarcoma services should support the development of efficient pathways for the investigation of suspected sarcomas. This may include providing information to local primary care or radiology services on the initial investigation and onward referral of patients with soft-tissue masses, and effective pathways to make direct suspected-cancer referrals when required. This may well involve the development of local diagnostic services that link to a central treatment centre in a 'hub and spoke' model.

Imaging — diagnostic

Ultrasound provides an effective initial triage tool, and in certain conditions such as soft tissue arterio-venous malformations, may demonstrate pathognomonic features. The majority of soft-tissue lumps are likely to be diagnosed as benign lipomas and the patients can be safely reassured. Ultrasound assessment is however highly user dependent, and therefore in the case of diagnostic uncertainty, an MRI of the affected region should be performed. For soft-tissue tumours affecting the extremity, trunk, and pelvis an MRI provides the most accurate information for diagnosis and surgical/ radiotherapy planning. Plain X-ray may be used to identify bone involvement and risk of fracture, or to detect calcification. For retroperitoneal tumours and intra-thoracic sarcomas, CT is preferred for diagnosis and managing treatment. It is more convenient and provides complete staging information on the same scan.

Introduction

Soft tissue musculoskeletal calcifications are seen on radiographs on a daily basis. Oftentimes, the radiologist is uncomfortable regarding how to report them or if further investigations is necessary. While seemingly trivial, calcifications can be an early indication of an unsuspected pathology.

Two categories of calcifications are recognised: dystrophic and metabolic (also termed metastatic). Dystrophic calcifications occur in necrotic or damaged tissue with normal serum levels of calcium and may progress to ossification. They represent more than 95% of calcifications observed in radiology. Metastatic calcifications are generally diffuse, occur in otherwise normal tissue, and are associated with abnormal serum levels of calcium, phosphate (increased calcium-phosphate product) and other ions.

Calcifications have multiple appearances, locations and causes. With a careful and systematic analysis of their characteristics, it is often possible to narrow the differential diagnosis, sometimes with minimal further investigations. Therefore, in this article, instead of classifying calcifications by their aetiology, we propose a more practical approach based on location, information available to the radiologist. We will describe our two-step method regarding musculoskeletal densities on radiographs: firstly, the correct identification of a calcification, and secondly, its location (Fig. 1). Tips to differentiate one diagnosis from another will be discussed.

Second step: What is the exact location?

Once a calcification is recognised on a radiograph, its location can be determined when its shape follows that of the anatomical structure involved, or more routinely using multiple oblique views around joints. CT can be helpful but is most often not necessary. Table 1 summarises the differential diagnosis of calcifications and ossifications based on their location.

Tendon calcifications

Calcific tendinopathy (hydroxyapatite deposition disease, HADD)

Calcific tendinopathy is very frequent and seen in 3–15% of the general population. It peaks in the fifth decade, can be bilateral in up to 50% of patients and symptomatic in 10–50% of cases. It is thought to be the result of hydroxyapatite deposition disease (HADD) that accumulates in degenerated or traumatised tendons through a process of fibrocartilaginous metaplasia.

Successive stages have been described in the literature and may help in understanding the various imaging appearances of calcific tendinopathy. The most practical classification, by Uhthoff, separates pre-calcific, calcific and post-calcific stages. The calcific stage is further divided into formative, resting and resorptive phases.

Objective

Although MRI is the technique of choice for evaluating most soft-tissue masses, CT often provides valuable complementary information. Specifically, there are distinguishing CT characteristics that can suggest a specific diagnosis, including the lesion's mineralization pattern, density, pattern of adjacent bone involvement, and degree and pattern of vascularity.

Conclusion

This article provides an overview of the CT evaluation of soft-tissue masses, emphasizing a differential diagnosis based on these CT features.

Differential diagnosis of intramuscular and subcutaneous calcifications

HO is another non-neoplastic lesion that shows calcifications in the early stages, before the typical bone organisation pattern is recognised (Fig. 3). When occurring in a muscle, it is called myositis ossificans circumscripta, but it can be found in virtually any soft tissue, after trauma. Myositis ossificans can have an aggressive and worrisome clinical presentation and histopathology, suggesting a sarcoma. Follow up study with radiograph or CT is recommended and will show faint calcifications that will eventually evolve towards a focal ossification with a classical zonal distribution (Fig. 3). Burns are a classic cause of heterotopic ossification. Chronic venous insufficiency in the lower extremities will often have heterotopic ossification with a honeycomb appearance that coalesces in the subcutaneous tissues. There are two hereditary forms called progressive osseous heteroplasia and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive. The latter causes severe ossifications that will eventually prevent adequate motion, causing respiratory failure and death at an early age.

Fleischner Society 2017 — CT attenuation measurement technique for solid nodules: Measurement of attenuation (in Hounsfield units) can help detect calcification or fat; measurements should be made on images without an edge‑enhancing filter because sharpened images may give erroneously high attenuation values, and all attenuation measurements should be made on the thinnest available nonsharpened (typically soft‑tissue window) series using a small region of interest.

### Radiological identification and analysis of soft tissue musculoskeletal calcifications [^112JjjGT]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Calcifications are encountered on imaging by radiologists on a daily basis. An appropriate identification and analysis of those calcifications might be helpful in their practice. In this manuscript, we exposed our two-step method to make a correct diagnosis. First, radiologists have to differentiate between calcification from an ossification or a foreign body. Then, they must correctly identify their location, because it will significantly narrow the differential diagnosis and reduce unnecessary investigations. Hydroxyapatite deposition disease (HADD) is most often responsible for intra-tendinous calcifications and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease, for intra-articular calcifications. A few examples of the most frequent soft tissue calcifications are secondary tumoural calcinosis from renal insufficiency, or collagen vascular diseases and vascular calcifications (arterial or venous).

The formative and resting phases are associated with a dense, homogeneous and well-defined calcium deposit (Fig. 2 a). They can be asymptomatic or present with a mild to moderate degree of discomfort caused by impingement of a bulky calcification. The resorptive phase is characterised clinically by acute, sometimes excruciating, pain with the release and migration of calcium in surrounding tissues, bursae, joints or even bones. On radiographs, the calcification becomes fluffy, ill-defined (including a comet tail appearance) and less dense or even unapparent. The intra-bursal migration of calcifications can be seen as a dense crescent streak overlying the main calcification (Fig. 2 b). This resorptive phase can have misleading appearances on imaging, including bone erosions on radiographs, bone marrow oedema on MRI or bone uptake on nuclear medicine studies. Intraosseous resorption can classically be mistaken for infection or tumour, hence the importance of identifying the continuity between the erosion and the calcific tendinitis (Fig. 6). Clinically, the resorptive phase can mimic pseudoparalysis, a septic joint or a fracture, hence the importance of acquiring a radiograph and avoiding unnecessary joint aspiration or even arthrotomy. Despite the spontaneously favourable outcome, image-guided treatment can be considered in cases of refractory pain after conservative treatment (analgesics, NSAIDs, rest and physiotherapy), including ultrasound (US)-guided aspiration and/or injection of anaesthetic with a corticoid into the surrounding tissue, more frequently in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa, avoiding intra-tendinous injection. The post-calcific stage will show either a residual shell, linear calcification remnant, or a complete resolution.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^112HGZz5]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Radiographic and imaging follow-up

Radiographic evaluation is recommended in cases of persistent marked clinical or biochemical signs, for example, elevated levels of ALP despite adequate therapy. Enthesopathies, osteoarthritis and pseudofractures can be accurately diagnosed on plain radiographs and bone nuclear scans. The EOS system (which is associated with 50–80% less irradiation than conventional radiography; EOS Imaging, Paris, France) enables 3D assessment of limb deformityand should be used whenever possible. Renal ultrasonography is the preferred method to screen for nephrocalcinosis.

A dental orthopantomogram (radiograph of the upper and lower jaw and teeth) is suggested at 5 years of age and in adults with recent oral manifestations and should be repeated on the basis of clinical needs.

In symptomatic adults and children (such as those with persistent headache, vomiting or abnormal skull shape), we recommend evaluation by brain and/or spinal MRI to exclude craniosynostosis, Chiari 1 malformation or syringomyelia. To avoid excessive irradiation from radiography or computed tomography (CT), the skull can be imaged through the black bone sequence on MRI, which provides a high image contrast between bone and other tissues.

The clinical value of peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT) or bone mineral density (BMD) measurements by DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) in patients with XLH is limited –. Both methods are unable to diagnose osteomalacia. Intriguingly, trabecular volumetric BMD was even found to be increased in paediatric patients with XLH –, which might reflect a compensatory mechanism owing to the soft bone.

Elevated arterial blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy and/or pathological electrocardiograms have been reported in some but not all studies evaluating the cardiovascular status of patients with XLH –. Therefore, we suggest at least yearly blood pressure measurements, with a more detailed work-up only in the presence of persistently elevated blood pressure.

### Radiological identification and analysis of soft tissue musculoskeletal calcifications [^117HuCky]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal calcifications are frequent on radiographs and sometimes problematic. The goal of this article is to help radiologists to make the correct diagnosis when faced with an extraosseous musculoskeletal calcification. One should first differentiate a calcification from an ossification or a foreign body and then locate the calcification correctly. Each location has a specific short differential diagnosis, with minimal further investigation necessary. Intra-tendon calcifications are most frequently associated with hydroxyapatite deposition disease (HADD). In most cases, intra-articular calcifications are caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease. Soft tissue calcification can be caused by secondary tumoural calcinosis from renal insufficiency, or collagen vascular diseases and by vascular calcifications, either arterial or venous (phlebolith). TEACHING POINTS:
- Calcifications have to be differentiated form ossification and foreign body.
- A musculoskeletal MRI study must always be correlated with a radiograph.
- The clinical manifestations of calcifications may sometimes mimic septic arthritis or sarcoma.
- HADD and CPPD crystal deposition have a distinct appearance on radiograph.
- Calcinosis is more frequently caused by chronic renal failure and scleroderma.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® primary bone tumors [^112wgZx3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although primary bone tumors are relatively uncommon, appropriate imaging evaluation is essential when they are suspected or incidentally detected. In almost all cases, radiographs are the most appropriate initial imaging study for screening and characterization of primary bone tumors. Radiographs often provide sufficient information for diagnosis and to guide the treating clinician. However, when conventional radiographs alone are inadequate, they still often guide the selection of the most appropriate next step for advanced imaging. MRI and CT are typically the most appropriate next step. MRI provides excellent soft-tissue contrast allowing for evaluation of the tissue composition (such as fat, hemorrhage, fluid levels) and anatomic extent of bone tumors. CT provides complementary information, with its ability to detect subtle matrix mineralization or periosteal reaction that may not be seen on radiographs or MRI. This publication focuses on six common variants to guide diagnosis and management of primary bone tumors. In addition to conventional radiographs, appropriate use of MRI, CT, PET/CT, bone scan, and ultrasound are discussed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Abstract

Musculoskeletal calcifications are frequent on radiographs and sometimes problematic. The goal of this article is to help radiologists to make the correct diagnosis when faced with an extraosseous musculoskeletal calcification.

Intra-tendon calcifications are most frequently associated with hydroxyapatite deposition disease (HADD). In most cases, intra-articular calcifications are caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease. Soft tissue calcification can be caused by secondary tumoural calcinosis from renal insufficiency, or collagen vascular diseases and by vascular calcifications, either arterial or venous (phlebolith).

Regarding medical management for chondrosarcoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of atypical cartilaginous tumors, NCCN 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain surveillance with the following for patients post-treatment of atypical cartilaginous tumors:

- physical examination

- X-rays of the primary site and/or cross-sectional imaging (CT with contrast or MRI with and without contrast) every 6–12 months for 2 years, then yearly, as clinically indicated.

### Targeting vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease [^112umtgG]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Screening

Proponents of routine screening for vascular calcification among patients with CKD suggest there is significant incremental value in identifying a high-risk CV cohort. Conversely, others have argued that all patients with CKD should be considered at the highest CV risk and, in the absence of specific vascular calcification therapies, screening for vascular calcification does not influence management. Routine vascular calcification screening using either lateral pelvic x-ray or CT imaging received a weak (level 2C) recommendation in the 2017 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines, reflecting the paucity of outcomes-driven data. The wording used in the 2017 updated guidelines was nearly identical to that used in the 2009 Guidelines, highlighting the lack of progress in the search for specific therapies proven to reverse, arrest, or attenuate vascular calcification.

### Incidental osseous lesions on chest CT: an algorithmic approach for radiologists [^113p3irZ]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Numerous osseous findings are commonly discovered incidentally at chest CTs in daily practice. A broad spectrum of these findings ranges from benign and do not touch lesions to ominous conditions requiring further imaging evaluation and/or intervention. Interpretation of these incidental musculoskeletal findings may constitute a diagnostic challenge to radiologists. This review provides a systematic, algorithmic approach to common osseous lesions on chest CT based on imaging findings with recommendations for proper next step management.

Chordoma — diagnostic workup and imaging: Initial workup should include H&P examination with adequate cross-sectional imaging of the primary site (ie, x-ray, MRI ± CT), screening MRI of spinal axis, and C/A/P CT with contrast; skull base to mid-thigh FDG-PET/CT or bone scan (if FDG-PET/CT is negative) can be considered for unusual cases. Benign notochordal cell tumors (BNCTs) are considered precursors to chordomas and do not require surgical management, and CT and MRI may be useful in distinguishing BNCTs from chordomas. For skull base chordomas, CT is useful to delineate bone destruction and calcifications, whereas MRI is the modality of choice to define tumor margin, characterize position and extension into adjacent soft tissues, and visualize blood vessels; for sacrococcygeal chordomas, CT and MRI are useful to assess soft tissue involvement, calcifications, and epidural extension. MRI provides more precise and superior contrast with surrounding soft tissues compared with CT and is helpful to assess recurrent or metastatic lesions, while CT is of particular importance to assess bony involvement, calcifications, and soft tissue and epidural extension.

### Calcium acetate (phoslo) [^1143gHtQ]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Patients with end stage renal failure may develop hypercalcemia
when given calcium with meals. No other calcium supplements should be given
concurrently with PhosLo.

Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdose of PhosLo may be severe as to
require emergency measures. Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular
calcification, and other soft-tissue calcification. The serum calcium level
should be monitored twice weekly during the early dose adjustment period. The serum calcium times phosphate(Ca × P) product should not be allowed to exceed 66. Radiographic
evaluation of suspect anatomical region may be helpful in early detection of
soft tissue calcification.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^111THjJu]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The members of the GDG assessed the quality of the evidence according to the methodology described by the GRADE system. In this system, quality of supporting evidence is assessed based on explicit methodological criteria and classified as "high" (further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect), "moderate" (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate), "low" (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate), or "very low" (any estimate of effect is very uncertain).

The method we used for wording of recommendations is shown in Table 1. The GDG considered the quality of evidence, the balance between benefit and harms, patients' values and preferences, and the resources and potential costs involved. For instances where interventions or investigations were recommended (or not recommended), the GDG felt that the benefits clearly outweighed the harms for most people or vice versa. For instances where there was a closer balance between benefits and harm for interventions and investigations, the GDG made a conditional recommendation. For conditional recommendations, the GDG felt that clinicians should discuss with patients and families the relative merits of alternative management options to the intervention to help each patient arrive at a decision consistent with his or her values and preferences.

Table 1
Wording of Recommendations

For instances where there was insufficient evidence to support the use of an intervention or investigation for a specific indication, it was agreed that a statement should be made to acknowledge that the intervention or investigation was not recommended.

The guideline process was validated in accordance with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, using the AGREE reporting checklist 2016. 67

The draft guidelines were sent to several stakeholders and were externally reviewed by the representatives from the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, the European Calcified Tissues Society, the International Osteoporosis Foundation, the British Geriatrics Society, the Bone Research Society (UK), as well as several patients who are members of the UK Paget's Association. Several other organizations were invited to comment but did not respond (Supplemental Appendix S3). The final version of the guideline was revised and updated to take account of the comments that were received. The GDG intends to conduct regular reviews every 3 years after publication of the guidance to determine whether the evidence base has progressed significantly enough to alter the current guideline recommendations and require an update.

Regarding medical management for chondrosarcoma - NCCN, more specifically with respect to management of atypical cartilaginous tumors, NCCN 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain the following workup in case of local recurrence in patients with atypical cartilaginous tumors:

- imaging of the primary site as clinically indicated (such as X-ray, MRI with and without contrast, and CT with contrast)

- chest imaging

- bone scan (optional)

- biopsy to confirm diagnosis

- if there is malignant transformation, treat as higher grade nonmetastatic chondrosarcoma.

### Extra-articular soft-tissue calcification after burn injury: a case study [^115CydV8]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Soft-tissue calcifications after burn injury commonly develop in periarticular regions, especially in the elbow joint. They can be easily recognized in patients because calcification in the joint limits range of motion and brings about tingling sensation due to compression of ulnar nerve. However, the incidence of extra-articular soft-tissue calcification after burn injury has rarely been reported. We present a patient with massive soft-tissue calcification in extra-articular burn scar with nonhealing ulcer after a long latency period of 40 years. We recommended wide excision and skin grafting, for prevention of recalcification and recurrence of ulceration, which could transform into a malignant case, if left untreated. Furthermore, we propose that such patients with burn injury should undergo follow-up in outpatient clinic and x-ray evaluation.

### Understanding the management of pediatric spondylodiscitis based on existing literature; a systematic review [^116ug4mi]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Technetium Tc 99 m (bone scan) can isolate the area of pathology to a specific motion segment and help confirm the diagnosis if plain X-rays are unaltered. A bone scan benefits children whose localization of the infected area can be very difficult only by physical examination. After the onset of clinical symptoms, changes may appear as early as 3–5 days.

CT scans are more sensitive and valuable, especially for studying areas that are difficult to scan on X-rays, such as the dorsolumbar or lower cervical spine. In half of cases, CT abnormalities are visible in the first two weeks of infection. The evaluation of markers will look for early disc involvement presenting as reduced bone density. Areas of osteolysis, bone erosion, or vertebral endplate geodes can be easily identified, and this method helps to visualize bone sequestra within the canals, residual calcification, and the presence of gas within an abscess.

MRI is the gold standard method for diagnosing spondylodiscitis and has higher sensitivity and specificity than other methods. MRI is valuable because it provides an excellent image visualization of the disk, neural tissues, surrounding soft tissues, and pathophysiologic changes in the vertebral body. Hence, this can reduce diagnostic delay while guiding the extent and duration of treatment. MRI findings are high signal intensity from the discs and the two adjacent vertebrae, thickening of the paravertebral soft tissue, involvement within the vertebral canal on T2-weighted images, and low signal intensity on T1. The patient's age must be considered because red bone marrow remains predominant in children, and the high signal intensity on T1 could mask the inflammation.

One of the considerable challenges is choosing the best protocol for treatment. Unfortunately, until today, the lack of a coherent practical guideline in this regard has led doctors to select the appropriate treatment based on their clinical judgment and the patient's condition. The goal of treatment is to eliminate the infection and minimize morbidity. Different responses to different treatment regimens for spondylodiscitis have led to ongoing confusion and discussion about its underlying cause.

Calcinosis in SSc

What is the management for calcinosis in SSc?

There is a very limited evidence base to guide clinicians on the management of calcinosis in SSc, but practical approaches are considered important to mitigate impact. This is a key area for the research agenda (see below).

Guideline Recommendation for calcinosis in SSc:

Superadded infection of calcinosis should be recognized early and treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy (1C, 99%).
Surgical intervention should be considered in severe, refractory calcinosis, which is severely impacting upon functional ability and quality of life (1C, 95%).

Fatigue, and quality of life

What are the best interventions for general impact of SSc on health status and quality of life, including fatigue?

Fatigue is a major unmet need that is generally managed as for other disorders. While evidence of benefit for exercise specific to SSc is not available, this is generally encouraged. Treatments that target inflammation may also improve symptoms although this has not been clearly shown in trials. Quality of life measures are routinely assessed in interventional studies, and some have shown improvement but in such a multicompartment disease that includes damage that is very hard to reverse it is challenging to significantly improve standard measures. It was recognised that self-help information and resources are important for people with SSc. These are often available from support organisations and can include valuable guidance. In addition, the psychological impact of SSc is considered important and initiatives to support self-management as well as structured psychological assessment and intervention has relevance when considering disease impact on everyday life and function as outlined below.

### Use of imaging prior to referral to a musculoskeletal oncologist [^113f8483]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

Plain radiographs — soft tissue tumor of unknown etiology: In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that conventional radiographs are a reasonable diagnostic test and may be considered during the initial evaluation of a soft tissue tumor (Strength of Recommendation: Consensus). With respect to soft tissue tumors there is scant published literature regarding the value of conventional radiographs for diagnosis or planning; certain radiographic findings can be very helpful when present — such as phleboliths in hemangiomas, characteristic ossification patterns of myositis ossificans, mineralization within the substance of the tumor, density of the tumor, and cortical involvement of the underlying bone — however, many times conventional radiographs will not add any additional information regarding the identity of the tumor. Thus, our work group agreed that this test should be regarded as a justifiable, although not universally critical, diagnostic study at initial evaluation of soft tissue tumors.

### Foreign bodies on lateral neck radiographs in adults: imaging findings and common pitfalls [^114UnLp3]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Foreign-body (FB) ingestion is less common in adults than in children, but still occurs. Diagnostic management of patients with suspected FB ingestion in emergency departments depends on FB type and location, both of which are related to the patient profile. In adults, fish and chicken bones are the most common FB types, and the oropharynx and cricopharyngeal muscle are the most common locations. Once accidentally swallowed, an FB may become lodged in the oropharynx, and in such cases indirect or fiberoptic laryngoscopy is the first clinical management option. For FBs that have passed beyond this location, radiologic study is recommended, including anteroposterior and lateral neck radiographs (LNRs) using the soft-tissue technique. This is a quick and simple imaging method that in emergency departments achieves detection rates of 70%-80% in assessing FBs in the hypopharynx and upper cervical esophagus. Careful initial evaluation using LNRs can determine the presence and nature of an FB, which helps with predicting the location and risk assessment, making further imaging-including computed tomography-unnecessary. Prevertebral soft-tissue swelling is a nonspecific indirect sign, which in the appropriate clinical context raises suspicion of a radiolucent FB or related complications. LNRs can sometimes be difficult to interpret due to the presence of multiple overlapping soft-tissue structures and variable patterns of laryngeal cartilage calcification in adults. Adequate performance in interpreting LNRs along with familiarity with the full diagnostic process in these patients will enable radiologists to use the right imaging technique for the right patient, as described in the clinical algorithm proposed by the authors. © RSNA, 2017.

### Breast cancer screening in women with chronic kidney disease: the unrecognized effects of metastatic soft-tissue calcification [^114aMMys]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are known to develop metastatic soft-tissue calcification, secondary to hyperparathyroidism, in tissues including the breast. Such calcifications in women could pose a problem for interpretation of mammograms, since they are thought to mimic malignant lesions and interfere with differentiation of benign from malignant disease. Investigation of this issue is important to provide high-quality, accurate breast care to women with CKD or ESRD, but little evidence is so far available. In a systematic review of the literature on the types and patterns of breast calcifications, we found only three studies that examined metastatic soft-tissue calcifications of the breast. The studies did, however, confirm that women with CKD or ESRD have a higher frequency of breast calcification than women with normal kidney function. The two older studies reported that these breast calcifications are not associated with malignancy, but the later study reported a raised rate of suspicious breast calcification among women with ESRD receiving hemodialysis, leading to an increased biopsy referral rate. In this Review we discuss the strengths and limitations of the available data and whether mammography is recommended in women with CKD or ESRD.

### Radiological identification and analysis of soft tissue musculoskeletal calcifications [^113SkfHh]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

First step: Is it really a calcification?

The first step is to differentiate calcifications from ossifications or foreign bodies. One can achieve this goal by analysing its density, shape and pattern.

Density

Calcifications normally appear as mineralised densities with an attenuation coefficient higher than soft tissue but lower than bone (Fig. 2). With computed tomography (CT), there is a wide range of Hounsfield unit (HU) values for calcifications, but it is mostly between 100 and 400 HU, whereas bone reaches higher values (700 HU for trabecular bone and over 1500 HU for cortical bone; Fig. 3). Foreign body density varies depending on the nature of the material, but glass and silicone, among others, may have similar HU values to calcifications (Fig. 4).

Fig. 2

(b) Anteroposterior radiograph of the right shoulder in a different patient shows migration of the calcifications to the subdeltoid-subacromial bursa (arrows) during the resorptive phase

Ossification. Axial CT image of myositis ossificans in the infraspinatus muscle shows a cortical and trabecular mineralisation pattern with a zonal distribution (absence of mineralisation centrally due to fatty bone marrow)

Fig. 4
Foreign bodies. Lateral radiograph of the foot shows glass fragments (arrowhead) in the plantar soft tissues, with sharp edges and a rectangular shape

CT is more sensitive than radiography for the detection and analysis of calcifications and provides additional information regarding adjacent tissues such as neurovascular bundles, muscles, tendons and inflammatory reactions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows various signal intensities on conventional spin echo T1- or T2-weighted images and can frequently overlook calcifications, hence the importance to correlate MRI with conventional radiographs on every occasion. Misleading appearances can occur such as fluid signal (mimicking tear) or intense inflammatory reaction surrounding a calcification. Gradient echo sequences and, more recently, a three-dimensional fast low-angle gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequence (susceptibility-weighted imaging [SWI]) can depict calcifications more accurately. Based on phase images, the latter allows a better distinction between calcifications and other causes of susceptibility variations. Ultrasound is known to be more sensitive than radiography, however, when acoustic shadowing is present, it will prevent one from doing a complete assessment and being able to differentiate between ossification and calcification.

### Radiographic / MR imaging correlation of soft tissues [^114hduB5]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

MR imaging is nowadays regarded as the preferred imaging modality for evaluation of soft tissue lesions. As plain radiographs are often the first step in evaluation of musculoskeletal disorders, identification of subtle soft tissue signs may be helpful to select patients who need to be referred for subsequent MR imaging. Although not very sensitive, certain plain film findings, such as intralesional calcification or gas, may allow one to make to a more specific tissue diagnosis and may obviate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures and potential harmful treatment.

### Soft tissue tumor imaging in adults: European society of musculoskeletal radiology-guidelines 2023-overview, and primary local imaging: how and where? [^1179PG8i]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound represents the initial triage imaging modality for accessible and small suspected soft tissue tumors. Ultrasound is highly accurate for diagnosis of specific superficial lesions with typical ultrasound features.

MRI is the modality of choice for the characterization and local staging of soft tissue tumors in most cases. CT and MRI may have complementary roles, with the capability of CT to demonstrate intralesional mineralization patterns and potential bone involvement. A deep soft tissue mass incidentally found at CT usually requires MRI examination. Tissue-specific evaluation and multiplanar capability of high-resolution MRI permit better tumor localization and characterization of pelvic/retroperitoneal masses.

Suspicious or likely malignant tumors should undergo biopsy.

Conclusion

The updated ESSR guidelines for imaging of soft tissue tumors in adults aim to provide best practice expert consensus for standardized imaging and are intended to support radiologists in their decision-making. Standardization may improve the comparability of serial examinations in the individual patient and may also provide databases for multicenter studies and large data analysis for individualized strategies.

### Diagnostic and imaging approaches to chest wall lesions [^1173Lffg]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Chest wall lesions are relatively uncommon and may be challenging once they are encountered on images. Radiologists may detect these lesions incidentally at examinations performed for other indications, or they may be asked specifically to evaluate a suspicious lesion. While many chest wall lesions have characteristic imaging findings that can result in an accurate diagnosis with use of imaging alone, other entities are difficult to distinguish at imaging because there is significant overlap among them. The interpreting radiologist should be familiar with the imaging features of both "do not touch" benign entities (which can be confidently diagnosed with imaging only, with no need for biopsy or resection unless the patient is symptomatic) and lesions that cannot be confidently characterized and thus require further workup. CT and MRI are the main imaging modalities used to assess the chest wall, with each having different benefits and drawbacks. Chest wall lesions can be classified according to their predominant composition: fat, calcification and ossification, soft tissue, or fluid. The identification or predominance of signal intensities or attenuation for these findings, along with the patient age, clinical history, and lesion location, can help establish the appropriate differential diagnosis. In addition, imaging findings in other organs, such as the lungs or upper abdomen, can at times provide clues to the underlying diagnosis. The authors review different chest wall lesions classified on the basis of their composition and highlight the imaging findings that can assist the radiologist in narrowing the differential diagnosis and guiding management. © RSNA, 2022.

### Diagnostic work-up of lipomatous tumors: a decision-making analysis among European sarcoma centers [^112FhYWi]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

All members of the Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group of the EORTC were invited by the chair of the EORTC Sarcoma Group to participate in this study in March 2023 by email. No formal exclusion criteria existed for participation. These experts were asked to provide their institutional guidelines for the management of adipocytic soft-tissue tumors. The following short clinical vignette was provided to all experts as a question: "Which criteria are used at your institution for the decision of surveillance, biopsy, or primary resection of adipocytic soft-tissue tumors? Please describe your institutional standard operating procedures in the otherwise healthy patient".

Responses were received as text files or diagrams. The responses were transformed into decision trees, including diagnostic criteria, leading to three possible recommendations (follow-up, core needle biopsy, or resection). Some criteria were adjusted to represent uniformity: Criteria mentioned by only one center were not included in the decision tree analysis. Imaging criteria such as calcification, bone density, septation size, and signal intensity were classified as heterogeneous or homogeneous features of imaging. Superficial and deep refer to the location of the mass in relation to the investing fascia. Superficial tumors do not involve the investing fascia. Some centers provided an exact definition of size, some provided a range, and others were descriptive. Size was adjusted as a numeric variable with an arbitrarily determined upper limit of 15 cm during analysis. The decision trees were sent to the experts for validation. All trees were validated by April 2024. The decision trees were subsequently compared using the objective consensus methodology. This method allows evaluation and comparison of individual potential combinations of the diagnostic criteria and recommendations of individual centers.

The level of consent or dissent was then quantified among the individual recommendations and expressed as a percentage. Individual validated decision trees are given in Supplement 1.

Mediastinal and retroperitoneal lipomatous tumors were excluded from the present analysis.

Statistical analysis

The present data of the decision‐making analysis are presented as consensus percentages among participating centers. Thresholds for low, intermediate, and high consensuses were arbitrarily determined as consensuses of 50%, 75%, or 90% among participating centers. Consensuses smaller than 50% were considered dissent among participating centers.

Clinically asymptomatic presentation — pulmonary nodules and malignancy risk: Only a minority of lung cancers are diagnosed while the patient is asymptomatic, typically discovered with stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as solitary lesions on chest radiographs or chest CT obtained for unrelated reasons. By definition, a pulmonary nodule is a lesion ≤ 3 cm in diameter surrounded by normal lung tissue and not associated with other radiographic abnormalities; larger lesions are defined as masses. Size strongly influences malignancy probability, with the majority of asymptomatic pulmonary nodules > 20 mm being malignant. Additional risk indicators include upper lobe location, spiculated edges compared with smooth borders, and the absence of dense, benign calcification patterns, noting that densely calcified nodules typically reflect healed prior inflammatory processes while heterogeneous or eccentric calcification does not exclude malignancy.

Management of impalpable tumours

The therapeutic strategy for ductal carcinomas in situ is not covered in this document. The therapeutic management of impalpable tumours is often a stepwise process guided by the histological results of the previous intervention. The patient should be informed right from the start about the risks associated with repeated interventions.
First decisional step (Figure 3): This first step is diagnostic and potentially therapeutic and consists of a radiologically proven complete excision and histological analysis of the lesion (standard). In the absence of a palpable macroscopic lesion, a frozen section and primary axillary dissection should not be performed (recommendation, expert agreement). If microcalcifications are present, a mammogram should be performed 2 months after surgery (recommendation, expert agreement).
Second decisional step: This step depends on the status of the surgical margins and the extent of the microcalcification before and/or after surgery. ○ Microinvasive cancer (infiltrating component ≤ 2 mm): There is no specific data concerning the risk of progression of microinvasive cancers. The recommendations are the same as those proposed for invasive cancers (Figure 4). – Extensive microcalcifications at diagnosis (breast-conserving surgery inappropriate): Modified radical mastectomy followed by immediate breast reconstruction should be offered (standard). – Clear margins and no residual microcalcifications: The breast should be irradiated (standard). Modified radical mastectomy can be considered if the patient refuses conservative treatment (option). Axillary dissection or axillary radiotherapy may also be performed (option). In the absence of known risk factors for metastatic recurrence, adjuvant systemic treatment should not be given (recommendation, level of evidence: B). – Involved margins and/or residual microcalcifications: Mastectomy is the standard treatment (standard). Re-excision and breast radiotherapy, or axillary dissection and radiotherapy can be performed (option). If re-excision does not provide clear margins, mastectomy should be performed (standard). ○ Invasive cancer (Figure 5): – Extensive micro-calcifications at diagnosis: Modified radical mastectomy is indicated (standard). In the event of lymph node invasion, radiotherapy to the chest wall and lymph nodes (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) should be performed (standard). – Clear margins and/or absence of residual microcalcifications: The standard procedure is axillary dissection and breast radiotherapy (standard). If the patient presents with lymph node involvement, this should be followed by lymph node irradiation (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) (standard). It is also possible to irradiate the lymph nodes without axillary surgery (option). – Invaded margins and/or presence of residual microcalcifications: Modified radical mastectomy should be performed (standard). In the event of lymph node involvement, this should be followed by the chest wall and lymph nodes (internal mammary chain, infra- and supraclavicular) irradiation (standard). Re-excision combined with axillary dissection, followed by breast radiotherapy can be undertaken. Breast radiotherapy with a boost to the tumour bed can also be considered (option).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® soft tissue masses: 2022 update [^114K7tDY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Imaging should be performed in patients with a suspected soft tissue mass that cannot be clinically confirmed as benign. Imaging provides essential information necessary for diagnosis, local staging, and biopsy planning. Although the modalities available for imaging of musculoskeletal masses have undergone progressive technological advancements in recent years, their overall purpose in the setting of a soft tissue mass remains unchanged. This document identifies the most common clinical scenarios related to soft tissue masses and the most appropriate imaging for their assessment on the basis of the current literature. It also provides general guidance for those scenarios that are not specifically addressed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Failed knee replacement: incorrect indication? [^117Cspea]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 52-year-old woman sustained a direct soft tissue injury to the right knee following a fall onto the right knee. X-rays did not identify any bony injury. Physiotherapy decreased pain but instability persisted. MRI scans identified early degeneration. An orthopaedic opinion recommended total knee replacement. Following a total knee replacement, the pain has worsened and she remains functionally impaired 2 years following the surgical intervention. Knee replacements are commonly performed successful surgical interventions. The increased numbers of replacements might be due to the lowered threshold in recommending surgical intervention by health professionals. This may increase the failure rate. It also raises the question whether adequate non-operative measures were attempted?

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on nonpalpable mammographic findings (excluding calcifications) [^116j5rLf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Screening mammography can detect breast cancer before it becomes clinically apparent. However, the screening process identifies many false-positive findings for each cancer eventually confirmed. Additional tools are available to help differentiate spurious findings from real ones and to help determine when tissue sampling is required, when short-term follow-up will suffice, or whether the finding can be dismissed as benign. These tools include additional diagnostic mammographic views, breast ultrasound, breast MRI, and, when histologic evaluation is required, percutaneous biopsy. The imaging evaluation of a finding detected at screening mammography proceeds most efficiently, cost-effectively, and with minimization of radiation dose when approached in an evidence-based manner. The appropriateness of the above-referenced tools is presented here as they apply to a variety of findings often encountered on screening mammography; an algorithmic approach to workup of these potential scenarios is also included. The recommendations put forth represent a compilation of evidence-based data and expert opinion of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) Expert Panel on Breast Imaging.

### Calciphylaxis: part I. diagnosis and pathology [^112u3wTZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Calciphylaxis is an uncommon but devastating disorder characterized by vascular calcification and subsequent cutaneous tissue necrosis. This results in exquisitely painful and slow healing wounds that portend exceptionally high morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of this condition can be complicated because there are no conclusive serologic, radiographic or visual signs that this disease is manifesting. The differential of tissue necrosis is broad, and identifying calciphylaxis requires an adroit understanding of the risk factors and physical signs that should raise suspicion of this condition. Reviews on this subject are uncommon and lack directed commentary from disease experts on the best diagnostic approach for patients suffering from this disease. The goal of this article is to update practicing dermatologists on the current standard of care for calciphylaxis.

5.4.3 Dermatomyositis‐related calcinosis cutis may cause skin ulcers, and imaging procedures and endocrinological examination should be performed for detailed examination of the etiology

Cutaneous or soft tissue calcinosis is often observed in patients with dermatomyositis. In particular, its incidence is approximately 40% in patients with childhood dermatomyositis. Although the incidence is low in patients with SLE, ectopic calcinosis is sometimes observed. Calcinosis may occur in all sites: skin/soft tissue, vertebral, and costal regions. In patients with childhood dermatomyositis, the incidence of muscular/subcutaneous calcinosis is higher than in adults.
In the classification of calcinosis cutis, calcinosis in patients with dermatomyositis or SLE corresponds to dystrophic calcification. The mechanism of tissue calcinosis remains to be clarified, but etiological factors include tissue/vascular damage, ischemia, and age‐related tissue changes. In addition, tissue calcinosis may develop when there is a decrease in calcification‐inhibiting factors or when a substance that promotes calcification as a crystal nucleus appears. Furthermore, it was reported that the levels of calcium‐binding amino acids and γ‐carboxyglutamic acid in the patient tissue with calcinosis were increased, and that there was an increase in the urinary γ‐carboxyglutamic acid level.
To differentiate the above pathogeneses involved in cutaneous/soft tissue calcinosis, it is necessary to measure blood calcium/phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. However, recent studies have shown that acroosteolysis and digital ulcers in patients with SSc were positively correlated with subcutaneous calcinosis. Furthermore, another study performed a correlation between calcinosis and PTHCaution is needed for interpreting PTH levels.
Blane et al.classified childhood dermatomyositis–related calcinosis into four types based on x‐ray findings: I: deep linear calcinosis, II: deep mass‐like calcinosis, III: subcutaneous superficial‐layer mass‐like calcinosis, and IV: subcutaneous net‐like lacy calcinosis.
Calcinosis is incidentally detected on x‐ray findings in many cases. When palpation reveals subcutaneous induration, plain x‐ray or computed tomography for confirming its properties is useful.

### Radiological identification and analysis of soft tissue musculoskeletal calcifications [^114S6JLv]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Shape and patterns

The classic hydroxyapatite calcification has an amorphous and cloudlike appearance with a well-defined oval contour (Fig. 2). It can appear multiloculated and even show fluid-fluid levels. Linear calcifications can be related to calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition. Punctate calcifications with arcs and rings will be seen in cartilage-forming tumours and are referred to as cartilaginous matrix mineralisation (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5
Enchondroma. Anteroposterior radiograph of the left knee shows a typical chondroid matrix mineralisation with arcs and rings in the tibia (arrowheads)

On the other hand, radiographs of ossifications will show a bone organisation with a distinct cortical and/or trabecular bone pattern (Fig. 3). Fatty bone marrow within trabecular spaces can be identified on CT and MRI (Fig. 3), narrowing greatly the differential diagnosis (Table 1). However, immature ossifications are not so well organised and may be more difficult to diagnose.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of calcifications and ossifications according to their location

The most frequent aetiologies are in bold characters. CPPD, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate; CRF, chronic renal failure; DISH, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis; HADD, Hydroxyapatite deposition disease; MOC, myositis ossificans circumscripta; RDO, rapidly destructive osteoarthritis; SSc, progressive systemic sclerosis

Foreign bodies will often show a distinctive shape such as sharp and/or geometric borders helping identifying their nature (Fig. 4). Other patterns can be recognised — such as round calcifications with radiolucent centre in venous phleboliths; parallel lines in calcifications of arterial origin; or "rice-grain" calcification in parasitic infection — and will be discussed later.

### Put your back into it: pathologic conditions of the spine at chest CT [^112qaDvv]. Radiographics (2011). Low credibility.

It is common to encounter pathologic processes of the lower cervical, thoracic, or upper lumbar spine in the course of routine computed tomography (CT) of the chest. Although magnetic resonance (MR) is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating known spinal disease, evaluation of the spine is an integral part of interpreting a chest CT study. Spinal diseases often have a characteristic CT appearance that allows the radiologist to make the diagnosis or provide a structured differential diagnosis. Pathologic conditions of the spine that can be identified at chest CT are categorized into benign or incidental findings, congenital anomalies, traumatic injuries, infectious spondylitis, primary or secondary neoplastic involvement, and associations with systemic disease. CT also provides information about bone mineralization and lesion calcification that complements the superior soft-tissue imaging capability of MR. In addition, chest CT data may be reformatted to create volumetric or multiplanar images of the spine to facilitate management decisions about spinal stabilization in symptomatic patients.

Although rare, extraosseous chondromas show a mass effect with typical cartilaginous calcifications in approximately half of cases. Most (82%) involve the hands and feet. Nerve sheath tumours and lipoma are other benign tumours in which calcifications and/or ossifications may rarely occur (Fig. 24).

Schwannoma. (a) axial CT image of the sacrum shows calcifications in a lesion and (b) sagittal T2-weighted MRI image of the sacrum (arrows) and axial fat-saturated T1-weighted MRI image of the sacrum following gadolinium enhancement show the specific signal inside the schwannoma (arrowheads)

Synovial sarcoma is the fourth most frequent soft tissue sarcoma, and one-third will exhibit calcifications on radiograph (Fig. 25). In a young adult, the presence of a periarticular mass of the lower extremity showing faint calcifications should raise suspicion for this diagnosis. Extraosseous chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, including parosteal osteosarcoma, and metastasis (Fig. 26) can also show calcifications, but are extremely rare. Cross-sectional studies will help in delineating the mass to plan for biopsy and treatment. One helpful clue in differentiating extraosseous osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma from heterotopic ossification (HO) is that calcification and/or ossification will be more central in sarcoma as opposed to peripheral in HO (Fig. 3).

Synovial sarcoma. (a) Frog-leg radiograph, (b) axial CT image and (c) axial T1-weighted image of the left thigh show faint calcifications (arrow in a, b and c) that are located inside a tumour which is better seen on the CT and MRI assessment (arrowhead in a, b and c). Synovial sarcoma was found at pathology

Remember that tumour necrosis, following either chemotherapy or radiation therapy, may show dystrophic calcifications inside a soft tissue tumour.

Injection site fat necrosis and granulomas are common non-neoplastic tumour-like lesions that tend to calcify and are typically found in expected injection sites, most frequently in the gluteus maximus muscle. Lymph nodes can also show calcifications due to calcifying metastasis (Fig. 26), from adenocarcinoma or medullary carcinoma for example, or granulomatous diseases, caused by sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, for example.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSoft-tissue Masses [^117KKq3s]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Imaging is an integral component of the evaluation of patients with a suspected soft-tissue mass. Imaging can not only confirm the presence of a mass but can provide essential information necessary for diagnosis, local staging, and biopsy planning. Although the objectives of the evaluation have not changed, the choices available for imaging of musculoskeletal masses have evolved dramatically in recent years. The purpose of this document is to identify the most common clinical scenarios and the most appropriate imaging for their assessment on the basis of the current literature and to provide general guidance for those scenarios that are not specifically addressed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Is this your stone? Distinguishing phleboliths and nephroliths on imaging in the emergency department setting [^116Cc3Ki]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureteral stones are a common diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) setting, often found with computed tomography (CT). The high frequency of phleboliths can confound ureteral stone diagnosis on CT imaging.

Objective

This article provides a narrative review of the etiological, epidemiological, and radiological distinctions between ureteral stones and phleboliths for appropriate ED diagnosis and management.

Discussion

Multiple studies demonstrate phleboliths, benign calcified thrombi largely in pelvic vasculature, are found at frequencies equal to or greater than those of ureteral stones on CT imaging. The calcified foundation of phleboliths and most ureteral stones, as well as the close proximity of the distal ureters to pelvic vasculature, can cause consternation in the proper diagnosis of ureteral stones in the patient with abdominal pain. Radiological findings of circumferential ureteral soft tissue edema ("rim sign") and an irregular tapering soft tissue mass ("comet tail sign") can suggest a ureteral and phlebolith etiology, respectively. These signs demonstrate high specificity but low sensitivity, and clinicians must use history, examination, and secondary signs on imaging to differentiate ureteral stones from phleboliths.

Conclusions

Phleboliths are a common finding on CT imaging. Radiological findings of rim sign and comet tail sign may help to differentiate phleboliths and ureteral stones; however, their low sensitivity and inconsistent presentation should prompt greater reliance on other signs of ureteral obstruction to aid in diagnosis of undifferentiated pelvic calcifications.

### Basic calcium phosphate crystal-associated musculoskeletal syndromes: an update [^111eHjSm]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are associated with two important musculoskeletal syndromes. Deposition of BCP crystals in tendons, bursae, and other soft tissues around joints causes calcific periarthritis, whereas intra-articular BCP crystals contribute to osteoarthritis and cause the highly destructive arthritis known as Milwaukee Shoulder Syndrome. The epidemiology and natural history of these syndromes are poorly understood, and because the pathogenesis remains unclear, few targeted therapies are available. I will review new developments in this field.

Recent Findings

I will discuss a case collection of calcific periarthritis of the hip, and evidence-based management strategies for shoulder calcific periarthritis that might be applied to calcific periarthritis at other locations. I will summarize several recent articles addressing mechanisms of crystal formation and identifying pathways through which BCP crystals produce tissue damage and explore some newly identified risk factors for pathologic mineralization.

Summary

We are making slow, but steady progress in understanding the clinical presentation of calcific periarthritis in sites other than the shoulder. A growing appreciation of the mechanisms through which BCP crystals mediate tissue damage should lead to the development of novel management strategies for these common musculoskeletal syndromes.

### Current practices in monitoring children and adults with X-linked hypophosphatemia: a global survey of expert experience [^116v9Ptk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

On review of the published guidelines, a strong suggestion to optimize the follow-up care of children with XLH is to assemble a multidisciplinary team of providers, preferably led by a metabolic bone disease expert, to manage those children with follow-up intervals individualized per patient. Where our panel suggests 3- to 6-month clinic visits, the published guidelines recommend visits as frequent as every 3 months during periods of rapid growth (infancy, puberty) or after initiation of therapy and subsequently tailoring the visits depending on the therapy and severity of the disease. The purpose of follow-up visits is not only the monitoring of patient symptoms and response to therapy but also the assessment for potential treatment-related complications including hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis with possible progression to chronic kidney disease, hypertension, as well as secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, close monitoring is critical to minimize these complications.

Initial assessment in adults with XLH

The initial assessment of adults with XLH with respect to history taking and biochemical tests are similar to that of children. A musculoskeletal clinical examination for bone tenderness and range of motion is commonly done by the IWG, a recommendation noted in the Belgian guidelines in both adults and children. Up to 80% of adult patients with XLH develop joint damage with subsequent joint stiffness in addition to muscle weakness, making a musculoskeletal evaluation prudent.

Baseline BMD measurement is suggested in the adult group as part of the initial visit by 80% of respondents, despite lack of data on fracture risk prediction. Indeed, some guidelines recommend against obtaining a BMD in XLH, due to the sclerosing nature of the disease, the expected false increase in BMD due to the size artefact and mineralization of spinal ligaments, and its inability to differentiate osteoporosis from osteomalacia. However, BMD assessment with DXA may still be of value, especially in postmenopausal women who have superimposed osteoporosis. Baseline renal ultrasound and X-rays of the lower extremity, while recommended in both European and Belgian guidelines, are only performed by 78% and 68% of respondents, respectively, and thus did not achieve the consensus threshold.

### Calcium acetate capsules 667 mg (calcium acetate) [^114pGPwM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS

Capsule: 667 mg calcium acetate per capsule.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Hypercalcemia

Patients with end stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia when treated with calcium, including calcium acetate. Avoid the use of calcium supplements, including calcium-based nonprescription antacids, concurrently with calcium acetate.

An overdose of calcium acetate may lead to progressive hypercalcemia, which may require emergency measures. Therefore, early in the treatment phase during the dosage adjustment period, monitor serum calcium levels twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, reduce the calcium acetate dosage, or discontinue the treatment, depending on the severity of hypercalcemia.

More severe hypercalcemia (Ca > 12 mg/dL) is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor and coma. Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing calcium acetate therapy.

Mild hypercalcemia (10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL) may be asymptomatic or manifest as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Mild hypercalcemia is usually controlled by reducing the calcium acetate dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy. Decreasing or discontinuing Vitamin D therapy is recommended as well.

Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Radiographic evaluation of suspected anatomical regions may be helpful in early detection of soft tissue calcification. The long-term effect of calcium acetate on the progression of vascular or soft tissue calcification has not been determined.

Hypercalcemia (> 11 mg/dL) was reported in 16% of patients in a 3-month study of solid dose formulation of calcium acetate; all cases resolved upon lowering the dose or discontinuing treatment.

Maintain the serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca × P) product below 55 mg²/dL².

5.2 Concomitant Use with Medications

Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity.

### UK guidelines for the management of bone sarcomas [^115uYD6g]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Key recommendations

The most common symptoms of PMBT are a mass or pain. Bone pain at night is a 'red flag' symptom requiring investigation.
Plain X-ray is the first investigation of choice.
Radiological features including bone destruction, new bone formation, periosteal swelling and/or soft tissue swelling require further investigation.
A normal X-ray does not exclude PMBT, and an urgent MRI may be required.
Networks should ensure GPs and hospital doctors are aware of urgent referral criteria and diagnostic pathways for PMBT.
All provisional histological and/or radiological diagnoses of PMBT should be reviewed by a specialist sarcoma pathologist and/or radiologist, within a bone sarcoma MDT.

Other form of calcinosis (non-idiopathic)

The most frequent cause of non-idiopathic calcinosis is metabolic (or metastatic) calcifications from chronic renal failure with haemodialysis and renal osteodystrophy (Fig. 18). The periarticular calcified masses are indistinguishable from idiopathic tumoural calcinosis except for bone erosion and destruction that might be seen in this case. It can be associated with vascular calcifications, chondrocalcinosis, bone resorption, osteopenia or osteosclerosis, and tendon pathologies. Other causes of non-idiopathic calcinosis include primary hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, milk-alkali syndrome and hypervitaminosis D. Phosphate serum level will be elevated in any of those settings, with an increase in the phosphocalcic product.

Fig. 18
Renal insufficiency with tumoural calcinosis. (a) Anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis and (b) axial CT image of the left hip show tumoural calcinosis (arrow) around the left hip with a multiloculated appearance in a clinical context of chronic renal failure. Note fluid-fluid level with denser material layering more posteriorly (arrowhead in b). I: ischium, T: greater trochanter

The second most frequent cause of non-idiopathic calcinosis is collagen-vascular disease. Calcinosis circumscripta is more often seen with progressive systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). It mainly involves the subcutaneous tissues and can cause painful inflammatory dermal papule that can ulcerate and discharge chalky material. The association of acro-osteolysis and skin atrophy with calcinosis is most specific for systemic sclerosis (Fig. 19). Calcinosis universalis is a diffuse calcium deposition in muscles, fascial planes and subcutaneous tissues seen characteristically with dermatomyositis and polymyositis with sheet-like muscle involvement (Fig. 20). Mixed connective tissue disease and, infrequently, lupus erythematosus may show calcinosis as well, although it is less specific.

### UK guidelines for the management of soft tissue sarcomas [^1125BGNE]. British Journal of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

In certain cases, this standard follow-up can be extended or adapted according to individual risk or local practice. If a patient were deemed unfit either for pulmonary metastasectomy or systemic treatment, then diagnosing metastases when the patient is asymptomatic has little purpose, for example, the chest X-ray could be dispensed with and referral back to primary care might be most appropriate.

As per the ESMO guidelines, it is recommended that patients with intermediate/high grade tumours, which most commonly relapse within 2–3 years, should be followed every 3–4 months in the first 2–3 years, then twice a year up to the fifth year, and once a year thereafter for a minimum of 8 to 10 years. It is recommended that patients with low-grade tumours should be followed up every 6 months for 5 years, then annually thereafter, for at least 10 years. In low-grade sarcoma where the risk of local recurrence is the main reason for follow-up, suitably educated patients, with tumours resected from easily examined regions can be considered for discharge from formal follow-up, with an option to self-refer to the service if any abnormality is identified (Patient-initiated follow-up, PIFU). Also, there is a subgroup of patients with good prognosis sarcomas as defined by size and grade in whom the risk of any relapse after five years is extremely remote and shortened follow-up to 5 years should be considered in these patients. Many centres no longer follow-up atypical lipomatous tumours unless there are concerning features such as large size or more abnormal histological appearance.

A further value of follow-up is to monitor for adverse, late effects of treatment. Patients who have received radiotherapy may be at risk of second malignancies or accelerated atherosclerosis in the radiotherapy field. Following chemotherapy there may be deterioration of renal or cardiac function, and reduced fertility. In women, early menopause may require interventions for issues such as bone health. Investigations for late effects of treatment should be considered, such as full blood count, renal profile, hormone profile, and echocardiography. Patients treated in childhood for paediatric sarcomas may be handed on to adult services, and it is important that suitable follow-up continues. Physical disability is a major feature of the survivorship experience of patients treated for soft tissue sarcoma, and follow-up should support the patient in trying to minimise the impact of their treatment. Psychological problems associated with relapse risk, altered body image, or loss of function are also common.

### Calciphylaxis [^116Dxjm1]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is a condition with a generally poor prognosis about which relatively little is known. Possible improvement in prognosis is noted if the diagnosis can be made early to avoid progression of soft tissue lesions and resulting complications. The mainstays of therapy are wound care and therapy aimed at controlling infection and the progression of disease. Parathyroidectomy seems to benefit some patients, but controversy remains as to the extent of overall patient benefit and scenarios for its appropriate use.

Infections

Dystrophic calcifications can occur in almost any chronic infectious disease. Previously, psoas calcifications would have strongly suggested presence of spinal tuberculosis with secondary chronic iliopsoas pyomyositis. Nowadays, iliopsoas pyomyositis will be caused mostly by urinary tract or gastrointestinal infections and will not show calcifications. Some typical pattern can suggest a specific diagnosis, such as small "cigar-shaped" intramuscular and subcutaneous calcifications in cysticercosis (Fig. 23), trichinosis, dracunculiasis, and, more rarely, external ear chondral calcifications in syphilis, or nerve calcification in leprosy.

Vascular calcifications and lesions

Arterial calcification can be either dystrophic or metabolic and will show a "double-tracked" appearance (Fig. 21). In atherosclerosis, dystrophic calcifications will involve the intima and show a more "chunky" and irregular appearance. On the contrary, metabolic calcifications, such as those seen in chronic renal failure, are more often thin and delicate and found in the media.

Fig. 21
Vascular calcifications. (a) Oblique radiograph of the femur shows atherosclerotic vascular calcifications (arrowheads) and (b) lateral radiograph of the ankle shows metabolic vascular calcifications (arrows)

Venous calcifications secondary to thrombosis are represented classically by phleboliths, with a focal well-delineated calcification with a denser rim and a central lucency (Fig. 22). It is commonly seen in the pelvis and lower extremities.

Fig. 22
Phleboliths. Anteroposterior radiograph of the elbow shows phleboliths in the soft tissues with the characteristic central lucency (arrowhead) in a patient with a venous malformation of the upper extremity. Note multifocal soft tissue masse effect that corresponds to the diffuse venous malformation (arrows)

Vascular malformations and tumours are now classified following the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification. A venous malformation will demonstrate a soft-tissue mass with occasional phleboliths and, less frequently, with adjacent skeletal anomalies. It can increase in size with Valsalva manoeuvre and be flattened with direct pressure. It usually grows in proportion with the patient or with hormonal stimulation (puberty, pregnancy), but does not regress. Further investigation should include a Doppler US assessment to differentiate from other vascular anomalies, showing low venous flow or absence of flow. CT can demonstrate better a phlebolith as well as possible fatty soft tissue components. Additionally, MRI may show fluid-filled cavities and will help determine the extension of the disease in the adjacent tissues.

### Dialysis bone disease [^116AcAv7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

The bone disease associated with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) and treatment are complex and multifactorial, and has changed in both clinical and imaging features over the past three decades. Whereas previously features of vitamin D deficiency (rickets/osteomalacia) and intense, and prolonged, secondary hyperparathyroidism (bone resorption, osteosclerosis, metastatic calcification) predominated, these features are now rarely evident radiologically. This has occurred through the better understanding of vitamin D metabolism and improvements in therapeutic management. However, metastatic calcification in soft tissues and 'adynamic" bone continue to be problematic. New complications have developed as a consequence of treatment (dialysis and transplantation), including amyloid deposition, noninfective sponyloarthropathy, osteonecrosis, and osteopenia/osteoporosis). Radiographs remain the most widely used imaging technique in examining for skeletal disease in patients with ESRD on maintenance dialysis. Occasionally, more sophisticated imaging (CT, MRI, nuclear medicine scanning) are helpful (parathyroid tumor localization, differentiation between infection and amyloid deposition). Developments in quantitative methods to assess bone density enable the effects of ESRD and treatment to be studied and monitored. Technical developments in computed tomography (rapid, multislice scanning) allow quantitation and monitoring of metastatic cardiac calcification in patients on hemodialysis, which has relevance to prognosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging is the mainstay of diagnostic imaging for soft tissue masses, but plain film, ultrasound, and computed tomography all have roles. A subset of lesions has specific imaging features that enable a confident radiological diagnosis with appropriate clinical correlation. Many soft tissue masses have nonspecific appearances and should be considered for biopsy in a specialist center. When a biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis, careful multidisciplinary planning is essential to avoid contamination of unaffected tissue, leading to recurrence and unnecessary amputations. This article discusses radiological diagnosis, biopsy, and management of the soft tissue mass.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in adults-(part I) assessment and medical management: position statement of the Endocrine Society of Australia, the Australian&New Zealand endocrine surgeons, and the Australian&New Zealand bone and mineral society [^113RT9pz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To formulate clinical consensus recommendations on the presentation, assessment, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in adults.

Methods

Representatives from relevant Australian and New Zealand Societies used a systematic approach for adaptation of guidelines (ADAPTE) to derive an evidence-informed position statement addressing nine key questions.

Results

PHPT is a biochemical diagnosis. Serum calcium should be measured in patients with suggestive symptoms, reduced bone mineral density or minimal trauma fractures, and in those with renal stones. Other indications are detailed in the manuscript. In patients with hypercalcaemia, intact parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, phosphate, and renal function should be measured. In established PHPT, assessment of bone mineral density, vertebral fractures, urinary tract calculi/nephrocalcinosis and quantification of urinary calcium excretion is warranted. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment and is warranted for all symptomatic patients and should be considered for asymptomatic patients without contraindications to surgery and with > 10 years life expectancy. In patients who do not undergo surgery, we recommend annual evaluation for disease progression. Where the diagnosis is not clear or the risk-benefit ratio is not obvious, multidisciplinary discussion and formulation of a consensus management plan is appropriate. Genetic testing for familial hyperparathyroidism is recommended in selected patients.

Conclusions

These clinical consensus recommendations were developed to provide clinicians with contemporary guidance on the assessment and management of PHPT in adults. It is anticipated that improved health outcomes for individuals and the population will be achieved at a decreased cost to the community.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^114eZsd5]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) is the most common cause of inherited phosphate wasting and is associated with severe complications such as rickets, lower limb deformities, pain, poor mineralization of the teeth and disproportionate short stature in children as well as hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, enthesopathies, osteoarthritis and pseudofractures in adults. The characteristics and severity of XLH vary between patients. Because of its rarity, the diagnosis and specific treatment of XLH are frequently delayed, which has a detrimental effect on patient outcomes. In this Evidence-Based Guideline, we recommend that the diagnosis of XLH is based on signs of rickets and/or osteomalacia in association with hypophosphataemia and renal phosphate wasting in the absence of vitamin D or calcium deficiency. Whenever possible, the diagnosis should be confirmed by molecular genetic analysis or measurement of levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) before treatment. Owing to the multisystemic nature of the disease, patients should be seen regularly by multidisciplinary teams organized by a metabolic bone disease expert. In this article, we summarize the current evidence and provide recommendations on features of the disease, including new treatment modalities, to improve knowledge and provide guidance for diagnosis and multidisciplinary care.

### Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos [^116tUGUg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Asbestos-related pleural plaques are bilateral, but not symmetric, lesions of the parietal pleura that are found following the ribs on the lower posterior thoracic wall and over the central tendons of the diaphragm, are raised and sharply circumscribed with a smooth or rounded knobby surface, range in color from white to pale yellow, and generally spare the costophrenic angles and apices of the thoracic cavity; smoking plays no role in the prevalence of pleural plaques. Microscopically, plaques consist of mature collagen fibers in an open basket-weave pattern covered by flattened or cuboidal mesothelial cells, are relatively avascular and acellular with minimal inflammation, are sharply demarcated from subpleural tissues with central calcification common, and asbestos bodies are not seen in or adjacent to the lesions. Isolated plaques may be associated with tuberculosis, trauma, and hemothorax, but multiple lesions with classic appearances are almost invariably associated with asbestos exposure. For imaging, the conventional chest film is a sensitive and appropriate method; in the posteroanterior (PA) radiograph plaques are best seen in profile on the midlateral chest walls and on the diaphragm or face on and show serrated borders. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is not a practical screening method because of section separation, high radiation exposure, and limited access, but is useful to identify questionable abnormalities and to resolve questions about structures that resemble plaques. Typical plaques have sharp, often foliated, borders when seen face on with a raised straight surface and clear, cut-off edges, and show irregular margins when seen in profile on the chest wall or diaphragm; apparent pleural thickening with gradually tapering or indistinct edges is often due to subpleural fat or superimposed soft tissue, with fat pads below the parietal pleura typically occurring in the midthoracic wall.

Metastatic tumor

Calcification or ossification commonly occurs with metastatic osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. In addition, metastatic carcinomas of the colon (Fig. 5), ovary, breast, and thyroid (Supplementary Fig. S 5), and metastatic synovial sarcoma and giant cell tumors of the bone, may calcify. Several mechanisms are responsible for calcification: first, bone formation in osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma; second, dystrophic calcification in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, giant cell tumor of the bone, synovial sarcoma, or treated metastatic tumor; and third, mucoid calcification in mucinous adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract and breast. Calcification may persist following successful chemotherapy despite resolution of the tumor.

Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma

EHE is a rare tumor of vascular origin, which presents an intermediate clinical course between hemangioma and angiosarcoma. Multiple small nodular pattern (< 15 mm in diameter) and multiple large nodular pattern (≥ 15 mm in diameter) were observed in 71.4% and 22.9% of patients, respectively. However, 5.7% of EHE showed a solitary lesion and may mimic lung cancer. EHE was located predominantly subpleurally with a perivascular location, and 48% of the nodules/masses showed punctate calcification. Extra-pulmonary EHE lesion were observed in 62.9% of cases, with most lesions occurring in the liver. Even with multiple nodules, the patient is expected to have a good prognosis and may not need urgent treatment. Furthermore, spontaneous regression may also occur.

### Calcium acetate (eliphos) [^113SdRfC]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Treat mild hypercalcemia by reducing or interrupting ELIPHOS and Vitamin D. Severe hypercalcemia may require hemodialysis and discontinuation of ELIPHOS. (5.1)
Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity. (5.2)

5.1 Hypercalcemia

Patients with end stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia when treated with calcium, including calcium acetate (ELIPHOS®). Avoid the use of calcium supplements, including calcium-based nonprescription antacids, concurrently with ELIPHOS®.

An overdose of ELIPHOS®may lead to progressive hypercalcemia, which may require emergency measures. Therefore, early in the treatment phase during the dosage adjustment period, monitor serum calcium levels twice weekly. Should hypercalcemia develop, reduce the ELIPHOS®dosage, or discontinue the treatment, depending on the severity of hypercalcemia.

More severe hypercalcemia (Ca > 12 mg/dL) is associated with confusion, delirium, stupor and coma. Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing ELIPHOS®therapy.

Mild hypercalcemia (10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL) may be asymptomatic or manifest as constipation, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Mild hypercalcemia is usually controlled by reducing the ELIPHOS®dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy. Decreasing or discontinuing Vitamin D therapy is recommended as well.

Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Radiographic evaluation of suspected anatomical regions may be helpful in early detection of soft tissue calcification. The long term effect of ELIPHOS®on the progression of vascular or soft tissue calcification has not been determined.

Hypercalcemia (> 11 mg/dL) was reported in 16% of patients in a 3-month study of solid dose formulation of calcium acetate; all cases resolved upon lowering the dose or discontinuing treatment.

Maintain the serum calcium-phosphorus (Ca × P) product below 55 mg²/dL².

5.2 Concomitant Use with Medications

Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity.

### Is rituximab an effective treatment of refractory calcinosis? [^111ic183]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Calcinosis, the deposition of calcified material in soft tissues, is frequently seen in systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis. Treatment options are limited, with disappointing results. Some recent case reports suggest that rituximab may be an attractive therapeutic option. In case 1, a 54-year-old woman who presented with rheumatoid arthritis in association with scleromyositis was treated with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis. Despite this, she developed multiple progressive calcinosis, necessitating extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to limit calcinosis extension and pain. In case 2, a 38-year-old man, previously treated for an anti-Pm/Scl-positive polymyositis/scleroderma overlap syndrome, presented with multiple tumoural periarticular calcinosis, which progressed despite bisphosphonates, sodium thiosulfate and thalidomide. We decided to start rituximab. Progression of calcinosis was still evident 6 and 12months after anti-CD20 treatment. Many treatments have been tried to treat calcinosis without demonstrated effectiveness. Presently, rituximab cannot be recommended for this indication in the absence of successful controlled trials.

### Neuroblastoma, version 2.2024, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117BJ2FA]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Neuroblastoma — CT/MRI roles state that both MRI and CT are routinely used for imaging of soft-tissue disease, depending on availability and institutional expertise. CT is rapidly performed and widely available, with superior detection of calcifications, allows rapid acquisition without motion artifacts, and reduces the need for sedation. MRI is superior for evaluating spinal involvement and does not involve use of ionizing radiation. Both CT and MRI may be preferred at the initial evaluation, especially if the tumor is paraspinal, and both modalities demonstrate typical features of primary tumors and metastasis to the liver, lymph nodes, bone, and skin.

FIGURE 1.
Photograph of 2 masses on mid-axillary/posterior chest wall at time of initial presentation.

Ultrasound revealed several heterogeneous masses on the posterior aspect of the left 9th rib near the mid-axillary line. CT with contrast showed extensive bone remodeling of the left 9th rib, with osseous sclerosis, hyperostosis and cortical defects. It also revealed a 4.3 × 2.4 × 4.0 cm heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue mass involving the left latissimus dorsi muscle and subcutaneous tissues, extending into the extra-pleural space near the left costophrenic angle and surrounding the rib abnormality, with no lymphadenopathy (Fig. 2). The patient was referred to an oncologist for further evaluation.

### International myeloma working group consensus statement and guidelines regarding the current role of imaging techniques in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma [^116E5hQp]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

Several imaging technologies are used for the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Conventional radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nuclear medicine imaging are all used in an attempt to better clarify the extent of bone disease and soft tissue disease in MM. This review summarizes all available data in the literature and provides recommendations for the use of each of the technologies. Conventional radiography still remains the 'gold standard' of the staging procedure of newly diagnosed and relapsed myeloma patients. MRI gives information complementary to skeletal survey and is recommended in MM patients with normal conventional radiography and in all patients with an apparently solitary plasmacytoma of bone. Urgent MRI or CT (if MRI is not available) is the diagnostic procedure of choice to assess suspected cord compression. Bone scintigraphy has no place in the routine staging of myeloma, whereas sequential dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans are not recommended. Positron emission tomography/CT or MIBI imaging are also not recommended for routine use in the management of myeloma patients, although both techniques may be useful in selected cases that warrant clarification of previous imaging findings, but such an approach should ideally be made within the context of a clinical trial.

Adult neck mass imaging — purpose and ancillary findings explains that the purpose of this statement is to emphasize the importance of obtaining neck imaging in those patients who are deemed to be at increased risk of malignancy and to provide guidance in study selection, and that contrast-enhanced CT or MRI examinations obtained in patients with a neck mass of uncertain etiology will help localize and characterize the mass, assess for additional nonpalpable masses, and screen visualized organs (most notably the upper aerodigestive tract) that are potential sites of primary malignancy. Furthermore, this imaging may provide useful ancillary information, such as evidence of dental disease, granulomas of the lung apices, and salivary calculi that could suggest alternative diagnoses.

### Soft tissue sarcoma, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115fNG95]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) stage-based surveillance — follow-up and imaging schedules: Stage I tumors are routinely followed with history and physical (H&P) every 3 to 6 months for 2 to 3 years and then annually. Chest imaging is recommended every 6 to 12 months by computed tomography (CT) (preferred) or x-ray, and postoperative baseline and periodic imaging of the primary tumor site is recommended based on estimated risk of locoregional recurrence; MRI with and without contrast and/or CT with contrast is recommended, ultrasound can be considered for smaller, superficial lesions by an experienced ultrasonographer, and imaging may not be required when the area is easily followed by physical examination. For stage II/III and synchronous stage IV disease, postoperative re-imaging using MRI with and without contrast (preferred) or CT with contrast should be used to assess the primary site and rule out metastatic disease; baseline and periodic primary site imaging are recommended with ultrasound considered for small, superficial lesions; and H&P and imaging of the chest and other known sites should be performed every 2 to 6 months for 2 to 3 years, then every 6 months for the next 2 years, and then annually.

### Hypercalcemia and soft tissue calcification owing to sarcoidosis: the sunlight-cola connection [^114Pqur9]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia occurs in sarcoidosis because of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production by pulmonary alveolar macrophages. Long-standing hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria may cause such complications as nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and soft tissue calcification, which can be at least partially reversible with treatment. Here we present a 43-year-old African-American man with diffuse soft tissue calcifications and acute kidney injury owing to sarcoidosis-induced hypercalcemia, probably exacerbated by sun exposure and phosphorus intake in the form of dietary cola drinks. Soft tissue calcifications resolved and kidney function improved significantly with hydration and glucocorticoid therapy. We discuss the pathophysiology of the hypercalcemia of sarcoidosis and current treatment options.

### American Society of Echocardiography clinical recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with pericardial disease: endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^112Te8nd]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) for constrictive pericarditis — CT is a highly accurate method for evaluating pericardial thickness; the normal pericardium is identified as a 1 to 2 mm curvilinear soft‑tissue line, whereas in CP the parietal pericardium is usually 4 to 10 mm thick. Increased thickness detected by CT is useful for distinguishing CP from restrictive cardiomyopathy, yet 28% of 143 surgically confirmed cases had normal thickness on CT and 18% had normal thickness on histopathology. CT is also the best technique to detect pericardial calcification, which can be found anywhere but primarily where pericardial fat is abundant, and About 50% of constriction cases show some degree of calcification.

Osteosarcoma — diagnostic workup and imaging: Initial workup should include imaging of the primary site (contrast-enhanced MRI with or without CT), chest imaging including chest CT, and head-to-toe FDG-PET/CT and/or bone scan. More detailed imaging (MRI with and without contrast or CT) of skeletal metastatic sites to identify abnormalities identified on primary imaging is required for suspected metastatic disease. Plain x-rays show cortical destruction and irregular reactive bone formation; bone scan may be useful to identify additional synchronous lesions; MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast, may be essential for operative planning, and is the best imaging modality to define extent within bone and soft tissues, detect "skip" metastases, and evaluate anatomic relationships.

### Intense soft tissue calcification of the head and neck following tracheostomy [^111ZagKi]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Dystrophic calcification is the accumulation of calcium salts, especially calcium phosphate, which can occur anywhere in the body. Unlike other heterotopic calcifications, it occurs in damaged tissue when there is no calcium imbalance. The most common sites are the heart muscle and valve and it is rarely seen in the head and neck region. It can appear by any cause of soft tissue degeneration such as trauma, infection, inflammation, and neoplasia. It is not symptomatic unless a dystrophic calcification mass is present and is usually detected incidentally. Determination of the etiology plays an important role in the planning of the treatment so that the patient's history, laboratory findings, and imaging methods are very important.

### Limb salvage for musculoskeletal tumors in the austere environment: review of the literature with illustrative cases regarding considerations and pitfalls [^112Fkdh8]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis: Imaging

The value of radiographs along with a history and physical to obtain a diagnosis should not be underestimated. Although a definitive diagnosis may not be possible, radiographs can guide treatment. In cases of soft-tissue tumors, calcifications, underlying bone erosions, or phleboliths may lead to a diagnosis. A well-defined or lobulated juxta-articular soft-tissue mass with calcifications is suggestive of synovial sarcoma(Figure 1). In cases of osteosarcoma, bone formation, cortical destruction, and periosteal reaction are typical(Figure 2). Some centers may have advanced imaging modalities, but the patient may have to pay for these services and traveling to these centers may not be possible. Although these tests add information, they may not be necessary for treatment. One study noted a 32.4% prevalence of inappropriate advanced imaging ordered before referral for musculoskeletal tumors when resources were not limited. For the surgeon who does not specialize in oncology, consultation with a musculoskeletal radiologist or orthopaedic oncologist is a vital link in making a diagnosis or deciding whether a biopsy is necessary. An image of the radiograph sent by e-mail can be accomplished in many circumstances. Benign lesions, including hemangiomas or osteochondromas, can be identified with radiographs, and consultation can prevent unnecessary procedures. If the diagnosis can be obtained by radiograph alone, then the surgeon who does not specialize in oncology, but has experience treating the specific tumor, can proceed with an appropriate treatment plan with confidence.

AP and oblique radiographs of the distal femur showing a soft-tissue mass near the knee joint with calcifications. These characteristic findings lead to synovial sarcoma being in the differential of possible lesions. The mass was mobile and away from the neurovascular structures and a chest radiograph was normal. Therefore, limb-salvage surgery could be considered.

Standards

There is insufficient evidence to support diagnostic standards.

Guidelines

There is insufficient evidence to support diagnostic guidelines.

Options

A lateral cervical x-ray is recommended for the diagnosis of atlanto-occipital dislocation. If a radiological method for measurement is used, the basion-axial interval-basion-dental interval method is recommended. The presence of upper cervical prevertebral soft tissue swelling on an otherwise nondiagnostic plain x-ray should prompt additional imaging. If there is clinical suspicion of atlanto-occipital dislocation, and plain x-rays are nondiagnostic, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is recommended, particularly for the diagnosis of non-Type II dislocations.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 KDIGO clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and Treatment of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) [^1164xEGi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US Commentary on the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline Update for chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) states that CKD-MBD "encompasses laboratory and bone abnormalities and vascular calcification and has deleterious effects on clinical outcomes", and clarifies that the article "presents the views of the KDOQI CKD-MBD work group". The KDOQI work group "agrees with most of the KDIGO guideline update recommendations, particularly the suggestions regarding bone mineral density testing, joint assessments of longitudinal trends in mineral metabolism markers, and dietary phosphate counseling focused on phosphate additives", but "has some concerns about the suggestions related to hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia, phosphate-binder choice, and treatment of abnormal parathyroid hormone concentrations". The introduction emphasizes that CKD-MBD "is a nearly universal complication of progressive loss of kidney function" and that its components "are consistently associated with increased risks for morbidity and mortality in large observational studies across the spectrum of CKD".

### Information about soft tissue imaging and metal ion testing… [^116S56XU]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

The most utilized methods of imaging soft tissue surrounding MoM hip implants include:

- Magnetic Resonance Imaging with metal artifact reduction sequences
- **Strengths**: MRI uses non-ionizing radiation and offers the best visualization of soft tissues surrounding a MoM hip implant and detection of potential ALTR.
- **Weaknesses**: Most MoM hip implants in the U. S. have not been evaluated for safety in an MR environment so the likelihood of adverse events, such as heating of the tissue near the implant, may not be known.
- Computed Tomography Scan
- **Strength**: CT offers the best visualization of implant positioning and bony tissue.
- **Weaknesses**: CT uses ionizing radiation and provides lower soft tissue visualization. Image artifacts from the implant may distort the image.
- Ultrasound
- **Strengths**: Ultrasound allows soft tissue visualization without metal artifacts and uses non-ionizing radiation.
- **Weaknesses**: Image quality in ultrasound is very operator dependent.

Ultrasound provides a lower resolution soft tissue image than MRI and has a limited depth penetration.
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging with metal artifact reduction sequences
- If it is determined that MRI imaging of a MoM hip implant patient is appropriate, the FDA recommends that the orthopaedic surgeon:

- Consult with the radiologist to evaluate the benefits and risks of utilizing MRI with metal artifact reduction;
- Use the available device-specific labeling to help determine appropriate scan sequences; and
- Inform the MRI site that the patient has a MoM hip implant. What Should Be Tested. Test Method:

- Measure cobalt using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, equipped with either a collision cell or dynamic reaction cell technology, or use a sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.

The FDA recommends testing cobalt in EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood using a validated method that meets the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments validation criteria. The method should accurately and precisely measure concentrations as low as 1 µg/L cobalt.
- If chromium is measured, use an ICP-MS, equipped with either a collision cell or dynamic reaction cell technology, or use SF-ICP-MS to resolve potential polyatomic interferences. The FDA recommends testing chromium in EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood using a validated method that meets the CLIA validation criteria. The method should accurately and precisely measure concentrations as low as 1 µg/L chromium.
