## Question

Should I give fluids in right heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether and how to give intravenous fluids in right heart failure, including how to assess fluid responsiveness and how to tailor therapy based on the underlying cause and hemodynamic status. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of right ventricular failure and the risk of both underfilling and overdistension. Then, I should verify what major guidelines and expert statements say about fluid strategy in RHF. Next, I will translate this into practical bedside assessment with static and dynamic measures. After that, I should consider scenario-specific management for common RHF etiologies, and finally I will synthesize a safe, stepwise algorithm and highlight red flags that warrant avoiding fluids altogether.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology, because if I get this wrong, fluid decisions will be off. The right ventricle is thin-walled and exquisitely sensitive to both preload and afterload; it is normally preload-dependent, yet paradoxically vulnerable to overdistension that increases wall stress, compresses the left ventricle via septal shift, and impairs both RV coronary perfusion and systemic output, so there is a narrow "sweet spot" for optimal filling rather than reflexively giving or withholding fluids across the board [^115aa1Qs] [^1133rjaZ] [^117M2brc].

> Wait, let me verify what the high-credibility sources advise. The AHA scientific statement explicitly cautions that the teaching that ARHF is preload-dependent requiring volume loading is overly simplistic and recommends careful preload optimization rather than routine fluids, while ESICM guidance advises against using fluid resuscitation as primary therapy in left-sided cardiogenic shock and supports individualized resuscitation in circulatory failure with frequent reassessment. The ISHLT consensus recommends a CVP target of roughly 5–12 mm Hg and discourages excessive fluid administration, and ESC/ERS pulmonary hypertension guidance emphasizes diuretics when there is RV failure with fluid retention, all of which argue for a measured, hemodynamic-targeted approach rather than liberal fluids [^117UDRuu] [^112JaomB] [^1121umfD] [^117Btrqw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about giving or withholding fluids. I should confirm how to assess fluid responsiveness and when a small challenge is appropriate. Bedside echocardiography with IVC dynamics, TAPSE, and visual assessment of RV size helps detect RV dilation and ventricular interdependence; a small fluid challenge of about 250–500 mL can be reasonable if the patient is hypotensive with low CVP/RAP, with the intent to stop early if there is no improvement, while passive leg raise or a ventilator-based dynamic test can help predict response without exposing the RV to large volumes; importantly, static measures like CVP are limited for predicting fluid responsiveness, so trends and integrated hemodynamics matter more than a single number [^111zdxbP] [^112z93GD] [^114yeJSa].

> I should double-check CVP targets and how to apply them. For most patients with RHF, aiming for a CVP around 5–12 mm Hg balances adequate preload against RV overdistension. However, after RV myocardial infarction, transiently accepting a CVP of about 12–15 mm Hg can offset RV diastolic dysfunction and improve forward flow, and I must be careful not to misapply a uniform CVP target across heterogeneous etiologies or stages of RHF [^1121umfD] [^111Ui2xk].

> Let me consider the scenario of acute pulmonary embolism, because that is where a cautious preload strategy is most nuanced. Initially, I thought fluids might uniformly help RV output after PE; wait, I should verify that because recent guidance warns that routine fluids can worsen septal shift and RV wall stress in PE-related RV failure, so a very small, carefully monitored bolus may be tried only if the patient is clearly hypovolemic with low filling pressures, and otherwise early inotropes, pulmonary vasodilators, and avoidance of RV ischemia are prioritized rather than liberal fluids [^112kTRXc] [^112jNrE8].

> Next, I will examine RV myocardial infarction, where I need to ensure I do not inadvertently drop preload too much. In RV infarction, diastolic dysfunction and impaired RV compliance are central, and modest volume loading to a CVP near 12–15 mm Hg can be beneficial if hypotension and low CO persist, with early use of inotropes and avoidance of preload-reducing agents; if low output persists despite this, temporary mechanical support should be considered without delay [^111Ui2xk] [^111LsGZ2].

> I will now examine chronic pulmonary hypertension with acute decompensation, because that is where fluids most commonly cause harm. These patients are often already volume-overloaded, so diuretics and careful afterload reduction are first-line; small test boluses may be considered only when clearly hypovolemic with low CVP, and if CVP is above roughly 15 mm Hg or there is no MAP rise with a leg raise or small bolus, inotropes, pulmonary vasodilators, and diuresis are favored over more fluids, given the risk of worsening septal shift and RV ischemia [^117Btrqw] [^115RZuit] [^112trPft].

> Let me consider acute respiratory distress syndrome, since positive pressure ventilation changes RV loading and fluid decisions. In ARDS with cor pulmonale physiology, lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes and careful PEEP selection reduce RV afterload, and fluid loading is often deleterious; if hypoperfusion persists, vasopressors and inodilators are preferred to additional fluids, and diuresis may be needed to decompress the RV and improve LV filling via ventricular interdependence [^112yC8EL].

> But wait, what if the patient is in septic shock with coexisting RV failure? I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize sepsis protocols. While sepsis algorithms have historically endorsed 30 mL/kg crystalloids early, this can precipitate RV volume overload in patients with RV dysfunction. A more tailored 10–15 mL/kg in the first few hours with very early vasopressors and close reassessment is reasonable, balancing under-resuscitation against RV decompensation, and recognizing that fluid responsiveness may be blunted in septic RV failure [^112JaomB] [^1133QL6E].

> I should confirm a practical bedside algorithm to keep this safe. First, screen for RHF using echocardiography and clinical congestion. Second, assess filling pressures with CVP or PA catheter if uncertainty persists. Third, if CVP is high and the patient is congested, prioritize diuresis and afterload reduction rather than fluids. Fourth, if CVP is low and there is hypotension, give a small, closely observed 250–500 mL bolus and stop if there is no improvement. Fifth, use inotropes and vasopressors early to secure MAP and RV perfusion when needed, and escalate to mechanical support if refractory [^112kTRXc] [^112jNrE8] [^112YtM5T].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mean fluids are contraindicated or harmful. A CVP persistently above about 15–18 mm Hg, marked RV dilation with septal flattening, signs of systemic venous congestion, or any deterioration in MAP with a fluid bolus should prompt cessation of fluids and initiation of diuresis and RV unloading strategies. Similarly, in mechanically ventilated patients with high PEEP or in post–lung transplant settings, aggressive fluids worsen RV failure and should be avoided in favor of euvolemia and RV-protective strategies [^115RZuit] [^111Ui2xk] [^114y8Uvk].

> In summary, I need to ensure my message is precise: fluids are not routinely indicated in right heart failure, but carefully selected, small test boluses may be appropriate when the patient is clearly underfilled with low CVP and low MAP, whereas most RHF presentations benefit more from diuresis, afterload reduction, inotropes, and vasopressors to maintain RV perfusion, all guided by dynamic reassessment and tailored to the underlying cause and hemodynamics [^117UDRuu] [^1121umfD] [^117Btrqw].

Not routinely. In right heart failure, fluids are generally avoided because the right ventricle is sensitive to **preload** and **afterload**, and excess fluid can worsen RV dilation, septal shift, and low output [^117M2brc]. Give fluids only if the patient is **hypovolemic with low CVP** and **clear fluid responsiveness** on dynamic testing (e.g. passive leg raise) [^112z93GD], using small boluses (250–500 mL) with close monitoring. Otherwise, prioritize diuretics, afterload reduction, and inotropes to **optimize RV function and perfusion** [^112kTRXc] [^117L2rJz].

---

## Pathophysiology of right heart failure and fluid management

Right heart failure arises from **increased afterload** (e.g. pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism), **impaired contractility** (e.g. RV infarction, myocarditis), or **volume overload** (e.g. tricuspid regurgitation, left heart failure) [^117L2rJz]. The RV is thin-walled and preload-dependent, yet also vulnerable to overdistension from excess volume, which can reduce contractility, increase wall stress, and worsen interventricular dependence, ultimately decreasing cardiac output [^112CedLM].

---

## Risks of fluid administration in right heart failure

Excess fluids in RHF can cause:

- **RV dilation and septal shift**: Reduces LV filling and output via ventricular interdependence [^112CedLM].
- **Increased wall stress and ischemia**: Elevates myocardial oxygen demand and reduces coronary perfusion [^114tyo1f].
- **Worsening congestion**: Raises CVP and venous pressures, impairing renal and hepatic function [^1148KFCJ].
- **Tricuspid regurgitation**: Aggravates RV volume overload and further reduces output [^114tyo1f].

---

## Clinical scenarios where fluids may be beneficial

Fluids may help only when **true hypovolemia** coexists with RHF, such as:

- **RV infarction with low preload**: Small boluses may improve output if CVP is low and the patient is fluid responsive [^111LsGZ2].
- **Acute PE with low preload**: Limited fluids may aid perfusion if CVP is low and responsiveness is confirmed [^112yC8EL].
- **Post-cardiac surgery RV dysfunction**: Careful fluids may help if hypovolemia is present [^116h4FUz].

---

## Clinical scenarios where fluids should be avoided

Fluids should be avoided when **volume overload** or **high CVP** is present, including:

- **Chronic RHF with congestion**: Diuretics and afterload reduction are preferred [^117Btrqw].
- **Acute decompensated RHF**: Diuretics and vasodilators are first-line; fluids worsen congestion [^112yC8EL].
- **Pulmonary hypertension with high CVP**: Fluids increase RV dilation and worsen output [^111Ui2xk].

---

## Evidence and guidelines

Guidelines emphasize **individualized, hemodynamically guided** management:

- **AHA**: Use fluids cautiously; prioritize diuretics, afterload reduction, and inotropes [^112kTRXc].
- **ESC**: Diuretics are first-line for RHF with fluid retention; fluids are not routine [^117Btrqw].
- **ISHLT**: Maintain CVP 5–12 mmHg; avoid excess fluids and use diuretics for overload [^1121umfD].

---

## Monitoring and assessment

Accurate assessment is essential to **guide fluids**:

- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate RV size/function, fluid responsiveness, and septal motion [^114oqQBv].
- **Invasive hemodynamics**: CVP, PAP, and CO guide safe fluid and drug therapy [^115tjgDK].
- **Dynamic tests**: Passive leg raise or mini-fluid challenges assess responsiveness [^112z93GD].

---

## Alternative strategies

When fluids are harmful or ineffective, use:

- **Diuretics**: Loop agents ± thiazides for congestion; monitor renal function [^115CG8Mp].
- **Afterload reduction**: Pulmonary vasodilators (inhaled NO, epoprostenol, sildenafil) [^112nnT6A].
- **Inotropes**: Dobutamine or milrinone to improve contractility and output [^113LjuXf].
- **Mechanical support**: ECMO or RVAD for refractory RV failure [^1128wG4f].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Fluid administration** | **Alternative strategies** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemic RHF (low CVP, fluid responsive) | Small bolus (250–500 mL) with close monitoring | Diuretics if congestion develops |
| Volume overloaded RHF (high CVP, congestion) | Avoid fluids | - Diuretics <br/> - Afterload reduction <br/> - Inotropes |
| RV infarction with low preload | Small cautious bolus if responsive | - Inotropes <br/> - Revascularization |
| Pulmonary hypertension with high CVP | Avoid fluids | - Pulmonary vasodilators <br/> - Diuretics |

---

Fluids are not routine in RHF; give them only when **hypovolemia and fluid responsiveness are clearly present**, using small boluses with close monitoring. Otherwise, prioritize diuretics, afterload reduction, and inotropes to **optimize RV function and perfusion**.

Post-acute myocardial infarction ARVF

Reduced contractility is the primary mechanism of ARVF in the context of inferior acute myocardial infarction due to right coronary artery occlusion. Nevertheless, during ischemic insult, the RV becomes stiff, reducing peak systolic pressure and augmenting end-diastolic volume, consequently end-diastolic pressure. This combined systolic and diastolic dysfunction leads to underfilling of the left side of the heart and low-output syndrome. Besides revascularization of the culprit vessel, medical management of ARVF post-acute myocardial infarction is targeted to maintain organ perfusion with adequate volume status, which is usually higher than normal to produce effective CO (CVP target between 12 and 15 mm Hg), and agents that compromise RV preload such as nitrates or diuretics, might be deleterious in this setting. In the case of CS, treatment with vasopressors and inotropes could be necessary to restore organ perfusion. However, the arrhythmic effect of β1-adrenergic receptor agonists can be even more pronounced in the presence of ongoing ischemia, so the utilization of this agent should be minimized. Fluid loading works in only about half of patients, and either dobutamine or inhaled NO has been shown to increase CO in fluid-unresponsive patients. If refractory ARVF following an RV acute myocardial infarction persists despite medical management, temporary MCS with a percutaneous RVAD or ECMO may be indicated.

Renal replacement therapies in diuretic-refractory right-sided heart failure — Among patients who fail to respond to escalating diuretics therapy, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or ultrafiltration may be needed to mechanically remove intravascular volume; care should be taken not to remove fluid at a rate that exceeds the ability of the body to shift extravascular fluid into the intravascular space (the plasma refill rate) because such an excess is likely to result in new or worsening acute kidney dysfunction or injury; ultrafiltration, which refers to the removal of isotonic fluid from the venous compartment via filtration of plasma across a semipermeable membrane, has been evaluated for the treatment of acute HF in multiple trials, although not specifically targeting subjects with RHF.

Monitoring preload and fluid responsiveness

Optimal fluid management is one of the cornerstones of hemodynamic management in shock. Both hypovolemia and hypervolemia are harmful states, and attempts have to be made to administer the fluids in the best possible way. Therefore, the first questions physicians should ask themselves are: (1) whether the clinical problem at hand can be (partially) resolved by increasing cardiac output and (2) whether fluid resuscitation will be effective to achieve this target.

Preload, along with afterload and cardiac contractility, is an important determinant of cardiac output. Preload has been defined as myocardial stretch imposed by ventricular filling at the end of the diastole. While fluid resuscitation should not be delayed, efforts should be made to assess if a patient will respond to fluids. Ideally, in cases of shock, a clinician should be able to use a measure of preload to determine whether a patient requires additional fluids to increase cardiac output. CVP and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) are the most commonly used estimates of right ventricular (RV) and LV preloads, respectively. Volumetric parameters, assessed by transpulmonary thermodilution, and end-diastolic ventricular volumes, determined by echocardiography, are also used to evaluate preload. However, each of these pressure and volume measurements has their limitations. Dynamic measures of assessing whether a patient requires additional fluid to increase stroke volume (i.e. assessing fluid responsiveness) have been proposed in an effort to improve fluid management. The principle behind dynamic measures is that changes in intrathoracic pressure imposed by mechanical ventilation impact on venous return and subsequent cardiac output. During a positive pressure breath, RV filling has been shown to decrease by 20–70%, leading to a decrease in stroke volume that can be amplified by an increasing degree of hypovolemia. This finding indicates that dynamic measures allow the discrimination of preload-dependent and preload-independent hemodynamic situations (i.e. these measures identify the position of a patient's individual Frank–Starling curve). Different dynamic measures are currently available and can be routinely assessed at the bedside using standard and minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems. These include the assessment of pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) via the arterial line or non-invasively by plethysmography, as well as of aortic flow variation and vena cava collapsibility or distensibility determined by Doppler and other modalities of echocardiography. The need for additional fluid may also be evaluated by observing the response to a volume challenge. Following the rapid administration of a bolus of intravenous fluid (i.e. 500 mL in < 30 min) or a passive leg-raising test (which is akin to a fluid load, as venous return increases), cardiac output immediately increases in patients who are fluid-responsive.

Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis of ARVF

Early diagnosis of ARVF is crucial for promptly treat this condition and its underlying cause. The initial clinical presentation of RV failure can be subtle, with vague symptoms like fatigue and abdominal discomfort/distention that are often misinterpreted, leading to a late diagnosis. Subsequently, the overt clinical syndrome is typically characterized by signs of systemic congestion, which may also be accompanied by signs of hypoperfusion in cases of low CO(Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Different causes and management of acute right ventricular failure. This figure depicts the causes and management of acute right ventricular failure (ARVF), resulting from acute or chronic stressors that affect preload, contractility, and afterload. Clinical manifestations include ascites, gastrointestinal congestion, peripheral edema, dyspnea, and jugular vein distension. Management strategies involve fluid control, addressing the underlying condition, and possible tricuspid valve repair. Hemodynamically unstable patients may require inotropes, vasopressors, or mechanical circulatory support (MCS), while stable patients undergo clinical follow-up and medical optimization. AMI indicates acute myocardial infarction; MAP, mean arterial pressure; PE, pulmonary embolism; PH, pulmonary hypertension; and TV, tricuspid valve.

Treatment of ARVF

General Principles

Medical management of ARVF is profoundly influenced by the underlying etiology and it is firstly aimed to identify and treat any reversible underlying condition, including invasive treatments such as coronary revascularization for acute coronary syndrome or thrombolytic therapy/catheter-based therapy for acute PE.

Volume Optimization

RV function is sensitive to loading conditions and medical treatment is addressed to achieve optimal volume balance. Excessive volume loading can cause RV overdistension, leading to augmented wall stress, impaired contractility and increased interventricular dependence, which ultimately reduces CO. Conversely, patients with ARVF have obligate RV diastolic dysfunction and require higher than normal RAP to provide optimal CO; these patients can seem preload dependent and cautious volume loading could be adopted in cases of low filling pressures. Previously normal patients with ARVF (eg, RV myocardial infarction or PE) are more likely to require volume loading than those with acute-on-chronic RV failure (eg, PH), who often have subtle but significant volume overload. Utilization of PAC or central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring can be useful to guide fluid management: a target of CVP between 9 mm Hg and 12 mm Hg (up to 15 mm Hg in selected patients) should be pursued, with fluid loading for patients who are hypotensive or have low CO in the setting of a low CVP, and diuresis stimulation for those with elevated filling pressures. Severely elevated CVP > 18 to 20 mm Hg will result in RV overdistention and systemic congestion and is important to lower acutely. Crucially, diuresis can dramatically improve RV performance and is central in the management of acute-on-chronic RVF.

Management of volume and use of vasopressors

Systemic hypotension may relate to sepsis, overdiuresis, or progression of RV failure itself. Principles of volume management and vasopressor use are summarized.

Volume management

With a normal RV, RV ejection fraction is usually primarily dependent on RV preload. In the setting of excessive myocardial distention (by fluids), wall tension increases according to the Frank-Starling mechanism, and muscle fiber length is increased, beyond a certain point at which ventricular function will fail. This situation may be precipitated sooner in the setting of PH and RV dysfunction, in which both hypo- and hypervolemia may reduce cardiac output. In stable patients with PAH, high plasma volumes are associated with worse outcomes, but very few clinical studies have been performed in pulmonary vascular dysfunction, and the use of fluid loading remains controversial. Some animal studies show that fluids increase the cardiac index; others show that they worsen shock by inducing RV ischemia or decreasing LV filling or both as the result of ventricular diastolic interdependence (due to an increase in RV volume).

In acute cor pulmonale after massive PE, increased filling may be at least initially required. In observational studies in sepsis, up to 40% of patients have evidence of RV failure, predominantly due to primary RV dysfunction. These patients have a higher CVP at baseline and are unable to augment stroke volume or perfusion pressure with fluid challenges alone, and so usually also require catecholamines.

RV volume overload is a very important principle to recognize and treat promptly in RV failure. It may be identified by a rising V wave on the CVP trace, or by increased TR due to RV overdistention seen at echocardiography. In this situation of "backwards" heart failure, no further escalation of vasoactive agents is likely to be helpful (and may even be harmful), and management involves fluid removal (by using diuresis or hemofiltration) and avoidance of excessive RV afterload. Unmonitored fluid challenges are inadvisable in any setting of RV failure.

GRADE RECOMMENDATION 1

Based on overall very-low-quality evidence (see Additional file 1), the following WEAK recommendation is made: Close monitoring of fluid status according to effects on RV function is recommended. Initial carefully monitored limited volume loading may be useful after acute PE, but may also worsen RV performance in some patients with pulmonary vascular dysfunction, and vasoactive agents may be required.

### Measurement and interpretation of central venous pressure: a narrative review [^114P6LZz]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite being non‐specific for right ventricular dysfunction or volume status, monitoring of CVP trends may be useful in conditions such as pulmonary hypertension or left‐sided heart failure, in which the development of acute right ventricular diastolic dysfunction is associated with high morbidity and poorer overall prognosis. The relationship between CVP and right ventricular dysfunction is complex, as elevated pressures can trigger a compensatory increase in afterload, worsening right ventricular filling. Nevertheless, CVP provides critical insights into the haemodynamic burdens placed on the right heart and can be useful to monitor the progression of right ventricular diastolic dysfunction over time (Fig. 4).

Anaesthetists and intensivists are called upon increasingly to care for patients at risk of right heart failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension. It is estimated to affect 1% of the global population, with increased prevalence in those aged > 65 y. Most cases are secondary to left heart disease or lung disease (World Health Organization group 2 disease). These patients have a peri‐operative mortality of 15–50% when undergoing emergency surgery. The 2022 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines recommend CVP be monitored during general anaesthesia where significant fluid shifts are expected. Importantly, CVC insertion and monitoring is within the core skill set of all anaesthetists, whereas peri‐operative echocardiography or pulmonary artery catheterisation may not be. In such cases, the absolute value, trends and waveform are all of importance. A CVP rising progressively combined with a falling mean arterial pressure may indicate a failing right ventricle, requiring consideration of inotropic and/or vasoactive support, careful volume management and inhaled pulmonary vasodilators. Changes in the CVP waveform also alert the anaesthetist to worsening right ventricular function.

### The right ventricle: interaction with the pulmonary circulation [^116rC4Wj]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

In the aggregate, if RV failure occurs due to increased afterload or impaired contractility, then RV filling pressures rise and if mean systemic filling pressure does not rise proportionally, cardiac output falls because the pressure gradient for venous return decreases. Indirectly, this gives rise to the clinical observation that if fluid resuscitation causes right atrial pressure to rise, then the patient is probably not volume responsive because the normal response of a healthy individual to fluid resuscitation is to keep right atrial pressure constant as cardiac output increases owing to the increased pressure gradient for venous return to the heart.

RV Response to Stressors and Clinical Consequences

The structure of the RV is specifically adapted to the high-flow, low-resistance pulmonary circulation, traditionally seen as ill-equipped to manage acute increases in afterload, and sudden rises in pulmonary pressure and PVR can precipitate ARVF. The timing of the onset of changes in loading conditions is a crucial determinant of the RV response. Acute stress induces an increase in end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, leading to a temporary decrease in ejection fraction while maintaining stroke volume, a phenomenon known as heterometric adaptation under Starling law of the heart. Over time, the RV adapts to increased afterload through enhanced contractility (homeometric adaptation) and undergoes remodeling, encompassing mechanisms like myocyte hypertrophy and extracellular matrix expansion, leading to a thicker chamber wall. Concurrently, the RV undergoes remodeling towards a rounder shape with a reduced radius. Given Laplace law, which posits that wall stress directly relates to chamber radius and inversely to wall thickness, these adaptations primarily aim to diminish wall stress, mitigating the impact of increased afterload.

When RV overburdening is prolonged, homeometric adaptation is no longer adequate and the heart resorts again to heterometric adaptation, ultimately resulting in RV dilatation that typically leads to increased filling pressures due to stiffening from fibrosis and hypertrophy, causing higher right atrial pressure (RAP) and systemic congestion. Functional TVR can also stem from RV and right atrium (RA) remodeling, worsening congestion, and reducing CO. The presence of high RAP attenuates the gradient for forward blood flow across the capillary network of the renal vasculature, ultimately resulting in glomerular dysfunction with consequent decreased renal performance and urinary output (ie, cardiorenal syndrome type 1). Furthermore, the reduced CO causes inadequate renal perfusion, prompting renin release from the juxtaglomerular cells, which in turn leads to a vicious circle of additional sodium/fluid retention. In addition, as the RV dilates, it may induce pericardial constraint, leading to interventricular competition for space and altering LV filling and output. Loss of normal interventricular septal curvature from RV dilation and RV pressure/volume overload can further compromise RV function, as the septum contributes substantially to overall RV performance.RV dilatation also increases myocardial oxygen demand while potentially reducing supply, particularly affecting coronary artery flow, thereby exacerbating ischemia and further diminishing RV contractility and CO.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111GWTtd]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association scientific statement on right-sided heart failure (RHF) describes diverse causes including primary cardiomyopathies with right ventricular (RV) involvement, RV ischemia and infarction, volume loading from congenital heart disease and valvular pathologies, and pressure loading from pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension, with progressive RV dysfunction associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output, progressive end-organ damage from venous congestion and underperfusion, cachexia from poor absorption of nutrients, and a systemic proinflammatory state, and it is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by complex geometry, and multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making. The statement notes that pharmacological and mechanical interventions targeting isolated acute and chronic RHF have not been well investigated and that specific therapies promoting stabilization and recovery of RV function are lacking.

Fig. 1
The relationship between unstressed and stressed blood volume and mean systemic pressure (Pms) and its independence from mean arterial pressure (MAP) and right atrial pressure (Pra). Pra is important because the driving pressure for venous return (Pvr) is the pressure difference between Pms and Pra. Thus, for the same blood volume, vasodilation, by increasing unstressed volume, decreases both Pms and Pvr, causing cardiac output to decrease. LV left ventricle, RV right ventricle

Accordingly, hypo volemia refers to a low intravascular blood volume, wherein mean systemic filling pressure is low and there is a net flux of water and electrolytes out of the interstitial and tissue spaces into the blood stream. This tends to support blood volume but with decreased tissue rigidity and loss of vascular reserve. At the opposite end of the spectrum, hyper volemia refers to an excessive blood volume, wherein mean systemic circulatory pressure is high, causing a net fluid loss into the interstitium resulting in some edema formation. The causes of hypervolemia can be complex and include renal failure, congestive heart failure, or liver failure, especially when these conditions are associated with overzealous fluid administration. Hypervolemia is also sometimes associated with hyponatremia, especially in patients with cirrhosis, renal failure, or heart failure, reflecting a defect in free water excretion. Unfortunately, hypervolemia is not a condition with which the body is prepared to cope, as all stress states are usually associated with hypovolemia. This is why clinicians often need to intervene in the management of hypervolemia with the use of diuretics or ultrafiltration. In essence, the body defends bleeding and hypo volemia. Hyper volemia is not a priority. Nevertheless, in the perioperative setting, both hypovolemia and hypervolemia are associated with several unfavorable outcomes, including acute renal failure, respiratory complications, and increased length of stay, costs, and even 30-day mortality.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117UDRuu]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Medical management of ARHF focuses on management of volume and preload, myocardial contractility, and RV afterload with pharmacotherapy and, if needed, MCS, and abnormalities in the pulmonary circulation and LV filling should be identified as targets for reducing RV afterload and augmenting RV function. Volume management is a critical consideration in ARHF, and the volume status of the patient should be determined on initial examination; a primary goal should be a reduction in left atrial pressure with an aim of reducing congestion and pulsatile RV loading. Hemodynamic monitoring with a central venous catheter or PA catheter can be informative when volume status is uncertain or when hemodynamic instability or worsening renal function occurs, and the teaching that ARHF is a preload-dependent condition requiring volume loading is overly simplistic.

Right ventricular failure (RVF) — acute on chronic decompensation: Acute decompensation is usually provoked by one or more precipitating factors (e.g., infection, pulmonary embolism, bleeding disorders) or by progression of the underlying disease; patients frequently deteriorate and enter a vicious cycle of hypotension, ischemia, and decreased pump function or may stabilize and revert to more or less stable chronic RVF, and mortality after hospital discharge remains high (35% at 12 mo).

### Practical guidance for hemodynamic assessment by right heart catheterization in management of heart Failure [^115tjgDK]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by the inability of the heart to meet the circulatory demands of the body without requiring an increase in intracardiac pressures at rest or with exertion. Hemodynamic parameters can be measured via right heart catheterization, which has an integral role in the full spectrum of heart failure: from ambulatory patients to those in cardiogenic shock, as well as patients being considered for left ventricular device therapy and heart transplantation. Hemodynamic data are critical for prompt recognition of clinical deterioration, assessment of prognosis, and guidance of treatment decisions. This review is a field guide for hemodynamic assessment, troubleshooting, and interpretation for clinicians treating patients with heart failure.

Weaning of cardiopulmonary bypass and actuating DMCS — vasopressors (norepinephrine and vasopressin) are started to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 75 to 90 mm Hg, while before separation and thereafter optimal oxygenation is maintained and acidosis and hypercarbia are avoided. In general, a central venous pressure of ≤ 14 mm Hg is desirable, and rapid administration of large amounts of intravenous fluids or blood products should be avoided; if necessary, blood products should be administered in combination with diuretics. Afterload management can be achieved using nonselective (milrinone) and selective (inhaled nitric oxide or inhaled prostaglandin) pulmonary vasodilators. Atrioventricular pacing may be attempted for bradyarrhythmia to enhance right ventricular function, and in the event of persistent and refractory right ventricular failure, mechanical right ventricular support should be instituted without delay. Continuous TEE guidance should be used to assess right ventricular function and degree of LV unloading during initiation of LVAD pump (Class I, Level of evidence C), pump speed should be increased and adjusted to maintain adequate aortic perfusion pressure, systemic perfusion and avoid excess unloading of the left ventricle (Class I, Level of evidence C), and selective inotropic therapy, pulmonary vasodilator therapy, systemic oxygenation, and heart rate with atrioventricular pacing, if necessary, should be optimized to prevent or manage right heart failure (Class I, Level of evidence C).

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^115BwsNh]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that current guidelines as well as important clinical trials have used measures of preload to guide fluid resuscitation, clinicians should be cautious when using such measures. Importantly, any measure of preload, particularly if it is a one-time measurement, should not be taken out of context with respect to the measures of other variables and the patient's overall clinical condition. For example, a normal individual with a normal vascular volume has a very low CVP and does not require additional fluid; alternatively, some patients with high measures of preload pressure may benefit from additional fluids. Thus, changes in these parameters following interventions may be much more useful than a single measurement. Unfortunately, poor correlations between estimates of preload (whether pressures or volumes) and predictions of fluid responsiveness have been widely reported. For example, in normal healthy volunteers, both CVP and PAOP are poor predictors of preload, cardiac performance and changes in cardiac performance following fluid loading compared with measurements of end-diastolic ventricular volumes. End-diastolic ventricular volumes have also been found to provide superior estimates of preload compared with CVP and PAOP in diverse groups of critically ill patients. Nonetheless, there may be clinical settings, such as severe congestive heart failure or hypovolemia, where titration of fluid therapy based on CVP and PAOP may be helpful. Notably, measurements of ventricular volumes are not always easy to obtain (especially on the right side of the heart), are associated with costs and time delays and are operator-dependent. A number of studies have shown that dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness are better predictors of fluid responsiveness than static parameters in mechanically ventilated patients. PPV and SVV, for example, have proven to be good predictors of fluid responsiveness in sedated mechanically ventilated patients without spontaneous breathing activities and in sinus rhythm. Dynamic measures do have several limitations, however. Importantly, patients must be on fully controlled mechanical ventilation without spontaneous efforts, which is seldom the case in ICU patients. In addition, these parameters are affected by the magnitude of the employed tidal volume. Finally, most of the evaluations involving dynamic measures have included relatively stable patients, such as post-cardiac surgery patients, and the extent to which these measures are useful in other potentially unstable populations is uncertain. Few studies evaluating measures of fluid responsiveness have specifically focused on the spontaneously breathing patient. Not surprisingly, the measurement of PPV had no predictive value in the subgroup of patients with spontaneous breathing activity. However, reductions in right atrial pressures by at least 1 mmHg during a spontaneous inspiration have been shown to be a reasonable predictor of fluid responsiveness. Passive leg-raising (e.g. 45° elevation for 4 min while maintaining the trunk supine) results in an increase in RV and LV preload. Such a test may help in predicting individual fluid responsiveness during spontaneous and positive pressure breaths while avoiding the hazards of unnecessary fluid loading.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112kTRXc]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Figure 11 — Management of acute right-sided heart failure (RHF) emphasizes hemodynamic assessment and sets specific targets and actions: Preload Optimization (RAP/CVP ≤ 12 mmHg) and Maintenance of perfusion (MAP ≥ 65). In volume depletion, careful fluid resuscitation is advised with NS 500–1000 mL IV bolus, and if volume overload persists with diuretic resistance, CVVH or UF for removing volume overload with diuretic resistance can be used. All management must be undertaken with an awareness of the patient's hemodynamic status, and if this status is not clear clinically, then invasive assessment/monitoring should be undertaken, with hemodynamic targets providing rough guidelines for tailored therapy.

### Successful echocardiography-guided medical management of severe early post-implant right ventricular failure in a patient with left ventricular assist device support: a case report [^115DgnMo]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-implant right heart failure (RHF) has been recognized as a crucial prognostic factor in patients receiving left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and its management has long attracted attention from cardiologists and surgeons.

Case presentation

This report described an 18-year-old female with acutely deteriorating heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent paracorporeal pulsatile-flow LVAD and developed early post-implant RHF. At postoperative day (POD) six, she was almost asymptomatic at rest on 2.5 mg/kg/min of dobutamine; however, the echocardiogram, performed as part of the daily postoperative care, revealed a severely enlarged right ventricle with a decompressed left ventricle, implying the development of post-implant RHF. Bolus infusion of saline and reduction of pump flow (6.0 L/min to 3.0 L/min) led to normalization of both ventricular shapes in 30 s, suggesting that RHF could be managed without surgical interventions. Milrinone was started on POD six, followed by sildenafil administration on POD seven. Fluid balance was strictly adjusted under the close observation of daily echocardiograms. Milrinone and dobutamine were discontinued on PODs 18 and 21, respectively. The patient was listed for a heart transplant on POD 40. Despite reduced right ventricular function (right ventricular stroke work index of 182.34 mmHg×ml/m², body surface area 1.5 m²), she was successfully converted to implantable LVAD on POD 44 with no recurrence of post-implant RHF thereafter for four years.

Conclusions

In post-implant RHF management, early detection, together with proper and prompt medical management, is crucial to avoiding any surgical intervention. Close observation of daily echocardiograms might be helpful in detecting subclinical RHF and is useful for post-implant medical management.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114Eh1UB]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Cardiorenal syndrome in right heart failure (RHF) — increased central venous pressure (CVP) and consequent rise in renal vein pressure worsen renal function even without decreased cardiac output, and increased CVP has been identified as an independent risk factor for impaired renal function in heart failure; clinical features include decreased urine output, worsening fluid retention, and increased diuretic requirements, with laboratory abnormalities of increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine; elevated and worsening serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen are independent predictors of adverse outcomes unless accompanied by significant decongestion in acute heart failure; these findings may limit aggressiveness in diuresis and using guideline-directed medical therapy, including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system–inhibiting agents, and may promote use of inotropes; increasing evidence of acute kidney injury with elevated right-sided filling pressures may motivate erroneous reduction of loop diuretic therapy, but this action may be deleterious, and if volume status is unclear or isolated RHF is a concern, placement of a PA catheter may be informative.

### Gaps and knowledge in the contemporary management of acute right ventricular failure [^117TPZCP]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology and Causes of ARVF

The RV is a thin-walled, crescent-shaped chamber of the heart that pumps venous blood from the systemic circulation to the lungs for oxygenation. To achieve this, the RV manages fluctuating end-diastolic volumes resulting from respirophasic changes in venous return due to heart-lung interactions, efficiently propelling blood into the pulmonary circulation, which has high compliance and minimal resistance in a healthy individual.

Definition and Causes of ARVF

From a pathophysiological perspective, ARVF can be described as the rapid deterioration of RV performance, typically due to impaired contractility and alterations in loading conditions. These changes result in the RV's inability to effectively manage systemic venous return (causing systemic congestion) and to provide forward flow to fill the LV (potentially causing hypoperfusion). ARVF usually develops in patients with preexisting chronic RV failure, exacerbated by an acute event (acute-on-chronic RV failure), but it can also arise de novo from direct acute injury affecting RV function. Moreover, most cases of ARVF are part of broader biventricular failure, and distinguishing isolated forms of ARVF is critical.

ARVF develops through 3 primary mechanisms, often interrelated (Figure 1):

It compares the pathways leading to ARVF under de novo conditions, which arise from direct acute injury, and acute on chronic scenarios, which develop due to a worsening of preexisting conditions. The diagram outlines the heart's short-term and long-term adaptive responses to increased afterload, emphasizing the potential for right ventricular dilatation and the associated negative outcomes on systemic circulation and organ function. CO indicates cardiac output; CVP, central venous pressure; PA, pulmonary artery; and RV, right ventricular.

### Pulmonary vascular and right ventricular dysfunction in adult critical care: current and emerging options for management: a systematic literature review [^114TyjKQ]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Pulmonary hypertension (PH) and associated right ventricular (RV) failure are associated with worse outcomes in critical care, and because of nonspecific presenting symptoms and signs, may be difficult to recognize: echocardiography is a very useful initial test, and invasive monitoring may be helpful in some cases for more continuous monitoring and accurate measurement of pulmonary vascular resistance.

- **Volume loading of the right ventricle may worsen its performance**: all fluid challenges should be closely monitored.

- It is essential to maintain adequate aortic root pressure to prevent the onset of RV ischemia. Vasopressors are useful in this setting, including low-dose norepinephrine as a first-line agent. Low-dose vasopressin may also be useful in some resistant cases but has adverse myocardial effects at higher doses. Potentially useful inotropes in RV failure include dobutamine and those with additional pulmonary vasodilating effects, including PDE III inhibitors, although co-administration with pressors is often necessary. The effects of any vasoactive drug may be unpredictable in an individual and require close clinical observation of circulatory performance, potentially assisted by echocardiography.

- Pulmonary vasodilators are useful to reduce RV afterload in several ICU settings, including PH and RV failure after cardiac surgery. Systemic administration may worsen systemic hemodynamics and oxygenation because of ventilation-perfusion mismatching.

- The use of mechanical therapies to manage acute PH and enhance RV performance is expanding, although with evidence currently limited to case series, and may be useful in experienced centers to ameliorate RV failure while awaiting definitive therapy.

### Geriatric trauma management [^113x1kVK]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in geriatric trauma: PAH is a progressive condition that leads to right ventricular dysfunction and right heart failure, and PAH syndrome is defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure exceeding 25 mm Hg with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤ 15 mm Hg. Physiologic changes resulting from aggressive resuscitation and fluid shifts can be dangerous and precipitate right ventricular decompensation and right heart failure. Clinically, right heart failure is diagnosed with a reduced cardiac output (< 2.5 L/min/m²) and elevated right ventricular filling pressure. Echocardiography is a useful bedside adjunct to assess pulmonary arterial pressures and evidence of right heart failure, and while invasive monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter is rarely used, it may provide useful information for a decompensating patient. Treat any arrhythmias, and reduce afterload to ease stress on the heart, and coordinate care with a heart failure team to evaluate the patient and determine a comprehensive care plan. The American College of Chest Physicians recommends that patients with PAH avoid unnecessary surgery, and for patients with PAH who require surgery, perform it at a center proficient in the treatment of patients with PAH.

### Assessment and treatment of right ventricular failure [^111r6kq6]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) failure is a complex problem with poor outcomes. Diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion, because many of the signs and symptoms of this condition are nonspecific and can be acute or chronic. Identification of the underlying aetiology, which can include pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, congenital or valvular heart disease, and sepsis, is essential. Echocardiography is the technique of choice for first-line assessment, but cardiac MRI is the current gold standard for anatomical and functional assessment of the right ventricle. Therapy for RV failure should be directed at the underlying cause, although management of symptoms is also important. Therapeutic options range from pharmacological treatment to mechanical RV support and heart transplantation. The complex 3D geometry of the right ventricle and its intricate interactions with the left ventricle have left many questions about RV failure unanswered. However, promising new targeted therapies are under development and mechanical support is becoming increasingly feasible. The next decade will be an exciting time for advances in our understanding and management of RV failure.

### Right heart failure management: focus on mechanical support options [^115Zc6cm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Millions of American adults suffer from right heart failure (RHF), a condition associated with high rates of hospitalization, organ failure, and death. There is a multitude of etiologies and mechanisms that lead to RHF, often in a feedforward spiral of decline. The management of advanced cases of RHF can be particularly difficult. For patients who are refractory to the medical optimization of volume status, hemodynamic and pharmacologic support, and rhythm control, mechanical therapies may be warranted. Currently available mechanical assist devices for RHF include venoarterial extracorporeal oxygenation and right ventricular assist devices, both surgical and percutaneous. Each advanced therapy has its own potential advantages and limitations, and often is appropriate in different clinical contexts. In this review, the authors describe the pathophysiology and medical therapies for RHF and then focus on the different types of advanced therapies that currently exist to help inform medical decision-making for this complicated patient cohort.

### Acute right ventricular dysfunction: real-time management with echocardiography [^114oqQBv]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

In critically ill patients, the right ventricle is susceptible to dysfunction due to increased afterload, decreased contractility, or alterations in preload. With the increased use of point-of-care ultrasonography and a decline in the use of pulmonary artery catheters, echocardiography can be the ideal tool for evaluation and to guide hemodynamic and respiratory therapy. We review the epidemiology of right ventricular failure in critically ill patients; echocardiographic parameters for evaluating the right ventricle; and the impact of mechanical ventilation, fluid therapy, and vasoactive infusions on the right ventricle. Finally, we summarize the principles of management in the context of right ventricular dysfunction and provide recommendations for echocardiography-guided management.

### Optimal fluid resuscitation targets in septic patients with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1133QL6E]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Individualized fluid management in sepsis improves outcomes in patients with septic shock. The recommendation of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation originates from the early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) trial conducted by Rivers et al. in 2001. Subsequently, both the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) and Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Early Management Bundle (SEP-1) have endorsed this approach. From 2014 to 2015, three independent, government-funded, multicenter randomized controlled trials were conducted: early septic shock in the USA (ProCESS), sepsis resuscitation assessment in Australia (ARISE), and sepsis programmed management in the UK (ProMISe). The average fluid volume administered to patients prior to randomization in these studies was also around 30 mL/kg, which led to the adoption of 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume in routine clinical practice. However, there has been significant debate regarding the optimal fluid volume for sepsis management. Increasing evidence suggests that the fluid administration during the EGDT era, which followed a permissive intravenous fluid strategy, resulted in suboptimal treatment outcomes. This has raised persistent questions about the appropriateness of the 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation volume. Additionally, the guidelines do not mention a specific rehydration scheme for septic patients at risk of volume overload, and there is no randomized controlled study for reference. Individualized fluid resuscitation may be necessary for patients at risk of volume overload, as the fixed fluid rehydration amount of 30 mL/kg may not be suitable for all sepsis subgroups. The CLOVERS trial demonstrated that early administration of vasopressors to reduce fluid resuscitation volumes did not decrease the 90-day mortality rate in patients with septic hypotension. In line with these findings, our study emphasizes the importance of tailored fluid management strategies in sepsis, particularly for patients with comorbid heart failure, where the optimal initial fluid resuscitation volume of 10–15 mL/kg within the first 3 h may offer the best clinical outcomes.

### Right heart failure: a narrative review for emergency clinicians [^116eGqMv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Right heart failure (RHF) is a clinical syndrome with impaired right ventricular cardiac output due to a variety of etiologies including ischemia, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, or volume overload. Emergency department (ED) patients with an acute RHF exacerbation can be diagnostically and therapeutically challenging to manage.

Objective

This narrative review describes the pathophysiology of right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, the methods to diagnose RHF in the ED, and management strategies.

Discussion

Right ventricular contraction normally occurs against a low pressure, highly compliant pulmonary vascular system. This physiology makes the right ventricle susceptible to acute changes in afterload, which can lead to RHF. Patients with acute RHF may present with an acute illness and have underlying chronic pulmonary hypertension due to left ventricular failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic lung conditions, thromboemboli, or idiopathic conditions. Patients can present with a variety of symptoms resulting from systemic edema and hemodynamic compromise. Evaluation with electrocardiogram, laboratory analysis, and imaging is necessary to evaluate cardiac function and end organ injury. Management focuses on treating the underlying condition, optimizing oxygenation and ventilation, treating arrhythmias, and understanding the patient's hemodynamics with bedside ultrasound. As RHF patients are preload dependent they may require fluid resuscitation or diuresis. Hypotension should be rapidly addressed with vasopressors. Cardiac contractility can be augmented with inotropes. Efforts should be made to support oxygenation while trying to avoid intubation if possible.

Conclusions

Emergency clinician understanding of this condition is important to diagnose and treat this life-threatening cardiopulmonary disorder.

### European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) 2025 clinical practice guideline on fluid therapy in adult critically ill patients: part 2-the volume of resuscitation fluids [^112JaomB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the volume of early resuscitation fluid for adult critically ill patients.

Methods

An international panel of experts developed the guideline, focusing on fluid resuscitation volume in adult critically ill patients with circulatory failure. Using the PICO format, questions were formulated, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

In adults with sepsis or septic shock, the guideline suggests administering up to 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloids in the initial phase, with adjustments based on clinical context and frequent reassessments (very low certainty of evidence). We suggest using an individualized approach in the optimization phase (very low certainty of evidence). No recommendation could be made for or against restrictive or liberal fluid strategies in the optimization phase (moderate certainty of no effect). For hemorrhagic shock, a restrictive fluid strategy is suggested after blunt trauma (moderate certainty) and penetrating trauma (low certainty), with fluid administration for non-traumatic hemorrhagic shock guided by hemodynamic and biochemical parameters (ungraded best practice). For circulatory failure due to left-sided cardiogenic shock, fluid resuscitation as the primary treatment is not recommended. Fluids should be administered cautiously for cardiac tamponade until definitive treatment and guided by surrogate markers of right heart congestion in acute pulmonary embolism (ungraded best practice). No recommendation could be made for circulatory failure associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Conclusions

The panel made four conditional recommendations and four ungraded best practice statements. No recommendations were made for two questions. Knowledge gaps were identified, and suggestions for future research were provided.

### ISHLT consensus statement: perioperative management of patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure undergoing surgery [^113wrxfN]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary endarterectomy preoperative management — operative candidacy focuses on expected surgery in operable patients; although there is no 'upper limit' of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) or degree of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction that excludes patients, severe RV dysfunction and PVR over 1500 dynes/sec/ cm⁻5 have been shown to correlate with postoperative mortality. Preoperatively, optimization of RV function and fluid balance is helpful in decompensated RV failure and can usually be achieved by low dose inotropic support such as dopamine at 1–3 mcg/kg/min and intravenous diuretics for a few days prior to surgery. Although all patients do require baseline right heart catheterization (RHC), continuous monitoring using a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission prior to surgery is rarely required, and due to the obstructive nature of this disease, pre- or intraoperative inhaled agents such as iNO or inhaled prostacyclin are not beneficial unless the patient has a significant non-obstructive vasculopathy.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — diuretics are used for fluid overload in right heart failure, with practice notes indicating that decompensated right heart failure leads to fluid retention, raised central venous pressure, hepatic congestion, ascites and peripheral oedema; although there are no RCTs on the use of diuretics in PAH, clinical experience shows clear symptomatic benefit in fluid overloaded patients; the choice of diuretic therapy may be left to the PAH physician, the addition of aldosterone antagonists should also be considered together with systematic assessments of electrolyte plasma levels, and it is important with diuretics to monitor renal function and blood biochemistry in patients to avoid hypokalaemia and the effects of decreased intravascular volume leading to pre-renal failure.

### ISHLT consensus statement: perioperative management of patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure undergoing surgery [^114y8Uvk]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

Intraoperative monitoring and fluid management during lung transplantation: While practice varies from center to center, intraoperative monitoring consists of radial artery cannulation, occasionally femoral arterial line, central venous access with or without PAC before or after induction depending on patient's ability to tolerate supine positioning, and/or TEE. TEE has been remarkably helpful not only for intraoperative monitoring of the RV but also in assisting in making the decision to whether or not support the RV postoperatively with inotropy and/or ECMO/extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Furthermore, TEE can help evaluate the patency and flows at the pulmonary arterial and venous anastomoses. Intraoperative fluid management is of paramount importance in patients with PH and RVF undergoing lung transplantation to prevent graft edema upon reperfusion while maintaining optimal cardiac output both during surgery and after.

### Diagnostic workup, etiologies and management of acute right ventricle failure: a state-of-the-art paper [^113Y9sL7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

This is a state-of-the-art article of the diagnostic process, etiologies and management of acute right ventricular (RV) failure in critically ill patients. It is based on a large review of previously published articles in the field, as well as the expertise of the authors.

Results

The authors propose the ten key points and directions for future research in the field. RV failure (RVF) is frequent in the ICU, magnified by the frequent need for positive pressure ventilation. While no universal definition of RVF is accepted, we propose that RVF may be defined as a state in which the right ventricle is unable to meet the demands for blood flow without excessive use of the Frank-Starling mechanism (i.e. increase in stroke volume associated with increased preload). Both echocardiography and hemodynamic monitoring play a central role in the evaluation of RVF in the ICU. Management of RVF includes treatment of the causes, respiratory optimization and hemodynamic support. The administration of fluids is potentially deleterious and unlikely to lead to improvement in cardiac output in the majority of cases. Vasopressors are needed in the setting of shock to restore the systemic pressure and avoid RV ischemia; inotropic drug or inodilator therapies may also be needed. In the most severe cases, recent mechanical circulatory support devices are proposed to unload the RV and improve organ perfusion CONCLUSION: RV function evaluation is key in the critically-ill patients for hemodynamic management, as fluid optimization, vasopressor strategy and respiratory support. RV failure may be diagnosed by the association of different devices and parameters, while echocardiography is crucial.

### Pragmatic approach to temporary mechanical circulatory support in acute right ventricular failure [^1128wG4f]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute right ventricular failure (RVF) is prevalent in multiple disease states and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Right-sided temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) devices are used to unload RV congestion and increase cardiac output in cardiogenic shock (CS) with hemodynamically significant RVF. Several RV-tMCS device platforms are available; however consensus is lacking on patient selection, timing of escalation to RV-tMCS, device management, and device weaning. The purposes of this review are to 1) describe the current state of tMCS device therapies for acute RVF with CS, 2) discuss principles of escalation to RV-tMCS device therapy, 3) examine important aspects of clinical management for patients supported by RV-tMCS devices including volume management, anticoagulation, and positive pressure ventilation, and 4) provide a framework for RV-tMCS weaning.

### Pathophysiology of right ventricular failure [^117Cygxh]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Right ventricular failure may be defined as the inability of the right ventricle of the heart to provide adequate blood flow through the pulmonary circulation at a normal central venous pressure. Critical care specialists encounter right ventricular failure routinely in their practice, but until recently right ventricular failure as a primary clinical entity received scant consideration. Indeed, there is still not a single published practice guideline focused on right ventricular failure. Right ventricular failure is usually due to a combination of right ventricular pressure overload and contractile abnormalities of the right ventricular free wall. Decompensation may occur abruptly and catastrophically because of unique aspects of right ventricular physiology. This review will focus on the pathophysiology of acute right ventricular failure in the critical care setting and summarize the limited management options available.

### Using the ventilator to predict fluid responsiveness [^115zSdqv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

During acute circulatory failure, infusing fluids as first line therapy is the source of a therapeutic dilemma [increase in cardiac output (CO) and improvement of tissue perfusion vs. inconsistent effectiveness and risk of fluid accumulation]. Predicting effectiveness of a fluid bolus on CO before infusing it avoids administering fluid to patients who do not require it. The principle is simple: if some changes in cardiac preload, induced by external maneuvers or by the ventilator, change CO above a given diagnostic threshold, fluid infusion will likely have a similar effect.

The tests and indices using the ventilator (Supplementary Fig. 1) are underpinned by heart–lung interactions. Under mechanical ventilation, increased intrathoracic pressure reduces the pressure gradient of systemic venous return by increasing right atrial pressure. This effect is exaggerated upon insufflation. The resulting drop in CO is larger if both ventricles are preload responsive. Ventilation also increases afterload of the right ventricle (RV) and decreases left-ventricular (LV) afterload, but these effects are independent of preload responsiveness and only relevant if the RV is failing.

Chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — peripheral edema is often the most prominent clinical feature; early stages may have mild symptoms, but as RV function worsens reduction in cardiac output leads to progressive exercise intolerance and fatigue; atrial tachyarrhythmias are common with elevated RAP and can lead to hemodynamic deterioration, and ventricular tachycardia and heart block are additional electrophysiological complications; in patients with pulmonary hypertension, CRHF closely correlates with increased morbidity and mortality; compared with primary left heart failure, CRHF involves increased central venous pressure and reduced LV filling from ventricular interdependence as a consequence of RV dilation; in later stages with reduced systemic output, impaired end-organ function may result from both elevated central venous filling pressures and reduced cardiac output, with increased systemic venous pressure impeding lung lymphatic drainage and exacerbating pulmonary edema and pleural effusions; the organs most affected are the kidneys and liver, with the gastrointestinal tract implicated.

Stabilization and Resuscitation Strategy

Intravenous Fluids

Fluid resuscitation strategy is a clinical challenge in the early management of CS as it is often difficult to assess and can vary over time. In right‐sided heart failure, right atrial pressures and pulmonary artery wedge pressures are poor predictors of fluid response. 15, 35 Echocardiography can assess right‐sided heart volume status and rule out pericardial fluid collection. 15 The definitive method of volume status assessment and adequacy of resuscitation is right heart catheterization, which should be performed in conjunction with coronary angiography. If hypovolemia is present, conservative boluses of crystalloids (250–500 mL) are reasonable while the patient is being stabilized for cardiac catheterization.

Oxygenation and Ventilation

Continuous pulse oximetry should be used to monitor for respiratory compromise. Oxygen goals vary depending on patient comorbidities, but in the acute care setting blood oxygen saturations of > 90% are acceptable.

When non‐invasive forms of oxygenation and ventilation are inadequate, invasive ventilation is required. Low tidal volumes (5–7 mL/kg of ideal body weight) used in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome are considered lung protective and decrease the incidence of RVF from 60% to 25% in this cohort of patients. 36 Low tidal volumes optimize blood flow between the pulmonary and parenchymal vasculature. The decreased resistance in the pulmonary circuit lowers stress on the RV, compared with higher tidal volumes. Therefore, a low tidal volume strategy is recommended when mechanically ventilating patients in CS.

Vasopressor Support

Vasopressors (Table 2) should be titrated to a mean arterial pressure with a typical goal of > 65 mm Hg. Vasopressin has less pulmonary vasoconstriction than norepinephrine; and may be more beneficial as a first‐line vasopressor in patients with CS with acute RVF. 37 Pulmonary vasoactivity can be modified by inodilators, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors, or nitric oxide (Table 3). When using these agents invasive blood pressure monitoring is required as they can rapidly induce hypotension.

Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy

Acute kidney injury occurs in 13% to 28% in patients with CS, and 20% will require continuous renal replacement therapy. 1, 38, 39 Continuous renal replacement therapy should be considered with stage 2 kidney injury as defined by elevated serum creatinine (≥ 2× baseline) and urine output < 0.5 mL/kg per hour for ≥ 12 hours; or when life‐threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid‐base balance precipitates the need for dialysis. 40

### Right ventricular failure in septic shock: characterization, incidence and impact on fluid responsiveness [^116nHD1m]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main results

RV failure was frequent (42% of cases) when defined by the association of RV dilatation (RV/LV EDA ≥ 0.6) with systemic congestion (CVP ≥ 8 mmHg). RV size modified the response to a reversible fluid challenge (PLR), as higher RV dilatation was associated with less likelihood of fluid responsiveness for a given PPV. TAPSE was also not accurate enough to detect RV failure since overlap was observed between the 3 groups and around 60% of patients with RV failure had normal values.

Definition of RV failure

The current definition is only physiologically based and has no clear cutoff values for RV size and CVP, CVP being used here as a surrogate of systemic congestion. Indeed, RV failure is now recognized as a state where the right ventricle is substantially dilated and associated with systemic congestion. In our study, 43.3% (52/120) of patients considered to show RV failure had an RV/LV EDA ratio greater than or equal to 0.8, which was recently shown to be a strong indicator of RV failure. Applying a cutoff of 8 mmHg for CVP is supported by a clinical study reporting a worse outcome when CVP is above this value. Besides, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign does not recommend more fluid expansion in patients with persistent shock when CVP is higher than 8 mmHg. Finally, Mullens et al. reported that among patients with advanced decompensated heart failure, those with higher CVP at admission or who did not achieve a CVP < 8 mmHg after treatment were more likely to develop worsening of renal failure by venous congestion. Interestingly, we did not find a correlation between CVP and RV size in patients without RV failure (groups 1 and 2), which is to be expected as CVP is known not to reflect RV filling in normal conditions and a normal right ventricle works under its stressed volume. However, we found a correlation in patients with RV failure, which probably reflects that the right ventricle is stressed.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis and initial management of acute right ventricular failure during pregnancy using point-of-care ultrasound [^113xcafd]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute right ventricular failure is a critical condition in pregnancy that can lead to severe maternal and fetal complications. This expert review discusses the instrumental role of point-of-care ultrasound in diagnosing and managing ARVF in pregnant patients, highlighting its benefits for immediate clinical decision-making in obstetric emergencies. The unique physiological changes during pregnancy, such as increased blood volume and cardiac output, can exacerbate underlying or latent cardiac issues, making pregnant patients particularly susceptible to acute right ventricular failure. Common causes during pregnancy include pulmonary embolism, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart diseases, each presenting distinct challenges in diagnosis and management. The real-time capability of point-of-care ultrasound allows for the immediate assessment of right ventricular size and function, evaluation of fluid status via the inferior vena cava, and identification of potential pulmonary embolism, offering a non-invasive, rapid, and dynamic diagnostic tool right at the bedside. The expert review details specific point-of-care ultrasound techniques adapted for pregnant patients, including the parasternal long and short axis and apical 4-chamber view, essential for evaluating right heart function and guiding acute management strategies. These include fluid management, adjustment of pharmacological treatment, and immediate interventions to support cardiac function and reduce ventricular overload. Point-of-care ultrasound enhances clinical outcomes by allowing clinicians to make informed decisions quickly, reducing the time to intervention, and tailoring management strategies to individual patient needs. However, despite its apparent advantages, the adoption of point-of-care ultrasound requires specialized training and familiarity with obstetric-specific protocols. This review advocates for the integration of point-of-care ultrasound into standard obstetric care protocols, emphasizing the need for clear guidelines and structured protocols that equip healthcare providers with the skills necessary to utilize this technology effectively. Future research should aim to refine these protocols and expand the evidence base to solidify the role of point-of-care ultrasound in improving maternal and fetal outcomes in acute right ventricular failure.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115aa1Qs]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of right heart failure (RHF) — acute RHF mechanisms and ventricular interdependence are detailed as follows: ARHF can occur because of abruptly increased right ventricular (RV) afterload (pulmonary embolus, hypoxia, acidemia) or decreased RV contractility (RV ischemia, myocarditis, postcardiotomy shock); in a healthy individual, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is < 1/10th of the systemic vascular resistance, and an acute increase in RV afterload such as from a large pulmonary embolism (PE) may abruptly decrease RV stroke volume (SV) with minimal increase in RV systolic pressure; acute reductions in RV contractility may be caused by direct myocardial injury such as myocardial inflammation (myocarditis) and ischemia; reduced RV SV results in RV dilatation that promotes tricuspid regurgitation (TR), exacerbates RV dilation, and drives a ventricular‑interdependent effect on left ventricular (LV) filling; ventricular interdependence is defined as forces transmitted through the myocardium and pericardium, and mechanical flattening with leftward septal shift increases LV end‑diastolic pressure, reduces LV transmural filling pressure, and impedes LV diastolic filling, contributing to systemic hypoperfusion; diastolic interaction is described as ventricular competition for diastolic distension/filling within an acutely confined pericardial space, whereas systolic interactions exist because it is estimated that 20% to 40% of RV systolic pressure results from LV contraction; elevated right‑sided filling pressures cause coronary sinus congestion, reducing coronary blood flow and provoking RV ischemia.

### Management and outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with sepsis [^11676xzL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This was a retrospective study characterizing patients with PAH who presented with sepsis compared to propensity weighted controls without PAH. Patients with underlying PAH had high mortality, received lower volume of fluids during initial resuscitation, and had higher rates of vasopressor use compared to controls. Among PAH patients, those who received fluid resuscitation had improved mortality and shorter time to antibiotics. These findings reflect the challenges around early fluid resuscitation in PAH patients presenting with sepsis, weighing the risks of precipitating RV decompensation against under-resuscitation. Individualized assessment around fluid administration and dynamic hemodynamic evaluation is warranted. These findings also suggest that early identification of sepsis in these patients is critical in shortening time to antibiotics. Further research is needed to help guide decision-making around early fluid management in patients with PAH presenting with sepsis.

### Intensive care unit management of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure [^117Siq7d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Despite advances in medical therapies, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality. Although the right ventricle (RV) can adapt to an increase in afterload, progression of the pulmonary vasculopathy that characterizes PAH causes many patients to develop progressive right ventricular failure. Furthermore, acute right ventricular decompensation may develop from disorders that lead to either an acute increase in cardiac demand, such as sepsis, or to an increase in ventricular afterload, including interruptions in medical therapy, arrhythmia, or pulmonary embolism. The poor reserve of the right ventricle, RV ischemia, and adverse right ventricular influence on left ventricular filling may lead to a global reduction in oxygen delivery and multiorgan failure. There is a paucity of data to guide clinicians caring for acute right heart failure in PAH. Treatment recommendations are frequently based on animal models of acute right heart failure or case series in humans with other causes of pulmonary hypertension. Successful treatment often requires that invasive hemodynamics be used to monitor the effect of strategies that are based primarily on biological plausibility. Herein we have developed an approach based on the current understanding of RV failure in PAH and have attempted to develop a treatment paradigm based on physiological principles and available evidence.

Acute right-sided heart failure (ARHF) — clinical features are characterized by acute RV dilatation with ventricular interdependence limiting LV filling, reduced RV forward flow, and elevated systemic venous pressure; patients typically show signs of hypoperfusion and hypotension (diaphoresis, listlessness, cyanosis, cool extremities, hypoperfusion, and tachycardia), and pulmonary edema is not consistent with isolated ARHF but suggests ARHF combined with or secondary to left-sided heart failure (LHF).

Physiology of the right ventricle — normal RV function is governed by systemic venous return, pulmonary artery (PA) load (RV afterload), pericardial compliance, and native contractility of the RV free wall and interventricular septum; generating RV output requires one sixth the energy expenditure of the LV because much of RV stroke work maintains forward momentum of blood flow into a highly compliant, low-resistance pulmonary circulation.

Afterload reduction — management priorities include correcting reversible causes of elevated PVR such as hypoxia and acidosis; by relaxing vascular tone, vasodilators decrease systolic stress, enabling more effective systolic contraction; nonselective vasodilators including intravenous nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside decrease both PVR and systemic vascular resistance, augmenting RV and LV SV and facilitating decoupling of the pulmonary and systemic circulations; conceptually, vasodilator therapy may relieve renal venous congestion and augment renal perfusion, although this strategy has not had positive results in acute HF with cardiorenal disease; both nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside have short half-lives, and partially selective pulmonary vasodilators provide another option to decrease PVR to improve RV SV.

Postoperative left ventricular dysfunction — In patients undergoing lung transplantation for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), lung transplantation transiently resets the PVR to physiologic conditions, increasing LV filling and cardiac output, but the untrained LV may not handle the sudden volume load, leading to temporary LV failure and pulmonary edema. There is a chronological distinction in which PGD occurs within the first 24 hours after lung transplantation, whereas temporary LV failure occurs later during weaning from mechanical respiratory support as positive pressure is reduced. Management includes optimization of fluid balance, inotropic support, hemodynamic stability, and avoiding rapid LV loading while the LV adapts to new physiologic conditions.

### A fluid challenge test for the diagnosis of occult heart failure [^113QYFEq]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

A right heart catheterization with measurements of pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) may be necessary for the diagnosis of left heart failure as a cause of pulmonary hypertension or unexplained dyspnea. Diagnostic cutoff values are a PAWP of ≥ 15 mm Hg at rest or a PAWP of ≥ 25 mm Hg during exercise. However, accurate measurement of PAWP can be challenging and heart failure may be occult. Left heart catheterization, with measurement of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, may also be indecisive. Measurements are then best repeated in stress conditions. Exercise is an option, but the equipment is not universally available, and interpretation can be difficult in patients with wide respiratory pressure swings. An alternative is offered by a fluid challenge. Studies have gathered data supporting infusion of 500 mL or 7 mL/kg saline and a PAWP of 18 mm Hg as a diagnostic cutoff. The procedure is simple and does not take much catheterization laboratory time. Combining echocardiography with invasive measurements may increase the diagnostic accuracy of diastolic dysfunction. Cardiac output after a fluid challenge may be of prognostic relevance.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115CG8Mp]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Diuretics and sodium/fluid restriction in chronic right heart failure (CRHF) — Diuretics remain the mainstay of therapy to treat congestion in CRHF, but because patients with RHF can have normal or low LV filling pressures, clinical monitoring is necessary to prevent prerenal azotemia and worsening renal function; patients with CRHF frequently require large diuretic doses, combination therapy including loop diuretics with thiazides may be helpful to augment natriuresis via sequential nephron blockade, and compared with furosemide, torsemide has more consistent absorption during decompensation and may be a preferred loop diuretic in CRHF. According to the AHA/American College of Cardiology HF practice guidelines, sodium restriction is considered reasonable for patients with symptomatic HF to reduce symptoms of congestion, clinicians should consider some degree (ie, < 3 g/d) of sodium restriction in patients with symptomatic CRHF, and fluid restriction (1.5–2 L/d) is considered reasonable in patients with refractory congestion and hyponatremia.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113R1fwi]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The fluid challenge is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of fluid responsiveness. The objective of this study was to describe the fluid challenge techniques reported in fluid responsiveness studies and to assess the difference in the proportion of 'responders', (PR) depending on the type of fluid, volume, duration of infusion and timing of assessment.

Methods

Searches of MEDLINE and Embase were performed for studies using the fluid challenge as a test of cardiac preload with a description of the technique, a reported definition of fluid responsiveness and PR. The primary outcome was the mean PR, depending on volume of fluid, type of fluids, rate of infusion and time of assessment.

Results

A total of 85 studies (3601 patients) were included in the analysis. The PR were 54.4% (95% CI 46.9–62.7) where < 500 mL was administered, 57.2% (95% CI 52.9–61.0) where 500 mL was administered and 60.5% (95% CI 35.9–79.2) where > 500 mL was administered (p = 0.71). The PR was not affected by type of fluid. The PR was similar among patients administered a fluid challenge for < 15 minutes (59.2%, 95% CI 54.2–64.1) and for 15–30 minutes (57.7%, 95% CI 52.4–62.4, p = 1). Where the infusion time was ≥ 30 minutes, there was a lower PR of 49.9% (95% CI 45.6–54, p = 0.04). Response was assessed at the end of fluid challenge, between 1 and 10 minutes, and > 10 minutes after the fluid challenge. The proportions of responders were 53.9%, 57.7% and 52.3%, respectively (p = 0.47).

Conclusions

The PR decreases with a long infusion time. A standard technique for fluid challenge is desirable.

Postoperative considerations in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) note that most perioperative complications and death occur within the first 48 to 72 hours, so frequent serial evaluations should be performed, and basic measures to prevent right ventricular failure (RVF) include optimal pain control and respiratory management, maintaining adequate systemic perfusion pressure to preserve coronary perfusion, early identification and treatment of postoperative complications (infection/sepsis, bleeding, arrhythmia, PE), avoiding excessive fluid administration that can overload the RV, and selective use of pulmonary vasodilator therapies to minimize RV afterload when appropriate for the type of PH.

### Acute right ventricular failure: pathophysiology, aetiology, assessment, and management [^1148MCZv]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute right ventricular failure is a complex and rapidly progressive clinical syndrome, whereby the right ventricle fails to provide adequate left ventricular preload, dilates, and causes systemic venous congestion. Previous research in acute heart failure has primarily focused on the left ventricle. Yet, the need for a better understanding of right ventricular anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, as well as of the diagnosis and management of its acute failure is crucial. Diagnosis mandates a high degree of clinical suspicion, as the majority of signs and symptoms are nonspecific. An accurate and prompt identification of the underlying causes, including pulmonary embolism, right ventricular myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, post-cardiac surgery, and decompensated chronic pulmonary hypertension, is therefore essential. This review provides insights into right ventricular anatomy and functioning and discusses the pathophysiology of acute right ventricular failure, its differential aetiologies, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment.

Postoperative monitoring and fluid targets in pulmonary hypertension (PH) and/or right ventricular failure (RVF) include that frequent postoperative evaluations should be performed to promptly identify and treat triggers of acute decompensation, and intermediate-to-high perioperative risk patients warrant being monitored initially in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 24 to 72 hours, while low-risk stable patients may require several hours of monitoring in the post-anesthesia care unit. Patients on infused parenteral therapy should be monitored in a location staffed by providers and nurses experienced with these complex medications; the duration of postoperative invasive hemodynamic monitoring must be individualized; and fluid management aims to maintain near baseline preoperative values with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 to 12 mm Hg as an acceptable target for most patients.

Accordingly, "optimization of volume status after surgery is a key issue to monitor and address postoperatively"; although "The optimal CVP range to maintain adequate but not excessive preload has not been determined", for most spontaneously breathing patients "a CVP goal between 5 and 12 mm Hg is reasonable".

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115JnrPX]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) decompensation and chronic remodeling — Declining pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in the setting of high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is an ominous clinical finding; with an intact pericardium, right ventricular (RV) dilation compresses the left ventricular (LV) cavity, impeding LV filling and equalizing biventricular diastolic pressures, and although patients with chronic right heart failure (CRHF) may require higher RV end-diastolic pressure, reduced LV filling is more likely caused by RV dilation and ventricular interdependence than reduced RV forward output; increased transmural pressure from RV dilation with pericardial constraint impairs LV filling, and the combination of RV systolic and biventricular diastolic dysfunction reduces cardiac output, impairs coronary blood flow, and exacerbates peripheral and abdominal congestion; venous congestion also negatively affects hepatic and renal function; CRHF most commonly results from gradual increases in RV afterload caused by pulmonary hypertension (PH) most frequently from left HF, although chronic volume overload from right-sided lesions such as tricuspid regurgitation can also lead to its development; if the load persists, the RV transitions to a decompensated phenotype characterized by myocyte loss and replacement/fibrosis.

Management of acute decompensated RV failure (ADRVF) — many postoperative factors can lead to ADRVF requiring vasopressors and/or inotropes, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring can help guide selection. Norepinephrine has an advantage over phenylephrine as it increases cardiac output and afterload to help RV perfusion, and in vitro evidence suggests vasopressin may increase systemic vascular resistance (SVR) without increasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR); for patients with PH and RV failure, we recommend first line treatment of hypotension with norepinephrine or vasopressin. Dobutamine is generally recommended as the inotrope of choice in PAH and right heart failure, whereas epinephrine is typically reserved for severe RV dysfunction and refractory hypotension. Inotrope-induced arrhythmias are poorly tolerated and may require amiodarone or electrical cardioversion; inodilators (milrinone or levosimendan) improve cardiac output at the expense of decreased SVR, often requiring a pressor, and should be used with caution in WHO Group 1 PAH.

### Contemporary management of acute right ventricular failure: a statement from the heart failure association and the working group on pulmonary circulation and right ventricular function of the European Society of Cardiology [^117L2rJz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Acute right ventricular (RV) failure is a complex clinical syndrome that results from many causes. Research efforts have disproportionately focused on the failing left ventricle, but recently the need has been recognized to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of RV anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, and of management approaches. Right ventricular mechanics and function are altered in the setting of either pressure overload or volume overload. Failure may also result from a primary reduction of myocardial contractility owing to ischaemia, cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmia. Dysfunction leads to impaired RV filling and increased right atrial pressures. As dysfunction progresses to overt RV failure, the RV chamber becomes more spherical and tricuspid regurgitation is aggravated, a cascade leading to increasing venous congestion. Ventricular interdependence results in impaired left ventricular filling, a decrease in left ventricular stroke volume, and ultimately low cardiac output and cardiogenic shock. Identification and treatment of the underlying cause of RV failure, such as acute pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute decompensation of chronic pulmonary hypertension, RV infarction, or arrhythmia, is the primary management strategy. Judicious fluid management, use of inotropes and vasopressors, assist devices, and a strategy focusing on RV protection for mechanical ventilation if required all play a role in the clinical care of these patients. Future research should aim to address the remaining areas of uncertainty which result from the complexity of RV haemodynamics and lack of conclusive evidence regarding RV-specific treatment approaches.

Postcardiotomy ARVF

Postcardiotomy ARVF occurs in up to 10% to 20% of high-risk surgical populations, and it is accompanied by high mortality in the severe forms. It results from a complex interplay of pathophysiological mechanisms, and key contributing factors include ischemia-reperfusion injury to the RV, acute pressure overload from residual PH, and volume overload secondary to fluid shifts during cardiopulmonary bypass. The management includes optimization of RV preload and afterload, mostly guided by PAC, with cautious diuresis and pulmonary vasodilators (especially inhaled NO) as the most commonly adopted agents to avoid RV pressure and volume overload. Also, inotropic agents like epinephrine, dobutamine, or milrinone are often needed to improve RV contractility when signs of low CO are evident. MCS devices like centrifugal-flow pumps or ECMO can be necessary for patients with refractory shock.

### The right ventricle: interaction with the pulmonary circulation [^117M2brc]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

RV function is not considered important for overall cardiovascular homeostasis until it is. Its primary role is to sustain an effective cardiac output by minimizing the impedance to systemic venous return to the heart while also not limiting LV filling. The right ventricle accomplishes this by keeping right atrial pressure as low as possible and having it not vary as venous return rate varies widely. To the extent that right atrial pressure increases, as may occur during fluid resuscitation, the use of mechanical ventilation, or disease, then maximal cardiac output responses to increased demand will be limited. In the extreme this will result in cardiogenic shock. The key factor regulating RV performance is pulmonary arterial impedance quantified by either pulmonary arterial pressure or pulmonary Ea. In cases where pulmonary arterial pressure increases acutely, causing acute cor pulmonale, the primary treatments are to increase systemic arterial pressure enough to sustain right coronary blood flow while attempting to revise the causes of increased pulmonary arterial pressure. In the setting of chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension, pharmacologic vasodilator therapy to prevent systemic hypotension and close fluid management to prevent both RV under- and overfilling are necessary. Central to the clinical assessment and management of RV failure are dynamic measures of right atrial pressure changes and bedside echocardiography, although other imaging methods may be useful in selected patients.

### Right ventricular failure in septic shock: characterization, incidence and impact on fluid responsiveness [^111y4pet]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We report in a large population of ventilated septic shock patients that when RV failure is defined using critical care echocardiography (RV/LV EDA ≥ 0.6) and a surrogate of venous congestion (CVP ≥ 8 mmHg), it was frequently observed (42%) with a negative effect on the response to a fluid challenge even in the case of significant PPV. TAPSE was unable to differentiate between patients with or without RV failure. Future studies should validate our results and our definition of RV failure in a larger population in order to improve hemodynamic management in these critically ill patients.

Intraoperative considerations in pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients emphasize that the overarching goals in PH patients receiving anesthesia are to support right ventricular (RV) function by maintaining adequate preload and preventing increases in RV afterload or reduced contractility that may precipitate acute right ventricular failure (RVF). One of the most important fundamental goals is to avoid systemic arterial hypotension that can promote RV ischemia in the setting of a pressure and volume overloaded RV with altered right coronary artery perfusion. Regardless of anesthetic technique and agents, appropriate use of supplemental oxygen (a potent pulmonary vasodilator) should be used to avoid hypoxemia, intravenous lines and syringes must be meticulously deaired to prevent even small amounts of air embolism, and warming blankets, heat and moisture exchangers in the breathing circuit, and warmed IV fluids can help prevent hypothermia which can inhibit physiologic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and ventilation-perfusion mismatching. Additionally, if significant postoperative pain is anticipated, consideration should be given to insertion of an epidural catheter for postoperative analgesia administration to mitigate the deleterious effects of systemic opioid use.

Symptomatic RVF (stage C) is usually managed pharmacologically, whereas refractory RVF (stage D) often requires specialized interventional or surgical measures; preventive measures may be applied at any of the different stages of RVF, and decompensation may occur at any stage.

Ventricular interdependence in right-sided heart failure — Pathological increases in right ventricular (RV) filling pressures are transmitted to the interventricular septum, and pericardial constraint produces a leftward septal shift that alters left ventricular (LV) geometry; these changes contribute to reduced cardiac output by decreasing LV distensibility, preload, and ventricular elastance and adversely affecting LV diastolic filling, while elevated RV end-diastolic pressure with pericardial constraint distorts ventricular geometry and impairs RV contractile function.

Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (PH-LHD) — diagnostic approach emphasizes suspicion via a stepwise assessment that combines clinical presentation, echocardiography, electrocardiography (ECG), and other imaging, noting that no single variable differentiates PH-LHD from pre-capillary PH and that multiple risk factors and findings should raise suspicion. PH should be suspected with otherwise unexplained symptoms, signs of right heart failure, and co-morbidities such as sleep apnoea syndrome, COPD, previous pulmonary embolism (PE) and risk factors for PAH. The roles of fluid loading and exercise testing to uncover PH-LHD in HF-PEF are currently not standardized with normal values lacking for a clear recommendation, and it has been suggested that patients diagnosed with PAH may show an abnormal increase in PAWP after fluid loading.

Advanced right ventricular failure (RVF) in pulmonary hypertension — intensive care unit (ICU) care emphasizes specialized management, monitoring thresholds, and avoidance of intubation. In a series from France, the mortality among PAH patients admitted to the ICU was 41%, and PAH patients requiring ICU treatment should be managed at specialized centres whenever possible. Basic monitoring includes vital signs, urine output, central venous pressure, central venous O2 saturation, and blood lactate, and the combination of a low central venous O2 saturation (< 60%) with rising lactate and low or absent urine production signals imminent right heart failure. Core ICU measures include treating triggers, optimizing fluid balance, reducing RV afterload, improving CO with inotropes — dobutamine being the preferred inotrope to treat RV failure — and maintaining systemic blood pressure with vasopressors, while intubation should be avoided in patients with RV failure as it frequently results in haemodynamic collapse.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of right ventricular failure: a state of the art review of mechanical support devices [^113bzijz]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The function of the right ventricle (RV) is to drive the forward flow of blood to the pulmonary system for oxygenation before returning to the left ventricle. Due to the thin myocardium of the RV, its function is easily affected by decreased preload, contractile motion abnormalities, or increased afterload. While various etiologies can lead to changes in RV structure and function, sudden changes in RV afterload can cause acute RV failure which is associated with high mortality. Early detection and diagnosis of RV failure is imperative for guiding initial medical management. Echocardiographic findings of reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (< 1.7) and RV wall motion (RV S' < 10 cm/s) are quantitatively supportive of RV systolic dysfunction. Medical management commonly involves utilizing diuretics or fluids to optimize RV preload, while correcting the underlying insult to RV function. When medical management alone is insufficient, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may be necessary. However, the utility of MCS for isolated RV failure remains poorly understood. This review outlines the differences in flow rates, effects on hemodynamics, and advantages/disadvantages of MCS devices such as intra-aortic balloon pump, Impella, centrifugal-flow right ventricular assist devices, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and includes a detailed review of the latest clinical trials and studies analyzing the effects of MCS devices in acute RV failure.

### Amniotic fluid embolism: diagnosis and management [^117J4RLM]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid embolism — hemodynamic support prioritizes right ventricular failure early, pulmonary vasodilation, careful fluid strategy, and ventilatory support, with a graded recommendation for oxygenation/ventilation plus vasoactive therapy. The initial phase consists mainly of right ventricular failure; echocardiography may show a severely dilated hypokinetic right ventricle with septal deviation. Hypoxia, acidosis, and hypercapnia should be avoided; right ventricular output may be improved with inotropes such as dobutamine and milrinone, and pulmonary vascular resistance can be decreased with sildenafil, prostacyclin, or inhaled nitric oxide; hypotension should be mainly treated with vasopressors such as norepinephrine or vasopressin. We recommend the provision of adequate oxygenation and ventilation and, when indicated by hemodynamic status, the use of vasopressors and inotropic agents in the initial management of amniotic fluid embolism; excessive fluid administration should be avoided (GRADE 1C). After an initial right ventricular phase, left ventricular failure predominates; minutes to hours later right ventricular function usually improves and left ventricular failure with cardiogenic pulmonary edema becomes prominent; in patients not intubated, noninvasive mechanical ventilation or endotracheal intubation should be considered.

Assessment of volume status

The physiological basis of providing 'optimal' filling in cardiogenic shock is that a critical decrease in intravascular-stressed volume reduces the difference between mean systemic venous and right atrial pressure, thereby limiting stroke volume. Although frequently used, invasive static pressure monitoring is not helpful for determining whether an individual patient is volume-responsive. Static echocardiographic parameters are widely used to predict volume responsiveness in critically ill patients (FIG. 4); however, their use requires that a number of strict criteria (relating to the patient, their underlying pathology, and medical interventions) are met, otherwise the investigation becomes invalid (see Supplementary information S3 (table)). Similarly, although thought to be superior, dynamic echocardiographic parameters to predict volume responsiveness are valid only in fully mechanically ventilated patients in sinus rhythm and without chronic heart disease. In the presence of cardiac disease (either left-sided and/or right-sided), these measurements can be misleading and should not be used. Conversely, tolerance to volume loading among different patients is variable. The conventional teaching to increase volume in RV failure has not been upheld by findings published in the past 3 years. Physiological models suggest that in some patients, progressive fluid loading leads to a plateauing of cardiac output, with a progressive increase in pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. In addition, higher volume is associated with worse outcome in critically ill patients –.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113MzBqr]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) and right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) — definitions and clinical scope are delineated as follows: RVD, defined as evidence of abnormal right ventricle (RV) structure or function, is associated with poor clinical outcomes independently of the underlying mechanism of disease across the spectrum of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF), after cardiac surgery, acute myocardial infarction (MI), congenital heart disease (CHD), and pulmonary hypertension (PH). To distinguish RHF from structural RVD, RHF is defined as a clinical syndrome with signs and symptoms of HF resulting from RVD, and RHF is caused by the inability of the RV to support optimal circulation in the presence of adequate preload. The statement provides evidence-based guidance on pathophysiology of RVD, assessment and evaluation of RV function, epidemiology and prognosis of RHF, and medical and surgical management of acute and chronic RHF, and proposes areas for future investigation.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113HvVPK]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The diverse causes of right-sided heart failure (RHF) include, among others, primary cardiomyopathies with right ventricular (RV) involvement, RV ischemia and infarction, volume loading caused by cardiac lesions associated with congenital heart disease and valvular pathologies, and pressure loading resulting from pulmonic stenosis or pulmonary hypertension from a variety of causes, including left-sided heart disease. Progressive RV dysfunction in these disease states is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide guidance on the assessment and management of RHF.

Methods

The writing group used systematic literature reviews, published translational and clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion/statements to summarize existing evidence and to identify areas of inadequacy requiring future research. The panel reviewed the most relevant adult medical literature excluding routine laboratory tests using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through September 2017. The document is organized and classified according to the American Heart Association to provide specific suggestions, considerations, or reference to contemporary clinical practice recommendations.

Results

Chronic RHF is associated with decreased exercise tolerance, poor functional capacity, decreased cardiac output and progressive end-organ damage (caused by a combination of end-organ venous congestion and underperfusion), and cachexia resulting from poor absorption of nutrients, as well as a systemic proinflammatory state. It is the principal cause of death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Similarly, acute RHF is associated with hemodynamic instability and is the primary cause of death in patients presenting with massive pulmonary embolism, RV myocardial infarction, and postcardiotomy shock associated with cardiac surgery. Functional assessment of the right side of the heart can be hindered by its complex geometry. Multiple hemodynamic and biochemical markers are associated with worsening RHF and can serve to guide clinical assessment and therapeutic decision making. Pharmacological and mechanical interventions targeting isolated acute and chronic RHF have not been well investigated. Specific therapies promoting stabilization and recovery of RV function are lacking.

Conclusions

RHF is a complex syndrome including diverse causes, pathways, and pathological processes. In this scientific statement, we review the causes and epidemiology of RV dysfunction and the pathophysiology of acute and chronic RHF and provide guidance for the management of the associated conditions leading to and caused by RHF.

### Pharmacological management of fluid overload [^11172Z4g]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment practice for the hypotensive patient with poor tissue perfusion is rapid volume resuscitation; in some scenarios, such as septic shock, this is performed with targeted goal-directed endpoints within 6 h of presentation. As a result, patients often develop significant positive fluid accumulation, which has been associated with poor outcomes above certain thresholds.

Methods

The aim of the current paper is to provide guidance for active pharmacological fluid management in the patient with, or at risk for, clinically significant positive fluid balance from either resuscitation for hypovolaemic shock or acute decompensated heart failure.

Results

We develop rationale for pharmacological fluid management targets (prevention of worsening fluid accumulation, achievement of slow vs rapid net negative fluid balance) in the context of phases of critical illness provided in the earlier Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 12 papers.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yeJSa]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous fluid is one of the most commonly administered therapies for critically ill patients and is the cornerstone of haemodynamic management of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). The rationale for volume expansion is to increase the cardiac output (CO) and oxygen delivery to ultimately improve tissue oxygenation. The gold standard for assessing fluid responsiveness to guide fluid administration in critically ill patients is to perform a fluid challenge. This involves the infusion of a specific amount of intravenous fluid to assess ventricular preload reserve and subsequent systemic haemodynamic effects. The volume of fluid infused must be sufficient to increase right ventricular diastolic volume and subsequently stroke volume (SV) as described by the Frank-Starling law. Fluid responsiveness is conventionally defined as an increase of at least 10% to 15% in SV in response to a fluid challenge, which is a reflection of the limits of precision of the technology used. Patients who reach this threshold are considered 'fluid responders'. Clinical studies have demonstrated that approximately 50% of critically ill patients who are deemed to have inadequate CO are fluid responders. However, fluid responsiveness is neither a binary nor a static condition, because it depends on dynamic interaction between intravascular volume, vascular tone and ventricular function. Furthermore, fluid responsiveness may also depend on the particularities of the fluid challenge, including the type and volume of fluid as well as the administration rate.

Administration of a fluid challenge is not a standardised technique, with varying volumes, infusion rates, fluid types and durations of response. The use of different methods to estimate SV is a further confounder. Whilst different clinical conditions may require different fluid challenge techniques, there is heterogeneity in practice for the same clinical condition.

We hypothesise that the technique of fluid challenge affects fluid responsiveness. This may result in different clinical decisions. Either inadequate or excessive fluid administration has adverse clinical consequences, and a better understanding fluid administration is likely to improve patient management and outcome. The objective of this study was to describe the different fluid challenge techniques used in clinical trials by assessing fluid responsiveness and how the proportion of patients deemed 'fluid-responsive' varies according to the technique used.

### British societies guideline on the management of emergencies in implantable left ventricular assist device recipients in transplant centres [^115ePnvV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

An alternative cause of a low LVAD flow alarm is right ventricular failure, to which further fluid administration could be detrimental. The recognition of right ventricular failure will require historical review of investigations such as echocardiography and right heart catheterisation data. In the immediate setting, echocardiography is likely to be the most rapid route to diagnostic assessment. If available, invasive monitoring such as significantly elevated central venous pressure or pulmonary artery catheter data can also support diagnosis of a volume overloaded state and the subsequent avoidance of intravenous fluid administration.

The low flow alarm can also be activated in response to an excessive LVAD afterload. If the peripheral or invasive MAP > 90 mHg and alternative causes of low flow above are assessed and excluded, antihypertensive medication should be administered such as intravenous hydralazine, sodium nitroprusside or glyceryl trinitrate.

A rarer cause of low flow is a restriction to blood flow within the LVAD blood path, e.g. thrombus or a partially occluded LVAD inflow/outflow. It is managed in a similar manner to pump thrombosis which impinges between the impeller and pump housing resulting in a refractory LVAD power increase. A low flow alarm may also occur because of torsion, compression or kinking of the LVAD outflow graft. This requires surgical correction.

Arrhythmias can also trigger low flow alarms, either through left ventricular preload reduction and/or left ventricular cavity obliteration (a suction event).

Ventricular arrhythmias

Although ventricular arrhythmias are associated with poor outcomes in LVAD recipients, they may be well-tolerated in the short term due to maintenance of perfusion by the LVAD. This can result in a patient retaining cerebral responsiveness despite ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). In the presence of an adequate circulation, chemical cardioversion can be attempted in VT. Patients are also likely to have implantable cardioverter defibrillators which can be used to deliver anti-tachycardia pacing. If the VT rate falls below programmed detection boundaries, then the VT zone can be reprogrammed by the pacing team to deliver this therapy.

### The acutely decompensated right ventricle: pathways for diagnosis and management [^111ynaSE]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Decompensated right ventricular (RV) failure is becoming increasingly common as the prevalence of predisposing conditions grows. Advances in diagnosis and management have granted insights into the following pathophysiologic mechanisms of RV dysfunction: impaired RV contractility, RV pressure overload, and RV volume overload. Emerging imaging modalities, such as cardiac MRI, and new therapeutic agents, such as pulmonary selective vasodilators, have expanded our options for evaluation and management, respectively. An improved understanding of pathophysiology and technologic progress provides us with new pathways in the diagnosis and hemodynamic support of these often critically ill patients.

### Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure in emergency medicine [^112noDix]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a hemodynamic condition, defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure by right-sided heart catheterization of at least 25 mm Hg at rest. It is classified into 5 general groups based on the underlying cause, with left ventricular failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being 2 of the most common causes in the United States. Although the specifics of the pathophysiology will vary with the cause, appreciating the risks of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure is critical to appropriately evaluating and resuscitating pulmonary hypertension patients in the emergency department (ED). Patients may present to the ED with complaints related to pulmonary hypertension or unrelated ones, but this condition will affect all aspects of care. Exertional dyspnea is the most common symptom attributable to pulmonary hypertension, but the latter should be considered in any ED patient with unexplained dyspnea on exertion, syncope, or signs of right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with right ventricular failure are often volume overloaded, and careful volume management is imperative, especially in the setting of hypotension. Vasopressors and inotropes, rather than fluid boluses, are often required in shock to augment cardiac output and reduce the risk of exacerbating right ventricular ischemia. Intubation should be avoided if possible, although hypoxemia and hypercapnia may also worsen right-sided heart function. Emergency physicians should appreciate the role of pulmonary vasodilators in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and recognize that patients receiving these medications may rapidly develop right ventricular failure and even death without these therapies. Patients may require interventions not readily available in the ED, such as a pulmonary artery catheter, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, and mechanical support with a right ventricular assist device or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Therefore, early consultation with a pulmonary hypertension specialist and transfer to a tertiary care center with invasive monitoring and mechanical support capabilities is advised.

### Right ventricular failure in septic shock: characterization, incidence and impact on fluid responsiveness [^117J7P8G]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the last decade, a few studies have highlighted the crucial role of right ventricular (RV) function in hemodynamic and respiratory diseases in critical care. However, RV failure is difficult to define in the critical care setting. A recent consensual definition proposed by different groups of experts characterizes RV failure as the association of a "significant" RV dilatation associated with systemic congestion. This definition is mainly physiologically based, not strictly validated, and the experts did not propose any threshold for RV size or congestion using critical care echocardiography (CCE) and central venous pressure (CVP), respectively.

Fluid management in septic shock is crucial for prognosis, as fluid overload and high CVP are associated with a worse outcome. It has been suggested that pulse pressure variations (PPV) could be observed despite altered fluid responsiveness due to RV failure, though this is still questionable. Septic shock is expected to impair RV function through the development of septic cardiomyopathy, but the incidence of RV failure is unknown.

In a large series of patients with septic shock, our goals were then to report the distribution of RV size and CVP, to determine the incidence of RV failure and its impact on fluid responsiveness.

Pregnancy and delivery in pulmonary hypertension (PH) — peripartum anesthesia, monitoring, and postpartum care — should prioritize continuous monitoring and right ventricular (RV)–supportive management. Continuous monitoring of ECG, pulse oximetry, CVP and intraarterial blood pressure is recommended, the use of PAC during delivery is not considered mandatory with CVP plus echocardiography as an alternative, and patients should be kept euvolemic with judicious IV fluids; inotropes and vasopressors may be required and should be available at the bedside, and in significant RV dysfunction the team may consider use of ECMO. Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) should be optimized pre-delivery; prostacyclins, calcium channel blockers, and PDE5Is are the only medications generally considered safe in pregnancy, prostacyclin therapy is indicated for significant RV dysfunction, and inhaled and/or parenteral prostacyclins should be available at delivery. The post-partum period warrants ICU monitoring for at least 48 hours with a net negative daily fluid balance, and routine obstetric care including prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended.

Right ventricular dysfunction is an important component of the pathophysiology of several disorders commonly encountered in the emergency department (ED). Interventions often performed routinely early in the ED course such as fluid administration and endotracheal intubation have the potential to cause precipitous clinical deterioration in patients with right ventricular failure and pulmonary hypertension. It is important for emergency physicians to understand the pathophysiology of acute decompensated right ventricular failure in order to avoid common pitfalls in diagnosis and management that can result in significant morbidity and mortality.

### Management and outcomes in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients with sepsis [^1164V9UN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and right heart failure. Sepsis is the second most common cause of in-hospital death in PAH patients. Recent data suggests that about 25% of patients with PAH who present for sepsis will die while in the hospital. Prompt recognition and treatment of sepsis is vital in the management of this high-risk condition.

Sepsis causes numerous systemic changes with adverse effects on the cardiac and pulmonary systems. These changes include decreased right ventricular preload, increased right ventricular afterload, and reduced contractility, all in the setting of increased myocardial oxygen demand. Each of these factors are further exacerbated in patients with PAH, with unique implications for management. Current management of sepsis in PAH patients is based on expert opinion rather than clinical data, and includes treating the underlying etiology, optimizing preload, reducing right ventricular afterload, and supporting myocardial function to achieve adequate systemic perfusion. Decisions around fluid management are particularly challenging in PAH patients with sepsis. Fluid resuscitation is recommended as part of initial resuscitation to restore preload in septic patients. However, differentiating sepsis from other causes of acute on chronic right ventricular dysfunction is challenging given the often non-specific signs in early sepsis in patients with PAH. Furthermore, administering fluids to increase preload risks worsening right ventricular dilatation, ventricular interdependence, and coronary perfusion in the setting of sepsis-induced increased PVR. This presents a major challenge in the management of sepsis in PAH patients as right ventricular volume overload can lead to impaired cardiac output, with catastrophic implications for the pulmonary and systemic circulations.

Currently, there is little data describing clinical characteristics or treatment strategies for sepsis in this acutely ill population. Current treatment recommendations for PAH patients presenting with sepsis are based on expert opinion rooted in clinical practice or the results of registry or administrative database studies with incompletely characterized cohorts, and so the recommendations are frequently vague or lack supporting data. This retrospective study investigates the treatment approaches and outcomes in a well-characterized cohort of patients with PAH verified by right heart catheterization who presented with sepsis between 2013 and 2022, with a particular focus on initial fluid resuscitation. We hypothesized that PAH patients would receive less fluids and that increased fluid resuscitation would be associated with worse outcomes.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112uJjEC]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure — hepatic involvement and prognosis are described: patients with end-stage liver disease are at risk for the developing portopulmonary hypertension, which is associated with worse outcomes after liver transplantation; isolated and markedly elevated transaminases are more commonly caused by severely reduced cardiac output/cardiogenic shock and respond better to inotropes than diuretic therapy; increased serum ammonia is also associated with adverse prognosis in decompensated heart failure.
