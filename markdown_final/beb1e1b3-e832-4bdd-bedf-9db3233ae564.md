## Question

NYHA functional class

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification in heart failure, specifically its definition, purpose, prognostic value, limitations, and practical clinical use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and classes of the NYHA system. Then, I should verify its clinical purpose and how it is used in guidelines and trials. Next, I will evaluate its prognostic value and how well it tracks with objective measures. After that, I need to scrutinize its limitations, including reproducibility and overlap. Then, I should review alternative and complementary tools, especially patient-reported outcomes and exercise testing. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical recommendations and acknowledge special populations where NYHA may be less reliable or where modified approaches are needed.

> Let me first confirm the definition and class structure. The NYHA functional classification is a clinician-assigned, ordinal scale (Classes I–IV) that describes symptom severity and activity limitation due to cardiac disease, with Class I indicating no limitation, Class II slight limitation with ordinary activity, Class III marked limitation with less-than-ordinary activity, and Class IV symptoms at rest or inability to perform any activity without discomfort. I should double-check that this is consistent across high-credibility sources, and yes, major guidelines and consensus statements align on these class descriptors and their intended use in patients with symptomatic (Stage C) or advanced (Stage D) heart failure, while recognizing the subjective nature of the assignment [^112b7rxM] [^111wFt7U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about its purpose; I need to verify how guidelines and regulators actually use NYHA. Contemporary guidelines endorse documenting NYHA class to determine candidacy for treatments and to stratify risk, and device approvals and CRT recommendations have historically referenced NYHA class thresholds, reflecting its entrenched role in practice and trials [^112b7rxM] [^114BSxts] [^112zQTnY]. But wait, what if trial entry criteria vary and undermine comparability? Indeed, trial and registry definitions often embed NYHA class alongside EF thresholds and natriuretic peptides, underscoring heterogeneity and the need to interpret NYHA-based inclusions carefully when comparing studies [^115w2sNG] [^111ymhxt].

> Next, I should review prognostic value and the relationship with objective measures. I will now examine whether NYHA tracks with outcomes and objective markers like NT-proBNP, KCCQ, 6-minute walk distance, and CPET parameters. Large analyses show NYHA class correlates with mortality and morbidity, yet there is substantial overlap in objective measures across NYHA II vs III, with 79% overlap in NT-proBNP, 63–54% in KCCQ and 6MWD, and similar overlap in CPET metrics, limiting discrimination between adjacent classes [^113xHyZ1] [^112KVEYz]. Let me verify if mild classes show even more overlap; yes, PARADIGM-HF showed AUC ~0.51 for NT-proBNP distinguishing NYHA I vs II and high kernel-density overlap, and KCCQ distributions within the same NYHA class vary widely, indicating poor granularity of NYHA in milder symptom strata [^117JhQGT] [^112KVEYz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also confirm interobserver reliability before criticizing the tool too harshly. Multiple studies document poor reproducibility: cardiologist pairs agreed in only about 54% of cases, standardized questionnaires improved concordance to roughly 60–75%, and 99% of research papers do not even specify how NYHA was assigned, all of which undermines consistency across clinicians and sites [^113bLwAn] [^115UjWwX] [^114db97g]. Hold on, I should verify if this affects prognostic inference; it does, because inconsistent assignment blurs risk boundaries and reduces the apparent gradient of risk across classes, particularly in Class II–III where clinical nuance is greatest [^113xHyZ1].

> Let me consider patient–clinician discordance, because this can systematically bias classification. Patients frequently report more severe limitations than physicians assign, with one large cohort showing 37% one-class and 12.8% two-class discordance; clinician-assigned NYHA correlates more strongly with mortality and LV dysfunction, suggesting clinicians implicitly weigh severity biomarkers when assigning class, which deviates from a purely symptom-based construct [^112a6M42]. I should double-check whether self-assessed NYHA still predicts outcomes; yes, patient-assigned NYHA has prognostic value for hospitalization and mortality, reinforcing that both perspectives matter but are not interchangeable [^117T155T].

> Next, I should review complementary and alternative tools that mitigate these limitations. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a validated, HF-specific patient-reported outcome that tracks health status and predicts mortality and hospitalization; changes in KCCQ-OS are more sensitive to clinically meaningful change than changes in NYHA class and provide incremental prognostic value over NYHA, while correlating with CPET and 6-minute walk distance [^116haMd3] [^115dnzD6] [^116F9NxH]. Wait, let me verify whether NYHA changes track outcomes as well; in contemporary cohorts, NYHA improvement was not associated with subsequent outcomes, whereas a 5-point KCCQ improvement reduced mortality by about 40%, highlighting KCCQ's superior responsiveness and prognostic granularity [^115dnzD6]. I should also note that 6-minute walk testing and CPET provide objective functional metrics and can reveal impairment not captured by symptom reports alone, and that ambulatory functional capacity (e.g., 4–7 METs) should be integrated with NYHA when assessing surgical risk [^116MRwgu] [^112EMtqP] [^1149j3X8].

> But wait, what if we treat NYHA class as dynamic rather than static? Does trajectory add prognostic value beyond a single value? Registry data show that while improvement or worsening in NYHA class over time tracks with outcomes, the prognostic signal is largely explained by the follow-up NYHA class rather than the direction of change itself, meaning repeated, contemporaneous assessments are more informative than change trajectories for risk prediction [^116DYvuT] [^117V7Euw]. I should confirm whether this holds across EF phenotypes; yes, the association between follow-up NYHA class and outcomes is consistent in HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF, supporting serial documentation at each encounter [^116DYvuT].

> I need to ensure we address special populations where NYHA may be unreliable or where modified frameworks are warranted. In end-stage renal disease, fluid status and dialysis timing profoundly alter symptom expression, making standard NYHA inadequate; proposals suggest dyspnea assessment pre- and post-ultrafiltration with echocardiography to better classify HF severity in dialysis patients [^113dK9vm]. In adults with congenital heart disease, guidelines integrate NYHA functional class into a broader anatomic–physiologic staging (ACHD-AP) to capture complexity beyond symptoms, and emerging data suggest that physiologic variables and simple functional assessments may outperform anatomic schemes for prognostication, reinforcing the need to pair NYHA with objective findings in ACHD [^1129LfsS] [^114omEHS]. Hold on, I should verify whether natriuretic peptides retain discriminative value across classes; even in NYHA I patients, elevated NT-proBNP identifies high-risk subgroups, emphasizing the role of biomarkers to unmask risk hidden by subjective class assignment [^117JhQGT].

> Next, I should review how guidelines position NYHA in the modern era. Major guidelines still recommend documenting NYHA class for treatment selection and risk stratification, but they also emphasize integrating patient-reported health status, biomarkers, and, when appropriate, exercise testing to overcome NYHA's limitations, signaling a shift toward multidimensional assessment rather than reliance on NYHA alone [^112b7rxM] [^116MRwgu] [^116haMd3]. I should double-check device criteria language; contemporary appropriate use criteria for ICD and CRT continue to use NYHA class thresholds, underscoring its regulatory and practical inertia despite recognized shortcomings [^113Uvrr3].

> Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical recommendations. I should confirm that clinicians routinely assign NYHA class at baseline and follow-up while explicitly stating the method used, because standardization improves comparability and reduces interobserver variability; consider using structured questions or brief questionnaires to enhance reliability when possible [^112b7rxM] [^115UjWwX] [^113bLwAn]. I need to ensure that NYHA is complemented by KCCQ or similar HF-specific PROs at each visit to improve sensitivity to change and prognostication, and that biomarkers such as NT-proBNP are interpreted alongside NYHA to unmask high-risk patients labeled "asymptomatic" or mildly symptomatic [^116haMd3] [^117JhQGT]. When the clinical picture is discordant or decisions hinge on functional capacity, I should add objective testing with 6-minute walk or CPET to clarify impairment and guide interventions, particularly for advanced therapies or surgical risk stratification [^116MRwgu] [^112EMtqP]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach aligns with contemporary quality frameworks; indeed, performance measures endorse routine PRO assessment to quantify symptom burden and drive therapy optimization, which complements rather than replaces NYHA class [^116S8giz].

---

The NYHA functional class is a **four-tier system** [^11157Hvm] (I–IV) that **grades symptom severity and activity limitation** in heart failure, guiding therapy selection, risk stratification, and trial eligibility [^112b7rxM] [^114db97g]. Class I: no symptoms with ordinary activity; II: slight limitation with ordinary activity; III: marked limitation with less-than-ordinary activity; IV: symptoms at rest or with any activity. It is widely used in practice and research [^111VrqjW], but has **subjective, inconsistent** [^117HzPDu] assignment and limited discrimination in mild disease, so it should be complemented by objective measures (6-minute walk, CPET, biomarkers) [^116MRwgu] and patient-reported outcomes (KCCQ) [^116haMd3] for more precise assessment and monitoring [^114db97g].

---

## NYHA functional class definitions

The NYHA class **definitions** are as follows [^117XZpJi]:

| **Class** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Class I | No limitation of physical activity; ordinary activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea [^11157Hvm]. |
| Class II | Slight limitation of physical activity; comfortable at rest, but ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea [^11157Hvm]. |
| Class III | Marked limitation of physical activity; comfortable at rest, but less-than-ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea [^11157Hvm]. |
| Class IV | Inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort; symptoms at rest or with minimal activity [^117XZpJi]. |

---

## Clinical significance and applications

The NYHA class is a **cornerstone** of HF care, with broad clinical applications:

- **Therapy selection**: Guides use of guideline-directed medical therapy, devices (CRT, ICD), and advanced therapies (LVAD, transplant) [^112b7rxM] [^112zQTnY] [^113Uvrr3].
- **Risk stratification**: Higher class independently predicts mortality, hospitalization, and disease progression [^112b7rxM] [^117K17dd].
- **Clinical trials**: Used for patient selection, stratification, and endpoint assessment in research [^114db97g] [^115w2sNG].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite widespread use, the NYHA class has **important limitations**:

- **Subjectivity**: Clinician-assigned class varies with interpretation and patient report, reducing reproducibility [^117HzPDu] [^113bLwAn].
- **Limited discrimination**: Poor differentiation in mild disease (Classes I–II), with substantial overlap in objective measures (NT-proBNP, 6-minute walk, KCCQ) [^117JhQGT] [^112EMtqP].
- **Static snapshot**: Single assessments may miss dynamic changes; trajectories matter for prognosis [^116DYvuT] [^112EcdmB].

---

## Integration with objective measures and patient-reported outcomes

To address these limitations, **objective and patient-reported measures** are increasingly integrated:

- **6-minute walk test (6MWT)**: Simple, objective, and reproducible; correlates inversely with NYHA class and improves classification consistency [^112EMtqP] [^111PESiu].
- **Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)**: Gold standard for functional capacity; informs prognosis and advanced therapy decisions [^116MRwgu] [^112KVEYz].
- **Patient-reported outcomes (PROs)**: KCCQ and MLHFQ capture symptom burden and quality of life, offering incremental prognostic value over NYHA alone [^116haMd3] [^115dnzD6].

---

## Recent developments and modifications

Recent efforts aim to **enhance NYHA utility**:

- **Standardized questionnaires**: Improve interobserver reliability and reproducibility in clinical practice and trials [^115UjWwX] [^116haMd3].
- **Digital health tools**: NLP and EHR integration enable automated extraction and tracking of NYHA class, supporting quality assessment and care coordination [^117UTLJN].
- **Complementary classifications**: Integration with ACC/AHA staging and MOGE(S) provides a more comprehensive patient profile [^116DyGMs] [^112b7rxM].

---

## Clinical implications of NYHA class changes

Changes in NYHA class over time carry **prognostic significance**: improvement is associated with reduced mortality and hospitalization, whereas worsening signals higher risk; however, the most recent class often explains risk better than the trajectory itself, underscoring the value of serial reassessment [^112EcdmB] [^117V7Euw].

---

## Special considerations

Certain populations require **cautious interpretation** of NYHA class. In older adults, comorbidities and functional decline may confound classification, necessitating careful clinical judgment [^notfound]. In patients with end-stage renal disease, fluid overload and dialysis timing complicate symptom assessment, prompting proposals for ESRD-specific functional classifications [^113dK9vm]. In pediatric heart failure, adult NYHA criteria are often adapted or supplemented with pediatric-specific tools to better reflect developmental capacity and activity patterns [^notfound].

---

The NYHA functional class remains a **practical, widely used tool** for symptom grading and decision-making in heart failure, but its subjectivity and limited discrimination in mild disease necessitate integration with objective tests and patient-reported outcomes for accurate, comprehensive care [^112b7rxM] [^116haMd3].

### Associations between clinical outcomes and a recently proposed adult congenital heart disease anatomic and physiological classification system [^114omEHS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Predicting prognosis was not the goal of the 2018 AHA/ACC ACHD guidelines or the proposed AP classification scheme; these guidelines are primarily designed to guide cardiovascular care and timing of follow‐up for patients with ACHD with a broad array of diagnoses and subsequent interventions. Decisions in that context usually focus on predicted probability of adverse events ≈3 months to ≈3 years in the future. Therefore, this near‐term and medium‐term prediction of clinical risk are most relevant when considering the value of the AP system. The PhyS system is more reflective of a patient's functional status and overall health than AnatC in isolation, which could classify a patient with ASD and Eisenmenger syndrome as simple. Although it is clear that PhyS adds predictive value beyond anatomic classification, it also intermingles variables that have broad prognostic implications (eg, functional class) with others that have follow‐up relevance for only a subset of patients (eg, aortic dimension). Prognosis is an important consideration when determining appropriate follow‐up, but so are other variables, independent of their impact on prognosis. It may be reasonable to separate those roles in future iterations of this classification scheme. That is, the decision about frequency of evaluations may change if either there was an indication of a high risk of deterioration in the near to medium term, or if there were particular clinical characteristics that may compel intervention. With this in mind, we identified other individual variables that were more strongly associated with prognosis across the range of outcomes compared with the AP classification. These included circulating biomarkers (NT‐proBNP), clinical history (prior atrial arrhythmia), and simple assessments of functional class (NYHA FC).

In the baseline model, as compared with stable NYHA class over time, an improvement in NYHA class was associated with lower all‐cause mortality, CV mortality, and risk of first HF hospitalization (adjusted HR [95% CI]: 0.70 [0.65–0.76], 0.68 [0.61–0.75] and 0.66 [0.60–0.72], respectively), whereas a worsening in NYHA class was associated with higher risk of all these outcomes (1.45 [1.34–1.56], 1.57 [1.43–1.72] and 1.51 [1.39–1.64], respectively). As a one‐time assessment, NYHA class at baseline independently predicted risk on top of NYHA class trajectories for all‐cause mortality (adjusted HR [95% CI] vs. NYHA class I: class II, 1.37 [1.23–1.53]; class III, 2.06 [1.84–2.31]; class IV, 2.69 [2.26–3.22]), CV mortality (class II, 1.45 [1.26–1.67]; class III, 2.35 [2.03–2.73]; class IV, 3.22 [2.58–4.01]), and first HF hospitalization (class II, 1.35 [1.20–1.52]; class III, 1.90 [1.67–2.16]; class IV, 2.28 [1.86–2.80]).

### Exploring symptoms in chronic heart failure [^1139xspk]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Symptoms in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are the cry for help, reflecting not only the physical aspects of the disease but the impact on lifestyle, anxiety, depression and expectations of the patient. Studies consistently show a difference in patients' self-assessed functional classification compared to investigator reported NYHA classification. Moreover, patient self-assessed symptoms have recently been shown to independently predict hospitalisation and mortality over 5 years. Recognition of symptoms and appreciation of their importance justifies the use of a structured assessment in order to provide optimal medical care for patients with CHF. A model of how to structure symptom assessment equally with signs is presented in this paper.

### Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire in cardiac function assessment of chronic kidney disease patients: a literature review [^115pPZpf]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In CKD patients, NYHA classification limitations become more pronounced. Fluid retention and electrolyte imbalances in CKD cause symptom variability, while fatigue and dyspnea may overlap with or be masked by renal dysfunction manifestations, potentially leading to misclassification or severity underestimation. In contrast, the repeatable KCCQ may better assess heart failure severity. Studies show CKD patients with lower KCCQ scores face higher heart failure hospitalization risk, highlighting KCCQ's potential value in this population.

Although direct comparisons in CKD populations are limited, several studies in patients with heart failure have demonstrated that the KCCQ provides superior prognostic value and sensitivity to clinical changes compared to the NYHA classification. For example, a ≥ 5-point improvement in KCCQ score was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality (HR = 0.84), whereas changes in NYHA class were not (HR = 0.91). Furthermore, KCCQ has shown greater sensitivity in capturing symptom fluctuations and substantially overlaps with NYHA classes, challenging the latter's ability to reflect patient quality of life. Lastly, KCCQ scores may enable clinicians to assess patients' health status with greater accuracy than the NYHA classification. Substantial overlap in KCCQ scores across NYHA classes (e.g.73.6% between II and III, 88.3% between III and IV) suggests that NYHA class alone may not fully capture differences in quality of life. Therefore, combining KCCQ with NYHA assessment may allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of heart failure severity.

In conclusion, the KCCQ shows advantages over NYHA classification in assessing symptom burden and prognosis in heart failure patients. However, combined assessment of both provides a more detailed and precise evaluation of patient health status, leading to improved assessment accuracy.

### Trajectories in New York heart association functional class in heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum: data from the Swedish heart failure registry [^116DYvuT]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

To investigate incidence, predictors and prognostic implications of longitudinal New York Heart Association (NYHA) class changes (i.e. improving or worsening vs. stable NYHA class) in heart failure (HF) across the ejection fraction (EF) spectrum.

Methods and results

From the Swedish HF Registry, 13 535 patients with EF and ≥ 2 NYHA class assessments were considered. Multivariable multinomial regressions were fitted to identify the independent predictors of NYHA change. Over a 1‐year follow‐up, 69% of patients had stable, 17% improved, and 14% worsened NYHA class. Follow‐up in specialty care predicted improving NYHA class, whereas an in‐hospital patient registration, lower EF, renal disease, lower mean arterial pressure, older age, and longer HF duration predicted worsening. The association between NYHA change and subsequent outcomes was assessed with multivariable Cox models. When adjusting for the NYHA class at baseline, improving NYHA class was independently associated with lower while worsening with higher risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, and first HF hospitalization. After adjustment for the NYHA class at follow‐up, NYHA class change did not predict morbidity/mortality. NYHA class assessment at baseline and follow‐up predicted morbidity/mortality on top of the changes. Results were consistent across the EF spectrum.

Conclusion

In a large real‐world HF population, NYHA class trajectories predicted morbidity/mortality after extensive adjustments. However, the prognostic role was entirely explained by the resulting NYHA class, i.e. the follow‐up value. Our results highlight that considering one‐time NYHA class assessment, rather than trajectories, might be the preferable approach in clinical practice and for clinical trial design.

### Clinical implications of the New York heart association classification [^113xHyZ1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification has served as a fundamental tool for risk stratification of heart failure (HF) and determines clinical trial eligibility and candidacy for drugs and devices. However, its ability to adequately stratify risk is unclear. Methods and Results To compare NYHA class with objective assessments and survival in patients with HF, we performed secondary analyses of 4 multicenter National Institutes of Health-funded HF clinical trials that included patients classified as NYHA class II or III: TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist), DIG (The Effect of Digoxin on Mortality and Morbidity in Patients With Heart Failure), HF-ACTION (Efficacy and Safety of Exercise Training in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure), and GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence-Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure). Twenty-month cumulative survival was compared between classes using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log rank test. NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores, 6-minute walk distances, left ventricular ejection fraction, and cardiopulmonary test parameters were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and percentage overlap using kernel density estimations. Cumulative mortality varied significantly across NYHA classes and HF clinical trials (likelihood ratio, P < 0.001). Mortality at 20 months for NYHA class II ranged from 7% for patients in HF-ACTION to 15% in GUIDE-IT, whereas mortality for NYHA class III ranged from 12% in TOPCAT to 26% in GUIDE-IT. There was substantial percentage overlap in values for NT-proBNP levels (79% and 69%), KCCQ scores (63% and 54%), 6-minute walk distances (63% and 54%), and left ventricular ejection fraction (88% and 83%). Similarly, there was substantial overall in values for minute ventilation-carbon dioxide production relationship (71%), maximal oxygen uptake (54%), and exercise duration (53%). Conclusions The NYHA system poorly discriminates HF patients across the spectrum of functional impairment. These findings raise important questions about the need for improved phenotyping of these patients to facilitate risk stratification and response to interventions.

KCCQ and other current assessment tools for patients with heart failure

To highlight the advantages of KCCQ in the assessment of heart failure in CKD patients, we compared it with the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and the Minnesota Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), thereby supporting its practical application in this specific population.

KCCQ and NYHA functional classification

The NYHA functional classification remains widely used for assessing heart failure severity. However, it has several limitations. This classification system lacks standardized symptom assessment and objective scoring mechanisms, primarily relying on healthcare professionals' subjective judgments based on limited clinical observations, which leads to significant assessment variability and poor reproducibility. Moreover, the boundaries between NYHA classes are ambiguous, resulting in marked overlap, for example, up to 93% of patients in NYHA I and II have similar NT-proBNP levels. Critically, the system shows limited prognostic accuracy: even among NYHA I patients, those with elevated NT-proBNP (≥ 1600 pg/mL) are at significantly increased risk of adverse events (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 3.43) compared to those with lower levels. These findings underscore that NYHA classification alone is insufficient for accurately identifying high-risk patients.

### Outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy by New York heart association class: a patient-level meta-analysis [^1113BjeX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

It is noteworthy that NYHA classification is a continuous spectrum in which each NYHA class covers different grades of HF severity. It is possible that patients with NYHA class IV symptoms in this study, who were deemed to be appropriate for enrollment in clinical trials, represent a healthier group than the average patient with NYHA class IV symptoms seen in clinical practice. This caveat should be kept in mind when interpreting our results.

The role of CRT in patients with advanced HF symptoms may be affected by several clinical factors. The extent of cardiac remodeling in patients with advanced HF symptoms may impact response to CRT. There is likely a level of remodeling (left ventricular dilatation, ejection fraction) beyond which CRT may not confer any benefit. Although data on this issue are badly needed, echocardiographic parameters were not available for examination in the current study. Also, patients with advanced HF commonly have other comorbidities. Whereas a prior studyhas suggested that CRT is beneficial in patients with several comorbidities, that study did not include an adequate number of patients with NYHA class IV symptoms. How the number, type, and severity of comorbidities affect outcomes of CRT deserves more study. In addition, many patients with advanced HF are not able to tolerate guideline‐directed target doses of medical therapies, either due to low blood pressure and/or elevated creatinine. Therefore, CRT may be especially beneficial in such patients. This, too, deserves further study.

### Associations between New York heart association classification, objective measures, and long-term prognosis in mild heart failure: a secondary analysis of the PARADIGM-HF trial [^117JhQGT]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Heart failure (HF) treatment recommendations are centered on New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, such that most apparently asymptomatic patients are not eligible for disease-modifying therapies.

Objectives

To assess within-patient variation in NYHA classification over time, the association between NYHA class and an objective measure of HF severity (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] level), and their association with long-term prognosis in the PARADIGM-HF trial.

Design, Setting, and Participants

All patients in PARADIGM-HF were in NYHA class II or higher at baseline and were treated with sacubitril-valsartan during a 6- to 10-week run-in period before randomization. Patients classified as NYHA class I, II, and III in PARADIGM-HF were compared at randomization.

Exposures

NYHA class at randomization after 6 to 10 weeks of the run-in period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was cardiovascular death or first HF hospitalization. Logistic regression models, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), kernel density estimation overlaps, and Cox proportional hazards models were used.

Results

The analysis included 8326 patients with known NYHA classification at randomization. Of 389 patients in NYHA class I, 228 (58%) changed functional class during the first year after randomization. Level of NT-proBNP was a poor discriminator of NYHA classification: for NYHA class I vs II, the AUC was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.48–0.54). For NT-proBNP level, estimated kernel density overlap was 93% between NYHA class I vs II, 79% between NYHA I vs III, and 83% between NYHA II vs III. Patients classified as NYHA III displayed a distinctively higher rate of cardiovascular events (NYHA III vs I, hazard ratio [HR], 1.84; 95% CI, 1.44–2.37; NYHA III vs II, HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.35–1.64). Patients in NYHA class I and II revealed lower event rates (NYHA II vs I, HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.97–1.58). Stratification by NT-proBNP level (< 1600 pg/mL or ≥ 1600 pg/mL) identified subgroups with distinctive risk, such that NYHA class I patients with high NT-proBNP levels (n = 175) had a numerically higher event rate than patients with low NT-proBNP levels from any NYHA class (vs I, HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 2.03–5.87; vs II, HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.58–2.86; vs III, HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.00–1.88).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, patients in NYHA class I and II overlapped substantially in objective measures and long-term prognosis. Physician-defined "asymptomatic" functional class concealed patients who were at substantial risk for adverse outcomes. NYHA classification might be limited to differentiate mild forms of HF.

### Natural language processing of clinical documentation to assess functional status in patients with heart failure [^117UTLJN]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is characterized by broad symptoms that impair patients' functional ability and adversely affect their quality of life. Clinical practice guidelines recommend regular functional status evaluations using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system, which grades HF severity based on limitations in physical activity and associated symptoms. These assessments are crucial for informing therapeutic decisions, such as selecting appropriate guideline-directed medical therapy and determining the need for primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs).

While regular functional status assessment measurements are expected to be a standard component of clinical management for patients with HF, these assessments are primarily documented in unstructured medical notes. The impact of these assessments on treatment decisions remains understudied due to persistent challenges of manually reviewing clinical records. This further impedes downstream applications of clinical assessment, such as the automated evaluation guideline-directed care quality and the scalable recruitment from the electronic health record (EHR) for clinical trials studying HF.

To address this, we developed and validated efficient, transformer-based deep learning models that use natural language processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of recorded functional status assessments within unstructured clinical notes. This study developed a scalable, artificial intelligence–driven approach that can reliably identify explicit mentions of NYHA classes and categorize relevant functional status descriptors within the vast array of unstructured text in the EHR.

ACC/AHA heart failure staging approach — progression and clinical implications are described as follows: According to this new staging approach, patients would only be expected to either not advance at all or to advance from one stage to the next, unless progression of the disease was slowed or stopped by treatment, and spontaneous reversal of this progression would be considered unusual; in a patient who has already developed the clinical syndrome of HF (Stage C), the patient could never return to Stage B (never had HF), and therapies recommended for Stage C will be appropriate even if this patient is in NYHA class I.

### Patients' self-assessed functional status in heart failure by New York heart association class: a prognostic predictor of hospitalizations, quality of life and death [^117T155T]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

C linician-assigned New York Heart Association (NYHA) class is an established predictor of outcomes in heart failure. This study aims to test whether patients' self-assessment of functional status by NYHA class predicts hospital admissions, quality of life, and mortality.

Methods and Results

This was an observational study within a randomized controlled trial. A total of 293 adult patients diagnosed with heart failure were recruited after an emergency admission at 3 acute hospitals in Norfolk, UK. Outcome measures included number of emergency admissions over 6 months, self-assessed quality of life measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ) and EQ-5D at 6 months, and deaths up to 20 months' follow-up. Patients were grouped into 3 NYHA groups (I/II, III, and IV) based on patients' self-assigned NYHA class (SA-NYHA). A Poisson model indicated an increased readmission rate associated with higher SA-NYHA class (adjusted rate ratio 1.21; 95% CI 1.04–1.41; p = 0.02). Higher SA-NYHA class at baseline predicted worse quality of life at 6 months' follow-up (P = 0.002 for MLHFQ; p = 0.047 for EQ-5D), and was associated with higher mortality rate (adjusted hazard ratio 1.84; 95% CI 1.10–3.06; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

SA-NYHA class is predictive of hospitalization, quality of life, and mortality among patients with heart failure.

### Trajectories in New York heart association functional class in heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum: data from the Swedish heart failure registry [^117V7Euw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

class trajectories and outcomes

Across the EF spectrum, our data showed that the prognostic role of NYHA class changes in terms of mortality and risk of HF hospitalization was independent of several patient characteristics including also the baseline NYHA class assessment, but not of follow‐up NYHA class. Thus, the association with prognosis was mostly explained by the resulting state of the patient, rather than the trajectory of change. For the clinician who aims to assess patients' prognosis based on reported symptoms, the implication of our results is that repeating NYHA assessment is useful to obtain the most updated view of the patient's status, but that the assessment of change across encounters adds little prognostic information.

A meaningful trial surrogate endpoint should be able to gauge the risk of hard outcomes, such as hospitalizations or death, or evaluate changes in clinical status. In HF trials, the approach to NYHA class as surrogate endpoint has varied from comparing the follow‐up value across study arms, to comparing trajectories (i.e. improvement or worsening) from each patient's baseline value. Although it is known that higher NYHA class predicts hard outcomes, our findings highlight that changes in NYHA trajectories are less prognostically relevant compared with the last known value as a surrogate for long‐term risk outcome.

It has been previously reported that an improvement in NYHA class would not predict lower mortality in patients with HFrEF, but that improvements in the KCCQ would. Also, patient‐reported outcomes might correlate to changes in clinical status with greater sensitivity than NYHA class. Greater discordance between NYHA class and patient‐derived scores might be observed in HFpEF. The complementing use of patient‐centred measures with NYHA class assessment might be a relevant approach for optimizing prognostic assessment. Consistently, in a recent analysis from the Resynchronization Reverses Remodeling in Systolic Left Ventricular Dysfunction (REVERSE) study reported that worsening of a clinical composite endpoint, combining NYHA class changes with a patient global assessment, was highly predictive of subsequent mortality.

### Development and validation of a patient questionnaire to determine New York heart association classification [^115UjWwX]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification correlates with quality of life and is useful in tracking changes in status in clinical trials. We explored methods to determine NYHA class in multicenter trials where double-blind conditions could not be maintained.

Methods and Results

A questionnaire was developed containing 7 major questions based on the standard definitions of NYHA classes. The questionnaire was administered to 116 patients with varying degrees of heart failure. When comparing NYHA determined by physicians at the site to NYHA assigned by 3 independent physician graders, there was an approximate 60% concordance. Concordance between independent reviewers was approximately 75%. Results of repeat grading of 30 randomly selected questionnaires indicated that graders provided the same score 90% of the time. Thus, although there were some differences from the site determination of NYHA class, the questionnaire had good inter- and intragrader reproducibility. In a second group of 103 patients enrolled in an ongoing device-intervention trial, we demonstrated that it is feasible to employ the questionnaire in a multicenter trial. Finally, NYHA class was correlated with quality of life and peak exercise oxygen consumption.

Conclusions

A standardized questionnaire provided an approximate 60% concordance in assigning NYHA classification compared to the site assessment with approximately 90% reproducibility. This approach may be useful to determine NYHA classification within the context of clinical trials where blinded conditions are not possible.

New York Heart Association (NYHA) class — NYHA class as reported by a healthcare provider includes permissible values None, Class I, Class II, Class III, and Class IV. Class I is patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of physical activity, where ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea. Class II is patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity; patients are comfortable at rest; ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea. Class III is patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity; patients are comfortable at rest; less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea. Class IV is patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, with symptoms present even at minimal exertion.

### The Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire in relation to New York heart association class [^117AwVfL]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A primary goal in treating patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is to improve their symptoms, function, and quality of life. This requires that clinicians accurately assess patient's health status, which is most often quantified by the clinician-assigned New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification. Despite clinicians' familiarity with NYHA classes, it is known that there is marked interobserver variability between them.

In contrast, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) directly measures patients' health status more reproducibly, sensitively, and prognostically than the NYHA classes. The KCCQ-23 is increasingly used as an endpoint in clinical trials and in the routine care of patients with HCM to assess treatment response. However, a barrier to more widespread use may be clinicians' unfamiliarity with how to interpret KCCQ-23 scores. To address this gap, we investigated the relationship between the NYHA and the KCCQ-23 scores, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally in symptomatic patients with oHCM.

### The 'surprise question' in heart failure: a prospective cohort study [^114M5j2s]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Objective

The Surprise Question (SQ) is a prognostic screening tool used to identify patients with limited life expectancy. We assessed the SQ's performance predicting 1-year mortality among patients in ambulatory heart failure (HF) clinics. We determined that the SQ's performance changes according to sex and other demographic (age) and clinical characteristics, mainly left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classifications.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study in two HF clinics. To assess the performance of the SQ in predicting 1-year mortality, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and the positive and negative predictive values. To illustrate if the results of the SQ changes the probability that a patient dies within 1 year, we created Fagan's nomograms. We report the results from the overall sample and for subgroups according to sex, age, LVEF and NYHA functional class.

Results

We observed that the SQ showed a sensitivity of 85% identifying ambulatory patients with HF who are in the last year of life. We determined that the SQ's performance predicting 1-year mortality was similar among women and men. The SQ performed better for patients aged under 70 years, for patients with reduced or mildly reduced ejection fraction, and for patients NYHA class III/IV.

Conclusions

We consider the tool an easy and fast first step to identify patients with HF who might benefit from an advance care planning discussion or a referral to palliative care due to limited life expectancy.

### What role for New York heart association class in heart failure clinical trials? [^115reNDX]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor In a recently published secondary analysis of the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure trial, Rohde et al1 highlight several limitations of the New York Heart Association functional classification in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. First, the authors show the poor ability of NYHA classification to detect different grades of mild HF, ie, NYHA classes I to II, with a striking overlap across classes for more objective measures of HF severity, namely natriuretic peptides and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. Moreover, patients with NYHA class I and higher NPs experienced a higher event rate than those with NYHA classes II or III and lower NPs.

Thus, as also highlighted by the authors, the current practice of considering patients with NYHA class I as a stable, homogeneous group at low risk of outcomes and crudely excluding them from HF trials might constitute a missed opportunity, affect generalizability, and decrease the feasibility of the enrollment. Beyond the suitability of using NYHA classification as treatment eligibility criteria, we believe that the current study has further implications for trial design. Lindberg F, Tomasoni D, Savarese G.

### Comparative reproducibility and validity of systems for assessing cardiovascular functional class: advantages of a new specific activity scale [^112jRdVa]. Circulation (1981). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "NYHA functional classification for heart failure" for heart failure, mitral regurgitation, hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, ventricular arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, acute pericarditis, constrictive pericarditis, myocarditis, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, cardiac amyloidosis, sick sinus syndrome, bradycardia, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Brugada syndrome, cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, chest pain, long QT syndrome, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, focal atrial tachycardia, orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, Chagas cardiomyopathy and vasospastic angina.

The NYHA functional classification for heart failure, or New York Heart Association Functional Classification, is a scoring system used to quantify the severity of symptoms in patients with heart failure. This classification system is applicable to patients diagnosed with heart failure and is used to assess their functional capacity and limitations during physical activity.

The NYHA classification is divided into four classes: Class I (no symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity), Class II (mild symptoms and slight limitation during ordinary activity), Class III (marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity), and Class IV (severe limitations, experiences symptoms even while at rest).

The clinical utility of this calculator is to guide treatment decisions, assess prognosis, and evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with heart failure. It is also commonly used in clinical trials to stratify patients and measure outcomes.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it is subjective and relies on patient self-report, so it may not be as accurate in patients with cognitive impairment or communication difficulties.

The calculator categorizes the severity of heart failure using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system. It does this by analyzing a patient's reported physical abilities related to cardiac disease and matches them to one of the four NYHA classes.

Here's the breakdown of each class:

- Class I involves patients who have cardiac disease but do not experience any limitations in physical activity. Regular activities do not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, or shortness of breath.

- Class II fits patients who have a slight limitation in physical activity due to cardiac disease. They feel comfortable when at rest, but ordinary physical activities might lead to fatigue, palpitation, or breathlessness.

- Class III describes patients with a marked limitation in physical activity. These individuals are comfortable when resting, but even less than ordinary activities cause fatigue, palpitations, breathlessness, or chest pain.

- Class IV covers patients who cannot engage in any physical activity without experiencing discomfort. They exhibit symptoms of heart failure even when at rest, and any physical activity worsens these symptoms.

To determine the appropriate class for a patient, the calculator compares the user's description of their physical ability with these four established patterns. Each condition is linked specifically to one of the NYHA classes, providing a clear pathway from symptom description to classification. For example, if a patient's physical condition matches the criteria for Class I, then the result is "Class I". This comparison method efficiently identifies the level of heart failure severity based on self-reported abilities and symptoms.

### Limitations of the New York heart association functional classification system and self-reported walking distances in chronic heart failure [^113bLwAn]. Heart (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Two ways to evaluate the symptoms of heart failure are the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and asking patients how far they can walk (walk distance). The NYHA system is commonly used, although it is not clear how individual clinicians apply it.

Aim

To investigate how useful these measures are to assess heart failure and whether other questions might be more helpful.

Methods

30 cardiologists were asked what questions they used when assessing patients with heart failure. To assess interoperator variability, two cardiologists assessed a series of 50 patients in classes II and III using the NYHA classification. 45 patients who had undergone cardiopulmonary testing were interviewed using a specially formulated questionnaire. They were also asked how far they could walk before being stopped by symptoms, and then tested on their ability to estimate distance.

Results

The survey of cardiologists showed no consistent method for assessing NYHA class and a literature survey showed that 99% of research papers do not reference or describe their methods for assigning NYHA classes. The interoperator variability study showed only 54% concordance between the two cardiologists. 70% of cardiologists asked patients for their walk distance; however, this walk distance correlated poorly with actual exercise capacity measured by cardiopulmonary testing (rho = 0.04, p = 0.82).

Conclusion

No consistent method of assessing NYHA class is in use and the interoperator study on class II and class III patients gave a result little better than chance. Some potential questions are offered for use in assessment. Walking distance, although frequently asked, does not correlate with formally measured exercise capacity, even after correction for patient perception of distance, and has never been found to have prognostic relevance. Its value is therefore doubtful.

### Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on functional class in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction – a meta-analysis [^1124syFS]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on symptoms in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is controversial.

Aims

To perform a meta-analysis of studies evaluating effect of ACE inhibitors on New York Heart Association (NYHA) class in patients with LVSD.

Methods

Individual data from 10389 patients in NYHA classes I-IV from four large long-term studies (2–4-year follow-up) and summary data from 2302 patients in NYHA classes II-IV from 16 short-term studies (3 months follow-up) were meta-analysed to assess changes in NYHA class.

Results

The large long-term studies showed a significant improvement in the worst NYHA classes (classes II-IV compared to class I) in the ACE inhibitor arm versus placebo, odds ratio (OR) = 0.875 (0.811–0.943) p = 0.0005. This effect was only present in studies which included patients with chronic heart failure and was particularly pronounced on deterioration to the worst NYHA class IV, OR = 0.66 (0.52–0.84) p = 0.001. There was no effect in the studies which included patients after myocardial infarction. The short-term chronic heart failure studies showed a significant improvement in NYHA class; OR for improvement of at least one NYHA class was 2.11 (1.48–2.98, 95% CI) p < 0.0001.

Conclusion

ACE inhibition significantly improves symptomatic status measured as NYHA classification in patients with chronic heart failure.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Universal definition of heart failure — patient and clinician perspective explains that relying solely on symptoms can be confusing because symptoms are nonspecific and subjective, and that patients may become asymptomatic (NYHA functional class I) while structural, cellular, and molecular abnormalities continue to worsen. Although Stage C HF uses the phrase "current or previous symptoms", patients may interpret lack of signs and symptoms as being out of HF and be less likely to adhere to care, and health care professionals may be less likely to optimize guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) when symptoms are mild or absent.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112b7rxM]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification — symptom-based functional status and staging linkage is described as follows: The NYHA classification is used to characterize symptoms and functional capacity of patients with symptomatic (stage C) heart failure (HF) or advanced HF (stage D), and it is a subjective assessment by a clinician that can change over time. The NYHA functional classification is an independent predictor of mortality and is widely used in clinical practice to determine the eligibility of patients for treatment strategies. Clinicians specify NYHA classification at baseline after the initial diagnosis and after treatment through the continuum of care, and although a patient with symptomatic HF (stage C) may become asymptomatic with treatment (NYHA class I), that patient will still be categorized as stage C HF; patients with stage C HF can also be classified according to the trajectory of their symptoms.

### NYHA functional classification and outcomes after transcatheter mitral valve repair in heart Failure: the COAPT trial [^115nM7T2]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of MitraClip implantation versus guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) in patients with secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) according to baseline functional status as assessed by the widely used New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification.

Background

Patients with heart failure (HF) and impaired functional status at baseline have poor prognosis. Whether the effects of transcatheter repair of secondary SMR in patients with HF are influenced by baseline functional status is unknown.

Methods

In the COAPT (Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with Functional Mitral Regurgitation) trial, patients with HF with moderate to severe or severe SMR who remained symptomatic despite maximally tolerated GDMT were randomized to MitraClip implantation versus GDMT alone. Outcomes were evaluated according to baseline functional status as assessed using the NYHA functional classification. The primary endpoint of interest was the rate of death or HF-related hospitalization (HFH) at 2 years in time-to-first-event analyses.

Results

Among 613 randomized patients, 240 were in NYHA functional class II (39.2%), 322 were in NYHA functional class III (52.5%), and 51 were in ambulatory NYHA functional class IV (8.3%). Rates of death or HFH were progressively higher with increasing NYHA functional class. Compared with GDMT alone, MitraClip implantation resulted in lower 2-year rates of death or HFH consistently in patients in NYHA functional class II (39.7% vs. 63.7%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37 to 0.77), NYHA functional class III (46.6% vs. 65.5%; HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.82), and NYHA functional class IV (66.7% vs. 85.2%; HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.28 to 1.10; p interaction = 0.86). Greater improvements in quality of life at 2 years were observed in patients treated with the MitraClip compared with GDMT irrespective of baseline functional status.

Conclusions

The NYHA functional classification provides prognostic utility in patients with HF and moderate to severe or severe SMR. In the COAPT trial, the benefits of MitraClip implantation were consistent in patients with better or worse functional status as assessed by NYHA functional class.

New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification — definitions specify that Class I is no limitation of physical activity with ordinary activity not causing symptoms of HF; Class II is slight limitation with comfort at rest but ordinary physical activity resulting in symptoms of HF; Class III is marked limitation with comfort at rest but less than ordinary activity causing symptoms of HF; and Class IV is inability to perform any physical activity without symptoms of HF or symptoms of HF at rest.

### Clinical implications of the New York heart association classification [^115LrcgF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Several limitations should be considered. First, we did not include patients classified as NYHA class I or IV because they constituted a small minority in the HF trials we assessed. Second, detailed phenotyping of HF patients that included natriuretic peptide levels and KCCQ assessments was available for only 2 of the trials, and only 1 trial had data on cardiopulmonary exercise testing, the gold standard for measure of functional status in HF. Third, we did not have data on real‐world use of NYHA classification, but it would not be expected to change our conclusions in a meaningful manner. Fourth, we did not limit our analysis to HF patients with reduced ejection fraction trials for the survival analyses. Prior studies have shown that prognosis is similar in HF patients with reduced or preserved ejection fraction. Fifth, the trials covered a long period of time, and therapies for HF have improved; however, the "newest" clinical trial — GUIDE‐IT — had patients who did the worst within similar categories of NYHA class, supporting our hypothesis.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116haMd3]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guideline — patient-reported outcomes context defines health status as encompassing symptoms, functional status, and health-related QOL. Clinicians traditionally assess health status via clinical interview and exam summarized as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, while standardized questionnaires such as the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire or the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire ascertain patient-reported health status. Studies found discordance between patient-reported status and clinician assessment using NYHA classification, and patient-reported health status may have higher reliability and better sensitivity for clinical changes than NYHA and is moderately correlated with CPET and the 6-minute walk test. Patient-reported health status is an independent predictor of hospitalization and mortality. Although there are minimal data regarding the effect of incorporating patient-reported health status assessment into routine care, these assessments provide valuable incremental information beyond standard evaluation, and risk-adjusted health status varies substantially across practices. HF-specific instruments (e.g. Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, PROMIS-Plus-HF) are preferable because they are more sensitive to changes in disease status and more responsive to HF therapy than generic measures.

### Comparison of patient self-reported health status with clinician-assigned New York heart association classification [^117HzPDu]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Current clinical trials categorize the severity of heart failure (HF) by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification to ensure that enrolled patients have similar disease severity, despite its known limited reproducibility and significant interphysician variability. Alternatively, the severity of symptoms and functional limitations can be directly elicited from patients using the well-validated Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). We compared the range of KCCQ scores within NYHA classes in recent clinical studies.

### Patients' self-assessed functional status in heart failure by New York heart association class: a prognostic predictor of hospitalizations, quality of life and death [^113bUGgd]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Clinician-assigned NYHA class is an established predictor of outcomes in heart failure. Our study has demonstrated that heart failure patients' own assessment of their NYHA class is also predictive of future outcomes. Higher (worse) self-assigned NYHA class was associated with increased hospitalization rates, worse quality of life, and decreased survival. Interestingly, the SA-NYHA classification in this study also predicted not only the physical dimension of the MLHFQ measure, but also the emotional dimension.

Usually the NYHA class is assigned by physicians or nurses based on their subjective interpretation of patients' cardiac symptoms, their interpretation of impact on daily activities, and the results of objective clinical investigations. There is no agreed-on method of assigning NYHA class. A limitation of the NYHA classification is its poor interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility. In a recent study, providers used a considerable variety of different questions and criteria to determine the NYHA classification. Furthermore, the interobserver concordance was little better than chance: for a series of 50 patients, 2 independent cardiologists assessors agreed on the NYHA class in only 54% of cases.

It has been suggested that a way to improve its reliability may be to use the criteria as a patient self-report instrument. The NYHA classification is based on the main symptoms of heart failure (breathlessness, fatigue, and palpitations) as experienced by patients and the limitation in their physical activity resulting from their condition. Being subjective experiences, symptoms should in principle be most reliably elicited by asking patients directly. It has been argued that functional status may be appropriate for self-report because it is affected by a variety of psychological, social, and environmental influences experienced by the patient. Our study provides evidence that self-reported functional status has predictive validity.

An advantage of our study is that it explicitly describes the method used for assigning the SA-NYHA class. In contrast, a recent review showed that 99% of the reviewed papers did not reference the methods they used to distinguish between different classes of patients. An additional strength of our study is that the questionnaire is very brief and was derived directly from the NYHA criteria.

### An evaluation of symptom classification systems used for the assessment of patients with heart failure in France [^115huDRB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Many systems have been proposed to assess the degree of functional impairment in patients with chronic heart failure in order to be able to draw comparisons between patients and assess the development of the disease in the same patient. The NYHA classification is subjective and insufficiently reproducible and has no real predictive value with respect to the exertion test. The Canadian classification does not contribute much in terms of validation. The Feinstein and Duke University classifications are too complex, not very easy to use and have never been validated. The scale of activity proposed by Goldman gives details on functional impairment by using examples from daily activities, selected for their variety and grouped according to the energy that they require. This classification is highly reproducible and is concordant with the exertion test (duration of the exertion test, VO₂ max). However, it is not suitable for France. The examples are not precise enough: in addition, they do not eliminate contradictions that can make the patient impossible to classify. We propose a scale of activity specifically designed for use in France. It is reproducible and the VO₂ peaks are highly concordant. Lastly, the questions the patient is asked are progressive, thus avoiding contradictory answers. This classification could prove to be useful in everyday life and also for multi-center studies in French-speaking countries.

### Correlation of the New York heart association classification and the 6-minute walk distance: a systematic review [^112EMtqP]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Functional status assessment is the cornerstone of heart failure management and trials. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) are commonly used tools; however, the correlation between them is not well understood.

Hypothesis

We hypothesised that the relationship between the NYHA classification and 6MWD might vary across studies.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed to identify all studies reporting both NYHA class and 6MWD. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. Thirty-seven studies involving 5678 patients were included.

Results

There was significant heterogeneity across studies in 6MWD within all NYHA classes: I (n = 16, Q = 934.2; P < 0.001), II (n = 25, Q = 1658.3; P < 0.001), III (n = 30, Q = 1020.1; P < 0.001), and IV (n = 6, Q = 335.5; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in average 6MWD between NYHA I and II (420 m vs 393 m; P = 0.416). There was a significant difference in average 6MWD between NYHA II and III (393 m vs 321 m; P = 0.014) and III and IV (321 m vs 224 m; P = 0.027). This remained significant after adjusting for region of study, age, and sex.

Conclusions

Although there is an inverse correlation between NYHA II-IV and 6MWD, there is significant heterogeneity across studies in 6MWD within each NYHA class and overlap in 6MWD between NYHA I and II. The NYHA classification performs well in more symptomatic patients (NYHA III/IV) but less so in asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients (NYHA I/II). Nonetheless, the NYHA classification is an easily applied first-line tool in everyday clinical practice, but its potential subjectivity should be considered when performing comparisons across studies.

### New York heart association functional class, QRS duration, and survival in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: implications for cardiac resychronization therapy [^115ygcJe]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Symptom severity assessed by NYHA functional class and QRS duration are essential criteria for selection of heart failure (HF) patients for CRT. This study assessed the relationship between NYHA class, QRS duration, and survival in a nationwide HF registry.

Methods and Results

We studied 13 423 patients with HF in NYHA class II-IV and LVEF < 40% in the Swedish Heart Failure Registry. Survival was followed via the Swedish Population Registry. Of 12 534 patients without CRT (age 71 ± 12 years, 29% women), 51% and 49% were in NYHA class II and III-IV, respectively. Patients in NYHA class II compared with class III-IV were younger (69 vs. 73 years), and had a better systolic function (49% vs. 58% with LVEF < 30%), P < 0.001 for all, and a favourable co-morbidity profile. QRS duration was 116 ± 29 ms in NYHA class II and 119 ± 29 ms in NYHA class III-IV with QRS ≥ 120 ms found in 37% vs. 44%, and an LBBB in 23% vs. 28% (P < 0.001 for all). Upon multivariable Cox regression adjusting for 40 clinically relevant variables, mortality risk was higher in NYHA class III-IV vs. class II, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23–1.40. Mortality was also higher with QRS prolongation ≥ 120 ms vs. narrow QRS. The HR in NYHA class II patients with non-LBBB was 1.19 (95% CI 1.05–1.36) and in those with LBBB it was 1.16 (95% CI 1.03–1.41). The corresponding HRs in NYHA class III-IV were 1.33 (95% CI 1.21–1.47) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.02–1.22). There was no significant interaction between the effects of NYHA class and QRS duration or morphology on mortality. Applying different scenarios to estimate guideline adherence, fewer patients with NYHA class II (range 14.4–42.6%) compared with NYHA class III-IV (18.0–45.4%) had received a CRT device when indicated.

Conclusions

In HF with reduced LVEF, QRS prolongation is common and independently linked to worse survival. The increase in mortality risk associated with QRS prolongation of both LBBB and non-LBBB morphology is similar in NYHA class II and III-IV.

### Comparison between the Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire and New York heart association in assessing functional capacity and clinical outcomes [^116F9NxH]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) has emerged as a patient-centered heart failure-specific health status measure. It currently lacks routine and widespread use in clinical practice and trials. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between KCCQ and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) parameters and clinical outcomes, compared with the New York Heart Association functional classification (NYHA).

Methods and Results

We performed a single-centered observational analysis of 432 patients who presented to the Heart Failure Department, completed the KCCQ, and underwent CPET. The 1-year clinical outcome assessed was a composite of mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and need for heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device. In the KCCQ, the physical limitation domain had a correlation with peak VO 2 similar to NYHA (r = 0.48; P < .001; and r = -0.48; P < .001; respectively), and slightly better correlation with ventilatory threshold (r = 0.42; P < .001; and r = -0.40; P < .001; respectively). According to model validation, the KCCQ physical limitation domain and NYHA were similar predictors of peak VO₂ (r² = 0.229; and r² = 0.227; respectively). KCCQ predicted the specified 1-year clinical outcome (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.69–0.82; P < .001) and provided incremental predictive ability when added to a model that included NYHA, with a net reclassification index of 76.1% (P < .001).

Conclusions

KCCQ and NYHA provide similar assessment of functional capacity. KCCQ predicts 1-year clinical outcomes, providing incremental value over NYHA. These findings support its routine use in clinical care, as well as its potential to serve as a measure in clinical trials.

### The Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire in relation to New York heart association class [^111q1Cok]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In order to identify candidacy and treatment response for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM), clinicians need an accurate means of assessing symptoms, function, and quality of life. While the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification is most often used for this purpose, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-23) is more accurate and sensitive to change, although less familiar to practicing clinicians. To support interpreting the KCCQ-23, we describe cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in KCCQ scores in the context of the NYHA.

Methods

Participants from the EXPLORER-HCM trial (NCT03470545) completed the KCCQ-23 and clinicians assigned NYHA classes at study visits. Participants were included if they had baseline and week 30 data for cross-sectional and longitudinal changes. Median KCCQ-23 scores were compared by NYHA class at baseline and week 30 and by change in NYHA class from baseline to week 30.

Results

Cross-sectionally, the KCCQ-23 Overall Summary Scores (KCCQ-23 OSS) and Clinical Summary Scores (KCCQ-23 CSS) had an inverse relationship with the NYHA class at baseline and 30 weeks, with marked variations in KCCQ-23 scores among patients assigned to the same NYHA class. When improving from NYHA class II to I, the median changes in KCCQ-23 OSS and KCCQ-23 CSS were 10 (IQR 4, 22) and 8 (IQR 2, 20), respectively. The changes were larger when improving from NYHA class III to II and from NYHA class III to I.

Conclusion

KCCQ-23 scores are inversely related to NYHA classes, with significant variability within classes. Changes in scores are not linear, suggesting greater differences when patients move between NYHA Classes II and III than when moving between Classes I and II. These insights may help clinicians better understand cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in KCCQ scores.

### Finerenone and New York heart association functional class in heart failure: the FINEARTS-HF trial [^1136bU3t]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The NYHA functional classification remains an important and widely used metric in heart failure (HF)-oriented clinical care and research.

Objectives

This study aims to evaluate whether the effect of finerenone varies according to NYHA functional class in HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

Methods

In this prespecified analysis of the FINEARTS-HF trial, treatment effects of finerenone according to baseline NYHA functional class (II or III/IV) were examined on the primary endpoint (cardiovascular death and total HF events) and key secondary endpoints. Effects of finerenone on change in NYHA functional class were evaluated using ordinal logistic regression.

Results

At baseline, 4,146 (69%) and 1,854 (31%) participants were NYHA functional class II and III/IV, respectively. Participants with baseline NYHA functional class III/IV vs II experienced a significantly higher rate of cardiovascular death and total HF events (adjusted rate ratio: 1.28 [95% CI: 1.11–1.46]; P < 0.001). Finerenone consistently reduced the primary endpoint irrespective of baseline NYHA functional class (P interaction = 0.54), with greater absolute benefits in NYHA functional class III/IV (absolute rate reduction [ARR]: 4.5 per 100 person-years) vs II (ARR: 2.0 per 100 person-years). Benefits of finerenone on Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Total Symptom Score at 12 months were consistent irrespective of NYHA functional class (P interaction = 0.93). NYHA functional class improved similarly in the finerenone and placebo arms out to 12 months. The safety profile of finerenone was similar among participants with baseline NYHA functional class III/IV vs II.

Conclusions

In this FINEARTS-HF analysis, finerenone reduced clinical outcomes and improved patient-reported health status in HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction irrespective of baseline NYHA functional class.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure staging — The guideline classification identifies 4 stages that emphasize development and progression: the first 2 stages (A and B) are clearly not HF and are for early identification of patients at risk; patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus who do not yet demonstrate impaired left ventricular (LV) function, hypertrophy, or geometric chamber distortion are considered Stage A, whereas asymptomatic patients who demonstrate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and/or impaired LV function are designated Stage B; Stage C denotes patients with current or past symptoms of HF associated with underlying structural heart disease, and Stage D designates patients with truly refractory HF who might be eligible for specialized, advanced treatment strategies such as mechanical circulatory support, procedures to facilitate fluid removal, continuous inotropic infusions, or cardiac transplantation or other innovative or experimental surgical procedures, or for end-of-life care such as hospice; this staging is intended to complement but in no way to replace the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, which primarily gauges the severity of symptoms in Stage C or Stage D and is recognized as a subjective assessment that can change frequently over short periods of time.

### Patients report more severe daily limitations than recognized by their physicians [^113mL9og]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Increasing penetration of recommended therapies for heart failure (HF) has improved outcomes, 1 but morbidity and mortality remain substantial. 2, 3 Heart failure guidelines mandate consideration not only for prolonging survival but also on improving quality of life (QOL), 4, 5 upon which patients may place similar or greater value. 6

A major contributor to QOL in HF is functional capacity, for which impairment can lead to loss of independence and reduced self‐esteem. 7, 8 The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system 9 is widely used in clinical practice, in clinical trials, 10 in translation of trials into guideline recommendations for therapies, 11 and in decisions about advanced HF therapies. 12, 13 Understanding functional status and its improvement may be further enhanced by consideration of patient reported limitations to specific activities during daily life, as assessed by some of the questions in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. 14, 15 Although NYHA classification has been revised several times since 1928, 9 it still relies on physicians' subjective estimate of a patient's ability to carry out "ordinary" activity. Consequently, the decision of a physician to classify a patient per NYHA functional class will depend on both patient and physician interpretation of "ordinary physical activity" and how to grade limitations as slight or marked. 16, 17 Although NYHA class remains a robust discriminator of clinical outcome, reproducibility is low when the same patients are evaluated by different physicians. 14, 17, 18 In order to focus on patient‐centered outcomes, 4 it would be potentially useful both in heart failure clinics and in clinical trials to consider patient's individual perceptions about limitations, adding information to frequently used NYHA classification. Although the nature of heart failure symptoms may be similar across ejection fraction (EF) groups, there are differences in demographics and comorbidities, such that the nature and degree of limitations may vary. 19

We hypothesized that patients may report limitations to specific daily activity that is not well‐reflected in physician‐assigned NYHA classification. The major aim of the present study was to determine the extent of patient‐reported limitations during daily activities and to compare with the physician assignment of NYHA class on the same day. A further aim was to compare the frequency of perceived limitations across the HF different left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) types.

### Comparison of New York heart association class and patient-reported outcomes for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^115dnzD6]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

It is unclear how New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class compares with patient-reported outcomes among patients with heart failure (HF) in contemporary US clinical practice.

Objective

To characterize longitudinal changes and concordance between NYHA class and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score (KCCQ-OS), and their associations with clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included 2872 US outpatients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction across 145 practices enrolled in the CHAMP-HF registry between December 2015 and October 2017. All patients had complete NYHA class and KCCQ-OS data at baseline and 12 months. Longitudinal changes and correlations between the 2 measure were examined. Multivariable models landmarked at 12 months evaluated associations between improvement in NYHA and KCCQ-OS from baseline to 12 months with clinical outcomes occurring from months 12 through 24. Statistical analyses were performed from March to August 2020.

Exposure

Change in health status, as defined by 12-month change in NYHA class or KCCQ-OS.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality, HF hospitalization, and mortality or HF hospitalization.

Results

In total, 2872 patients were included in this analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 68 [59–75] years; 872 [30.4%] were women; and 2156 [75.1%] were of White race). At baseline, 312 patients (10.9%) were NYHA class I, 1710 patients (59.5%) were class II, 804 patients (28.0%) were class III, and 46 patients (1.6%) were class IV. For KCCQ-OS, 1131 patients (39.4%) scored 75 to 100 (best health status), 967 patients (33.7%) scored 50 to 74, 612 patients (21.3%) scored 25 to 49, and 162 patients (5.6%) scored 0 to 24 (worst health status). At 12 months, 1002 patients (34.9%) had a change in NYHA class (599 [20.9%] with improvement; 403 [14.0%] with worsening) and 2158 patients (75.1%) had a change of 5 or more points in KCCQ-OS (1388 [48.3%] with improvement; 770 [26.8%] with worsening). The most common trajectory for NYHA class was no change (1870 [65.1%]), and the most common trajectory for KCCQ-OS was an improvement of at least 10 points (1047 [36.5%]). After adjustment, improvement in NYHA class was not associated with subsequent clinical outcomes, whereas an improvement of 5 or more points in KCCQ-OS was independently associated with decreased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44–0.80; P < .001) and mortality or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.89; p = 0.002).

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings of this cohort study suggest that, in contemporary US clinical practice, compared with NYHA class, KCCQ-OS is more sensitive to clinically meaningful changes in health status over time. Changes in KCCQ-OS may have more prognostic value than changes in NYHA class.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^111VrqjW]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

2013 ACCF/AHA heart failure clinical practice guideline — A thorough history and physical examination should be obtained/performed in patients presenting with heart failure to identify cardiac and noncardiac disorders or behaviors that might cause or accelerate the development or progression of HF (Class I, Level of Evidence: C). The guideline notes that the NYHA functional classification gauges the severity of symptoms in those with structural heart disease and that the NYHA functional classification is an independent predictor of mortality; it is widely used in clinical practice and research and for determining the eligibility of patients for certain healthcare services, yet NYHA functional class assessment is not reported in a significant number of patients in contemporary HF practices in the United States. It also directs clinicians to evaluate general health status and clarifies that although no specific 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline recommendation is made regarding collection of NYHA or other quantitative result, knowledge of symptom status is needed to determine candidacy for appropriate HF treatments.

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^114cHRRs]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

ACCF/AHA stages and NYHA functional classification mapping for heart failure is summarized as follows: Stage A is "At high risk for HF but without structural heart disease or symptoms of HF" and corresponds to NYHA "None"; Stage B is "Structural heart disease but without signs or symptoms of HF" and corresponds to "Class I" defined as "No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms of HF". Stage C is "Structural heart disease with prior or current symptoms of HF" and spans "Class I" (same no-limitation definition), "Class II" defined as "Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in symptoms of HF", "Class III" defined as "Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes symptoms of HF", and "Class IV" defined as "Unable to carry on any physical activity without symptoms of HF, or symptoms of HF at rest". Stage D is "Refractory HF requiring specialized interventions" and corresponds to "Class IV" with the same Class IV definition.

### Effect of candesartan on New York heart association functional class. results of the candesartan in heart failure: assessment of reduction in mortality and morbidity (CHARM) programme [^114uxJaJ]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the effect of the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan on New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in a broad spectrum of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).

Methods and Results

Patients in the CHARM Programme with symptomatic CHF were randomized to placebo (n = 3796) or candesartan (n = 3803) and followed for a median of 38 months. NYHA class was assessed at baseline, at two weekly intervals during dose titration and 4 monthly thereafter. Patients were classified as "better", "unchanged" or "worse" at the end of the study compared to baseline. Both a simple "last visit carried forward" (LVCF) analysis and "worst rank carried forward" (WRCF) analysis (where patients who died were allocated NYHA class V) were used. In the LVCF analysis, compared to placebo, more candesartan patients improved (35.4% versus 32.5%) and fewer worsened (9.0% versus 10.3%) in NYHA class (p = 0.003). The WRCF analysis also showed a better overall change in NYHA class with candesartan compared to placebo. There was no heterogeneity in the response to candesartan between the CHARM component trials.

Conclusions

Candesartan improves NYHA functional class to a similar extent to other proven treatments for CHF when added to these other treatments.

### A comparison of patient and physician-rated New York heart association class in a community-based heart failure clinic [^112a6M42]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is recommended for grading symptoms of chronic heart failure and is a powerful prognostic marker. Patient-rated NYHA (Pa-NYHA) and physician-rated NYHA (Dr-NYHA) class have never been compared directly, and it is unknown whether they carry similar prognostic significance.

Methods and Results

NYHA class was rated independently by a physician and patient in 1752 patients referred with suspected heart failure. Pa-NYHA and Dr-NYHA varied by 1 class in 37.1% cases and by 2 classes in 12.8% cases. Mean Dr-NYHA and Pa-NYHA were higher in women than men (1.98 vs 1.89, P = 0.016; 2.17 vs 2.02, P = 0.002) despite less cardiac disease. Dr-NYHA correlated more with 6-minute walk test distance and severity of left ventricular systolic dysfunction than Pa-NYHA (Spearman's rho: -0.53 vs -0.44 and 0.32 vs 0.16). Dr-NYHA better predicted mortality when compared with Pa-NYHA (log-rank: χ² = 105 vs 46, both P < .001).

Conclusion

Patients rate NYHA differently from physicians, and women rate NYHA differently from men. Dr-NYHA relates more strongly to survival and severity of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, suggesting that for physicians the NYHA classification may have become a "heart failure severity score" and not as was intended, purely a measure of a patient's symptoms and functional status.

### Patients' self-assessed functional status in heart failure by New York heart association class: a prognostic predictor of hospitalizations, quality of life and death [^115foXNt]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Our study was limited by there being no clinician assessment to compare with patients' own assessment. Furthermore, follow-up was reasonably brief (limited to 6 months) and only 54% of the patients could complete our SA-NYHA questionnaire themselves. Patients who needed help selecting their SA-NYHA class were more likely to be older, had worse abbreviated mental test scores, and needed help with their medication, indicating that further refinement of the questions is needed to make them clearer and easier to use by older or sicker patients. Equally on a positive side, researchers were generic health researchers or research nurses, none of whom had a background in cardiology implying that no specialist expertise was used to assign SA-NYHA class where help was given. A further weakness of our study was that in general we only identified differences between mild (SA-NYHA I/II) heart failure and moderate/severe (SA-NYHA III/IV) heart failure. We found little difference between SA-NYHA Class III and IV except for 1 quality of life measure. This finding is in line with previous research, which has often failed to find prognostic differences between NYHA Classes II and III or between NYHA Classes III and IV. Finally, our study measure was not validated against objective measures of functional capacity.

We are not aware of other published studies in which NYHA was assigned by directly asking patients to choose the NYHA class that best describes their condition. Our study supports earlier findings that patients' self-reported symptoms have predictive significance for outcomes in heart failure. NYHA functional class is a well known and simple risk stratification tool. We have demonstrated that it has a clinically significant predictive value when used directly by patients. Further research is necessary to refine the instrument for self-determining NYHA class and to validate it against objective measures of functional capacity in heart failure and clinician assessment. In conclusion, this study suggests that self-assigned NYHA class appears to predict patient outcome. It could be used by researchers who need a quick tool to stratify patients with heart failure, or by nonspecialist clinical staff needing a simple estimate of disease severity.

### Proposal for a functional classification system of heart failure in patients with end-stage renal disease: proceedings of the acute dialysis quality initiative (ADQI) XI workgroup [^113dK9vm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Structural heart disease is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. More than 80% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are reported to have cardiovascular disease. This observation has enormous clinical relevance because the leading causes of death for patients with ESRD are of cardiovascular disease etiology, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. The 2 systems most commonly used to classify the severity of heart failure are the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification and the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) staging system. With rare exceptions, patients with ESRD who do not receive renal replacement therapy (RRT) develop signs and symptoms of heart failure, including dyspnea and edema due to inability of the severely diseased kidneys to excrete sodium and water. Thus, by definition, nearly all patients with ESRD develop a symptomatology consistent with heart failure if fluid removal by RRT is delayed. Neither the AHA/ACC heart failure staging nor the NYHA functional classification system identifies the variable symptomatology that patients with ESRD experience depending upon whether evaluation occurs before or after fluid removal by RRT. Consequently, the incidence, severity, and outcomes of heart failure in patients with ESRD are poorly characterized. The 11th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative has identified this issue as a critical unmet need for the proper evaluation and treatment of heart failure in patients with ESRD. We propose a classification schema based on patient-reported dyspnea assessed both pre- and post-ultrafiltration, in conjunction with echocardiography.

### Newly developed adult congenital heart disease anatomic and physiological classification: first predictive validity evaluation [^113GgqZf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stratifying patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) for their risk on mortality and morbidity remains a point of discussion among many experts and healthcare professionals in the field. The classification of Task Force 1 of the 32nd Bethesda Conference is the most commonly applied system, categorizing patients into mild, moderate, and complex heart defects, according to the anatomic complexity of their heart defect. 1 Despite its widespread use, the current functional status of the patient and its respective evolution over time cannot be accounted for by the Bethesda classification.

In the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines for the management of adults with CHD, a new classification scheme is proposed, in which both anatomic complexity and current physiological stage of the patient are included. 2 This new classification system, the Adult Congenital Heart Disease Anatomic and Physiological classification (ACHD‐AP), comprises 12 categories to which patients can be assigned. This classification scheme has the potential to provide a more comprehensive assessment of patients for their risk of mortality and morbidity. Given that it is a new classification scheme, no data on the validity of the ACHD‐AP are available yet.

Recently, we published a study in which we compared 5 scales on their ability to predict 15‐year mortality in adults with CHD 3: the Bethesda classification, 1 the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, 4 the Ability Index, 5 the Disease Severity Index, 6 and the Congenital Heart Disease Functional Index (CHDFI). 7 We found that the CHDFI had the highest discrimination ability for all‐cause and cardiac mortality. 3 To confirm the added value of the physiological component of the newly developed ACHD‐AP score, it is relevant to investigate how this newly developed classification system is performing in relation to the other existing systems. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the properties of the ACHD‐AP to predict 15‐year mortality and to compare these predictive properties with the other classification systems.

Objectives

Our objectives are:

to assess whether treatment guided* by serial BNP or NT‐proBNP (collectively referred to as NP) monitoring improves outcomes compared with treatment guided by clinical assessment alone;
to assess the extent to which improved outcomes are explained by up‐titration of medication and/or reductions in BNP levels; and
to determine which groups of patients benefit most from monitoring in terms of their age, gender, severity of symptoms or stage of heart failure (with the use of the NYHA classification), and baseline NP.

*Treatment guided within this review refers to lifestyle and medication changes for the management of heart failure (i.e. no device therapy or transplantation).

### Poor functional status based on the New York heart association classification exposes the coronary patient to an elevated risk of ischemic stroke [^115cdTcu]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) are at increased risk of stroke. We investigated in a large cohort of patients with CHD the relationship between functional status, as assessed by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, and incident ischemic stroke.

Methods

We followed up 15,524 patients with documented CHD, screened for inclusion in a clinical trial (Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention), for 4.8 to 8.1 years. Functional status at baseline was categorized according to the NYHA classification. Among 14,703 patients, free of stroke, with recorded NYHA functional class, 1086 (7.4%) developed an ischemic cerebrovascular event, of whom 604 (4.1%) patients were confirmed to have an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Results

The cumulative rate of ischemic cerebrovascular events increased from 6.7% in patients with NYHA functional class I to 9.2% and 9.7% for patients with NYHA functional classes II and III, respectively (P < .001). Adjustments were made in Cox proportional hazard models for age, sex, body mass index, past myocardial infarction, current smoking, diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, percent of cholesterol in high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels. The adjusted hazard ratios associated with NYHA functional class II and III were 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.12–1.48) and 1.71 (95% confidence interval 1.36–2.15), respectively, as compared with patients with NYHA class I.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that stable coronary patients with even a slight limitation based on the NYHA functional class are exposed to an increased risk of ischemic stroke.

### The 'surprise question' in heart failure: a prospective cohort study [^115mt6vd]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Objective

The Surprise Question (SQ) is a prognostic screening tool used to identify patients with limited life expectancy. We assessed the SQ's performance predicting 1-year mortality among patients in ambulatory heart failure (HF) clinics. We determined that the SQ's performance changes according to sex and other demographic (age) and clinical characteristics, mainly left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classifications.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort study in two HF clinics. To assess the performance of the SQ in predicting 1-year mortality, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and the positive and negative predictive values. To illustrate if the results of the SQ changes the probability that a patient dies within 1 year, we created Fagan's nomograms. We report the results from the overall sample and for subgroups according to sex, age, LVEF and NYHA functional class.

Results

We observed that the SQ showed a sensitivity of 85% identifying ambulatory patients with HF who are in the last year of life. We determined that the SQ's performance predicting 1-year mortality was similar among women and men. The SQ performed better for patients aged under 70 years, for patients with reduced or mildly reduced ejection fraction, and for patients NYHA class III/IV.

Conclusions

We consider the tool an easy and fast first step to identify patients with HF who might benefit from an advance care planning discussion or a referral to palliative care due to limited life expectancy.

Discussion

In this nationwide real‐world HF population, we observed that: (i) the majority of patients in all the EF categories reported no change in NYHA class, whereas 17% improved and 14% worsened over a median follow‐up time of approximately 1 year; (ii) a follow‐up in specialty care predicted improvement in NYHA class, whereas inpatient status, renal disease, lower blood pressure, older age, and longer HF duration, predicted a worsening in NYHA class; (iii) NYHA class improvement was associated with lower and NYHA class worsening with higher crude mortality and HF hospitalization risk; (iv) the prognostic role of NYHA trajectories was independent of baseline NYHA class value, but explained by the resulting NYHA class at follow‐up; and (v) follow‐up NYHA assessment predicted mortality/risk of HF hospitalization independently of NYHA trajectories (Graphical Abstract).

### Clinical implications of the New York heart association classification [^113EYzsX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The New York Heart Association classification has served as a fundamental tool for risk stratification of heart failure and determines clinical trial eligibility and candidacy for drugs and devices. However, its ability to adequately stratify risk is unclear.

Methods and Results

To compareclass with objective assessments and survival in patients with, we performed secondary analyses of 4 multicenter National Institutes of Health–fundedclinical trials that included patients classified asclassor III: TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist), DIG (The Effect of Digoxin on Mortality and Morbidity in Patients With Heart Failure), HF‐ACTION (Efficacy and Safety of Exercise Training in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure), and GUIDE‐IT (Guiding Evidence‐Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure). Twenty‐month cumulative survival was compared between classes using Kaplan–Meier curves and the log rank test.‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro–B‐type natriuretic peptide), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores, 6‐minute walk distances, left ventricular ejection fraction, and cardiopulmonary test parameters were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and percentage overlap using kernel density estimations. Cumulative mortality varied significantly acrossclasses andclinical trials (likelihood ratio, P < 0.001). Mortality at 20 months forclassranged from 7% for patients in‐to 15% in‐, whereas mortality forclassranged from 12% into 26% in‐. There was substantial percentage overlap in values for‐prolevels (79% and 69%), scores (63% and 54%), 6‐minute walk distances (63% and 54%), and left ventricular ejection fraction (88% and 83%). Similarly, there was substantial overall in values for minute ventilation–carbon dioxide production relationship (71%), maximal oxygen uptake (54%), and exercise duration (53%).

Conclusions

Thesystem poorly discriminatespatients across the spectrum of functional impairment. These findings raise important questions about the need for improved phenotyping of these patients to facilitate risk stratification and response to interventions.

### Self-assessed symptoms in chronic heart failure – important information for clinical management [^115oWDej]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the patients' self-assessment of the severity of their symptoms with a physicians assessment and to evaluate the ability of self-assessed symptoms and ejection fraction (EF) to predict long-term survival in heart failure patients.

Method

Patients (n = 332) evaluated symptoms using a self-administered functional classification scale (Specific Activity Scale, SAS), which is equivalent to the NYHA scale. EF and NYHA functional class was also recorded. All patients were followed over a 3-year period.

Results

Approximately 50% of patients classified themselves into SAS class I. In contrast, the cardiologists classified only 9% of the patients as NYHA class I. In patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (EF ≤ 0.35) SAS score (HR 1.48, 95% CI [1.03–2.12] p = 0.03) and ACE inhibitor treatment (0.23 [0.11–0.51], p = 0.0003) independently predicted 3-year mortality in a multivariable analysis. EF was not predictive of mortality in the low EF group. Only age predicted long-term outcome in patients with preserved systolic function.

Conclusion

Patients' self-assessed symptoms and NYHA classification are not coherent. Left ventricular EF is of less importance in comparison with symptoms in chronic heart failure. Patients reporting less severe symptoms had a favourable 3-year prognosis, regardless of EF.

### The Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire in relation to New York heart association class [^116kazcb]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

In order to identify candidacy and treatment response for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM), clinicians need an accurate means of assessing symptoms, function, and quality of life. While the New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification is most often used for this purpose, the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-23) is more accurate and sensitive to change, although less familiar to practicing clinicians. To support interpreting the KCCQ-23, we describe cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in KCCQ scores in the context of the NYHA.

Methods:

Participants from the EXPLORER-HCM trial completed the KCCQ-23 and clinicians assigned NYHA classes at study visits. Participants were included if they had baseline and week 30 data for cross-sectional and longitudinal changes. Median KCCQ-23 scores were compared by NYHA class at baseline and week 30 and by change in NYHA class from baseline to week 30.

Results:

Cross-sectionally, the KCCQ-23 Overall Summary Scores (KCCQ-23 OSS) and Clinical Summary Scores (KCCQ-23 CSS) had an inverse relationship with the NYHA class at baseline and 30 weeks, with marked variations in KCCQ-23 scores among patients assigned to the same NYHA class. When improving from NYHA class II to I, the median changes in KCCQ-23 OSS and KCCQ-23 CSS were 10 (IQR 4, 22) and 8 (IQR 2, 20), respectively. The changes were larger when improving from NYHA class III to II and from NYHA class III to I.

Conclusion:

KCCQ-23 scores are inversely related to NYHA classes, with significant variability within classes. Changes in scores are not linear, suggesting greater differences when patients move between NYHA Classes II and III than when moving between Classes I and II. These insights may help clinicians better understand cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in KCCQ scores.

### Trajectories in New York heart association functional class in heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum: data from the Swedish heart failure registry [^116AdtVL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification has been a widely used clinical tool to assess dyspnoea and symptom severity in patients with heart failure (HF) for almost a century. Among patients with chronic HF, around a quarter experience symptoms at modest exertion/at rest (NYHA class III–IV), and poor NYHA functional class is associated with adverse outcomes in HF. The use of NYHA class as a single‐point assessment ranges from prognostication purposes and eligibility for HF treatments in clinical practice to enrolment criteria for trials. However, HF is a progressive syndrome, and symptom severity may change dynamically over its clinical course.

Few studies have comprehensively evaluated longitudinal changes in NYHA class over time and their associated factors, and they were often affected by several limitations, e.g. small sample sizes, inclusion of only patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or the setting of a specific intervention. Whether the trajectories of NYHA class over time (i.e. whether symptoms are stable, improving, or worsening) independently predict mortality/morbidity on top of a single‐point assessment across the ejection fraction (EF) spectrum might have implications for clinical trial design and prognostic assessment in clinical practice.

Therefore, in a large, contemporary, and nationwide HF registry enrolling patients across the EF spectrum, we aimed to comprehensively focus on longitudinal changes in NYHA class by investigating (i) their incidence, (ii) their independent predictors, and (iii) their independent associations with mortality/morbidity on top of one‐time NYHA class assessment.

### Patients' self-assessed functional status in heart failure by New York heart association class: a prognostic predictor of hospitalizations, quality of life and death [^117K17dd]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is the most commonly used system to describe the impact of heart failure on a patient's daily activities. The classification was originally developed in 1928 and subsequently revised. It classifies patients with heart failure into 4 categories (I, II, III, IV), with higher class indicating more severe symptoms, limitation in physical activity, and worse health. Clinicians assign NYHA class on the basis of their indirect interpretation of reported patients' symptoms, medical history, and results from clinical tests on cardiac structure and function. Physician-assigned NYHA class has been shown to be predictive of outcomes in heart failure including hospitalization and mortality. However, because the NYHA classification involves doctors' subjective judgment of symptoms and clinical data, wide interobserver variability has been reported. Furthermore, disparities between clinician-assigned NYHA class and patient-reported limitation in function have been observed in a number of studies.

The prognostic value of patients' own reports of their symptoms has received less attention in heart failure. One approach has been to derive NYHA class through responses to other brief patient-completed questionnaires. An early example is the Specific Activity Scale, a 5-item questionnaire assessing maximum physical activity. This scale has been shown to predict mortality. Nevertheless, a recent study demonstrated that patient assessed Specific Activity Scale levels did not appear to correlate with clinician assigned NYHA class. Similarly, a study deriving NYHA class from patient responses to the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnairefound only "slight agreement" with clinician-assigned NYHA class.

Our recently completed trialasked patients to assign themselves an NYHA class using standard NYHA class descriptors, as opposed to other similar questions (eg, Specific Activity Scale, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire). This study sets out to examine whether patient-assigned NYHA class can predict patient outcomes in terms of mortality, hospital admission, and quality of life.

### Sudden death in patients with coronary heart disease without severe systolic dysfunction… [^115BPVyF]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

The 4-year cumulative incidence of each mode of death, accounting for the competing risk of death, are shown in strata of LVEF and NYHA functional class. Differences in cumulative incidence across strata are shown. Inclusion criteria included confirmation of coronary heart disease or MI and the presence of left ventricular function more than 35% or an LVEF of 30% to 35% with NYHA class I. Exclusion criteria included a history of cardiac arrest not associated with acute MI, current or planned ICD, or life expectancy less than 6 months. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study was approved by the institutional review board at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The primary end point was SAD. All deaths were classified according to timing and mechanism in accordance with criteria by Hinkle and Thaler.

6, 7 A definite sudden cardiac death was defined as a death or fatal cardiac arrest occurring within 1 hour of symptom onset without evidence for a noncardiac cause by history or autopsy. Baseline characteristics for participants enrolled in the PRE-DETERMINE Study are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the cohort was 64 years. Most patients were classified as NYHA class I at baseline and the mean LVEF was 52%. Decreasing LVEF was associated with progressive elevations in the cumulative incidence of both SAD and non-SAD. By comparison, increasing NYHA functional class was associated with a graded increased incidence of non-SAD, whereas SAD rates were only elevated among patients with NYHA class III/IV. The 4-year cumulative incidences of SAD and non-SAD across all clinical subgroups are listed in Table 2.

By comparison, advancing age and NYHA functional class II were more strongly associated with an increased risk for non-SAD compared with SAD. With advancing age, the relative risk of non-SAD increased while the relative risk of SAD only marginally increased, and therefore the proportion of deaths that were SAD declined with increasing age.

### IIIB or not IIIB: a previously unanswered question [^115rE2Xd]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2012). Low credibility.

The term New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIB has been used increasingly in clinical medicine, including as an inclusion criteria for many clinical trials assessing left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Indeed, NYHA class IIIB is incorporated in the Food and Drug Administration's approved indication for the Heartmate II. However, on review of the medical literature, we found that there is no consensus definition of NYHA class IIIB. Until the ambiguity is resolved, we suggest that this designation not be used in clinical practice or by investigators leading clinical trials assessing therapies which convey substantial risk to patients and therefore require clarity in describing the enrolled patient population. With ongoing improvements in LVADs, this therapy will increasingly be considered in patients less sick than those who require inotropic support, providing urgency to establish a consensus system of classifying such patients who nevertheless fall within the spectrum of advanced heart failure. Herein we propose a modification of the standard NYHA classification system which can be used to fill this void.

### Clinical implications of the New York heart association classification [^116jpSR9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A simple functional classification of heart failure (HF) patients first suggested by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) has been used clinically for almost a century. 1 It has long served as a foundational tool for risk stratification of HF and determines clinical trial eligibility and candidacy for drugs and devices. Whereas it is widely acknowledged that NYHA classification is subjective and has low reproducibility, its use is ingrained in both guidelines and contemporary practice, and it serves as a cornerstone of clinical documentation, trial enrollment, and candidacy for therapeutics in HF. 2, 3 This use has implications for the success of further interventions: currently on, 304 ongoing studies have the NYHA classification as an inclusion or exclusion criterion. As a result, guideline recommendations and FDA approval of invasive interventions such as cardiac resynchronization therapy, implantable pulmonary artery pressure monitoring (CardioMEMS HF System (Abbott)), and left ventricular assist devices are firmly anchored in NYHA class. 4, 5, 6

Despite the ubiquity of the NYHA classification system in HF, its clinical implications are less clear. There is no consistent method for accurate assessment of functional class, and its relations with objective measures of HF (eg, NT‐proBNP [N‐terminal pro–B‐type natriuretic peptide]) are unknown. 7 Consequently, we sought to examine the association of NYHA class with adverse outcomes and objective measures of HF in previously published landmark clinical trials.

Heart failure classification and NYHA functional classes — use at implantation decision on optimized therapy: NYHA functional class on optimized guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) "should be utilized", and the patient's NYHA class at the time of the decision to implant should be used; if left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is present without heart failure (HF) symptoms, it "should be coded as 'class I'. Table definitions are: Class I — no limitation with ordinary activity; Class II — slight limitation, comfortable at rest, ordinary activity causes symptoms; Class III — marked limitation, comfortable at rest, less than ordinary activity causes symptoms; Class IV — unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort, symptoms may be present at rest. Ambulatory NYHA class IV is defined as class IV HF with no active acute coronary syndrome, no inotropes, and on GDMT.

### Aldosterone antagonists improve ejection fraction and functional capacity independently of functional class: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113asjNT]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Current guidelines recommend the use of aldosterone antagonists (AA) in patients with moderately severe to severe symptoms [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III to IV] and systolic heart failure.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of AA in improving ejection fraction (EF) and functional capacity and to assess whether this effect was influenced by baseline NYHA classification.

Study Design

Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Data extraction performed independently by two researchers.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library.

Study Selection

Prospective randomized controlled trials using AA were included if there was a clear description of the baseline NYHA classification and change in EF in patients from study initiation to completion.

Results

Data from 1,575 patients enrolled in fourteen studies were included. Overall, there was a weighted mean improvement in EF of 3.2% and in NYHA classification of 0.13 in subjects treated with AA when compared to controls (p < 0.001). A mixed effects meta-regression analysis revealed that baseline NYHA was not predictive of improvement in EF (p = 0.67) nor NYHA status (p = 0.18).

Conclusions

The results of this meta-analysis suggest that AA is associated with significant improvements in EF and functional class independent of baseline functional capacity. This supports and expands on the recently published EMPHASIS-HF trial and suggests that the current restriction of AA use to patients with NYHA class III-IV symptoms should be reconsidered.

The association between higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and poor outcome in heart failure (HF) is well known. However, to what extent these associations are confounded by covariates such as age, the severity of disease, and co-morbidity burden is unknown. In the Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) trial, 2,441 of the 7,788 patients with chronic HF had NYHA class III or IV symptoms. Propensity scores for NYHA classes III and IV were calculated for each patient and were then used to match 1,863 patients in NYHA classes III and IV with 1,863 patients in NYHA classes I and II. Kaplan-Meier and matched Cox regression analyses were used to estimate associations of NYHA class III or IV with mortality and hospitalizations during a median of 37 months of follow-up. Compared with 34% (641 of 1,863) patients in NYHA classes I and II (mortality rate 1,175 in 10,000 person-years of follow-up), 42% (777 of 1,863) patients in NYHA classes III and IV (mortality rate 1,505 in 10,000 person-years) died from all causes (hazard ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 1.45, p < 0.0001). Hospitalizations due to all causes occurred in 66% (1,232 of 1,863) patients in NYHA classes I and II (hospitalization rate 3,898 in 10,000 person-years) and 71% (1,322 of 1,863) patients in NYHA classes III and IV (hospitalization rate 4,793 in 10,000 person-years) (hazard ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.28, p = 0.003). The hazard ratios for patients in NYHA classes III and IV, compared with those for those in NYHA classes I and II, for other outcomes were 1.29 for cardiovascular mortality (95% CI 1.12 to 1.48, p < 0.0001), 1.49 for HF mortality (95% CI 1.20 to 1.84, p < 0.0001), 1.18 for cardiovascular hospitalization (95% CI 1.06 to 1.32, p = 0.002), and 1.17 for HF hospitalization (95% CI 1.03 to 1.34, p = 0.017). In conclusion, baseline NYHA class is a marker of hospitalization, disease progression, and mortality in a wide spectrum of ambulatory patients with chronic HF.

### Integrating the 6-minute walk test into New York heart association functional classification [^111PESiu]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification System is integral to guiding management of patients with heart failure. However, reproducibility remains a challenge due to subjective assessment of patient functional capacity based on self-reported symptoms and clinical interpretations. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT), involving walking as far as possible in 6 minutes, represents a simple, objective functional assessment tool.

Objective

Determine the clinical utility of the 6MWT in improving reproducibility of cardiologist-assigned NYHA classification.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study. After performing a 6MWT, adults with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension were reassessed for NYHA classification.

Results

Of 56 participants, 25 were classified as NYHA Class I, 21 as NYHA Class II, 9 as NYHA Class III, and 1 as NYHA Class IV at baseline. The 6MWT resulted in redistribution of 15 participants in NYHA Class I, 21 participants in NYHA Class II, 16 participants in NYHA Class III, and 4 participants in NYHA Class IV. Participants were predominantly reclassified to higher NYHA classes (25/56 (45%)) while 4/56 (7%) received a lower NYHA Class. 6-minute walk distance was negatively correlated with NYHA Class, particularly between NYHA Classes I and II which are often difficult to differentiate. Traditional cardiac risk factors (age, sex, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking) or history of invasive procedures (pacemakers, stents, valve replacements) were not associated with effect on the 6MWT.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the 6MWT reveals more severe functional impairment than expected by relying solely on patient-reported symptoms and clinical judgment.

### Shengmai (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) for heart failure [^113Pxpn8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This systemic review is an update of a review previously published in 2011. Heart failure is a major public health problem worldwide. Shengmai (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) has long been used as a complementary treatment for heart failure in China.

Objectives

To assess the effects (both benefits and harms) of Shengmai for heart failure.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL and DARE on The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to March 2011), EMBASE (1980 to March 2011), AMED (1985 to August 2008) (AMED was not searched for the update as it is no longer available to the person conducting the searches), BIOSIS (1969 to March 2011), CBM (1978 to April 2011), VIP (1989 to April 2011) and CNKI (1979 to April 2011). We also handsearched Chinese journals. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Shengmai plus usual treatment versus usual treatment alone or Shengmai versus placebo in treating heart failure, irrespective of blinding status, were included. More stringent inclusion criteria were applied in this update and only studies with a clear description of randomization methods and classified as true RCTs were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Dichotomous and continuous data were calculated as relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD), respectively. A random-effects model and fixed-effect model were used to perform meta-analysis with and without heterogeneity, respectively.

Main Results

Nine RCTs (600 patients) with seven comparing Shengmai plus usual treatment with usual treatment alone and three comparing Shengmai with placebo (one RCT contained three arms) were included in this updated review. Based upon the seven RCTs (494 patients), improvement of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification was more common in patients taking Shengmai plus usual treatment than in those receiving usual treatment alone (risk ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.47). Beneficial effects of Shengmai in treating heart failure were also observed on other outcomes, including an exercise test, ejection fraction, cardiac output, cardiac index and left ventricular end-systolic volume. The three RCTs (106 patients) which compared Shengmai with placebo reported an improvement in NYHA functional classification, ejection fraction, stroke volume, cardiac index and myocardial contractility. Three out of the nine RCTs reported mild adverse effects, and two patients were withdrawn due to the adverse effects. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution. This is due to the studies being of low quality, their small sample size, and the significant heterogeneity for certain outcomes including ejection fraction and cardiac output.

Authors' Conclusions

Shengmai may be beneficial in treating heart failure, especially in terms of improving the NYHA functional classification with Shengmai plus usual treatment. However, the evidence for its effects on mortality and hospitalisation are not available yet. Therefore more studies, of higher quality and long-term follow-up, are needed to provide more evidence for the future use of Shengmai.

### Clinical implications of the New York heart association classification [^1149VrJG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The NYHA classification system is an unreliable predictor of adverse outcomes in HF and poorly discriminates among patients across the spectrum of functional impairment. Its continued usage in guidelines, clinical trials, for US Food and Drug Administration approval of therapies, and for clinical decision making may hinder our progress toward bringing precision medicine to the bedside of HF patients.

### Clinical implications of the New York heart association classification [^114db97g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This analysis of 4 landmark HF trials demonstrates that the NYHA system poorly differentiates patients across the spectrum of functional impairment. In this report, we examined both the macro‐ and microimplications of the NYHA classification system across the spectrum of HF and found that it is an unreliable predictor of survival and a poor discriminator of functional impairment in HF. A heterogeneity of risk is strikingly clear in similar NYHA classifications across studies from lower risk (eg, HF‐ACTION) to higher risk (eg, GUIDE IT) and across trials including patients with HF reduced and preserved ejection fraction, implying that the prognostic value of NYHA classification is largely dependent on the baseline risk of the patient in which it is assessed. This suggestion is contrary to the general assumption that the NYHA classification is an accurate measure of mortality risk and is consistent across studies for patients of a similar class.

Whereas the heterogeneity of NYHA class across trials is a recognized consequence of differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria of the studies assessed and the heterogeneity of risk in these studies, use of NYHA symptom severity by regulatory bodies does not necessarily take this limitation into consideration. Once clinical trials are completed, therapies may be approved for specific NYHA classes and suggested based on post hoc analyses of the data. 14 For example, the CardioMEMS HF System is presently approved for NYHA class III, and a clinical trial with expected enrollment of 3600 is ongoing to extend its approval to NYHA class II patients (NCT03387813). Our findings suggest it is time to revisit the use of NYHA class to guide enrollment into trials and approval for therapy on its basis.

Other more objective and better calibrated measures of disease severity and patient‐reported symptoms such as the KCCQ, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, and biomarkers might be better suited to guide enrollment strategies and to appraise the impact of therapeutic interventions on patient symptoms.

Although the median levels of almost all objective HF parameters differed significantly between NYHA classes II and III, there was immense overlap in values. These findings, along with the longstanding recognition that the NYHA classification system has poor reproducibility, raise the question of whether our care of HF patients might be enhanced if we elevated the clinical use of disease descriptors that are more objective and precise. 3 Furthermore, these limitations make its centrality to the HF guidelines potentially inconsistent with the goal of improving patient care.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^116S8giz]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

QM-2 rationale and guidance state that improving symptoms is a fundamental goal best quantified by directly asking patients, and disease-specific patient-reported outcomes (PROs) — for example, MLHFQ or KCCQ — are recommended because they are more sensitive to clinical change than general measures and are predictive of outcomes such as mortality, hospitalization, and costs. Knowledge of a patient's reported health status may prompt medication changes, and although the ACC/AHA have not addressed PRO tool selection, the FDA has provided guidelines and currently, 2 heart failure survey tools — the MLHFQ and the KCCQ — are considered qualified tools for FDA device use in heart failure. As a process measure, no risk-adjustment methods are required; it is required as a foundation for outcomes-based performance measure and is paired with QM-3. The 2013 ACCF/AHA heart failure clinical practice guideline notes that the ACCF/AHA heart failure guideline modifies several recommendations based on the health status of the patient, usually quantified by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification.

### Is the severity of congenital heart disease associated with the quality of life and perceived health of adult patients? [^116Yecfc]. Heart (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore whether the severity of congenital heart disease is associated with the quality of life and perceived health status of adult patients.

Design

Descriptive, cross sectional study.

Setting

Adult congenital heart disease programme in one tertiary care centre in Belgium.

Patients

629 patients (378 men, 251 women) with a median age of 24 years.

Main Outcome Measures

Disease severity was operationalized in terms of initial diagnosis (classification of Task Force 1 of the 32nd Bethesda Conference), illness course (disease severity index), and current functional status (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ability index, congenital heart disease functional index, and left ventricular ejection fraction). Quality of life was measured by a linear analogue scale, the satisfaction with life scale, and the schedule for evaluation of individual quality of life. Perceived health status was also assessed with a linear analogue scale.

Results

Scores derived from the disease severity classification systems were weakly negatively associated with quality of life and health status, ranging from -0.05 to -0.27. The NYHA functional class and ability index were consistently associated with quality of life and perceived health.

Conclusions

This study showed that the severity of congenital heart disease is marginally associated with patients' quality of life and perceived health. Functional status was more related to patients' assessment of their quality of life than was the initial diagnosis or illness course.

### New York heart association class and Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire in acute heart failure [^114kdfJR]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification has been widely used for heart failure (HF) symptom severity assessment since the 1920s. It is ingrained in guidelines and clinical practice, and NYHA class has served as the benchmark for risk stratification, trial enrollment, and treatment candidacy determination. However, there has been recognition of its potential limitations (eg, marked interobserver variability and limited reproducibility), and its prognostic relevance has been questioned increasingly. Since the inception of NYHA class, patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures have evolved substantially. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is an extensively validated PRO instrument for quantitatively measuring HF-specific health status.,

However, comparisons between the KCCQ and NYHA classification among patients with acute HF in clinical practice remain unknown. Few studies have reported the prognostic value of PROs compared with NYHA and their conflicts, and the results have been affected by some limitations, such as inclusion of patients exclusively with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction, short-term outcomes, and use of a general health survey rather than an HF-specific instrument (eg, KCCQ). In 2015, a shorter version of KCCQ, KCCQ-12, reduced the original 23-item questionnaire to 12 items, taking half the time to complete and increasing feasibility, particularly in acute care settings. Given the rapid progress of symptom severity in HF, it would be informative to compare the concordance in NYHA class and KCCQ-12 and the long-term outcome values associated with their early changes. Accordingly, using data from a nationwide cohort of patients with acute HF, we aimed to (1) characterize the level of concordance between admission NYHA class and KCCQ and assess correlations between them, (2) describe patterns of changes in NYHA class and KCCQ over time, and (3) compare the association of changes in NYHA class and KCCQ for long-term outcomes.

### Quality-adjusted life year weights among elderly patients with heart failure [^113C6zVr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2008). Low credibility.

Background

When assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in elderly patients with heart failure (HF), the process of obtaining quality-adjusted life year (QALY) weights is generally complicated and time-consuming.

Aim

To evaluate whether information regarding HRQoL and QALY weights can be derived directly from the established and widely used New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system.

Methods

NYHA functional status was assessed independently both by the individual patients and by the examining cardiologist in 323 elderly patients with symptoms of HF recruited from primary care. HRQoL was evaluated using the SF-36 questionnaire and a time trade-off (TTO) scenario. The TTO technique generates direct QALY weights.

Results

Both the TTO technique and SF-36 values demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with NYHA functional status. The TTO values also correlated with all SF-36 dimensions. Increasing impairment was associated with statistically significant drops in both SF-36 values and TTO-based QALY weights. For patients in NYHA classes I-IV the QALY weights were 0.77, 0.68, 0.61, and 0.50, respectively. Thus in elderly patients, symptoms of HF have a major impact on perceived quality of life.

Conclusion

The results of the present study show that QALY weights, an important instrument in the health economic evaluation of treatment strategies, can be derived directly from NYHA classification in elderly HF patients.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117XZpJi]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guideline — NYHA functional classification is used to grade symptom-based functional limitation and select candidates for treatment. The NYHA functional classification can be used to grade the severity of functional limitation based on patient report of symptoms experienced with activity and is used to define candidates for certain treatments. NYHA functional classification is an ordinal, categorical variable (I-IV) that is used to document functional limitation in patients with cardiac disease, including heart failure (HF). In HF, NYHA functional class I includes patients with no limitations in physical activity resulting from their HF; class II includes patients who are comfortable at rest but have slight symptoms resulting from HF with ordinary activity; class III includes patients who are comfortable at rest but have symptoms of HF with less than ordinary activity; and class IV includes patients who are unable to carry out any physical activity without symptoms and have symptoms at rest. NYHA functional classification has been widely used in clinical practice, clinical trials, and clinical practice guidelines to determine candidacy for drug and device therapy, although limitations include its ability to be inconsistently assessed from 1 clinician to another, resulting in poor reproducibility.

### Trajectories in New York heart association functional class in heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum: data from the Swedish heart failure registry [^111qniuE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcome analyses

The primary outcome of the current analysis was all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were CV mortality and first HF hospitalization, with censoring at competing deaths. The outcomes data have full coverage in Sweden but censoring was performed in the event of emigration. The index date for the outcome analysis was defined as the date of the follow‐up NYHA class assessment. Event rates per 100 patient‐years with 95% CI were calculated and compared across patients with stable versus improved versus worsened NYHA class by the exact Poisson test. To assess the associations between NYHA class trajectory and outcomes, survival functions were illustrated by Kaplan–Meier curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models included the variables labelled with an asterisk (*) in Table 1 as covariates (with values taken at the index date for the outcome analyses, i.e. the time of the follow‐up NYHA class assessment), and the time between NYHA class assessments. Separate models were performed adjusting for NYHA class at either baseline ('baseline model') or follow‐up ('follow‐up model'). In a third multivariable model ('stratified model'), NYHA class at baseline and follow‐up was dichotomized as NYHA class I–II (low) or III–IV (high), and trajectories were analysed as low–low, low–high, high–low, and high–high. Results were reported as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI. The differences in the associations between NYHA class change trajectory and outcomes across the EF phenotypes were assessed by including an interaction term between NYHA class trajectory and EF phenotype in the models. Three sensitivity analyses were performed where we considered (1) only patients who were encountered as outpatients both at the baseline and follow‐up NYHA class assessments; (2) only patients whose time between NYHA class assessments was < 1 year; and (3) only patients with NYHA class II–III at baseline to minimize floor and ceiling effects.

All analyses were performed using the statistical software R version 4.0.4. A two‐sided p ‐value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Clinical implications of the universal definition for the prevention and treatment of heart failure [^1163dMBo]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1.1 Heart failure definitions — An evolving concept

As highlighted in Figure 1, the definition of HF has significantly evolved and expanded over time. Early definitions referred to it as "a condition in which the heart fails to discharge its contents adequately", — essentially confining the case definition to those presenting as HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Today, HF is typically, but not uniformly, defined as a clinical syndrome (i.e. recognizable patterns of signs and symptoms) that is related to any functional and/or structural cardiac impairment, resulting in reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressure at rest or during stress. Yet, for research purposes, case definitions of HF (e.g. Framingham criteria) include an objective left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) threshold, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, previous hospitalization, and sometimes even natriuretic peptides are preferred for clinical trial enrolment.

### Outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy by New York heart association class: a patient-level meta-analysis [^116kP93Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Although our analysis included the largest number of patients in NYHA class IV (302 patients) to date, and it was conducted at the patient level, some limitations should be acknowledged. The power of this study was limited by the relatively small number of patients in NYHA class IV. For this reason, we were underpowered in our interaction analysis, further highlighting the need for new studies with greater recruitment of patients with advanced HF symptoms.

It should be acknowledged that assessment of the NYHA class is subjective and may not be accurate, and this may have biased the results toward the null. If future studies can enroll a large number of patients with NYHA class IV symptoms, they may be able to look for a graded response to CRT, an analysis we were not able to do in the current study. However, NYHA classification is frequently used in clinical practice and clinical trials, and as such, our results are not only reflective of what takes place in usual care, but they are relevant to clinicians.

Studies included in this analysis were published more than a decade ago; medical therapy of patients with HF and CRT devices and implantation techniques have evolved drastically since the publication of those trials. Whether and how contemporary CRT technology and medical therapy for patients with advanced HF might impact the outcomes of CRT is uncertain. It will be important to understand the relationship between NYHA class and CRT outcomes in contemporary patients receiving goal‐directed medical therapy. Other important end points such as quality of life and implant‐related complications were not reported in a sufficient number of studies for this meta‐analysis, and procedural complications that are higher in patients with more advanced HF might influence the net clinical benefit from CRT. Although the end points of the trials were all independently adjudicated by blinded clinical end point committees, end point definitions varied slightly across the trials. Although advanced Bayesian techniques were applied to account for this heterogeneity, the possibility of confounding cannot be ruled out.
