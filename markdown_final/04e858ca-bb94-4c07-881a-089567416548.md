## Question

How often to do PSA for prostate Cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often PSA screening should be done for prostate cancer and how to tailor the interval based on risk, age, and prior PSA results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality guideline sources and the core evidence base. Then, I should verify the recommended screening interval for average-risk men aged 55–69. Next, I will consider how to adjust frequency based on baseline PSA and risk stratification. After that, I need to check age-related considerations, including when to start and when to stop. Finally, I should confirm what to do with an elevated PSA and how to integrate shared decision-making and MRI-first pathways into the plan.

> Let me first confirm the foundation. The most authoritative, evidence-based interval for average-risk men aged 50–69 is every 2–4 years, supported by the AUA/SUO 2023 guideline and informed by ERSPC and Göteborg-1 showing reductions in metastatic disease and prostate cancer mortality with regular PSA screening in that age range, which directly addresses the "how often" question for the typical population [^116NQTjS].

> Wait, let me verify the USPSTF stance so I don't overstate anything. The USPSTF gives a C recommendation for men 55–69 to make an individualized decision after discussing benefits and harms, and a D recommendation against routine screening at age 70 and older; it does not specify a precise interval, but in practice aligns with 2–4 year spacing when screening is chosen, reinforcing the same cadence without mandating it [^112vm4Rq] [^113dMF98].

> I should double-check the rationale for not screening annually. Modeling and trial designs suggest that biennial or quadrennial screening preserves most of the mortality benefit while substantially reducing false positives, unnecessary biopsies, and overdiagnosis; the ERSPC used a 4-year interval and still showed benefit, and cost-effectiveness modeling supports longer intervals to mitigate harms, so annual screening is generally not favored for average-risk men [^1166SAqe] [^117V7Q7Q].

> Next, I will examine risk-adapted intervals based on baseline PSA. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds. For men with very low PSA, especially PSA less than 1.0 ng/mL at around age 60, extending the interval up to 8 years or even stopping further screening is reasonable because the long-term risk of clinically significant cancer is extremely low; conversely, men with higher baseline PSA, particularly above the age-specific median, carry higher future risk and may warrant shorter intervals or closer follow-up, consistent with EAU and risk-modeling literature [^115UUJaF] [^111DZPBh] [^114zrvj9].

> Let me consider high-risk groups. I need to ensure I'm not implying a different interval is proven, because the evidence is limited; however, expert guidance supports earlier discussions and, in some cases, earlier baseline PSA testing for Black men and those with strong family history, with the same 2–4 year interval applied in the screening years but with heightened vigilance and shared decision-making given their higher incidence and mortality burden [^117JmwAA] [^112V81V9].

> I should confirm age-related starting and stopping rules. Starting screening in the mid-40s to early 50s can be considered for shared decision-making, particularly to establish a baseline PSA for risk stratification, but routine population screening is targeted to ages 50–69. Screening should generally stop at age 70 because harms outweigh benefits, and men with life expectancy under 10–15 years are unlikely to benefit and should not be screened [^116NQTjS] [^114mQpzt] [^114a5coV] [^117JmwAA].

> Now, what if the PSA is elevated? Hold on, I should verify the repeat-testing step. After a new elevation, repeating the PSA to confirm persistence is recommended before proceeding to secondary biomarkers, MRI, or biopsy; this reduces false positives and unnecessary procedures, and MRI-first strategies can decrease unnecessary biopsies while improving detection of clinically significant cancer, though long-term outcome impacts remain under study [^117JmwAA] [^117V7Q7Q].

> Let me synthesize practical intervals while keeping the evidence straight. For average-risk men aged 50–69 who choose screening after shared decision-making: every 2–4 years is appropriate. For men with PSA less than 1.0 ng/mL around age 60, consider extending to every 4–8 years or stopping. For men with PSA above the age-specific median or other risk factors, maintain 2–4 year intervals with readiness to shorten if risk evolves. For men 70 and older or with limited life expectancy, stop screening. And always repeat an unexpectedly elevated PSA before further workup [^116NQTjS] [^115UUJaF] [^114mQpzt] [^117JmwAA].

> But wait, what if someone insists on annual testing? I should explain that while annual PSA may detect cancer earlier in some cases, it increases false positives and overdiagnosis without clear additional mortality benefit in randomized data, so the balance favors 2–4 year intervals for most. Shared decision-making tools can help align testing frequency with the patient's values regarding these trade-offs [^1166SAqe] [^114FUe1Z].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is anchored in informed choice. The small absolute mortality benefit, the risks of false positives, biopsies, and treatment-related harms, and the potential for overdiagnosis should be discussed explicitly. Decision aids and clear numeric summaries from USPSTF and related evidence reviews can support this conversation and help patients choose whether to screen and how often to retest in line with their preferences and risk profile [^114mQpzt] [^1157nbPN].

---

PSA testing should be done **every 2–4 years** for men aged 50–69 who choose screening after shared decision-making [^116NQTjS] [^112vm4Rq]. For men with **PSA < 1 ng/mL** at age 60, extend intervals to every 4–8 years or stop screening [^112mNkxS] [^114zrvj9]. For higher-risk men (Black race, family history, or baseline PSA > 1 ng/mL), consider shorter intervals or earlier start, but still avoid annual testing unless clinically indicated. Stop screening at age 70 or when **life expectancy is < 10–15 years** [^114mQpzt] [^115UUJaF]. Always repeat an elevated PSA before further workup to reduce false positives and unnecessary biopsies [^117JmwAA] [^112vm4Rq].

---

## General recommendations for PSA screening frequency

- **Age range**: 50–69 years is the core group for shared decision-making and routine screening [^116NQTjS] [^117JmwAA].
- **Standard interval**: Every 2–4 years is supported by RCTs and guidelines [^116NQTjS] [^112vm4Rq].
- **Annual screening**: Not recommended routinely due to increased false positives, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment [^1166SAqe] [^113iRf9g].

---

## Risk-stratified screening intervals

Risk stratification by baseline PSA and clinical factors can **tailor frequency and reduce harms** [^115UUJaF]:

| **Risk category** | **Baseline psa level** | **Recommended screening interval** |
|-|-|-|
| Low risk | < 1 ng/mL at age 60 | - Extend to every 4–8 years <br/> - Or stop screening [^115UUJaF] [^114zrvj9] |
| Intermediate risk | 1–2 ng/mL | Every 2–4 years [^116NQTjS] [^112vm4Rq] |
| High risk | - > 2 ng/mL <br/> - Or elevated for age | Consider shorter intervals (e.g. every 1–2 years) |

---

## Age-specific considerations

- **< 50 years**: Consider a baseline PSA at 45–50 for risk stratification; routine screening not advised [^117JmwAA] [^112b8sAe].
- **50–69 years**: Standard 2–4 year intervals with shared decision-making [^116NQTjS] [^112vm4Rq].
- **≥ 70 years**: Stop screening; harms outweigh benefits [^114mQpzt] [^113SgBTe].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring more frequent PSA testing

More frequent testing may be appropriate for selected patients: for those on **active surveillance**, monitor every 3–6 months initially, then extend if stable; after treatment, check every 3–6 months for the first 2 years, then annually; and for symptomatic patients, test promptly when symptoms or exam findings raise concern.

---

## Clinical scenarios where PSA testing may be discontinued

Discontinuation is appropriate when **life expectancy is < 10–15 years** or when PSA remains consistently < 1 ng/mL at age 60 with low risk, indicating minimal future risk [^115UUJaF] [^114zrvj9].

---

## Impact of screening frequency on outcomes

More frequent screening can detect cancer earlier but increases false positives, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment; **biennial screening retains most mortality benefit while reducing harms** [^117V7Q7Q] [^113iRf9g].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **USPSTF**: Ages 55–69, individual decision; ≥ 70, do not screen [^114mQpzt] [^113SgBTe].
- **AUA/SUO**: 2–4 year intervals for ages 50–69; shared decision-making [^116NQTjS].
- **ACS**: Individualize intervals by risk; extend if PSA < 2.5 ng/mL [^1149of81] [^1166SAqe].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard interval**: Every 2–4 years for ages 50–69 [^116NQTjS].
- **Low risk**: Extend or stop if PSA < 1 ng/mL at 60 [^112mNkxS] [^114zrvj9].
- **High risk**: Consider shorter intervals, but avoid annual unless indicated.
- **≥ 70 years**: Stop screening [^114mQpzt] [^113SgBTe].
- **Elevated PSA**: Repeat before further workup to limit false positives [^117JmwAA] [^112vm4Rq].

---

PSA screening every 2–4 years for ages 50–69 balances benefits and harms; **individualize by risk, age, and PSA history**, and stop at 70 or when life expectancy is limited.

Prostate-specific antigen screening in high-risk populations — Test positivity generally increases with advancing age; in men younger than age 50 years, test positivity, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, ranges between 2% and 3% and increases up to as high as 28% among men ages 70 years and older, while the prostate cancer detection rate and positive predictive value (PPV) are lower among men younger than age 50 years (1%-2%, and 6%-38%, respectively) compared with older men (13% and 39%-58%, respectively), and specificity decreases with increasing age (from 97% to 98% in younger adults compared with 80% in older adults); in African American men ages 70 to 79 years, based on a 4-ng/mL PSA cutoff, test positivity reportedly may be as high as 54% with a prostate cancer detection rate of 25% and a PPV of 59%.

### Critical appraisal of prostate-specific antigen in prostate cancer screening: 20 years later [^11562deK]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is secreted by all types of prostate epithelial cells and has been used for 2 decades as a biologic marker for prostate cancer (PCa). Since the implementation of PSA screening in the United States, the detection of PCa has increased, accompanied by a decrease in the incidence of high-grade cancer and PCa-specific mortality rates. It has been suggested that these decreases have resulted from the enhanced detection of PCa while still curable. These data have been the impetus for early detection programs, which have recommended the initiation of screening as early as 40 years of age. Despite widespread use, PSA screening remains controversial, principally because of the lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating a mortality benefit that could outweigh the concerns of the costs of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Two ongoing, randomized controlled trials are examining whether screening reduces the risk of PCa-related mortality, and the results of these studies are expected soon. Although it has its limitations, PSA still remains the best-studied marker for the detection of PCa.

Implications for clinicians and policy makers

This systematic review provides important information for an individual man's decision making about prostate cancer screening. It supported the development of an evidence based clinical practice guideline, as reflected in the accompanying Rapid Recommendation article. Our analysis indicates that PSA screening yields, at best, only a small benefit in prostate cancer specific mortality but does not reduce overall mortality. This small benefit should be weighed against the potential short term complications (biopsy related, false positive and false negative findings) and long term downstream effects (treatment related side effects, in particular related to urinary and sexual function). The latest results of the PIVOT and ProtecT trials should help guideline developers identify the subset of patients with clinically localised prostate cancer who will likely benefit from local, curative treatment while avoiding overtreatment. Although active surveillance is increasingly accepted to treat low risk prostate cancer, it is burdensome to patients due to the need for frequent follow-up visits, PSA testing, digital rectal examinations, prostate biopsies, and, recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The value of MRI in determining which prostate cancers appear clinically relevant versus indolent seems promising but remains uncertain in the context of PSA screening.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in asymptomatic men — Don't routinely perform PSA-based screening for prostate cancer. American men are estimated to have a 16% lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer and a 3% risk of dying from prostate cancer, and both the USPSTF and the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care have recommended against routine screening for prostate cancer. There is a slight possible benefit of reducing one death due to prostate cancer by screening 1,000 symptom-free men aged 55 — 69 years for at least 10 years; however, these same 1,000 men would have an estimated 178 men with a false-positive test result, with four experiencing biopsy complications severe enough to require hospitalization. Of the 102 men estimated to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, 33 are estimated to be overdiagnosed, and most of these men would be expected to undergo treatment and experience associated complications, such as urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. Black men have much higher incidence and death rates, but the USPSTF stated there is insufficient evidence in this subgroup to make a different recommendation than for the general U.S. population. The article states that men should only consent to being screened for prostate cancer after they clearly understand the associated benefits and risks, and notes that decision aids may be effective ways to engage men in this conversation.

Importance

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among US men.

Objective

To systematically review evidence on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based prostate cancer screening, treatments for localized prostate cancer, and prebiopsy risk calculators to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Registries and Databases from July 1, 2011, through July 15, 2017, with a surveillance search on February 1, 2018.

Study Selection

English-language reports of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening; cohort studies reporting harms; RCTs and cohort studies of active localized cancer treatments vs conservative approaches (eg, active surveillance, watchful waiting); external validations of prebiopsy risk calculators to identify aggressive cancers.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prostate cancer and all-cause mortality; false-positive screening results, biopsy complications, overdiagnosis; adverse effects of active treatments. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for treatment harms.

Results

Sixty-three studies in 104 publications were included (N = 1 904 950). Randomization to PSA screening was not associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer mortality in either a US trial with substantial control group contamination (n = 76 683) or a UK trial with low adherence to a single PSA screen (n = 408 825) but was associated with significantly reduced prostate cancer mortality in a European trial (n = 162 243; relative risk [RR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69–0.91]; absolute risk reduction, 1.1 deaths per 10 000 person-years [95% CI, 0.5–1.8]). Of 61 604 men screened in the European trial, 17.8% received false-positive results. In 3 cohorts (n = 15 136), complications requiring hospitalization occurred in 0.5% to 1.6% of men undergoing biopsy after abnormal screening findings. Overdiagnosis was estimated to occur in 20.7% to 50.4% of screen-detected cancers. In an RCT of men with screen-detected prostate cancer (n = 1643), neither radical prostatectomy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.21–1.93]) nor radiation therapy (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.15–1.69]) were associated with significantly reduced prostate cancer mortality vs active monitoring, although each was associated with significantly lower risk of metastatic disease. Relative to conservative management, radical prostatectomy was associated with increased risk of urinary incontinence (pooled RR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.82–2.84]; 3 trials; n = 1796) and erectile dysfunction (pooled RR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.62–2.04]; 2 trials; n = 883). Relative to conservative management (8 cohort studies; n = 3066), radiation therapy was associated with increased risk of erectile dysfunction (pooled RR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.20–1.42]).

Conclusions and Relevance

PSA screening may reduce prostate cancer mortality risk but is associated with false-positive results, biopsy complications, and overdiagnosis. Compared with conservative approaches, active treatments for screen-detected prostate cancer have unclear effects on long-term survival but are associated with sexual and urinary difficulties.

### Decision aids for prostate cancer screening choice: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FUe1Z]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Owing to increasing use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, the incidence of early-stage prostate cancer has increased during the last 25 years. Advocates of screening often cite the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) — of the available trials, the one at lowest risk of bias — that suggested that PSA screening reduces prostate cancer–specific mortality but not overall mortality. Opponents of screening often cite an earlier meta-analysisor other major trials, that reported no association between PSA screening and prostate cancer–specific mortality and point out possible harms associated with surgery or radiotherapy.

Men's choice of whether to undergo prostate cancer screening is sensitive to their values and preferences: that is, fully informed men will make different choices depending on their experience and perspective. For such decisions, shared decision-making, characterized by cooperative communication between patient and clinician in which they share knowledge, values, and preferences, represents an ideal approach to decision-making. Major guidelines therefore acknowledge the importance of informing men about the risks and benefits of PSA screening. The US Preventive Services Task Force has recently recommended that the decision to undergo prostate cancer screening should be an individual one in which men should discuss potential benefits and harms with their clinician before screening and recommended that men who do not express a clear preference for screening should not be screened. Even more recently, a BMJ Rapid Recommendations' panel made a weak recommendation against systematic PSA screening that acknowledged the need for shared decision-making.

Shared decision-making is challenging because of time constraints and the specific skills that it requires. Well-designed decision aids may, at least in part, address these challenges by summarizing the current best evidence and by supporting conversations that address the issues that matter most to patients. The association of decision aids with the decision-making process remains, however, uncertain. We therefore undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) — many of which were conducted before major PSA trials, such as ERSPC, were published — that have addressed the effect of decision aids on the decision-making process in the context of prostate cancer screening.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1149of81]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer screening recommendations — men who choose to be screened after considering benefits and risks should follow these directives: Screening is recommended with PSA with or without DRE; screening should be conducted yearly for men whose PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or greater; for men whose PSA is less than 2.5 ng/mL, screening intervals can be extended to every 2 years; a PSA level of 4.0 ng/mL or greater historically has been used to recommend referral for further evaluation or biopsy, which remains a reasonable approach for men at average risk for prostate cancer; for PSA levels between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL, health care providers should consider an individualized risk assessment that incorporates other risk factors and may be used to recommend a biopsy, noting that African American race, family history of prostate cancer, increasing age, and abnormal DRE increase risk and that a previous negative biopsy lowers risk.

### The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA [^1177pw2c]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2017). Medium credibility.

Guidelines regarding recommendations for PSA screening for early detection of prostate cancer are conflicting. In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigned a grade of D (recommending against screening) for men aged ≥ 75 years in 2008 and for men of all ages in 2012. Understanding temporal trends in rates of screening before and after the 2012 recommendation in terms of usage patterns in PSA screening, changes in prostate cancer incidence and biopsy patterns, and how the recommendation has influenced physician's and men's attitudes about PSA screening and subsequent ordering of other screening tests is essential within the scope of prostate cancer screening policy. Since the 2012 recommendation, rates of PSA screening decreased by 3–10% in all age groups and across most geographical regions of the USA. Rates of prostate biopsy and prostate cancer incidence have declined in unison, with a shift towards tumours being of higher grade and stage upon detection. Despite the recommendation, some physicians report ongoing willingness to screen appropriately selected men, and many men report intending to continue to ask for the PSA test from their physician. In the coming years, we expect to have an improved understanding of whether these decreased rates of screening will affect prostate cancer metastasis and mortality.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113SgBTe]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prostate cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, general population, age > 70 years, USPSTF 2018 guidelines recommend to do not obtain PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in males aged ≥ 70 years.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^114a5coV]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

American Cancer Society guideline — shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening emphasizes involving men in whether to initiate and continue testing and states that men must have a basic understanding of the potential benefits of early detection, the strengths and limitations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, and the risks of finding and treating screen-detected cancer. Health care providers can and should play a critical role, and we encourage providers and patients to use prostate cancer screening decision aids; for men who are unable to decide, the screening decision can be left to the discretion of the health care provider, who should factor into the decision his or her knowledge of the patient's general health preferences and values. In view of the delay between diagnosis through screening and the expected mortality benefit, we continue to recommend that men whose life expectancy is less than 10 years not pursue prostate cancer early detection, noting that the likelihood of benefit in these men is sufficiently low to be outweighed by the risk of harms from treatment in the near term.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen–based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^1115e9Wd]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

An additional benefit of screening is the reduction in metastases at diagnosis and after diagnosis. Effects of risk-stratified screening on this endpoint, and implications for quality of life, should be examined in future research.

Less intensive PSA screening in men with low PSA levels can substantially reduce the testing burden. The specific quantitative impact on overdiagnosis and lives saved is sensitive to the model used, but both models project that stratifying screening by PSA level is expected to reduce overdiagnosis by a modest amount while preserving the majority of the benefit of screening. Depending on how these harms and benefits are valued, our results confirm that PSA-based stratification could lead to more efficient use of the PSA test in early detection of prostate cancer.

### Baseline prostate-specific antigen testing at a young age [^116aUrzp]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Prostate cancer screening is highly controversial, including the age to begin prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Several studies have evaluated the usefulness of baseline PSA measurements at a young age.

Objective

Review the literature on baseline PSA testing at a young age (≤ 60 yr) for the prediction of prostate cancer risk and prognosis.

Evidence Acquisition

PubMed was searched for English-language publications on baseline PSA and prostate cancer for the period ending April 2011.

Evidence Synthesis

In most published series, median PSA levels in the general male population range from approximately 0.4 to 0.7 ng/ml in men in their 40s and from approximately 0.7 to 1.0 ng/ml in men in their 50s. Evidence from both nonscreening and screening populations has demonstrated the predictive value of a single baseline PSA measurement for prostate cancer risk assessment. Specifically, men with baseline PSA levels above the age-group-specific median have a greater risk of prostate cancer diagnosis during the next 20–25 yr. Additional studies confirmed that higher baseline PSA levels at a young age are also associated with a greater risk of aggressive disease, metastasis, and disease-specific mortality many years later.

Conclusions

Baseline PSA measurements at a young age are significant predictors of later prostate cancer diagnosis and disease-specific outcomes. Thus baseline PSA testing may be used for risk stratification and to guide screening protocols.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111YHZ1h]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF prostate cancer screening — estimated effects after 13 years for inviting men aged 55 to 69 years to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening indicate that among 1000 men invited, 240 have at least 1 positive PSA test result, 220 have undergone 1 or more transrectal prostate biopsies, 2 are hospitalized for a biopsy complication, 100 are diagnosed with prostate cancer, 3 avoid metastatic prostate cancer, 5 die of prostate cancer despite screening, diagnosis, and treatment, and 1.3 avoid dying of prostate cancer; estimates are based on benefits observed in the ERSPC trial and on treatment harms derived from pooled absolute rates.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117TKupa]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — estimate of net benefit from decision analysis: Conclusions consistent with randomized trials and cohort studies suggest that more aggressive strategies, particularly those using a lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) threshold for biopsy than generally used in the United States, provide the greatest potential reduction in death from prostate cancer; however, these strategies are also associated with more false positives, more biopsies, and higher rates of overdiagnosis, and options to reduce overdiagnosis include lowering the age at which to stop screening, extending the interval between screenings, and using higher PSA thresholds for biopsy. Decision analysis models confirm that the overall benefit of PSA-based screening is sensitive to the values of individual men, and the magnitude of net benefit depends on how each man weighs the potential benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Impact of the United States preventive services task force' D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging [^115H79oc]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a grade 'D' recommendation against the use of routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for any men. This recommendation reflects critical misinterpretations of the available evidence base regarding benefits and harms of PSA screening and has influenced the nationwide landscape of prostate cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment.

Recent Findings

Following the USPSTF recommendation, a substantial decline in PSA screening was noted for all age groups. Similarly, overall rates of prostate biopsy and prostate cancer incidence have significantly decreased with a shift toward higher grade and stage disease upon diagnosis. Concurrently, the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has significantly risen in the United States. These trends are concerning particularly for the younger men with occult high-grade disease who are expected to benefit the most from early detection and definitive prostate cancer treatment.

Summary

These emerging trends in PSA screening and prostate cancer incidence following the USPSTF recommendation may have significant public health implications. Due to the long natural history of the disease, a long-term follow-up is needed to provide a better understanding on the implications of such recommendations on disease progression and mortality rates in prostate cancer patients. The future of US screening policy should reflect a targeted 'smarter' screening strategy rather than dichotomizing the decision between 'screen all' or 'screen none'.

### Risk stratification in prostate cancer screening [^117PRMj4]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2013). Medium credibility.

Screening for prostate cancer is a controversial topic within the field of urology. The US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial did not demonstrate any difference in prostate-cancer-related mortality rates between men screened annually rather than on an 'opportunistic' basis. However, in the world's largest trial to date — the European Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer — screening every 2–4 years was associated with a 21% reduction in prostate-cancer-related mortality rate after 11 years. Citing the uncertain ratio between potential harm and potential benefit, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended against serum PSA screening. Although this ratio has yet to be elucidated, PSA testing — and early tumour detection — is undoubtedly beneficial for some individuals. Instead of adopting a 'one size fits all' approach, physicians are likely to perform personalized risk assessment to minimize the risk of negative consequences, such as anxiety, unnecessary testing and biopsies, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. The PSA test needs to be combined with other predictive factors or be used in a more thoughtful way to identify men at risk of symptomatic or life-threatening cancer, without overdiagnosing indolent disease. A risk-adapted approach is needed, whereby PSA testing is tailored to individual risk.

### The politics of prostate cancer screening [^111koSPy]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The controversial recent recommendation by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for early-stage prostate cancer has caused much debate. Whereas USPSTF recommendations against routine screening mammography in younger women resulted in fierce public outcry and eventual alteration in the language of the recommendation, the same public and political response has not been seen with PSA screening for prostate cancer. It is of paramount importance to ensure improved efficiency and transparency of the USPSTF recommendation process, and resolution of concerns with the current USPSTF recommendation against PSA screening for all ages.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115jPf5c]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Benefits of PSA-based screening from randomized trials — Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened and may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened. Current results from screening trials show no reductions in all-cause mortality from screening. There is inadequate evidence to assess whether the benefits for African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer aged 55 to 69 years are different than the benefits for the average-risk population, and there is also inadequate evidence to assess whether there are benefits to starting screening in these high-risk groups before age 55 years. Adequate evidence from RCTs is consistent with no benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer on prostate cancer mortality in men 70 years and older.

Understanding the recommendation

The recommendation against PSA screening is weak because of the small and uncertain benefits of screening on prostate cancer mortality and the large variability in men's values and preferences. In practice, a weak recommendation means that shared decision making is important. Clinicians should support men considering screening to make a well informed decision in line with their own risk profile and individual values and preferences. Another implication of our weak recommendation is that clinicians do not need to raise the issue systematically with their patients. They could raise PSA screening or wait for the patient to raise the issue. Both approaches are reasonable. It depends on the patient's context and competing issues in each clinical encounter.

The panel believes that most informed men considering screening would decline it, although some would choose to undergo screening, accepting the diagnostic and therapeutic burden and harms that can result.

Absolute benefits and harms

The main infographic explains the recommendation and provides an overview of the absolute benefits and harms of screening at a 10 year time horizon for consistency and easier communication. However, the individual trials varied in their duration of follow-up from 10 to 20 years (fig 2), and we used the relative estimates of effect, pooled in the linked systematic review, at the longest available follow-up time. For the 10 year time horizon, we used as baseline risk in the non-screening arm of the CAP trial. It provided the most contemporary estimates of risks from a large sample of men representative of a general practice setting.

### Strategy for detection of prostate cancer based on relation between prostate specific antigen at age 40–55 and long term risk of metastasis: case-control study [^112L2YWK]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

PSA concentrations can indicate not only the current risk of cancer — and hence the need for prostate biopsy — but are also predictive of the future risk of prostate cancer metastasis and cancer specific death. Screening programmes can be designed to focus on men at highest risk, with three lifetime PSA tests between the ages of 45 and 60 sufficient for at least half of the male population. This is likely to reduce the risk of overdiagnosis while still enabling early cancer detection among those most likely to gain from early diagnosis. As such, a risk stratified approach to PSA screening will improve the ratio of its benefits and harms.

### Association of the USPSTF grade D recommendation against prostate-specific antigen screening with prostate cancer-specific mortality [^117CeLKA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer remains the most common cancer diagnosed for men in the United States, with an estimated 248 530 new cases and 34 130 deaths in 2021. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) provides recommendations regarding the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer. More recently, with evidence that the lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis far outweighed the lifetime risk of prostate cancer death, as well as concerns of overdiagnosis or overtreatment, the USPSTF recommended against PSA screening for men older than 75 years in 2008and subsequently transitioned to a Grade D recommendation against PSA screening for all men in 2012 (draft statement released October 2011).

This recommendation against PSA screening has remained controversial. Several studies have demonstrated that, in the years after the Grade D recommendation, there have been decreases in PSA testing, prostate biopsies, and prostate cancer diagnoses. These decreases have been accompanied by a shift to higher-stage disease, including more metastatic prostate cancers at diagnosis and fewer low-grade prostate cancers.,

We sought to understand the association between the 2012 USPSTF Grade D recommendation against PSA screening for all men and prostate cancer–specific mortality (PCSM) using contemporary, comprehensive, population-based nationwide data between 1999 and 2019, comparing mortality rates before and after the 2012 change to the screening guidelines. We also evaluated US trends in diagnoses of both localized prostate cancer and metastatic prostate cancer and in mortality from all malignant neoplasms during the same interval to better understand their association with the Grade D PSA screening recommendation.

Prostate cancer screening — recommendation and RCT evidence: Clinicians should offer regular prostate cancer screening every 2 to 4 years to people aged 50 to 69 years. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A) Two RCTs, ERSPC and the Goteborg-1 population-based trial, provide evidence that regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening every 2 to 4 years in patients aged 50 to 69 years reduces the risk of metastatic prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality at 16 to 22 years compared to no or opportunistic screening. The number needed to be screened (NNS) and number needed to be diagnosed (NND) to prevent one death from prostate cancer depends on the screening protocol (including screening ages) and follow-up time.

### Relationship between baseline prostate-specific antigen on cancer detection and prostate cancer death: long-term follow-up from the European randomized study of screening for prostate cancer [^115UUJaF]. European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with, besides a decrease in metastatic disease and PCa-specific mortality (PCSM), an increase in the incidence of PCa, as demonstrated in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian screening trial (PLCO) after correcting for contamination and in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial. A considerable proportion of the excess incidence due to PSA-based screening concerns overdiagnosis, for which detection and subsequent treatment most likely only result in harm. The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines recommend that men should not undergo PSA testing without counseling on the potential risks and benefits; if the decision is to perform a PSA test, a risk-based strategy should be followed. This risk-based strategy was further elaborated in the EAU 2021 position paper and in the recent recommendations on early detection of PCa. A very low PSA level has implications for further testing, with a screening interval of up to 8 yr for those younger than 60 yr and a recommendation to refrain from further testing for those aged ≥ 60 yr. The Göteborg-1 trial recently showed that age is a predictor for finding screen-detected Gleason ≥ 7 PCa. It is obvious that both a man's initial PSA level and his remaining life span are crucial in the balance between further testing to avoid missing a diagnosis within the window of curability and overdiagnosis with subsequent overtreatment. The general idea is that men with life expectancy of < 10–15 yr are unlikely to benefit from (further) screening.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1178WQdj]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Screening process — tests and diagnostic follow-up outline the pathway: Screening for prostate cancer begins with a test that measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein in the blood; an elevated PSA level may be caused by prostate cancer but can also be caused by other conditions, including an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), so some men without prostate cancer may therefore have false-positive results. Men with a positive PSA test result may undergo a transrectal ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of the prostate to diagnose prostate cancer.

### Would you recommend prostate-specific antigen screening for this patient? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115Grbi1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the third most common cancer type in the United States overall, accounting for 9.5% of new cancer cases and 5% of cancer deaths. The goal of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening is to identify early-stage disease that can be treated successfully. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviewed evidence on the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening and treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer. It found that PSA-based screening in men aged 55 to 69 years prevents approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over 13 years per 1000 men screened and 3 cases of metastatic cancer per 1000 men screened, with no reduction in all-cause mortality. No benefit was found for PSA-based screening in men aged 70 years and older. On the basis of its review, the USPSTF concluded that the decision for men aged 55 to 69 years to have PSA-based screening should be an individual one and should include a discussion of the potential benefits and harms. Here, 2 experts-an internist and a urologist-discuss the key points of a shared decision-making conversation about PSA-based prostate cancer screening, the PSA-based screening strategy that optimizes benefit and minimizes harm, and the PSA threshold at which they would recommend further diagnostic testing.

Costs and resources

Results from a recent cost-effectiveness study modelled for the US suggested that screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years combined with active surveillance for low risk men could only be cost-effective at a $100 000 threshold if the screening frequency remains low (every four years) and active surveillance is offered to all men with low risk prostate cancer (that is, Gleason score ≤ 6 and stage ≤ T2a). Strategies with shorter screening intervals or in which immediate treatment is offered to all men were not cost-effective. Although the Rapid Recommendations panel focused on the patients' priorities rather than those of society, our recommendation is compatible with these findings.

Uncertainties for future research

Recent evidence suggests that incorporating MRI in the investigation of those with a positive PSA test result decreases the false positive rate, and thus the number of patients undergoing unnecessary biopsies, and may also increase the accuracy of biopsies in those who do have prostate cancer. The Rapid Recommendations panel considered addressing this issue in the guideline, but the impact of MRI on long term outcomes of prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment remains uncertain. Sophisticated decision modelling might shed light on this issue, but the panel decided not to conduct such an analysis because of logistic and feasibility considerations, and because the panel's review of the evidence suggests that modelling would introduce further uncertainties regarding the impact of MRI on patient-important outcomes.

Key research question to inform decision makers and future guidelines include

Could new screening and diagnostic techniques reduce the harms and burden of the diagnostic procedure by better identifying non-progressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life? These strategies may include genetic markers or biomarkers, risk stratification tools, or MRI guided biopsy. For example, two recent high quality studies on MRI guided biopsy have shown encouraging results of MRI to reduce overdiagnosis, but the impact of this strategy on long term, patient-important outcomes (such as prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment) remains uncertain.
For men opting for screening, what would be the ideal age range and screening interval? Randomised trials varied in their offer of a one-off or repeated PSA testing and it remains uncertain which strategy is more suitable.
What is the impact of screening on men at higher baseline risk (men with a family history of cancer, of African descent, and of lower socioeconomic status)? Are their values and preferences different from those of men in the general population?

### Prostate cancer screening and determining the appropriate prostate-specific antigen cutoff values [^117XkumZ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2010). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in combination with digital rectal examination forms the basis for current prostate cancer (CaP) screening programs. Although PSA screening was recently shown to reduce CaP-specific mortality in the European randomized trial, its limitations include the risk for unnecessary prostate biopsy and the diagnosis and treatment of some CaP that might never have caused suffering or death. A potential way to minimize these pitfalls is through the use of derivatives of PSA, particularly PSA kinetics, to increase the specificity for clinically relevant CaP. CaP is the second-leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States and many other westernized countries; accordingly, judicious screening of healthy men allows for diagnosis sufficiently early that all options (i.e., treatment or surveillance) are still available in most cases.

### Prostate cancer screening [^116MUTHh]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Although the use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer screening since the 1990s has led to increased early diagnoses, the most recent studies are in conflict about the risks and benefits of routine prostate cancer screening. Recently, evidence has emerged to support the use of the PSA test to lower mortality, but there is still concern that over-diagnosis may lead to over-treatment of cancers that would not significantly affect patients' health for several years. This article describes the results of important recent prostate cancer screening trials, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Cancer Society screening guidelines, and discusses the implications for clinical practice.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen–based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^114zrvj9]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

Some studies have attempted to evaluate the relative harms and benefits of different PSA-based screening strategies. Multiple studies using data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer support using a screening interval of 8 years in men with initial PSA levels below 1.0 ng/mL. A modeling study showed that switching from annual to biennial screening when PSA is less than 2.5 ng/mL did not affect the probabilities of detection and overdiagnosis. Although it is believed that screening intervals longer than 2 years delay the diagnosis of aggressive cancers yet still detect most indolent cancers, there are few studies with quantitative predictions.

This study analyzes harm–benefit trade-offs associated with lengthening the screening interval when PSA is below 1.0 ng/mL at age 45 or 50 years or discontinuing screening when PSA is below 1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years. We focus specifically on how these policies are likely to affect clinically important outcomes like lives saved and overdiagnosis. Ultimately, we aim to determine how stratified screening might change the balance between harms and benefits of screening compared with using a single screening strategy for the entire population.

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-NCI-national cancer institute… [^114hmhTx]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

In general, a PSA level above 4. 0 ng/mL is considered abnormal and may result in a recommendation for prostate biopsy. However, because PSA levels increase with age, some doctors apply a higher cutoff for older men and a lower cutoff for younger men. What are some of the potential benefits and harms of the PSA test for prostate cancer screening. The potential benefit of the PSA test for prostate cancer screening is that it may help detect prostate cancer earlier, before it spreads and when it may be easier to treat, possibly reducing someone's risk of dying from prostate cancer. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials comparing PSA screening with usual care in men without a diagnosis of prostate cancer concluded that PSA screening for prostate cancer leads to a small reduction in prostate cancer mortality over 10 years. Detecting prostate cancer earlier does not always result in cure.

While the PSA test can help detect small tumors, some of these tumors, regardless of size, may have already spread beyond the prostate before being detected and may not be curable. The PSA test may give false-positive results. A false-positive test result occurs when the PSA level is elevated but no cancer is present. A false-positive test result may create anxiety and lead to additional medical procedures, such as a prostate biopsy, that can be harmful. Possible side effects of biopsies include serious infections, pain, and bleeding.
- 3 men would avoid developing metastatic cancer.
- 5 men would die from prostate cancer despite having screening, diagnosis, and treatment.
- 240 men would have a positive PSA test result, many of whom would have a biopsy that shows that the result was a false-positive; some men who had a biopsy would experience at least moderately bothersome symptoms from the procedure.
- prevent an unnecessary biopsy among people with an elevated blood PSA
- screen for prostate cancer.

### Trends in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates [^113UJdJ2]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is in the most diagnosed and second-leading cause of cancer death among males in the US. While many prostate tumors are highly aggressive and eventually lead to death, many more are indolent and never metastasize. This heterogeneity in prostate cancer leads to challenges in screening and treatment. As the prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening test is not able to differentiate aggressive vs nonaggressive tumors, many males were diagnosed and treated for cancers that did not need intervention when PSA screening was first introduced and common in the US (approximately 1994 to 2008). On the other hand, in the absence of screening, prostate cancer is diagnosed with aggressive characteristics and usually too late for treatments to be curative.

The potential benefits and harms of PSA screening have resulted in fluctuating screening guidelines over the last 20 years. In 2008, the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against PSA screening for males older than age 75 years. In 2012, the recommendation for no PSA screening was extended to all males. In 2018, the guidelines were revised to recommend that males aged 55 to 69 years "discuss the possible benefits and harms of PSA screening with their health care [clinician] and make an individualized decision about whether to get screened". It is unclear the extent to which shared decision-making is taking place and if population groups at higher risk of prostate cancer mortality (eg, non-Hispanic Black males) are being referred for screening. Thus, close monitoring of cancer surveillance data is needed to understand how the changing screening guidelines have impacted the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer across population groups.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112V81V9]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 13%, and the lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer is 2.5%. The median age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years. Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening, would never know they have the disease. African American men and men with a family history of prostate cancer have an increased risk of prostate cancer compared with other men.

Objective

To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer and subsequent treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer. The USPSTF also commissioned a review of existing decision analysis models and the overdiagnosis rate of PSA-based screening. The reviews also examined the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening in patient subpopulations at higher risk of prostate cancer, including older men, African American men, and men with a family history of prostate cancer.

Findings

Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened. Screening programs may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened. Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms. Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel symptoms. About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction. Adequate evidence shows that the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men because of increased risk of false-positive results, diagnostic harms from biopsies, and harms from treatment. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the net benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men aged 55 to 69 years is small for some men. How each man weighs specific benefits and harms will determine whether the overall net benefit is small. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older do not outweigh the expected harms.

Conclusions and Recommendation

For men aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one and should include discussion of the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician. Screening offers a small potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate cancer in some men. However, many men will experience potential harms of screening, including false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on the basis of family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of screening and treatment-specific outcomes, and other health needs. Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older. (D recommendation).

Prostate cancer screening — screening modalities and adjuncts: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening is the usual method, but evidence is insufficient to support one method of PSA-based screening over another, and evidence is also insufficient that a prebiopsy risk calculator (with or without free PSA), genetic tests, or adjunctive imaging meaningfully change benefits and harms; the use of digital rectal examination as a screening modality is not recommended because of lack of evidence and its exclusion from major trials.

Current guidelines on PSA testing

Guidelines vary in their recommendations on PSA testing (see table 1). The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends against PSA screening for men aged 55 to 69 years. However, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently changed its guidance to say that "the decision about whether to be screened for prostate cancer should be an individual one", without clearly suggesting for or against screening: previously it recommended against screening in that group. National Cancer Center Network (NCCN) guidelines (which represents cancer centres in the USA) recommends initiating PSA screening at age 45 years. Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA)and European Association of Urology (EAU)recommend a discussion about PSA screening with patients.

Table 1
Major guideline recommendations on PSA screening*

Uptake of PSA testing

The incidence of prostate cancer has dramatically increased over the last quarter century. This has been associated with widespread use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing detecting early stage prostate cancers. There is wide variation in the adoption of prostate cancer screening. In the UK, about 39% of men aged 45–69 years have undergone PSA testing in the past 10 years. In Sweden 23% of men aged 50–69 had a PSA test in the previous 12 months and 58% in the previous 10 years. Although the rates of screening have declined during the past decade in the US, up to half of US men aged 60–74 undergo screening each year. Also, as many as 33% of elderly US men with competing medical comorbidities at high risk of dying from other cause underwent screening, and twice as many of these men recalled discussing the potential benefits rather than harms of screening. African-Americans were less likely to have been screened than non-African US men. Overall, two thirds of men reported no past discussion with physicians about the advantages, disadvantages, or scientific uncertainty and no shared decision making about prostate cancer screening.

Values and preferences

The panel, including the patient partners, felt that this variability in values and preferences contributes to a weak recommendation. The recommendation against screening reflects a belief that most men would value avoiding complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment because the reduction in prostate cancer and death from screening is small and uncertain. Prostate cancer will often, though not always, remain indolent.

Men who place a high value on avoiding complications from biopsies and subsequent treatment are likely to decline screening. In contrast, men who place a higher value on even a small reduction of prostate cancer may opt for screening. Several panel members felt that higher risk patients — such as patients with family history of cancer or of African descent — may be more likely to seek screening because they may worry more about prostate cancer and want to rule out the diagnosis.

For men considering screening, shared decision making is critical to ensure that their decision is in line with their own values and preferences. The evidence summarised in this Rapid Recommendation is available in MAGICapp as decision aids that can support shared decision making.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 3 outlines the key practical issues. PSA testing can be performed on any normal blood sample, but prostate biopsies and their follow-up have important implications for daily life.

Fig 3
Practical issues about use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and biopsy for prostate cancer screening

Lower urinary tract symptoms (slow urine stream, sensation of incomplete emptying, increased urinary frequency) are common complaints in adult men that can have a major impact on quality of life. Benign prostatic enlargement is the major cause. Evidence to date indicates that men with these complaints are not at increased risk of prostate cancer.

For men who chose to undergo PSA testing, the optimal frequency of screening remains unknown. Figure 2 summarises the frequency used in the different trials, yet the accompanying systematic review did not find any significant subgroup effect of the effect of screening based on these different frequencies. Given that the ERSPC data are likely at lower risk of bias, PSA screening every four years — rather than, say, every year or only once in a lifetime — may be the optimal interval.

### Viewpoint: expanding prostate cancer screening [^115HeSfD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The authors address 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The authors argue, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening are convincing. They recommend screening for risk assessment for average-risk men beginning at age 40 years, screening selected healthy men older than age 70 years, and lowering the PSA threshold for considering biopsy to 2.5 ng/mL for all men.

### Prostate-specific antigen and prostate cancer: prediction, detection and monitoring [^116VRury]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2008). Medium credibility.

Testing for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has profoundly affected the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. PSA testing has enabled physicians to detect prostate tumours while they are still small, low-grade and localized. This very ability has, however, created controversy over whether we are now diagnosing and treating insignificant cancers. PSA testing has also transformed the monitoring of treatment response and detection of disease recurrence. Much current research is directed at establishing the most appropriate uses of PSA testing and at developing methods to improve on the conventional PSA test.

### Comparative effectiveness of alternative prostate-specific antigen – based prostate cancer screening strategies: model estimates of potential benefits and harms [^113iRf9g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently concluded that the harms of existing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies outweigh the benefits.

Objective

To evaluate comparative effectiveness of alternative PSA screening strategies.

Design

Microsimulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality quantifying harms and lives saved for alternative PSA screening strategies.

Data Sources

National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence, treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, and mortality.

Target Population

A contemporary cohort of U.S. men.

Time Horizon

Lifetime.

Perspective

Societal.

Intervention

35 screening strategies that vary by start and stop ages, screening intervals, and thresholds for biopsy referral.

Outcome Measures

PSA tests, false-positive test results, cancer detected, overdiagnoses, prostate cancer deaths, lives saved, and months of life saved.

Results Of Base-Case Analysis

Without screening, the risk for prostate cancer death is 2.86%. A reference strategy that screens men aged 50 to 74 years annually with a PSA threshold for biopsy referral of 4 µg/L reduces the risk for prostate cancer death to 2.15%, with risk for overdiagnosis of 3.3%. A strategy that uses higher PSA thresholds for biopsy referral in older men achieves a similar risk for prostate cancer death (2.23%) but reduces the risk for overdiagnosis to 2.3%. A strategy that screens biennially with longer screening intervals for men with low PSA levels achieves similar risks for prostate cancer death (2.27%) and overdiagnosis (2.4%), but reduces total tests by 59% and false-positive results by 50%.

Results Of Sensitivity Analysis

Varying incidence inputs or reducing the survival improvement due to screening did not change conclusions.

Limitation

The model is a simplification of the natural history of prostate cancer, and improvement in survival due to screening is uncertain.

Conclusion

Compared with standard screening, PSA screening strategies that use higher thresholds for biopsy referral for older men and that screen men with low PSA levels less frequently can reduce harms while preserving lives.

### Prostate-specific antigen and prostate cancer mortality: a systematic review [^115c19mc]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Although findings from recently published clinical trials and a review from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force suggest that there is limited to no prostate cancer mortality benefit associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, confusion remains as to whether the use of PSA as a screening tool for prostate cancer is warranted.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic literature review was done in 2012 to identify case-control studies from the past 20 years that focused on evaluating the association between screening for prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality. Emphasis was put on synthesizing the results of these studies, evaluating their limitations, and identifying remaining questions and issues that should be addressed in future studies.

Evidence Synthesis

A total of seven studies were identified in this time period, with the majority suggesting that a reduction in prostate cancer mortality is associated with PSA screening. However, the findings may be limited by various biases inherent to case-control studies of screening tests, such as selection biases resulting from both case and control subject selection, exposure measurement issues, lead and length biases, and issues specific to prostate cancer screening such as the influence of digital rectal examinations.

Conclusions

Findings from existing case-control studies of PSA and prostate cancer mortality suggest that there is a mortality benefit from PSA screening. However, these studies may be limited by bias and must therefore be interpreted with caution. As uncertainty regarding PSA screening remains, future studies to evaluate the association between PSA and prostate cancer mortality should address these potential biases directly.

Introduction

Guidelines currently recommend shared decision-making between males and their health care clinicians regarding prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen (PSA), taking into consideration patient age and life expectancy.

### Prostate-specific antigen screening and 15-year prostate cancer mortality: a secondary analysis of the CAP randomized clinical trial [^114Au9yp]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP) reported no effect of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening on prostate cancer mortality at a median 10-year follow-up (primary outcome), but the long-term effects of PSA screening on prostate cancer mortality remain unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of a single invitation for PSA screening on prostate cancer-specific mortality at a median 15-year follow-up compared with no invitation for screening.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary analysis of the CAP randomized clinical trial included men aged 50 to 69 years identified at 573 primary care practices in England and Wales. Primary care practices were randomized between September 25, 2001, and August 24, 2007, and men were enrolled between January 8, 2002, and January 20, 2009. Follow-up was completed on March 31, 2021.

Intervention

Men received a single invitation for a PSA screening test with subsequent diagnostic tests if the PSA level was 3.0 ng/mL or higher. The control group received standard practice (no invitation).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was reported previously. Of 8 prespecified secondary outcomes, results of 4 were reported previously. The 4 remaining prespecified secondary outcomes at 15-year follow-up were prostate cancer-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, and prostate cancer stage and Gleason grade at diagnosis.

Results

Of 415 357 eligible men (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [5.6] years), 98% were included in these analyses. Overall, 12 013 and 12 958 men with a prostate cancer diagnosis were in the intervention and control groups, respectively (15-year cumulative risk, 7.08% [95% CI, 6.95%-7.21%] and 6.94% [95% CI, 6.82%-7.06%], respectively). At a median 15-year follow-up, 1199 men in the intervention group (0.69% [95% CI, 0.65%-0.73%]) and 1451 men in the control group (0.78% [95% CI, 0.73%-0.82%]) died of prostate cancer (rate ratio [RR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85–0.99]; p = 0.03). Compared with the control, the PSA screening intervention increased detection of low-grade (Gleason score [GS] ≤ 6: 2.2% vs 1.6%; P < .001) and localized (T1/T2: 3.6% vs 3.1%; P < .001) disease but not intermediate (GS of 7), high-grade (GS ≥ 8), locally advanced (T3), or distally advanced (T4/N1/M1) tumors. There were 45 084 all-cause deaths in the intervention group (23.2% [95% CI, 23.0%-23.4%]) and 50 336 deaths in the control group (23.3% [95% CI, 23.1%-23.5%]) (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94–1.01]; p = 0.11). Eight of the prostate cancer deaths in the intervention group (0.7%) and 7 deaths in the control group (0.5%) were related to a diagnostic biopsy or prostate cancer treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, a single invitation for PSA screening compared with standard practice without routine screening reduced prostate cancer deaths at a median follow-up of 15 years. However, the absolute reduction in deaths was small.

### PSA-based screening for prostate cancer: how does it compare with other cancer screening tests? [^115JVk8j]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Despite the substantive societal impact of prostate cancer, the medical community is currently divided on the balance between benefit and harm of screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Objective

To examine whether PSA-based screening for prostate cancer meets current guidelines on efficacy and effectiveness for screening, and how it compares with other currently implemented cancer-screening methods.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature search was conducted for reviews and individual studies that have examined the performance of screening for colorectal, cervical, breast, and prostate cancer. Each screening method was assessed using the United Kingdom National Screening Committee guidelines. Data on screening test performance (sensitivity, specificity, etc) were extracted from these articles for comparison.

Evidence Synthesis

In common with other cancers for which screening is conducted, prostate cancer represents a significant morbidity and mortality burden. The PSA test can be considered "simple" and "safe" within appropriate boundaries. The sensitivity/specificity profile of PSA is not optimal but has clinical validity: Cases missed at screening detected as interval cases do not have a poor outcome. Early prostate cancer intervention can be beneficial for long-term outcomes, although the benefits need to be weighed against the adverse effects of intervention. Early evidence from screening studies also suggests positive stage and grade shifts, although Level 1 mortality data are still awaited. Robust cost-effectiveness data are still lacking, although current evidence suggests that PSA screening may lie within acceptable limits.

Conclusion

Until better markers become available, PSA can be regarded as an appropriate screening tool for prostate cancer at a population level.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114pVitB]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality among men worldwide. Screening for prostate cancer with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) aims to detect prostate cancer at an early, intervenable stage amenable to curative treatment and reduction in overall and disease-specific mortality. However, the evidence has so far not demonstrated that screening for prostate cancer saves lives. Instead, screening may be associated with increased harms such as overdiagnosis and complications of treatment for indolent disease. Nevertheless, screening for prostate cancer remains highly controversial because of limitations in randomised trials including contamination and under-representation of black men. Difficulty of shared, informed decision-making between patients and primary care providers about PSA screening may also contribute to practice variations. Recently, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated their recommendation statement, changing it from a grade D (recommendation against PSA based screening for prostate cancer) to a grade C recommendation (advocating for an individualised approach to screening).

Our prior systematic review and meta-analysis that evaluated the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening included five studies that enrolled 341 342 patients. In this 2013 Cochrane review we demonstrated that PSA screening led to an increase in prostate cancer diagnoses but did not reduce overall nor disease-specific mortality. Since the publication of this review, several of the included studies have reported outcomes at extended follow-up. In addition, a new, large trial has been published. Therefore, the effectiveness of prostate cancer screening based on the current best evidence is uncertain. In contrast to the recently published USPSTF evidence report, we included and analysed all relevant screening trials using data from the longest available follow-up.

This systematic review is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations project, a collaborative effort from the MAGIC research and innovation programme and The BMJ. The aim of the project is to respond to new potentially practice changing evidence and provide a trustworthy practice guideline in a timely manner. In our case, the stimulus was the recent Cluster Randomised Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP), which randomised over 419 357 men at 573 primary care practices in the United Kingdom to PSA screening versus usual management. In light of this new evidence, we conducted an update of prior systematic reviews by our group to address the potential benefits and harms of PSA based screening. This systematic review informed the parallel guideline published in a multi-layered electronic format on bmj.com and MAGICapp (see box 1).

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^1155Wa6X]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Future directions in prostate cancer screening — screening and diagnosis remain intensely debated with many unanswered questions, and research is encouraged through clinical trials and modeling studies that prioritize inclusion of historically underrepresented populations. Shared decision making (SDM) regarding whether to screen, how frequently, and when to proceed to secondary testing or biopsy is critically important, but clinicians tend to discuss benefits more than harms; there is an unmet need for multilingual decision aids for people with varying health literacy. For populations at higher risk (e.g., concerning family history, Black ancestry, genetic risk, or elevated baseline prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), targeted and perhaps more intensive screening warrants investigation, whereas people with a very low likelihood of clinically significant cancer may benefit from less intensive or discontinuation of screening. A more comprehensive understanding is required of how race and ethnicity affect the operating characteristics of PSA, secondary biomarkers, and prostate imaging, recognizing that many undergoing screening are of mixed or unknown race and ethnicity. Efforts should be made by clinicians, payors, and health care systems to bridge this gap.

### Prostate cancer screening [^1112BwFR]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Among American men, prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing has been used to screen for prostate cancer for more than 25 years, the test has low sensitivity and specificity, and there is no clear evidence for determining what threshold warrants prostate biopsy. Only one of five randomized controlled trials of PSA screening showed an effect on prostate cancer-specific mortality, and the absolute reduction in deaths from prostate cancer was one per 781 men screened after 13 years of follow-up. None of the trials showed benefit in all-cause mortality, and screening increased prostate cancer diagnoses by about 60%. Harms of screening include adverse effects from prostate biopsy, overdiagnosis and overtreatment, and anxiety. One-half of screen-detected prostate cancers will not cause symptoms in the patient's lifetime, and 80% to 85% of men who choose observation will not die from prostate cancer within 15 years. Adverse effects of radical prostatectomy include perioperative complications, erectile dysfunction, and urinary incontinence. Radiation therapy can cause acute toxicity leading to urinary urgency, dysuria, diarrhea, and rectal pain; late toxicity includes erectile dysfunction, rectal bleeding, and urethral stricture. Despite variations across guidelines, no organization recommends routine PSA testing, and all endorse some form of shared decision-making before testing. If screening is performed, it should generally be discontinued at 70 years of age.

### Evaluation of a low-invasive strategy for prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen [^112EMaCk]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate a two-step strategy for the detection of prostate cancer within the context of serial screening and compare this strategy with other screening strategies. The optimal combination of tests proposed for prostate cancer screening remains undetermined, particularly when screening is repeated over time.

Methods

A prospective serial prostate cancer screening study with follow-up to 55 months was performed in a general community screening clinic. One thousand seven hundred seven self-referred men, 50 to 75 years old, without a history of prostate cancer agreed to undergo screening for prostate cancer on an annual basis. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement was the first-step screening test. If the serum PSA test was positive, a standard urologic evaluation was performed. Biopsy was recommended only if a test other than serum PSA was suspicious for cancer. The outcome measures were the biopsy rate and prostate cancer detection rate. The comparisons with other studies were age-standardized to correct for differences in age distribution.

Results

The biopsy and cancer detection rates after the first test were 7.0% and 2.0%, respectively. After 4 years of the study, the cumulative biopsy rate and cumulative cancer detection rate per enrolled man was 12% and 4.1%, respectively. The comparisons between studies revealed that screening strategies using serum PSA as a first-line test had similar detection rates but lower biopsy rates than strategies performing biopsy when one of several screening tests was positive.

Conclusions

A two-step screening strategy using serum PSA alone as the initial test seemed able to detect as many cancers as when all screening tests were used at the same time but reduced the number of unnecessary biopsies.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^113Z4Xa3]. CA (2009). Low credibility.

In the United States, prostate cancer will affect 1 man in 6 during his lifetime. Since the mid-1980s, screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test has more than doubled the risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis. A decrease in prostate cancer death rates has been observed since that time, but the relative contribution of PSA testing as opposed to other factors, such as improved treatment, has been uncertain. The recent release of 2 large randomized trials suggests that if there is a benefit of screening, it is, at best, small. Methods to assess a man's risk of prostate cancer, including those tools that integrate multiple risk factors, are now available and should be used in risk assessment. Men undergoing screening for prostate cancer may reduce their risk of prostate cancer with finasteride.

### Screening for prostate cancer [^113LUgXN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Any form of screening aims to reduce disease-specific and overall mortality, and to improve a person's future quality of life. Screening for prostate cancer has generated considerable debate within the medical and broader community, as demonstrated by the varying recommendations made by medical organizations and governed by national policies. To better inform individual patient decision-making and health policy decisions, we need to consider the entire body of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on prostate cancer screening summarised in a systematic review. In 2006, our Cochrane review identified insufficient evidence to either support or refute the use of routine mass, selective, or opportunistic screening for prostate cancer. An update of the review in 2010 included three additional trials. Meta-analysis of the five studies included in the 2010 review concluded that screening did not significantly reduce prostate cancer-specific mortality. In the past two years, several updates to studies included in the 2010 review have been published thereby providing the rationale for this update of the 2010 systematic review.

Objectives

To determine whether screening for prostate cancer reduces prostate cancer-specific mortality or all-cause mortality and to assess its impact on quality of life and adverse events.

Search Methods

An updated search of electronic databases (PROSTATE register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, and the NHS EED) was performed, in addition to handsearching of specific journals and bibliographies, in an effort to identify both published and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs of screening versus no screening for prostate cancer were eligible for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

The original search (2006) identified 99 potentially relevant articles that were selected for full-text review. From these citations, two RCTs were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. The search for the 2010 version of the review identified a further 106 potentially relevant articles, from which three new RCTs were included in the review. A total of 31 articles were retrieved for full-text examination based on the updated search in 2012. Updated data on three studies were included in this review. Data from the trials were independently extracted by two authors.

Main Results

Five RCTs with a total of 341,342 participants were included in this review. All involved prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing, with or without digital rectal examination (DRE), though the interval and threshold for further evaluation varied across trials. The age of participants ranged from 45 to 80 years and duration of follow-up from 7 to 20 years. Our meta-analysis of the five included studies indicated no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality between men randomised to the screening and control groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.17). The methodological quality of three of the studies was assessed as posing a high risk of bias. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial were assessed as posing a low risk of bias, but provided contradicting results. The ERSPC study reported a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95), whilst the PLCO study concluded no significant benefit (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.54). The ERSPC was the only study of the five included in this review that reported a significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, in a pre-specified subgroup of men aged 55 to 69 years of age. Sensitivity analysis for overall risk of bias indicated no significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality when referring to the meta analysis of only the ERSPC and PLCO trial data (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30). Subgroup analyses indicated that prostate cancer-specific mortality was not affected by the age at which participants were screened. Meta-analysis of four studies investigating all-cause mortality did not determine any significant differences between men randomised to screening or control (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.03). A diagnosis of prostate cancer was significantly greater in men randomised to screening compared to those randomised to control (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.65). Localised prostate cancer was more commonly diagnosed in men randomised to screening (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.70), whilst the proportion of men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer was significantly lower in the screening group compared to the men serving as controls (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.87). Screening resulted in a range of harms that can be considered minor to major in severity and duration. Common minor harms from screening include bleeding, bruising and short-term anxiety. Common major harms include overdiagnosis and overtreatment, including infection, blood loss requiring transfusion, pneumonia, erectile dysfunction, and incontinence. Harms of screening included false-positive results for the PSA test and overdiagnosis (up to 50% in the ERSPC study). Adverse events associated with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies included infection, bleeding and pain. No deaths were attributed to any biopsy procedure. None of the studies provided detailed assessment of the effect of screening on quality of life or provided a comprehensive assessment of resource utilization associated with screening (although preliminary analyses were reported).

Authors' Conclusions

Prostate cancer screening did not significantly decrease prostate cancer-specific mortality in a combined meta-analysis of five RCTs. Only one study (ERSPC) reported a 21% significant reduction of prostate cancer-specific mortality in a pre-specified subgroup of men aged 55 to 69 years. Pooled data currently demonstrates no significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific and overall mortality. Harms associated with PSA-based screening and subsequent diagnostic evaluations are frequent, and moderate in severity. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are common and are associated with treatment-related harms. Men should be informed of this and the demonstrated adverse effects when they are deciding whether or not to undertake screening for prostate cancer. Any reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality may take up to 10 years to accrue; therefore, men who have a life expectancy less than 10 to 15 years should be informed that screening for prostate cancer is unlikely to be beneficial. No studies examined the independent role of screening by DRE.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^116b6Jpm]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and cancer risk — historical thresholds and biopsy-era findings: A PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL was accepted as the upper limit of normal, but prostate cancer rates were significant at lower PSA levels (between 2.5 ng/mL and 4.0 ng/mL), and men with PSA levels < 2.5 ng/mL were believed to have low risk. With biopsies performed across all PSA levels, PSA "should not be considered 'elevated' or 'normal', because prostate cancer was identified at all levels of PSA, including values < 1.0 ng/mL", and "the higher the PSA, the higher the risk of cancer", with aggressive cancers identified at higher levels.

### A discussion on controversies and ethical dilemmas in prostate cancer screening [^111A6Tei]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the the most common cancers in men. A blood test called prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has a potential to pick up this cancer very early and is used for screening of this disease. However, screening for prostate cancer is a matter of debate. Level 1 evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests a reduction in cancer-specific mortality from PCa screening. However, there could be an associated impact on quality of life due to a high proportion of overdiagnosis and overtreatment as part of the screening. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2012 recommended that PSA-based PCa screening should not to be offered at any age. However, considering the current evidence, USPSTF recently revised its recommendation to offer the PSA test to men aged 55–69 years with shared decision-making, in line with earlier guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Urological Association. A shared decision making is necessary since the PSA test could potentially harm an individual. However, the literature suggests that clinicians often neglect a discussion on this issue before ordering the test. This narrative discusses the main controversies regarding PCa screening including the PSA threshold for biopsy, the concept of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, the practical difficulties of active surveillance, the current level 1 evidence on the mortality benefit of screening, and the associated pitfalls. It offers a detailed discussion on the ethics involved in the PSA test and highlights the barriers to shared decision-making and possible solutions.

### What's new in screening in 2015? [^1163djmB]. Current Opinion in Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this review was to highlight important articles in the field of prostate cancer screening published during 2015 and early 2016. Four major areas were identified for the purpose: screening strategies, post-United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2011–2012, screening trends/patterns, and shared decision making.

Recent Findings

Several studies furthered the evidence that screening reduces the risk of metastasis and death from prostate cancer. Multiplex screening strategies are of proven benefit; genetics and MRI need further evaluation. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates declined in men above age of 50 years, as did the overall prostate cancer incidence following the USPSTF 2011–2012 recommendation against PSA. The consequences of declining screening rates will become apparent in the next few years. More research is needed to identify the most optimal approach to engage in, and implement, an effective shared decision-making in clinical practice.

Summary

Data emerging in 2015 provided evidence on the question of how best to screen and brought more steps in the right direction of 'next-generation prostate cancer screening'. Screening is an ongoing process in all men regardless of whether or not they might benefit from early detection and treatment. After the USPSTF 2011–2012 recommendation, the rates of PSA testing are declining; however, this decline is observed in all men and not solely in those who will not benefit from the screening. The long-term effect of this recommendation might not be as anticipated. More studies are needed on how to implement the best available evidence on who, and when, to screen in clinical practice.

### Screening for prostate cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116kZYMu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement about screening for prostate cancer.

Methods

The USPSTF evaluated randomized, controlled trials of the benefits of prostate cancer screening; cohort and cross-sectional studies of the psychological harms of false-positive prostate-specific antigen test results; and evidence on the natural history of prostate-specific antigen-detected prostate cancer to address previously identified gaps in the evidence from the 2002 USPSTF recommendation.

Recommendations

Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer in men younger than age 75 years (I statement). Do not screen for prostate cancer in men age 75 years or older (Grade D recommendation).

Screening Strategies

Using the calibrated models, we simulated cohorts of men in the United States age 45 or 50 years in 2017 and followed until age 85 years. We implemented the following screening strategies: screening up to age 69 years with 2-year intervals; lengthening the screening interval to 8 years for baseline PSA less than 1.0 ng/mL but decreasing again to 2 years when PSA is greater than 1.0 ng/mL at a later screen; stopping screening when PSA is less than 1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years and older; or a combination of the last two strategies. For reference, we also implemented strategies that stop screening all men at age 60 years. In all strategies, a PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL was used. To evaluate the optimal strategy, a 100% attendance rate to each screen was specified, and positive screens were followed with a biopsy compliance and sensitivity of 100%. For each screening policy, we projected the number of tests conducted, cancers diagnosed (screen and clinically detected), overdiagnoses, lives saved, and life-years gained.

### Screening for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114diw8h]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer among men worldwideand, after lung cancer, is the second leading cause of deaths from cancer in men in the United States. Screening has been advocated as a means of detecting prostate cancer in the early stages, which are amenable to local interventions with curative intent, to decrease overall and disease specific mortality. The benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening, however, have become the topic of controversy, as reflected by numerous recent editorials, position statements, and guidance documents.

Population based recommendations for cancer screening should ideally be based on high quality evidence derived from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that document a positive impact of screening on outcomes that are the most important to patients. In 2006, a systematic review published in the Cochrane Library concluded that there was insufficient evidence to either support or refute the routine use of mass, selective, or opportunistic screening compared with no screening. This Cochrane systematic review was based on two randomised controlled trials that enrolled 55 512 participants overall but was limited by substantial methodological weaknesses in the design, conduct, and analysis of the included studies. The evidence drawn from this systematic review did not show that screening improved outcomes. By 2010, four additional trialsenrolling 351 531 participants had been published, thereby providing strong impetus for an updated synthesis of research evidence.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the role of screening for prostate cancer to guide decision making in health policy. Specifically, we assessed the question of whether in men without a previous history of prostate cancer, screening by testing for prostate specific antigen with or without digital rectal examination when compared with no screening affects the two most important outcomes to patients: overall and disease specific mortality.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112neE2Y]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Sensitivity analysis based on low risk of bias studies

As planned, we performed an additional analysis using studies that were judged to be at lower risk of bias; this left only the ERSPC study.

Effect of PSA screening on all-cause mortality

Based on the ERSPC trial, PSA screening probably has no effect on all-cause mortality (IRR 1.0 (0.98 to 1.02), moderate quality evidence; table 3). This corresponds to zero fewer deaths of any cause (95% CI 3 fewer to 3 more) per 1000 participants screened. We downgraded the quality of evidence for risk of bias.

Effect of PSA screening on prostate-specific mortality

PSA screening probably has a small effect on prostate cancer-specific mortality (IRR 0.79 (0.69 to 0.91), moderate quality evidence; table 3). This corresponds to one fewer death from prostate cancer (95 CI 1 fewer to 0 fewer) per 1000 participants screened. We downgraded the quality of evidence for risk of bias. When using the ERSPC control event rate at 13 yearsor that of the Göteborg arm of the ERSPC trialat 18 years, this translates to one fewer (95% CI 1 fewer to 2 fewer) or three fewer (95% CI 1 fewer to 4 fewer) deaths from prostate cancer, respectively, per 1000 men screened.

Effect of PSA screening on incidence of prostate cancer

Screening probably increases the detection of prostate cancer of any stage (IRR 1.57 (1.51 to 1.62), moderate quality evidence; table 3). This corresponds to 18 more diagnoses of prostate cancer (95% CI 16 more to 20 more) per 1000 men screened. We downgraded the quality of evidence for risk of bias. Results of this analysis changed little when the Stockholm trial was excluded in a sensitivity analysis. Screening probably also increases the incidence of localised (stage I and II) prostate cancer (RR 1.75 (1.68 to 1.82)), corresponding to 14 more per 1000 (95% CI 13 more to 16 more), and probably decreases the incidence of advanced (stages III and IV) prostate cancer (RR 0.75 (0.69 to 0.82)), corresponding to three fewer per 1000 men screened (95% CI 4 fewer to 2 fewer).

Other outcomes

Since all available data for these outcomes were from the ERSPC trial the results of the sensitivity analysis were the same as that of the main analysis.

Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies

We provide the most up to date report on the best available evidence on screening for prostate cancer. While our groupand othershave previously published similar reviews, these did not include the most recent updates of existing screening trials nor the recently published CAP trial.

The most relevant study for comparison is the systematic review and evidence report referenced by the recently published United States Public Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on prostate cancer screening, which differs from our review in several important ways. First, the CAP trial — the largest and most recent trial of PSA screening to date — is missing from their evidence report. While the USPSTF guideline developers gave it formal consideration, the CAP trial was published after the USPSTF's literature search cut-off date of 1 February 2018. Second, the authors excluded three older, "poor quality" trials based on methodological grounds. Reasons included low adherence to the screening intervention, uncertain levels of contamination in the control arm, and lack of blinding of outcome assessors. While we appreciate these methodological issues, their severity did not prompt us to disregard two of the three studies entirely as the USPSTF Task Force did. We excluded the Norköpping trial on a number of methodological limitations, including quasi-randomisation. Third, in contrast to the task force's evidence report, we meta-analysed the entire body of evidence. This approach allowed us to evaluate for inconsistency between individual trials by conducting subgroup analyses (based on age and screening intervals) and a sensitivity analysis for risk of bias. Fourth, another major distinction lies in how we handled the control event rates. For the presentation of absolute effects in our summary of findings, we chose to draw this event rate from the CAP trial because it provides the most contemporary and broadly applicable estimation of what would occur in the absence of screening. These numbers were ascertained at a 10-year time horizon (while the effect estimates were pooled at the longest follow-up available in the included trials). This contributes to the lower absolute effect size estimates that we report compared with those reported by the USPSTF, but were deemed the most appropriate to inform the accompanying Rapid Recommendation panel deliberations.

### Prostate-specific antigen and the early diagnosis of prostate cancer [^113bAu8M]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

With digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a major screening tool for prostate cancer. PSA is specific for the prostate, but not for prostate cancer. Multiple factors influence PSA value. Determination of PSA levels is not 100% sensitive for prostate cancer, as PSA levels may be normal despite presence of prostate cancer. The cutoff value for PSA of 4.0 ng/mL gives the highest sensitivity and highest specificity. Several modifications of PSA testing have been developed and may be beneficial for select populations. Uncertainty about the natural progression of prostate cancer and inherent limitations of PSA testing make it unclear whether universal screening is beneficial, and the recommendations of various organizations conflict. Randomized studies are in progress to address the role of PSA testing and of modifications of this test in the early detection of prostate cancer.

### Viewpoint: limiting prostate cancer screening [^114UBZ33]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer screening is controversial, and major professional associations offer differing screening guidelines. The author addresses 3 key issues about prostate cancer screening: 1) the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria to recommend a prostate biopsy, 2) the appropriate age to start screening, and 3) the appropriate age to stop screening. The author argues, on the basis of evidence published since 2000, that data supporting the efficacy of PSA screening remain unconvincing. The author recommends that screening should not be expanded to include average-risk men younger than age 50 years or older than age 75 years and that a PSA threshold below 4.0 ng/mL should not be used to trigger biopsy referral.

### Randomized trial results did not resolve controversies surrounding prostate cancer screening [^117Dyxn1]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prostate cancer screening remains controversial. This review will address recently published results from randomized controlled screening trials as well as current practice guidelines.

Recent Findings

The Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial found that screening did not decrease prostate cancer mortality after 7 years of follow-up. High-screening rates in the control group, the low number of deaths from prostate cancer, and the relatively short follow-up duration contributed to the negative results. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer found that screening reduced prostate cancer mortality by 20% during a median 9 years of follow-up. However, the absolute benefit (0.7/1000 reduction) was small and was associated with a 70% increase in prostate cancer diagnosis. Subsequently, the American Urological Association recommended beginning screening at the age of 40 years and not relying on a specific prostate-specific antigen cutoff for biopsy referral. The United States Preventive Services Task Force and American Cancer Society have yet to issue updated guidelines.

Summary

The randomized trials suggest that screening at best will have a small survival benefit but substantial potential risk for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Patients need to understand these tradeoffs in order to make informed decisions about screening.

### Screening for prostate cancer: an update [^11629xfd]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review evidence regarding the potential introduction of prostate cancer screening programmes and highlight issues pertinent to the management of screen-detected prostate cancer.

Methods

Screening for prostate cancer is a controversial health care issue in general and urological practice. A PubMed database search was performed, followed by a systematic review of the literature, to examine the evidence base underlying prostate cancer screening.

Results

A prostate cancer screening programme should satisfy several key postulates prior to its introduction. To date, several of these postulates have not been satisfied, and the evidence available for prostate cancer screening is currently insufficient to warrant its introduction as a public health policy. The natural history of screen-detected prostate cancer remains poorly understood, and recent evidence suggests that a screening programme may detect a large number of men with indolent disease who may be subsequently overtreated. Several randomised clinical trials are currently in progress and it is hoped that they will provide robust evidence to inform future practice.

Conclusions

National systematic prostate cancer screening programmes outside randomised clinical trial settings have not been implemented to date owing to lack of robust evidence that such programmes would improve survival and/or quality of life in men with screen-detected disease. Forthcoming results of clinical trials and the application of appropriate risk stratification to prevent overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer are likely to change practice in coming years.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for the detection of prostate cancer in symptomatic patients [^111YVB5V]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a commonly used test for the detection of prostate cancer, identifying patients that may require a diagnostic test. PSA testing is usually performed for one of two reasons: assessing a patient presenting to their general practitioner (GP) or primary care physician with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or screening for a patient who is asymptomatic but concerned about their risk of prostate cancer. Patients with an elevated PSA are usually referred to a urologist for diagnostic testing, which may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate and/or a prostate biopsy. Very large randomised controlled trials of PSA-based prostate cancer screening have been performed; these are summarised in a recent systematic review in 2018 that showed a small potential reduction in prostate cancer specific mortality with no change in all-cause mortality and an increased risk of complications from biopsy, overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer, and overtreatment. However, uncertainty remains about the diagnostic accuracy of PSA for prostate cancer in patients with LUTS.

The most recent systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of PSA was published by Harvey et al. in 2009. A range of estimates for the accuracy of PSA was found amongst the ten included studies. That review presented limited information on their methods; crucially, it was unclear whether the included studies were assessing PSA in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients nor was it clear whether any were relevant to primary care populations. Just et al. published a brief review of the literature in 2018, highlighting that the paucity of research in this area applicable to primary care, where a significant proportion of PSA testing is performed, still remains.

This systematic review aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of PSA for the detection of prostate cancer in patients, focusing on studies where the included patients (or a subset of included patients) had at least one symptom that could relate to an undiagnosed prostate cancer. Given the findings by Just et al. this review considered studies from primary and secondary care settings.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test thresholds and performance — Using a threshold of 4 ng/mL in average-risk men, the rate of PSA test positivity varies between 9% and 11%, the cancer detection rate is about 3%, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranges from 28% to 32%, and specificity remains high (92%-94%). When lower thresholds are used (2.0 ng/mL or 2.5 ng/mL), PPVs are substantially higher among men with a positive family history (38%-43%) with variable specificity (64%-93%). PSA screening in higher risk populations is characterized by higher detection rates and higher PPVs, but it is stated that we still do not know whether PSA screening performs better in higher risk men in terms of reduced prostate-specific mortality; the ERSPC observed no effect of age on mortality and neither the PLCO nor the ERSPC has reported subgroup analyses examining the impact of ethnicity or family history.

PSA thresholds for prompting biopsy — no universal cutoff: In considering whether a biopsy should be performed based on overall or high-grade cancer risk, "no absolute PSA level exists that is applicable to all men". Instead, "the risk level at which a biopsy should be considered should be based on factors related to a man's life expectancy (age, comorbidities) as well as a man's concern regarding his risk", and because detection and treatments can entail harms, "the level of risk at which a biopsy should be undertaken should be based on a man's integration of these considerations into his decision making".

### Early detection, PSA screening, and management of overdiagnosis [^115oDi3a]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment rates have increased significantly since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Although it was initially thought that most prostate cancers would lead to death or significant morbidity, recent randomized trials have demonstrated that many patients with screening-detected cancer will not die of their disease. Modifications to PSA screening, screening guideline statements, and novel screening markers have been developed to minimize the risk and morbidity associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Less aggressive management strategies such as active surveillance may lead to lower treatment rates in men who are unlikely to benefit while maintaining cure rates.

### Prostate cancer and the evolving role of biomarkers in screening and diagnosis [^113rB7vd]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of prostate cancer have substantially changed over the last 3 decades. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was adopted for screening in the 1990s after it was found to be a sensitive indicator of disease. Because of a lack of specificity for significant disease, indiscriminate PSA testing led to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Several biomarkers have been developed that are superior to PSA in stratifying a man's risk for harboring potentially lethal prostate cancer.

### Prostate cancer screening and the associated controversy [^1164K9t8]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy diagnosed in men and the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. Widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening led to a decrease in mortality; however, PSA screening may have led to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant cancers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released a statement recommending against the use of PSA, which was met with concern from professional organizations. This article reviews the epidemiology of prostate cancer, data from the largest screening trials, USPSTF recommendation statement, and current strategies used to improve overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### Prostate-specific antigen screening: pro [^113gxFPv]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous malignancy among men in the USA and is most frequently diagnosed through prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening. Nevertheless, PSA testing has become increasingly controversial. In this review, we will present the evidence supporting the role of PSA in prostate cancer screening.

Recent Findings

Numerous studies have shown that the risk of current and future prostate cancer is directly related to the serum PSA level. Moreover, increasing PSA levels predict a greater risk of adverse pathologic features and worse disease-specific survival. Substantial epidemiologic evidence has suggested a reduction in advanced disease and improvements in prostate cancer survival rates since the introduction of PSA-based screening. Recently, evidence from a randomized trial further validated that PSA testing reduces both metastatic disease and prostate cancer-specific mortality.

Summary

PSA is a valid marker for prostate cancer and its aggressiveness. Level 1 evidence is now available that PSA-based screening reduces both the rate of metastatic disease and prostate cancer-specific mortality.

### Screening for prostate cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114qy1TV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2008 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for prostate cancer.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening for prostate cancer, as well as the benefits and harms of treatment of localized prostate cancer.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer (grade D recommendation). This recommendation applies to men in the general U.S. population, regardless of age. This recommendation does not include the use of the PSA test for surveillance after diagnosis or treatment of prostate cancer; the use of the PSA test for this indication is outside the scope of the USPSTF.

### Lifetime benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen–based risk-stratified screening for prostate cancer [^111DZPBh]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2020). Medium credibility.

It has long been understood that controlling the harm–benefit trade-off of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is critical for its sustainability. Strategies for reducing harms while preserving benefits include screening less frequently, using higher thresholds for biopsy referral in older men, and tailoring screening algorithms by PSA level.

The recommendation to stratify screening by PSA level is largely based on studies that stored ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid plasma in an unscreened cohort of Swedish men aged 44–60 years in the 1980s. Prostate cancer cases diagnosed up to 25 years later had statistically significantly higher PSA levels at their baseline blood draw than those not diagnosed. There was also a strong association between baseline PSA and prostate cancer mortality: 44% of prostate cancer deaths occurred in men with PSA in the top 10% of the PSA distribution at ages 44–49 years. In addition, only 0.2% of men with PSA below 1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years died from prostate cancer within 25 years. Other studies, including screened and unscreened cohorts, have confirmed that baseline PSA predicts the risk of future prostate cancer diagnosis or prostate cancer death. These studies have motivated proposals to tailor the screening intensity to a man's current PSA level. However, the implications of such stratified policies for clinically important outcomes, such as prostate cancer deaths or overdiagnosis, compared with current practices have not been evaluated. Despite this, some guidelines are already incorporating PSA-stratified screening. The European Association of Urology guideline states that targeting men at a higher risk of prostate cancer (older than age 50 years, or with PSA > 1.0 ng/mL at age 40 years, or > 2.0 ng/mL at age 60 years) might reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. The American Urological Association guideline suggests that baseline PSA may be used to guide alternative screening strategies that screen less frequently.

### Risk-based prostate cancer screening [^116DFwfa]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Widespread mass screening of prostate cancer (PCa) is not recommended because the balance between benefits and harms is still not well established. The achieved mortality reduction comes with considerable harm such as unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnoses, and overtreatment. Therefore, patient stratification with regard to PCa risk and aggressiveness is necessary to identify those men who are at risk and may actually benefit from early detection.

Objective

This review critically examines the current evidence regarding risk-based PCa screening.

Evidence Acquisition

A search of the literature was performed using the Medline database. Further studies were selected based on manual searches of reference lists and review articles.

Evidence Synthesis

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been shown to be the single most significant predictive factor for identifying men at increased risk of developing PCa. Especially in men with no additional risk factors, PSA alone provides an appropriate marker up to 30 yr into the future. After assessment of an early PSA test, the screening frequency may be determined based on individualized risk. A limited list of additional factors such as age, comorbidity, prostate volume, family history, ethnicity, and previous biopsy status have been identified to modify risk and are important for consideration in routine practice. In men with a known PSA, risk calculators may hold the promise of identifying those who are at increased risk of having PCa and are therefore candidates for biopsy.

Conclusions

PSA testing may serve as the foundation for a more risk-based assessment. However, the decision to undergo early PSA testing should be a shared one between the patient and his physician based on information balancing its advantages and disadvantages.

### Beyond PSA: the next generation of prostate cancer biomarkers [^1156KgH5]. Science Translational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening 25 years ago, prostate cancer diagnosis and management have been guided by this biomarker. Yet, PSA has proven controversial as a screening assay owing to several inherent limitations. The next wave of prostate cancer biomarkers has emerged, introducing new assays in serum and urine that may supplement or, in time, replace PSA because of their higher cancer specificity. This expanding universe of biomarkers has been facilitated, in large part, by new genomic technologies that have enabled an unbiased look at cancer biology. Such efforts have produced several notable success stories that involve rapidly moving biomarkers from the bench to the clinic. However, biomarker research has centered on disease diagnostics, rather than prognosis and prediction, which would address disease management. The development of biomarkers to stratify risk of prostate cancer aggressiveness at the time of screening remains the greatest unmet clinical need in prostate cancer. We review the current state of prostate cancer biomarker research, including the PSA revolution, its impact on early cancer detection, the recent advances in biomarker discovery, and the future efforts that promise to improve clinical management of this disease.

### Low-value prostate-specific antigen screening in older males [^113HgSM8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males worldwide. While screening for prostate cancer may reduce prostate cancer–specific mortality, it comes at the risk of overdiagnosis, particularly in older males or those with comorbid medical conditions. Screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in males who are unlikely to benefit from intervention for prostate cancer exposes these individuals to anxiety, invasive biopsies, and possible overtreatment, which could lead to unnecessary clinical consequences.

Given the lack of evidence of clinical benefit of PSA screening for prostate cancer in older males, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) published revised guidelines in 2018 that advised against PSA screening for prostate cancer in males 70 years or older due to the risk of false-positive results and overdiagnosis of indolent disease. These guidelines now recommend that males aged 55 to 69 years make the personal decision to undergo PSA screening after discussing its potential benefits and risks with their physician.

To characterize the factors associated with low-value PSA screening in males 70 years or older, we analyzed a cohort of males from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationwide survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We hypothesized that, despite the advice to the contrary, PSA screening in older males remains overused.

The statement adds "Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a preference for screening. (C recommendation)" and "The USPSTF recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older. (D recommendation)". In its evidence synthesis, the USPSTF notes "the net benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men aged 55 to 69 years is small for some men" and that in older adults "the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men".

### Prostate cancer screening (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^116uHWt1]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening by Serum PSA The prostate-specific antigen test has been examined in several observational settings for initial diagnosis of disease, as a tool in monitoring for recurrence after initial therapy, and for prognosis of outcomes after therapy. Numerous studies have also assessed its value as a screening intervention for the early detection of prostate cancer. The potential value of the test appears to be its simplicity, objectivity, reproducibility, relative lack of invasiveness, and relatively low cost. Possible explanations for the lack of a significant reduction in mortality in this trial include the following:

- Approximately 44% of the men in each study group had undergone one or more PSA tests at baseline, which would have eliminated some cancers detectable on screening from the randomly assigned population.

Thus, the cumulative death rate from prostate cancer at 10 years in the two groups combined was 25% lower in those who had undergone two or more PSA tests at baseline than in those who had not been tested.
- Improvement in therapy for prostate cancer during the trial may have resulted in fewer prostate-cancer deaths in the two study groups, which blunted any potential benefits of screening.
- After a PSA finding greater than 4 ng/mL, within 1 year only 41% of men underwent prostate biopsy; within 3 years of this finding, only 64% of men underwent prostate biopsy. Such lower biopsy rates, associated with lower prostate cancer detection rates, may have blunted the impact of screening on mortality. Overall, PSA-based screening was reported to reduce the rate of death from prostate cancer by about 20% but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis.

Of the seven centers included in the study, two individually reported a significant mortality benefit associated with prostate cancer screening. It is not readily apparent which factors at these two centers might explain the observed difference. It is important to note that the trial was not designed for individual countries to have adequate statistical power to find a significant mortality reduction. The PSA threshold for biopsy was 2. 5 ng/mL. Seventy-seven percent of men in the screened group attended at least one screen. At 18 years of follow-up, 1, 396 men in the screened group and 962 in the control group had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

### Prostate cancer screening: common questions and answers [^112vm4Rq]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer is the most diagnosed noncutaneous malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer death among men in the United States. Risk factors include older age, family history of prostate cancer, and Black race. Screening via prostate-specific antigen testing may lead to a small reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality, with no reduction in all-cause mortality, but it can cause significant harms related to false-positive test results, unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. Shared decision-making is strongly recommended by all national guidelines before initiating screening. Most guidelines recommend screening every 2 to 4 years in men 55 to 69 years of age at average risk. After a positive prostate-specific antigen test result (more than 4 ng/mL), the test should be repeated. If the prostate-specific antigen level is still elevated, next steps include multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, assessment of urine or blood biomarkers, and referral to urology. Active surveillance is increasingly accepted as the preferred standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer, because it is associated with similar long-term survival and better quality of life than curative treatment. The primary intent of screening is to identify patients with clinically significant prostate cancer who may benefit from curative treatment while minimizing the detection of clinically insignificant cancer.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA guideline [^112b8sAe]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The guideline purpose is to provide the urologist with a framework for the early detection of prostate cancer in asymptomatic average risk men.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review was conducted and summarized evidence derived from over 300 studies that addressed the predefined outcomes of interest (prostate cancer incidence/mortality, quality of life, diagnostic accuracy and harms of testing). In addition to the quality of evidence, the panel considered values and preferences expressed in a clinical setting (patient-physician dyad) rather than having a public health perspective. Guideline statements were organized by age group in years (age < 40; 40 to 54; 55 to 69; ≥ 70).

Results

Except prostate specific antigen-based prostate cancer screening, there was minimal evidence to assess the outcomes of interest for other tests. The quality of evidence for the benefits of screening was moderate, and evidence for harm was high for men age 55 to 69 years. For men outside this age range, evidence was lacking for benefit, but the harms of screening, including over diagnosis and overtreatment, remained. Modeled data suggested that a screening interval of two years or more may be preferred to reduce the harms of screening.

Conclusions

The Panel recommended shared decision-making for men age 55 to 69 years considering PSA-based screening, a target age group for whom benefits may outweigh harms. Outside this age range, PSA-based screening as a routine could not be recommended based on the available evidence.

### Recent changes in prostate cancer screening practices and epidemiology [^111ifKWa]. The Journal of Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate specific antigen based screening for prostate cancer has had a significant impact on the epidemiology of the disease. Its use has been associated with a significant decrease in prostate cancer mortality but has also resulted in the over diagnosis and overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer, exposing many men to the harms of treatment without benefit. The USPSTF (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) in 2008 issued a recommendation against screening men older than 75 years, and in 2012 against routine screening for all men, indicating that in its interpretation the harms of screening outweigh the benefits. We review changes in the use of prostate specific antigen testing, performance of prostate biopsy, incidence of prostate cancer and stage of disease at presentation since 2012.

Materials and Methods

An English language literature search was performed for terms that included "prostate specific antigen", "screening" and "United States Preventive Services Task Force" in various combinations. A total of 26 original studies had been published on the effects of the USPSTF recommendations on prostate specific antigen based screening or prostate cancer incidence in the United States as of December 1, 2016.

Results

Review of the literature from 2012 through the end of 2016 indicates that there has been a decrease in prostate specific antigen testing and prostate biopsy. As a result, there has been a decline in the incidence of localized prostate cancer, including low, intermediate and high risk disease. The data regarding stage at presentation have yet to mature but there are some early signs of a shift toward higher burden of disease at presentation.

Conclusions

These findings raise concern about a reversal of the observed improvement in prostate cancer specific mortality during preceding decades. Alternative screening strategies would 1) incorporate patient preferences by allowing shared decision-making, 2) preserve the survival benefits associated with screening, 3) improve the specificity of screening to reduce unnecessary biopsies and detection of low risk disease, and 4) promote the use of active surveillance for low risk cancers if they are detected.

### Prostate-specific antigen-based screening: controversy and guidelines [^111nqVNC]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The cause of discrepancy between the major PSA screening trials may be a result of differences in study design, screening protocol, and biopsy threshold: PLCO compared annual to opportunistic screening and relied on the community standard for indication to biopsy, while ERSPC compared biennial to quadrennial screening to no screening and defined a PSA cutoff for biopsy. As for the major intervention trials, PIVOT found that prostatectomy for PSA-diagnosed low-risk PCa may provide limited benefit, while SPCG-4 found that the same treatment is beneficial for younger patients with clinically diagnosed PCa. The forthcoming results (expected in 2016) of the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial should provide further insight regarding survival and quality of life for patients with localized PCa diagnosed by PSA screening randomized to active monitoring, prostatectomy, or radiotherapy.

Although the current guidelines regarding PSA screening differ by organization, overall they reflect the important findings of the above studies: 1) PSA screening should be offered only to men with reasonable life expectancy, 2) screening should be performed on a biennial or greater basis to minimize overdiagnosis, 3) additional data may be used to provide risk adjustments to screening interval and biopsy threshold, and, most importantly 4) the decision to undergo PSA screening should be made by both the provider and the well-informed patient after a complete discussion of the potentially limited benefit and associated harms of early PCa detection and treatment.

### Brief report: free prostate-specific antigen test utilization. consistency with guidelines [^114PMcNM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The American Cancer Society and American Urologic Association recommend prostate cancer screening for average-risk men between the ages of 50 and 75 years using digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing. Measuring the percent free PSA may improve test specificity for detecting prostate cancer when the total PSA is between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL.

Objective

To assess whether free PSA testing practices are consistent with published screening guidelines.

Design

Retrospective analysis of free PSA testing performed by a national reference laboratory between October 1, 2003 and September 30, 2004.

Measurements

Free PSA and total PSA results and the age of the patient at testing.

Results

Over 24% of free PSA tests were performed on patients greater than 75 years of age, and 38% were performed on patients with a total PSA either less than 2.5 ng/mL or greater than 10.0 ng/mL.

Conclusions

A substantial proportion of free PSA tests performed in a national reference laboratory appeared to be inconsistent with existing screening guidelines. This raises concern that some of these patients may have received inappropriate diagnostic workup and/or therapy, resulting in excess medical costs and potential harms.

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^1166SAqe]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening interval evidence and modeling — Although many U.S. men are tested annually, there is no strong evidence to recommend one interscreening interval over another, and different intervals have not been compared in a randomized controlled trial setting. The ERSPC had a screening interval of 4 years (and a PSA threshold level for biopsy of 3.0 ng/mL) in most centers, and these results provide support for a benefit of screening less frequently than every year. Modeling studies project that screening every 2 years would reduce tests and unnecessary biopsies by 50% while retaining 93% of the years of life saved; another model showed almost 50% fewer tests and unnecessary biopsies and reduced overdiagnosis by 13% while retaining 87% of the years of life saved; a third model retained 95% of the years of life saved. All assumed a PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL with screening starting at 50 years, and one showed similar results starting at 40 years. The average delay in diagnosis when moving from annual screening to every 2 years is estimated as between 5 months and 6 months. In men with very low PSA levels, conversion to a PSA above 4.0 ng/mL within 2 years or even 4 years after the initial test is very unlikely; for example, with an initial PSA < 1.0 ng/mL, only 0.24% had a positive test (PSA > 4 ng/mL) the following year and 0.51% at 2 years, whereas with an initial PSA of 1 ng/mL or 2 ng/mL, only 1.2% were positive at 1 year and 2.6% at 2 years.

### Limitations of prostate-specific antigen testing after a prostate cancer diagnosis [^114yvYSC]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is frequently used in isolation to guide treatment decisions in men with recurrent prostate cancer, a practice discouraged by prostate cancer working groups and guidelines. Instead, PSA should be used with imaging and other factors to make treatment decisions.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115kEPVc]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening benefits and harms — "Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials shows that PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer per 1000 men screened" and "may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate cancer per 1000 men screened". Harms include that "Potential harms of screening include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms" and "Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel symptoms", with quantified treatment effects: "About 1 in 5 men who undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary incontinence, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile dysfunction". The USPSTF also notes for older adults that "the harms of screening in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than in younger men".

### American cancer society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010 [^111Q1Yvb]. CA (2010). Medium credibility.

Screening test characteristics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA thresholds — systematic review and Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) findings are detailed. A systematic review of the literature was performed to assess PSA test performance among men at average risk for prostate cancer, noting that although a PSA cutoff value of 4.0 ng/mL has been used historically, many of the countries participating in the ERSPC lowered their threshold to 3.0 ng/mL. Accordingly, the review included prospective studies using either 4.0 ng/mL or 3.0 ng/mL as the cutoff value; after a full-text review of 78 studies, nine prospective studies that examined a PSA cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL in average-risk men were selected. Four studies that used a PSA cutoff of 3.0 ng/mL were deemed eligible for inclusion. In PCPT, men who had PSA levels < 3.0 ng/mL and normal DRE results were included at baseline, underwent annual PSA and DRE, and were recommended for a prostate biopsy if PSA was above 4.0 ng/mL or if DRE was abnormal; at the end of the 7-year follow-up period, all men without a diagnosis underwent a prostate biopsy. Relatively low prostate cancer detection sensitivities of 20.5% and 32.2% were reported for PSA cutoff values of 4.0 ng/mL and 3.0 ng/mL, respectively.

### Update on PSA testing [^1152tRu9]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

The use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer screening has increased dramatically over the past decade. Determining the most efficient way to use PSA testing and how to interpret total PSA levels and changes in PSA values over time remain challenging. Guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer have a direct impact on the number of unnecessary tests performed and are critical for developing a successful screening approach for prostate cancer. The age at which PSA screening should begin, PSA testing intervals, and the importance of understanding fluctuations in PSA values over time are discussed in the framework of recent discoveries in the field. Results from ongoing randomized trials will confirm whether prostate cancer screening is an effective method for reducing deaths from prostate cancer and what approaches will provide the most cost-effective screening strategies.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^111wR7FR]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Screening for prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is controversial. Screening is currently transitioning from being an all-or-nothing-question, to finding new ways of individualized testing. However, consensus remains to be reached within guideline groups and worldwide experts regarding who – and when – to screen, if at all. In this Q & A, we invite seven of the world's key opinion leaders in the field, both proponents and skeptics, to elaborate on what they believe the current screening policy should be. The authors have all published widely on PSA, and comprise a wide variety of experience in areas such as urology, epidemiology, evidence-based medicine, and medical decision-making.

Currently, only one guideline group, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), recommends against screening for all men. Most other guideline groups recommend shared decision-making, involving a discussion of the pros and cons of screening. To aid in decision-making, some propose using a risk-stratified approach taking into account multiple factors along with a PSA measurement. However, the specifics of such an approach are a subject of debate; for instance, the appropriate age limits of screening remain to be defined. Randomized screening trials, including the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the Göteborg trial have provided evidence that regular PSA-screening can reduce prostate cancer mortality by 21–44% at 13–14 years of follow-up; the age groups studied in these trials were 55–69 and 50–64 years, respectively. Thus, the question remains regarding the screening of men outside this age range. There is a growing body of evidence on the benefits of commencing screening in the mid-40s. While the American Urological Association (AUA) bases its recommendation on the 55–69 age group based on the ERSPC results, the European Urological Association recommends a baseline PSA be obtained at 40–45 years of age.

### PSA screening for prostate cancer… [^116xdrdU]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Average-risk men screened with prostate-specific antigen test for prostate cancer Efficacy End Points: Detection of prostate cancer, prevention of death or metastasis from prostate cancer, and prevention of death from any cause Harm End Points: Need for biopsy. Given the high incidence of prostate cancer, there have been aggressive efforts to screen patients with the hopes of diagnosing local cancer that can be treated before it progresses and leads to death. Elevated serum PSA levels are loosely correlated with prostate cancer. Routine PSA screening was widely adopted on the theory that tracking PSA levels would identify prostate cancer and save lives; therefore, broad screening began in many Western countries without evidence from major randomized trials to support this theory.

In the systematic review summarized here, researchers pooled the data from six randomized controlled trials with a total of 387, 286 patients. Prostate cancer mortality rate in control group:

0. **8% Prostate cancer diagnosis rate in PSA group**:
6. **4% Prostate cancer diagnosis rate in control group**:

4. **4% Adverse medical events due to biopsy in PSA group**:
0. **7% Biopsy for false-positive PSA result in PSA group**: 20%. There were more cancers diagnosed in the PSA-screened groups, suggesting a 2% difference for diagnosing a cancer in the absence of a mortality benefit. There was a slight increase in diagnosis of stage 1 and 2 prostate cancer, but no increase in the diagnosis of higher or late stage 3 or 4 prostate cancer. Many of the trials did not report complications or quality-of-life measures.

6 This randomized controlled trial showed no overall mortality benefit to PSA testing, but there was a reduction in prostate cancer mortality of 1. 07 deaths per 1, 000 men. To prevent one prostate cancer death, 935 men would need to be screened and 37 cancers would need to be detected. However, to reiterate, overall mortality was unaffected by screening. Moreover, approximately 20% of men screened needlessly underwent biopsy because of a false-positive PSA result. 6, 7.

### The new US preventive services task force "C" draft recommendation for prostate cancer screening [^116ds3gH]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a new draft guideline, with a "C" recommendation that men aged 55–69 yr should be informed about the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer, and offered prostate-specific antigen testing if they choose it. For men aged ≥ 70 yr, the recommendation remains "D", or "do not screen". This draft represents substantial progress in the right direction towards offering men a fair opportunity to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their primary care providers. However, the evidence review underlying the draft remains fundamentally inadequate, leading to biased presentations of both benefits and harms of screening. The final guideline and future revisions should reflect formal engagement with subject matter experts to optimize the advise given to men and their physicians.

Background

Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer and a leading cause of cancer mortality among men in the USA. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2025, 313 780 individuals will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and there will be approximately 35 770 deaths from prostate cancer.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing became clinically valuable for prostate cancer screening in the late 1980s. The Food and Drug Administration then approved the PSA test for monitoring prostate cancer progression in 1986. Subsequently, it was approved in conjunction with digital rectal examinations for screening asymptomatic men for prostate cancer in 1994. The widespread use of PSA testing in the 1990s led to an increase in prostate cancer diagnoses, and initially, PSA testing was recommended for all men aged 50 years and older, predicated on the finding that early detection of clinically significant prostate cancer can increase cure rates. However, following widespread adoption, studies began to show that PSA may not be as effective at screening as initially thought, and there were demonstrated harms associated with overdiagnosis.

Many men found themselves subjected to biopsy, treatment and side effects for slow-growing or indolent forms of prostate cancer that likely would not contribute to mortality. Other potential harms associated with PSA testing include anxiety and stress surrounding the testing process, false positives, which are common in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lead to unnecessary procedures, and false negatives, especially those associated with aggressive, non-PSA-producing tumours, leading to confusion for patients who are later diagnosed with prostate cancer. This newfound nuance to testing led to changes in guideline recommendations and the endorsement of shared decision-making (SDM) regarding testing to ensure patients' values and preferences were discussed and respected.

SDM is a collaborative process in which clinicians and patients partner to make healthcare decisions, integrating the best available scientific evidence with patient's values, goals and preferences. Conversations should be comprehensive of benefits, risks and alternatives, with time allocation determined by the complexity of the decision and patient needs rather than a fixed duration. Clinical guidelines from organisations such as the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Urological Association endorse this practice, emphasising the need for clinicians to engage patients in meaningful conversations about screening options. In its 2018 recommendations, the USPSTF highlights that men aged 55–69 years should make individual decisions about PSA testing after discussion with their healthcare provider, while discouraging routine screening for men aged 70 years and older due to potential harms outweighing benefits.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111Dhxgp]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Prostate cancer screening — age-related evidence scope and counseling: The 3 large randomized clinical trials predominantly included men aged 55 to 69 years. There is inadequate evidence on starting screening at a younger age or to obtain a baseline PSA level, and evidence in men 70 years or older does not support routine screening. Although some older men may request screening, men older than 70 years who request screening should be aware of the reduced likelihood of benefit and the increased risk of false-positive test results and complications of diagnosis and treatment.
