## Question

What infectious disease screening should be performed prior to stem cell transplantation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what infectious disease screening should be performed before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, presented step-by-step with verification and adjustments as needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about transplant type and epidemiologic risk mapping. Then, I should verify a core mandatory screening panel for recipients and parallel donor screening. Next, I will examine risk-based add-ons, timing, and pitfalls like passive antibody transfer. After that, I will review pediatric-specific nuances and long-term monitoring. Finally, I should synthesize an action-oriented plan that aligns prophylaxis, preemptive monitoring, and documentation with guideline-supported practices.

> Let me first confirm how transplant type and baseline risk change the screen; allogeneic HSCT carries greater infectious risk than autologous HSCT due to depth and duration of immunosuppression and GVHD, and conditioning intensity and graft source also modify risk, so I need to incorporate geographic exposures, prior infections, transfusion history, and vaccination status at baseline to correctly stratify hazards, including imported infections in migrants and travelers that can reactivate with immunosuppression [^111BNeUu].

> Now, on the core recipient herpesvirus screen, I should prioritize CMV IgG because recipient seropositivity is the dominant predictor of post-transplant reactivation and mortality; emerging data suggest that higher pre-HSCT quantitative CMV IgG titers further enrich risk, potentially guiding closer monitoring or prophylaxis, though I need to be careful to note assay variability and the hypothesis-generating nature of the data [^116YUipz] [^114itRfp].

> Wait, let me verify toxoplasma screening next; Toxoplasma gondii IgG in the recipient matters because R+ allogeneic recipients have meaningful early reactivation risk, ECIL-9 recommends weekly qPCR in high-risk periods and at least 6 months of TMP-SMX prophylaxis, with extension during ongoing immunosuppression, and pediatric prospective cohorts highlight that much of the risk clusters in the first month without prophylaxis, so preemptive molecular monitoring should not be delayed [^116t9VzJ] [^112JeS8M].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about EBV and VZV; EBV IgG helps frame PTLD risk and guides DNA monitoring in T-cell–depleted or mismatched settings per survivorship and transplant society recommendations, while VZV IgG establishes immunity for post-exposure prophylaxis and pre-transplant vaccination strategies in seronegative candidates, which is standard in SOT guidelines and extrapolated into HSCT pre-evaluation workflows [^1137rMWW].

> I need to check HHV-6 as well; ECIL guidance emphasizes HHV-6B as the principal encephalitis pathogen post-HSCT and highlights the clinical relevance of chromosomally integrated HHV-6, so pre-emptive differentiation and awareness of CIHHV-6 by PCR interpretation can prevent misattribution of high-level viremia to active disease while ensuring early recognition of encephalitis in the right clinical context [^112wKe3g].

> Next, I should review hepatitis viruses; HBV screening with HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs, plus HCV antibody with reflex RNA, is mandatory given reactivation risk under immunosuppression and potential donor transmission, and although this is canon across transplant domains, I should also remember HEV, where UK blood safety policy supports HEV RNA screening peri-transplant and studies show low but nontrivial peri-transplant viremia prevalence, arguing for PCR over serology alone in the immunocompromised host [^111hXQpX].

> I will now examine blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections; 4th generation HIV Ag/Ab, syphilis serology with confirmation, and HTLV-1/2 testing in those with epidemiologic risk remain essential because transmission via stem cell products is possible and because immunosuppression can accelerate disease course, so comprehensive pre-transplant mitigation is required [^115LkY7X].

> But wait, what if respiratory viruses are circulating; for SARS-CoV-2 I should confirm PCR screening before admission and ideally again at donation day, and defer transplantation after positivity until clinical recovery with repeat negative PCRs, since asymptomatic carriage is substantial and peri-transplant COVID-19 worsens outcomes, which NICE and EBMT-aligned guidance addressed early and updated over time, with local practice determining the number and spacing of negatives before conditioning [^116Yw8gV] [^113qJ2PW].

> Let me think about seasonal viruses like influenza and RSV; during outbreaks, targeted pre-transplant testing can reduce early post-transplant respiratory morbidity, and although some pediatric cohorts suggest tolerability of community respiratory viruses, GVHD associations and transplant-related mortality risks demand conservative screening and deferment when feasible in HSCT candidates [^notfound].

> I should confirm bacterial and mycobacterial considerations; IGRA for latent TB is preferred in most settings, with TST if IGRA is unavailable, particularly in migrants from high-incidence regions, and diarrheal illness pre-transplant warrants standard-of-care stool diagnostics for C. difficile per pediatric oncology and transplant care pathways to avoid missing modifiable enteric risks before conditioning [^112n66WA].

> Next, I need to ensure parasitic and imported infection screening is risk-based; Strongyloides serology in those from endemic regions is critical to prevent hyperinfection, and screening for Schistosoma, Chagas disease, malaria, and leishmaniasis should follow exposure history, as reactivation or recrudescence under post-HSCT immunosuppression can be catastrophic but is preventable with preemptive therapy when identified [^112n66WA].

> Let me first confirm that donor screening mirrors recipient screening; donor CMV, EBV, and toxoplasma IgG serology inform pairing risk, with CMV D−/R+ carrying the highest CMV risk for the recipient, and standard infectious screens for HBV, HCV, HIV, syphilis, and HTLV-1/2 apply, while repeat CMV serology at time of transplant is a consistent theme in SOT guidance that most centers operationalize analogously for HSCT donor-recipient risk confirmation [^113kPCWY] [^112ujTrm] [^115hgwUh].

> Hold on, I should verify donor-specific anti-HLA antibody testing because it modifies infectious risk indirectly through graft outcomes; ASTCT 2024 recommends solid-phase screening and identification for candidates with mismatches, C1q testing in specific scenarios, and considering cell-based assays, since DSA management impacts engraftment and, by extension, infectious vulnerability through graft function and immunosuppression intensity [^114edAgQ] [^111W3vGw] [^114TtxV8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, there is a pitfall with CMV serology I must not miss; passive antibody transfer from blood products or IVIG can yield false-positive CMV IgG, so I should obtain pre-transfusion baselines when possible, consider CMV cell-mediated immunity assays to adjudicate true infection history when serology is indeterminate or low-positive, and reclassify to R− when supported, an approach supported by reclassification data and by SOT guidance endorsing CMI testing when passive antibodies are suspected [^112PE9Jw] [^113rPDod].

> I should double-check timing; obtaining serologies within 30 days before transplant and repeating at the time of transplant when prior testing is older or exposures occurred improves accuracy, a practice mirrored in SOT CMV guidance and UK practice statements that many HSCT programs adapt to reduce misclassification at the moment of conditioning [^113kPCWY] [^112ujTrm].

> Next, I should review pediatric-specific adjustments; infants with SCID have high pre-HSCT infection risk despite newborn screening, so stringent isolation, immunoglobulin replacement, and standardized antimicrobial prophylaxis are essential, and timing HSCT before infectious complications improves survival, underscoring the need for aggressive pre-transplant ID mitigation in this subgroup [^115fmDvU] [^115cYs5g].

> Let me consider pregnancy after prior HSCT as a special case; because circulating blood cells and DNA reflect the donor, prenatal infectious and hematologic screening must refer back to pre-HSCT samples and serologies for accuracy, and obstetric teams must coordinate with transplant clinicians to correctly assess risks such as hepatitis B transmission and hemolytic disease, which requires deliberate re-evaluation [^114dY7fs].

> I will now examine early and late post-transplant monitoring to close the loop; for CMV, weekly PCR through day 100 with risk-adapted thresholds and dynamic monitoring beyond day 100 when immunosuppression escalates is standard, and higher CMV viral loads correlate with mortality even in the preemptive therapy era, so vigilance during and after prophylaxis is warranted to prevent delayed-onset disease, especially with evolving prophylactic strategies like letermovir [^112xbU7U] [^116LnrcS].

> Wait, I almost forgot ocular disease risk in pediatrics; clusters of CMV retinitis have prompted centers to implement ophthalmic screening protocols in high-risk pediatric allogeneic recipients with viremia, and although saliva PCR has limited predictive value for impending DNAemia, integrating targeted organ surveillance in selected patients can reduce missed end-organ disease [^112WgXHp] [^113GUJxU].

> Next, I should review long-term survivor considerations; late viral reactivations, opportunistic fungi, and encapsulated bacterial risks persist, and international survivorship recommendations emphasize infection surveillance tailored to GVHD status and immunosuppression, with EBV/PTLD vigilance and VZV, influenza, COVID-19 prevention remaining priorities in chronic phases [^117LEAYd] [^115Zkk1H].

> Let me reconsider the action plan to ensure it is coherent; for CMV, risk-stratify by D/R serostatus and, when available, quantitative IgG, correct for passive antibodies, and choose letermovir prophylaxis versus intensive preemptive PCR monitoring with prompt antiviral therapy, recognizing mortality associations with even low-level viremia; for toxoplasma R+, combine TMP-SMX prophylaxis with weekly qPCR; for HBV core antibody–positive recipients, institute antiviral prophylaxis; maintain universal PJP prophylaxis and mold-active prophylaxis in high-risk allogeneic settings, aligning with classic and contemporary prevention frameworks [^114RUhXJ] [^116t9VzJ] [^112xbU7U].

> Hold on, I should verify documentation and communication steps; a standardized infectious risk profile that flags CMV D−/R+, toxoplasma R+, and HBV exposure, reviewed in a multidisciplinary pre-transplant ID conference, supports coordinated donor selection, conditioning timing, and peri-transplant prophylaxis, which pediatric ID best practices also underscore as a cornerstone of risk mitigation and family counseling [^1137rMWW].

Pre-transplant infectious screening is essential to **reduce morbidity and mortality** in stem cell transplantation [^114RUhXJ]. The core is **CMV serostatus** for both donor and recipient to guide risk stratification and prophylaxis [^116GuMCR] [^116YUipz]. Additional screening includes **HBV, HCV, HIV, EBV, VZV, HSV, and Toxoplasma** serologies, SARS-CoV-2 PCR, and latent TB testing (TST/IGRA) [^1137rMWW]. Screen for Strongyloides and Trypanosoma cruzi in at-risk patients, and perform MRSA/VRE surveillance per center policy [^112n66WA]. Treat active infections before conditioning, and use results to guide post-transplant monitoring and prophylaxis [^1174KgW3].

### CMV-IgG pre-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the risk for CMV reactivation and mortality [^116GuMCR]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) represents one of the most common infectious complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Currently, a common diagnostic test used to stratify the risk for CMV infection in allo-HSCT recipients is the qualitative CMV serology of donor and recipient. A positive serostatus of the recipient is the most important risk factor for CMV reactivation and is associated with reduced overall survival post-transplantation (TX). Direct and indirect effects of CMV are involved in the poorer survival outcome.

The present study investigated whether the quantitative interpretation of anti-CMV IgG before allo-HSCT might serve as a novel parameter for identifying patients at risk for CMV reactivation and worse outcomes post-TX. For this purpose, a cohort of 440 allo-HSCT recipients over a period of 10 years was retrospectively analyzed. Our findings indicated that patients with high CMV IgG pre-allo-HSCT had a higher risk of developing CMV reactivation, including clinically relevant infections, and a worse prognosis 36 months post-allo-HSCT compared to recipients with low CMV IgG values.

In the era of letermovir (LMV), this group of patients might benefit from closer CMV monitoring and, hence, earlier intervention if needed, especially after discontinuation of prophylaxis.

### Clinical aspects of CMV infection after stem cell transplantation [^117KAYJY]. Human Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most important infectious complications after stem cell transplantation (SCT). Major improvements in the management of CMV infection have been achieved during the last decade, including the introduction of safe blood product support for CMV-seronegative patients, the development of early pre-emptive antiviral therapy based on sensitive diagnostic tests, and antiviral prophylaxis. With better control of CMV infection during the first 100 days after allogeneic SCT, an increase in the incidence of CMV infection and disease after day 100 post-transplantation was observed. New methods that allow for the reconstitution of CMV-specific immune responses, such as adoptive T-cell therapy, are promising tools that might help improve the management of late CMV infection and disease.

### Guidelines from the 2017 European conference on infections in leukaemia for management of HHV-6 infection in patients with hematologic malignancies and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^112wKe3g]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Over the past ten years, it has been recognized that human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and HHV-6B are distinct species. HHV-6B, not HHV-6A, is the most frequent cause of encephalitis post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (CIHHV-6) is clinically significant. Revised European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) HHV-6 guidelines were prepared following a literature review by a group of experts and discussed at a plenary session on September 22, 2017, until consensus was reached. The guidelines specifically applying to treatment were graded according to pre-ordained criteria for the level of evidence and strength of recommendation. Participants were hematologists, microbiologists, and infectious disease specialists with expertise in infectious complications in hematology. A final slide set was posted on the ECIL website on October 2, 2017, and made available for open consultation.

- **Human herpesvirus 6A and human herpesvirus 6B**: The two species of HHV-6, HHV-6A and HHV-6B, infect and establish latency in different cell types including CD4 positive T lymphocytes, monocytes, and other epithelial, fibroblastic, and neuronal cells. No disease has been causally linked to HHV-6A, and its natural history is unknown. In contrast, HHV-6B primary infection is ubiquitous in the first two years of life, sometimes causing exanthema subitum.

### Hepatitis E infection in stem cell and solid organ transplant patients: The importance of HEV RNA screening in peri-transplant period [^111hXQpX]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is a common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. Typically associated with a self-limiting illness, infection may persist in immunosuppressed populations with significant morbidity and mortality. Based on clinical data published worldwide, UK blood safety guidance recommends universal screening for HEV RNA in blood donors and donors of tissue, organs, and stem cells.

- **Objectives**: This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the point prevalence of HEV viraemia and the clinical course of viraemic patients in the peri-transplant period in solid organ transplant (SOT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients transplanted over a 3-year period (2013–2015).

- **Study design**: Nucleic acid extracts of whole blood from patients undergoing SOT or HSCT were tested by an in-house real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for HEV RNA. Samples were tested at baseline (time of transplant), and 30, 60, and 90 days post-transplant.

- **Results**: A total of 870 patients (259 HSCT, 262 liver, and 349 kidney transplant) were included with 2,554 samples meeting the inclusion criteria. No kidney transplant patients had HEV viraemia at the time of testing. One HSCT and three liver transplant patients were found to be HEV RNA positive. Overall, this represented 0.46% of the patients testing positive for HEV viraemia.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of HEV viraemia in SOT and HSCT patients in the UK, although higher than in the general population, is low at baseline and remains low throughout the early post-transplant phase. Clearance of viraemia can be maintained.

### Challenges and pitfalls in prenatal screening in pregnancies involving allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients [^114dY7fs]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Increasing numbers of successful pregnancies are reported in recipients of allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These pregnancies may occur naturally or, more commonly, through assisted reproduction. The pregnancy outcomes are usually normal. There are currently no guidelines on the prenatal management of pregnancies involving HSCT recipients.

HSCT recipients are unique in that their red cells, lymphocytes, and even the DNA in their circulation are donor-derived. As a result, typical prenatal screening tests in parents, including mean cell volume (MCV), hemoglobin pattern, blood group, infective serology, and DNA screening, are all affected. The MCV cannot be used as a guide for iron and folate supplements or for thalassemia and sickle cell anemia screening. Such screening must be based on pre-HSCT indices and pre-HSCT DNA samples.

The risks for hemolytic disease of the newborn and hepatitis B virus transmission have to be re-evaluated based on both pre- and post-HSCT patient and donor blood group and serology results. Good communication between obstetricians and the HSCT physician is paramount to promote successful pregnancies in this distinct patient population.

### Once daily ganciclovir as initial pre-emptive therapy delayed until threshold CMV load ≥ 10000 copies/ml: a safe and effective strategy for allogeneic stem cell transplant patients [^114v7qW3]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) for cytomegalovirus (CMV) is emerging as the preferred screening method for detecting CMV viremia in patients following allogeneic bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplants. However, there are currently no universally accepted QPCR treatment thresholds at which to start pre-emptive therapy. We report here the results of a pre-emptive therapy strategy using ganciclovir (GCV) 5 mg/kg initiated once daily (ODG) and delayed until a threshold CMV load of ≥ 10,000 copies/ml in whole blood for clinically stable patients.

Sixty-nine at-risk patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplants. Among them, 48 out of 69 (70%) patients experienced an initial episode of CMV viremia. Notably, 5 out of 48 (10%) cleared viremia without requiring treatment. Of the 43 patients requiring treatment, 28 (65%) initiated treatment with ODG. Among these, 17 out of 28 (61%) successfully cleared CMV viremia on ODG, while 10 out of 28 (36%) required dose escalation to twice daily GCV due to increasing viral loads. There were two cases of CMV disease (colitis) and no deaths due to CMV disease in patients initiating treatment with ODG.

We conclude that delaying pre-emptive therapy with ODG until whole blood QPCR reaches ≥ 10,000 copies/ml is a safe and effective strategy for managing CMV viremia after allogeneic stem cell transplants in clinically stable patients.

### Infectious risks and outcomes after stem cell transplantation: Are nonmyeloablative transplants changing the picture [^111BNeUu]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Opportunistic infections contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality following myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The development of nonmyeloablative or toxicity-reduced conditioning regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation might significantly alter this scenario. These regimens are generally highly immunosuppressive but tend to have reduced effects on myelopoiesis and mucosal toxicities compared to myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning regimens. This review summarizes the infectious risks associated with each type of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation conditioning regimen and presents early clinical study results.

Although data remain preliminary, recent studies suggest that nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens may reduce the risks of bacterial infections associated with mucosal damage and persistent neutropenia. However, risks for late viral and fungal infections persist during severe graft-versus-host disease. Several case reports and series emphasize that therapeutic outcomes of infections may improve in patients receiving nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens.

In summary, infectious risks and outcomes post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation appear to be evolving with the introduction of alternative, nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. Although infections remain a significant cause of transplant-related mortality, the timing and types of infections may differ. Further studies are necessary to define appropriate prevention and treatment strategies.

### Guidelines for the management of Toxoplasma gondii infection and disease in patients with haematological malignancies and after haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation: Guidelines from the 9th European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia, 2022 [^116t9VzJ]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Patients with haematological malignancies might develop life-threatening toxoplasmosis, especially after allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Reactivation of latent cysts is the primary mechanism of toxoplasmosis following HSCT; hence, patients at high risk are those who were seropositive before transplantation. The lack of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis and various immune status parameters of the patient are other associated risk factors. The mortality of toxoplasma disease, such as with organ involvement, can be particularly high in this setting.

We have developed guidelines for managing toxoplasmosis in haematology patients through a literature review and consultation with experts. In allogeneic HSCT recipients seropositive for Toxoplasma gondii before transplant, because T. gondii infection mostly precedes toxoplasma disease, we propose weekly blood screening by use of quantitative PCR (qPCR) to identify infection early as a pre-emptive strategy. As trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis might fail, prophylaxis and qPCR screening should be combined. However, PCR in blood can be negative even in toxoplasma disease.

The duration of prophylaxis should be at least 6 months and extended during treatment-induced immunosuppression or severe CD4 lymphopenia. If a positive qPCR test occurs, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine, or pyrimethamine-clindamycin should be started, and a new sample taken. If the second qPCR test is negative, clinical judgement is recommended to either continue or stop therapy and restart as needed.

### Reexploring cytomegalovirus serology in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [^114itRfp]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Discuss the recent evidence on cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients.

- **Recent findings**: Whereas the role of CMV-specific cellular mediated immunity has recently emerged as an important factor of CMV DNAemia post-transplant, the value of CMV serology has remained unchanged through decades. It is associated with donor selection and post-transplant prophylactic and monitoring strategies. In this review, we describe and discuss the emerging reports on the association between the magnitude of pre-transplant CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and the post-transplant incidence of CMV DNAemia, as CMV IgG titer could become an additional tool in CMV risk assessment in the future.

- **Summary**: Pre-transplant recipient CMV serology may have significant implications in post-transplant CMV reactivation in allogeneic HCT recipients.

### Cytomegalovirus viral load and mortality after haemopoietic stem cell transplantation in the era of pre-emptive therapy: a retrospective cohort study [^112xbU7U]. The Lancet Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

While CMV viral load (CMV-VL) is commonly used to guide preemptive therapy in the post-transplant setting, there is little data correlating viremia with clinical endpoints. Therefore, we investigated the association of CMV-VL with mortality in the first year after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

This cohort study included patients who received an allogeneic HCT between 01 January 2007 and 28 February 2013, were CMV seropositive or had a seropositive donor, and underwent weekly plasma CMV monitoring by PCR through day 100 post-transplant. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association of CMV-VL at different thresholds with overall mortality by 1 year post-transplant, adjusting for the use of preemptive therapy and other factors such as neutropenia and graft-versus-host disease. Secondary endpoints were non-relapse mortality and CMV end organ disease by 1 year post-transplant.

Among 926 patients, the cumulative overall mortality was 30.0% (95% CI 26.9–33.0) by 1 year. CMV-VL of ≥ 250 IU/ml was associated with increased risk of early (day 0–60 post-transplant) death (adjusted HR 18.1, 95% CI 8.8–37.4). The risk was attenuated after day 60 (adjusted HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4–2.4). Similar associations were observed for higher CMV-VL thresholds. CMV-VL was also associated with increased risk of non-relapse mortality and demonstrated a dose-response relationship. The adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for CMV-VL of any positive CMV-VL below 500, 501–1000, and > 1000 IU/ml were 1.4 (0.9–2.1), 2.6 (1.3–4.9), and 5.0 (3.1–8.1), respectively.

### Death after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: Changes over calendar year time, infections and associated factors [^116T9iHz]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2020). Low credibility.

There are major caveats in this study. It examines very heterogeneous data over a prolonged period with significant variations in disease indications, donor type choice, and stem cell source over calendar years. The data were derived from multiple centers in different countries, each with distinct micro- and macroeconomic contexts. Notably, some data, such as cytogenetic profiles, were absent from the dataset.

Certain decisions were arbitrary, including the use of economic factors as of the year 2016. Centers exhibited varying attitudes toward data collection, potentially leading to different interpretations of "cause of death". The study relied on the data as reported to the database, accepting the information provided by the centers, even if it included high rates of deaths and infectious deaths of "unknown" origin.

Nevertheless, the consistency of findings across the four post-transplant phases and the confirmation of key risk factor elements are strong arguments for the validity of the data. The results were in line with the pre-set hypotheses, suggesting that factors associated with overall mortality and infections would vary depending on the post-transplant phase. Mortality was reduced in the early post-transplant phase but increased in the late phase after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which is concerning. Improvements were more rapidly apparent than deteriorations. The increase in late mortality years after transplant might not be recognized to the same extent, particularly with patients often distant from the center. Lethal infections caused by bacteria and fungi were reduced at any time point, but not completely eradicated.

### Revisiting cytomegalovirus serology in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients [^112PE9Jw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients (allo-HCTRs) with positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology may have false-positive results due to blood product transfusion-associated passive immunity.

- **Methods**: This single-center cohort study included allo-HCTRs with negative baseline (at malignancy diagnosis) CMV serology and indeterminate/low-positive (CMV IgG titer, ≥ 0.6- < 50 U/mL) pretransplant CMV serology with negative pretransplant plasma CMV DNAemia. The CMV status of those patients was reclassified from R+ to R- (CMVR- reclassification group). We compared those patients to allo-HCTRs with negative (CMV IgG titer < 0.6 U/mL) pretransplant CMV IgG (CMVR- group). We describe the number and type of patients whose pretransplant CMV status was reclassified from indeterminate/positive to negative. We reviewed all plasma CMV DNAemia tests performed during the first 6 months posttransplant in both groups to assess the safety of this approach.

- **Results**: Among 246 (84.5%) of 291 transplanted patients identified as CMVR+ pretransplant, 60 (24.4%) were reclassified from CMV serology indeterminate (N:10)/low-positive (N:50) to R-. Only 1 of 60 patients (1.67%) in the CMVR- reclassification group versus 3 of 44 (6.8%; p = 0.30) in the CMVR- group developed CMV DNAemia during the follow-up period. There were no significant differences in the number of CMV DNAemia tests performed, CMV DNAemia range, and time posttransplant between the two groups.

- **Conclusions**: One of four allo-HCT CMVR+ may be falsely flagged as R+, with significant impact on donor selection and prophylaxis.

### Community respiratory viruses are generally well tolerated in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: A brief report from the TRANSPIRE study [^113otiVY]. Haematologica (2025). Low credibility.

Patient demographics and transplant characteristics are presented in Table 1. Our cohort encompassed 146 patients, subdivided into those diagnosed with respiratory viral infections (N = 78) and those without infections (N = 68). The leading indication for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was malignancy (32.3%). Bone marrow was the most common stem cell source (60.9%), and a large portion of patients received myeloablative conditioning (50.6%). A majority had fully matched donors (63%), with 65.1% receiving transplants from unrelated donors. Notably, patients with pulmonary infectious events were younger at the time of HSCT than those without infectious events (6.8 years vs. 11.4 years, respectively).

The majority of patients (83.6%) were administered calcineurin-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, while 16.4% underwent ex vivo T-cell depletion. There was no observed difference in infectious events between the two prophylaxis regimens. Interestingly, patients with respiratory viral infections exhibited higher rates of acute GVHD compared to those without infectious events (P = 0.002).

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^111W3vGw]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, specifically concerning stem cell transplantation and management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, the ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining C1q testing before and after desensitization. This applies to patients with donor-specific antibodies greater than 2,000 mean fluorescence intensity in haploidentical HSCT and greater than 1,000 mean fluorescence intensity in single cord blood transplantation. Additionally, consider obtaining a flow cytometric crossmatch as an alternative.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: A 2023 update [^117LEAYd]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

HCT survivors have a 4- to 11-fold increased risk of developing subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) compared with the general population. Among allogeneic HCT recipients, the incidence of SMNs increases from 3.5% at 10 years to 12.8% at 15 years post-HCT. SMNs can be categorized as hematologic tumors (tMNs, PTLD) or solid tumors.

The overall incidence of tMNs is estimated to be 4% at 7 years post-HCT, with a median occurrence at 2.5 years post-HCT. Recipients of pre-HCT alkylating agents (particularly etoposide or cyclophosphamide) and possibly post-HCT cyclophosphamide are at higher risk. Survivors have a higher risk of developing tMNs after autologous HCT, but tMN rarely can arise from donor hematopoiesis in allogeneic HCT recipients. Patients who were conditioned with TBI, received ≥ 3 lines of chemotherapy, were poor stem cell mobilizers, or received lenalidomide maintenance for myeloma may be at higher risk for tMN.

The cumulative incidence of PTLD is 1% at 10 years after HCT and is associated with greater donor-recipient HLA disparity, T cell depletion, and GVHD. Patients with primary immune deficiency also are at higher risk of developing lymphomas. Recommendations on prevention and treatment of PTLD have been developed by the sixth European Conference on Infections in Leukemia and are described in detail elsewhere.

### Risk of reactivated toxoplasmosis in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: A prospective cohort study in a setting withholding prophylaxis [^112JeS8M]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Reactivation of latent toxoplasmosis may be life-threatening in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. We conducted an 8-year-long prospective study on the diagnosis and monitoring of reactivated toxoplasmosis in paediatric HSCT recipients. The primary objective was to determine the incidence of reactivated toxoplasmosis in a setting that withholds prophylaxis until engraftment. The second objective was to identify the subgroups of HSCT recipients particularly prone to reactivation who may benefit the most from regular PCR follow-up.

- **Methods**: Serological and qPCR screening targeting the Toxoplasma 529 bp gene was performed before HSCT, and continued by weekly monitoring after HSCT for a median time of 104 days.

- **Results**: Reactivated toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in 21/104 (20.2%), predominantly in allo- (19/75) and rarely in auto-HSCT (2/29) recipients. Over 50% (14/21) of cases were diagnosed during the first month after HSCT, while awaiting engraftment without prophylaxis. Toxoplasma disease evolved in only three (14.3%, 3/21) patients, all treated by allo-HSCT. Reactivation was more frequent in patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (3/27, p 0.03) and especially in recipients of haploidentical stem cells (10/20, p 0.005). Seronegative status of the donor (where known) contributed to 75% (12/16) cases of reactivated toxoplasmosis after allo-HSCT.

- **Discussion**: The presented results show that peripheral blood-based qPCR, both before and after HSCT, is a valuable asset for the diagnosis of reactivated toxoplasmosis.

### Toxoplasmosis in transplant recipients, Europe, 2010–2014 [^115oipu8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Transplantation activity is increasing, leading to a growing number of patients at risk for toxoplasmosis. We reviewed toxoplasmosis prevention practices, prevalence, and outcomes for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT; heart, kidney, or liver) patients in Europe. We collected electronic data on the transplant population and prevention guidelines/regulations and clinical data on toxoplasmosis cases diagnosed during 2010–2014. Serologic pretransplant screening of allo-hematopoietic stem cell donors was performed in 80% of countries, screening of organ donors in 100%. SOT recipients were systematically screened in six countries. Targeted anti-Toxoplasma chemoprophylaxis was heterogeneous. A total of 87 toxoplasmosis cases were recorded (58 allo-HSCTs, 29 SOTs). The 6-month survival rate was lower among Toxoplasma-seropositive recipients and among allo-hematopoietic stem cell and liver recipients. Chemoprophylaxis improved outcomes for SOT recipients. Toxoplasmosis remains associated with high mortality rates among transplant recipients. Guidelines are urgently needed to standardize prophylactic regimens and optimize patient management.

### Newborn screening followed by early treatment is essential to improve survival in SCID [^115cYs5g]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Assessing the impact of prior infections on clinical outcomes before hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we observed a significant difference in survival percentages between patients who underwent transplantation without prior infection and those who underwent transplantation after experiencing infectious conditions.

- **Outcome of patients without prior infection**: We found a survival percentage of 100% (2 out of 2 patients).

- **Outcome of patients with prior infection**: In the early diagnosis group, the survival rate was 60%, while in the late diagnosis group, it was 66.6%. However, a statistical comparison was impossible due to the small number in each group. Additionally, there were no representatives in the late diagnosis group without infection.

### Recommended screening and preventive practices for long-term survivors after hematopoietic cell transplantation: Joint recommendations of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, and the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT/CIBMTR/ASBMT) [^113sXyaX]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

More than 40,000 hematopoietic cell transplants (HCTs) are performed worldwide each year. With improvements in transplant technology, larger numbers of transplant recipients survive free of the disease for which they were transplanted. However, there are late complications that can cause substantial morbidity. Many survivors are no longer under the care of transplant centers, and many community health-care providers may be unfamiliar with health matters relevant to HCT. The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), and American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) have developed these recommendations to offer care providers suggested screening and prevention practices for autologous and allogeneic HCT survivors.

### Reexploring cytomegalovirus serology in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [^11225Wyw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The recent years have seen the reevaluation of pretransplant CMV serology, both as a means to accurately define and identify truly CMV R+ allogeneic HCT recipients, and as a potential predictor of posttransplant CMV replication. More data are urgently needed to better understand and describe the underlying pathophysiology between CMV IgG titer and CMV reactivation, in order to identify how quantified CMV IgG titer could be further incorporated into everyday clinical practice.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^1142pBhL]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

The ASTCT 2024 guidelines provide recommendations regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, specifically in the context of stem cell transplantation and the management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies through desensitization therapy. The guidelines recommend administering multimodality pre-transplant desensitization to decrease donor-specific antibodies.

- **Situation table**:
	- **Donor-specific antibodies ≤ 20,000 mean fluorescence intensity**:
		- Administer plasmapheresis, rituximab, IVIG, and infusion of donor-derived HLA, either irradiated buffy coat for the corresponding HLA class I and II, or platelet transfusions for corresponding HLA class I only.

	- **Donor-specific antibodies > 20,000 mean fluorescence intensity**:
		- Consider performing antibody titration due to bead saturation, selecting an alternative donor without corresponding HLA, or consider treating using an investigational approach.

	- **Donor-specific antibodies 2,000–10,000 mean fluorescence intensity in haploidentical HSCT or 1,000–10,000 mean fluorescence intensity in cord blood transplantation**:
		- There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a lower intensity desensitization protocol, such as rituximab with IVIG.

### The NICE COVID-19 rapid guideline on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation: development, implementation and impact [^116Yw8gV]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Following the initial rapid spread of SARS‐CoV‐2, the peak of infection in the general population occurred in mid-April 2020, with COVID-19 deaths peaking soon afterward. Measures were required to reduce the risk and to mitigate the potential interruption to a planned transplant. For example, transplant centres and donor registries advised donors to follow government guidance on strict social distancing behaviour for at least four weeks before donating. Donors were advised to keep in contact with the harvest centre and to seek advice if they developed any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.

Due to the reported asymptomatic carriage of the virus by individuals, which ranges from 18%–88% depending on the population studied, screening by throat and nasal swabs for SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR at least once prior to donation and ideally on the day of donation was recommended. Screening on the day of donation was intended to provide an audit trail rather than inform the use of the harvested stem cells. In theory, it was possible that a donor would be asymptomatic but positive for COVID-19 on the day of donation.

There have been reports of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA being detected in several organs and in blood; however, the presence of the potentially infectious virus in blood, and hence in blood products, in an asymptomatic donor is remote. The swab test on the day of donation would allow tracing in the event that a transplant recipient became unwell with COVID-19 post-transplant. Similarly, donors were asked to inform harvest teams if they developed any COVID-19 symptoms.

### Pre-transplantation strategies for infectious disease mitigation and prevention [^1137rMWW]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric infectious disease (ID) clinicians play a critical role in helping prevent and mitigate infectious risks in children peri- and post-transplantation. Prevention starts during the pre-transplant evaluation and persists throughout the solid organ transplant and hematopoietic cell transplant continuum. The pre-transplant evaluation is an opportunity to screen for latent infections, plan preventative strategies, optimize immunizations, and discuss risk mitigation practices. An ideal pre-transplant evaluation establishes a relationship with the family that further promotes post-transplant infectious risk reduction. This manuscript builds on shared pediatric ID prevention strategies, introduces updated ID testing recommendations for transplant donors/candidates, highlights emerging data, and identifies ongoing knowledge gaps that are potential areas of research.

### Recommended screening and preventive practices for long-term survivors after hematopoietic cell transplantation [^114JkEGU]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) technology and supportive care techniques have led to improvements in long-term survival after HCT. Emerging indications for transplantation, the introduction of newer graft sources (for example, umbilical cord blood), and the transplantation of older patients using less intense conditioning regimens have also contributed to an increase in the number of HCT survivors. These survivors are at risk for developing late complications secondary to pre-, peri-, and post-transplant exposures and risk factors. Guidelines for screening and preventive practices for HCT survivors were published in 2006. An international group of transplant experts was convened in 2011 to review contemporary literature and update the recommendations while considering the changing practice of transplantation and the international applicability of these guidelines. This report provides the updated recommendations for screening and preventive practices for pediatric and adult survivors of autologous and allogeneic HCT.

### Cytomegalovirus retinitis in pediatric stem cell transplants: Report of a recent cluster and the development of a screening protocol [^112WgXHp]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in the pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) population is unknown. We report a cluster of five pediatric patients with CMV retinitis diagnosed in a 12-month period and compare this to the rate of CMV viremia and retinitis in the four years prior. Presented is the ophthalmic screening protocol developed in response to this experience.

- **Design**: Retrospective cross-sectional study.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients at Children's Hospital of Colorado (CHCO) who received allogeneic HSCT between January 2010 and December 2014. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the proportion of CMV viremia and CMV retinitis in patients transplanted between January 2010 and December 2013 with those transplanted in 2014.

- **Results**: A total of 101 patients underwent allogeneic HSCT from January 2010 to December 2013; 32 (32%) tested positive for CMV viremia. No cases of CMV retinitis were identified. From January 2014 to December 2014, 28 patients underwent allogeneic HSCT; 13 patients (46%) had CMV viremia, which was not a statistically significant increase (P = 0.18). There were five cases of CMV retinitis diagnosed in those transplanted in 2014, a statistically significant increase compared with those transplanted in 2010–2013 (P = 0.0004). A multidisciplinary team was formed to review the literature, and an ophthalmic screening protocol was developed.

Our recent cluster of CMV retinitis in pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients may suggest a rise in the incidence of CMV retinitis.

### Monitoring of oral cytomegalovirus DNA shedding for the prediction of viral DNAemia in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^113GUJxU]. Journal of Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Preemptive antiviral therapy based on detecting cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNAemia above a preestablished threshold is the mainstay strategy for the prevention of CMV disease in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients. Nevertheless, CMV DNAemia, even at low levels, may increase mortality. We investigated whether surveillance of saliva for the presence of CMV DNA may anticipate the occurrence of CMV DNAemia.

This was a prospective observational study with 53 consecutively enrolled allo-HSCT recipients. Saliva and plasma specimens were collected on a weekly basis from Day 0 to Day 100 after transplantation. CMV DNA was quantified in both specimen types using the Abbott Real-Time PCR assay (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL). CMV DNA was quantifiable in 44 (83%) patients: either in saliva (n = 1) or plasma (n = 12) only, or in both specimen types (n = 31). CMV oral shedding preceded the occurrence of CMV DNAemia in eight patients (18.2%), while the opposite pattern was observed in 21 patients (47.7%).

The CMV DNA loads quantified in saliva and plasma correlated modestly (P = 0.33; P = 0.013) and did not differ in magnitude (P = 0.527). No transplantation factors, other than recipient CMV seropositivity, were associated with oral CMV DNA shedding. Serum CMV IgG levels were comparable, regardless of the timing of the detection of CMV DNA at both sites.

In summary, screening of saliva specimens for the presence of CMV DNA appears to be of limited value for anticipating the occurrence of CMV DNAemia in allo-HSCT recipients.

### CNS infections in patients with hematological disorders (including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation)-Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (DGHO) [^114a56rh]. Annals of Oncology (2016). High credibility.

CNS infections related to specific causative agents are a significant concern for allo-HSCT recipients.

- **Parasitic CNS infections**: Toxoplasma spp. are among the most common causative agents in allo-HSCT recipients with CNS infections. However, other parasitic CNS infections such as malaria, microsporidiosis, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, or helminthic infections have also been described in immunocompromised hosts.

- **Toxoplasma species**: Mental abnormalities, fatigue, and fever are frequent clinical symptoms in allo-HSCT recipients with cerebral toxoplasmosis. Neuroimaging by MRI frequently shows typical hypo-/isointensities mainly in the basal ganglia and the frontal lobe. Higher sensitivity of MRI compared with CT scans has been demonstrated in a comparative retrospective analysis. However, typical nodular or ring enhancement surrounded by edema was visible by MRI in only 60% of allo-HSCT patients. Besides neuroimaging, diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis is based on the demonstration of tachyzoites or cysts in the CSF [A], CSF PCR [B], and serological tests such as CSF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [C].

Primary treatment of cerebral toxoplasmosis should comprise a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine [AII t]. Pyrimethamine in combination with clindamycin [BII t] or single-agent trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [BII t] may alternatively be used. Maintenance treatment should be conducted for at least 3 months [BIII]. Atovaquone could be administered in patients with intolerance or refractoriness to conventional antitoxoplasmic agents [BII t, u].

- **Fungi**: The predominant fungal pathogens causing CNS infections in patients with hematological disorders can include several distinct species that require targeted therapy.

### Prevention and management of CMV-related problems after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^1169s5fo]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

The prevention and management of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have improved substantially in the past decade. However, with this improvement, there is increased complexity in deciding which diagnostic tests, treatment strategies, and immunologic assessments are optimal for different patient populations. The purpose of this review is to address certain practical problems that commonly arise and suggest a suitable approach to management that should have wide applicability.

### The NICE COVID-19 rapid guideline on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation: development, implementation and impact [^116uMB1S]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing HSCT are immunocompromised and may have atypical presentations of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. They are also susceptible to other post‐transplant complications, which may have similar symptoms to COVID‐19, including neutropenic sepsis or pneumonia caused by other pathogens. The expert panel was concerned that patients who feel unwell may be advised to isolate at home, which means that other types of infection or neutropenic sepsis―which is immediately life‐threatening―could be missed. Consequently, the guideline recommends that patients with new symptoms suggestive of COVID‐19 contact their transplant centre rather than the national NHS emergency telephone number to receive specialist advice. The guidance also aligns with existing NICE guidance for people with cancer and suspected neutropenic sepsis, recommending assessment in secondary or tertiary care and offering immediate empirical antibiotic therapy (NICE CG151 14).

Patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID‐19 require testing for SARS‐CoV‐2. Isolation and the use of PPE are required until the test result is known. If a patient tests positive for SARS‐CoV‐2, NG164 recommends following UK guidance on the management of exposed healthcare workers and patients in hospital settings, which includes information on testing and isolating patients.

### A randomised trial comparing cytomegalovirus antigenemia assay vs screening bronchoscopy for the early detection and prevention of disease in allogeneic bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplant recipients [^116GKEYa]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Preemptive antiviral therapy is often employed for CMV prevention following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Two common strategies include screening bronchoscopy for CMV post-BMT or regular CMV antigenemia testing with ganciclovir administration for a positive result. In a randomised trial, we prospectively compared the efficacy of these two preemptive strategies. Consecutive patients were randomized to either a bronchoscopy for CMV on day 35 post-BMT or weekly CMV antigenemia testing. If the bronchoscopy was positive for CMV, patients received preemptive ganciclovir for 8–10 weeks. If the antigenemia was positive for CMV, patients received a minimum of two weeks of preemptive ganciclovir. The primary endpoint was the development of active CMV disease.

One hundred and eighteen allogeneic BMT patients were enrolled (60 in the antigenemia arm and 58 in the bronchoscopy arm). The two groups were comparable with respect to baseline demographic data, underlying disease, conditioning regimen, and immunosuppression. Active CMV disease developed in 7 out of 58 (12.1%) patients in the bronchoscopy arm versus 1 out of 60 patients (1.7%) in the CMV antigenemia arm (P = 0.022). Based on the screening test, 13.8% of patients received preemptive ganciclovir in the bronchoscopy arm compared to 48.3% of patients in the antigenemia arm (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the rate of graft-versus-host disease, bacteremia, invasive fungal infections, or mortality between the two groups. Preemptive therapy based on regular CMV antigenemia monitoring is superior to screening bronchoscopy for the prevention of CMV disease after allogeneic BMT.

### Pretransplant evaluation for infections in donors and recipients of solid organs [^115LkY7X]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The risk of infectious disease reactivation in recipients of and transmission by solid-organ transplants remains, and thorough screening and testing of both recipients and donors is especially important. When designing screening strategies, it is crucial to consider the sensitivity and specificity of individual diagnostic tests within the context of their use. Furthermore, recognizing special risks for infectious complications of transplantation will help guide preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic steps to control infectious complications in individual patients. The acceptability of risks for infectious complications after transplantation also depends on the urgency of transplanting a vital organ as well as the availability of organs. Although these principles are well accepted, standards for the extent of screening, criteria for inappropriate donors, and the exclusion of unfit recipients remain somewhat controversial.

### Guideline for the management of infection in children and adolescents with cancer and pediatric hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation recipients [^112Hjx4B]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). High credibility.

With the assistance of a library scientist, we searched for randomized trials indexed from 1980 to March 15, 2018, in the following databases: Medline, Medline in-process, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Full search strategies are available in the Data Supplement.

Eligibility criteria were defined a priori. We included studies if patients were human participants, it was a fully published randomized trial with a parallel group design, and it evaluated an intervention for the prevention or treatment of CDI. Exclusion criteria were: for prevention interventions, CDI was not a study end point or was reported as an adverse event; and for treatment interventions, the study population comprised less than 90% of patients who were determined to have C. difficile as a cause of diarrhea. Studies published in any language were evaluated.

Screening of titles and abstracts, review of full articles for eligibility, and data abstraction were performed independently by two investigators (C.D. and P.D.R.). Any disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer (L.S.). Agreement on study inclusion between reviewers was evaluated using the κ statistic. Strength of agreement was defined as slight (0.00 to 0.20), fair (0.21 to 0.40), moderate (0.41 to 0.60), substantial (0.61 to 0.80), or almost perfect (0.81 to 1.00).

- **Interventions for prevention and treatment of CDI**: For prevention studies, the primary outcome was CDI as defined by the presence of diarrhea and a measure of C. difficile toxin from stool.

### Risks, diagnosis and outcomes of invasive fungal infections in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^115N9uF8]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) continue to cause considerable morbidity and mortality in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. This review focuses on the risks for and diagnosis of IFIs (candidiasis, aspergillosis, and other mould infections) and factors that affect outcomes. Diagnosis of IFI is difficult, with the sensitivity of the gold standard tests (culture and histopathology) often below 50%. Therefore, physicians rely on a constellation of clinical signs, radiography, culture, histopathology, and adjunctive tests to establish diagnosis. HSCT recipients often have multiple co-morbidities, and understanding the outcomes and prognostic variables is therefore important for overall management. This paper reviews historical trends and data.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: A 2023 update [^115Zkk1H]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

HCT survivors are at risk for developing infections and autoimmune diseases post-HCT; however, significant gaps still remain in our knowledge of immune dysfunction as a late effect of HCT. Infection is a significant cause of late mortality after allogeneic HCT, even in individuals without cGVHD. Late CMV infections are seen most frequently in patients with early CMV disease, cGVHD, and late immune manipulation (e.g. lymphocyte infusions). Other viral infections that may lead to significant hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality include varicella zoster virus (VZV), influenza, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Survivors are also at risk for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) (see Subsequent Malignant Neoplasms), and hepatitis B and C viruses (see Gastrointestinal Complications).

Several risk factors affect the incidence of late fungal infections, including cGVHD with ongoing immunosuppression, history of relapse, age, underlying disease, type of conditioning (especially with TBI), umbilical cord blood graft source, and the use of T cell depletion. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is rare unless there is nonadherence with prescribed prophylaxis; however, when it does occur, the mortality rate is high. Finally, bacterial infections pose a risk for long-term survivors with asplenia, cGVHD, a central line, unvaccinated status, or other risk factors.

### The NICE COVID-19 rapid guideline on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation: development, implementation and impact [^113qJ2PW]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Transplant recipients are particularly susceptible to viral infections, and it is well-documented that respiratory viral infections can increase transplant-related mortality. Recent evidence also suggests this holds true for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients who contract a SARS-CoV-2 infection, with recommendations including social distancing, regular hand washing, and self-isolation for the 14 days prior to admission. Patients should also be tested for SARS-CoV-2 before admission, regardless of whether they exhibit symptoms, due to the significant rate of asymptomatic virus carriers.

If patients have been in close contact with an individual infected with COVID-19 in the preceding week, a deferral of transplant by three weeks was initially recommended. This was in line with European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) guidance at that time. However, the interval has since been reduced to a minimum of 14 days by the EBMT before the commencement of any transplant-related procedures, and this guideline is subject to further modification.

For patients with high-risk hematological disease progression, morbidity, or mortality who test positive for SARS-CoV-2, it is advised that the transplant be deferred until they are asymptomatic and have three negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests taken at least one week apart. This is similar to EBMT guidance, which recommends two negative swabs, a deferral of 14 days from the first negative swab, and a repeated swab before the start of conditioning. For patients with lower-risk disease, it is suggested that their transplant is delayed by three months.

### CMV-IgG pre-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the risk for CMV reactivation and mortality [^116juN1r]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The study highlights the necessity for early parameters to identify immunocompromised patients at risk for opportunistic infections. Traditionally, CMV serostatus has been used as a qualitative parameter for transplant recipients. This study demonstrates a significant association between anti-CMV IgG values before allo-HSCT and the risk for CMV reactivation and late mortality post-transplantation. In the LMV era, these patients might benefit from closer CMV monitoring, enabling earlier intervention if needed, particularly after discontinuation of prophylaxis.

- **Limitations**: Some limitations of the study include the following. Specimens with anti-CMV IgG values greater than 250 AU/ml were flagged as " ≥ 250 AU/ml" and not further diluted to obtain more precise results. There was no evidence to justify performing this additional step routinely. Another limitation is that serology results were reported in AU/ml, while different assays from various manufacturers use different units, lacking a common standard. Additionally, the study has an explorative, hypothesis-forming character, and larger group sizes would be necessary to detect small effect sizes as defined by Cohen. Therefore, larger prospective multicenter studies are needed to validate the findings before quantitative pre-transplantation IgG values can be used as an established predictor in the clinical setting. Additionally, in future research, anti-CMV IgG values exceeding 250 AU/ml should be diluted to achieve greater precision.

### Reexploring cytomegalovirus serology in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [^114wstZy]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to discuss recent evidence on cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients.

Recent findings highlight that although CMV-specific cellular-mediated immunity has emerged as an important factor in CMV DNAemia post-transplant, the value of CMV serology has remained unchanged over the decades. This is closely associated with donor selection and post-transplant prophylactic and monitoring strategies. This review describes and discusses emerging reports on the association between the magnitude of pre-transplant CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and post-transplant incidence of CMV DNAemia, suggesting that CMV IgG titer could serve as an additional tool in CMV risk assessment in the future.

In summary, pre-transplant recipient CMV serology may have significant implications for post-transplant CMV reactivation in allogeneic HCT recipients.

### Infections in infants with SCID: Isolation, infection screening, and prophylaxis in PIDTC centers [^115fmDvU]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

The Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) enrolled children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in a prospective natural history study of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) outcomes over the last decade. Despite newborn screening (NBS) for SCID, infections occurred prior to HSCT. This study's objectives were to define the types and timing of infection prior to HSCT in patients diagnosed via NBS or by family history (FH) and to understand the breadth of strategies employed at PIDTC centers for infection prevention.

We analyzed retrospective data on infections and pre-transplant management in patients with SCID diagnosed by NBS and/or FH and treated with HSCT between 2010 and 2014. PIDTC centers were surveyed in 2018 to understand their practices and protocols for pre-HSCT management.

Infections were more common in patients diagnosed via NBS (55%) versus those diagnosed via FH (19%) [p = 0.012]. Outpatient versus inpatient management did not impact infections (47% vs 35%, respectively; p = 0.423). There was no consensus among PIDTC survey respondents as to the best setting (inpatient vs outpatient) for pre-HSCT management. While isolation practices varied, immunoglobulin replacement and antimicrobial prophylaxis were more uniformly implemented.

Infants with SCID diagnosed due to FH had lower rates of infection and proceeded to HSCT more quickly than those diagnosed via NBS. Pre-HSCT management practices were highly variable between centers, although uses of prophylaxis and immunoglobulin support were more consistent.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^114TtxV8]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, specifically concerning stem cell transplantation, the ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining anti-HLA antibodies testing as part of the pre-HSCT evaluation. This testing should be conducted within one month before starting the conditioning regimen for all candidates using related, unrelated, or cord blood grafts with mismatched HLA antigens or alleles.

### Dendritic cell recovery after autologous stem cell transplantation [^1114PFbX]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

There is persistent immunosuppression not only in allogeneic but also in autologous stem cell transplantation because humoral and cellular immunity may take a year or more to return to normal, with an increased risk of infectious complications. This immune defect may also involve antigen presentation, particularly dendritic cell (DC) function. We evaluated DC subset reconstitution in 58 patients who underwent bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

In all patients, DC type 1 (DC1) and DC type 2 (DC2) were already significantly lower than in normal individuals before conditioning therapy (DC1/microl 3.1 ± 1.0, DC2/microl 3.0 ± 1.1). On day 0 and day +7, the mean DC1 and DC2 numbers were very low in both groups. Patients who received unmanipulated marrow or peripheral blood stem cells reached pre-conditioning levels of DC1 and DC2 cells on day +20. In patients receiving selected CD34 cells, DC increased slowly, and pre-transplant counts were observed only on day +60. Nearly 'normal' levels of DC1 and DC2 could be observed in the first group from day +180 and were maintained thereafter; in CD34(+) selected patients, DC1 and DC2 counts remained lower than normal.

Our data emphasize that circulating antigen-presenting cells (APCs) recover quickly. It remains to be determined if DC frequency in PB reflects their tissue function. The relatively low incidence of infections in patients undergoing autologous transplantation, despite defective lymphocyte reconstitution, could be related to functionally efficient DC.

### CMV-IgG pre-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the risk for CMV reactivation and mortality [^116YUipz]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) represents one of the most common infectious complications after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Currently, a common diagnostic test used to stratify the risk for CMV infection in allo-HSCT recipients is the qualitative CMV serology of both donor and recipient. A positive serostatus of the recipient is the most important risk factor for CMV reactivation and is associated with reduced overall survival post-transplantation (TX). Direct and indirect effects of CMV are involved in the poorer survival outcome.

The present study investigated whether the quantitative interpretation of anti-CMV IgG before allo-HSCT might serve as a novel parameter for identifying patients at risk for CMV reactivation and worse outcomes post-TX. For this purpose, a cohort of 440 allo-HSCT recipients over ten years was retrospectively analyzed. Our findings indicated that patients with high CMV IgG pre-allo-HSCT had a higher risk of developing CMV reactivation, including clinically relevant infections, and exhibited a worse prognosis 36 months post-allo-HSCT compared to recipients with low CMV IgG values. In the letermovir (LMV) era, this group of patients might benefit from closer CMV monitoring and, hence, earlier intervention if needed, especially after discontinuation of prophylaxis.

### CMV-IgG pre-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the risk for CMV reactivation and mortality [^1134z4sv]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has a negative impact on patient outcomes, and a CMV-positive serostatus is an independent risk factor for non-relapse mortality, as shown by consistent data. In line with these observations, prevention remains crucial to protect transplant recipients from the adverse effects of CMV. Thus, the identification of new diagnostic tools that can individualize risk stratification is urgently needed to optimize antiviral drug exposure and the intensity of immunosuppressive regimens.

Currently, the pre-transplant (pre-TX) assessment of donor (D) and recipient (R) serostatus is the most common laboratory assay used to stratify the risk for CMV after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).

In the post-transplant period, monitoring CMV cell-mediated immunity through the interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is increasingly recognized as a valid tool to assess patients' immune responses in controlling viral replication. The detection of anti-CMV IgG is an important qualitative biomarker for defining latent CMV infection in recipients and donors. However, the relevance of anti-CMV IgG as a quantitative value has been poorly considered. The few available data suggest that the quantitative determination of specific anti-CMV IgG could represent an early parameter for CMV risk assessment in candidates for allo-HSCT.

In this retrospective analysis, we investigated whether the pre-allo-HSCT anti-CMV IgG value, measured by a widely used commercially automated assay, might serve as a novel parameter to identify patients at higher risk for CMV reactivation and, eventually, poorer outcomes post-transplant.

### Routine screening for psychosocial distress following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^115PYo6e]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of cancer are often associated with high levels of psychosocial distress, yet exploration of these issues is rarely included in routine oncologic care. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of screening for psychosocial distress after autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A total of 80 adults were enrolled in Boston, MA, USA. Subjects completed self-administered assessments prior to hospital admission, at their first clinic visit after hospital discharge, and at 100 days post-transplant.

Assessments included validated instruments assessing psychosocial distress and quality of life (QOL). Elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression were detected in 55% of those providing pre-transplant assessments and were associated with compromised QOL. Post-transplant screening was successfully performed in 69% of subjects, identifying that 44% had symptoms of depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Pre-transplant distress was associated with the detection of distress after transplantation (81% vs. 13%, P < 0.0001).

In summary, we detected high levels of distress in transplant patients using self-administered tools. Pre-transplant distress appears to be highly predictive of distress post-transplant and is a feasible marker to target screening and intervention programs.

### Summary of the guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^114RUhXJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

This article contains highlights of "Guidelines for Preventing Opportunistic Infections among Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients: Recommendations of the CDC, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation", which was published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. There are sections on prevention strategies for bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and helminth infections, as well as hospital infection control, strategies for safe living following transplantation, immunizations, and hematopoietic stem cell safety. The guidelines are evidence-based, and prevention strategies are rated by both the strength of the recommendation and the quality of evidence that supports it. Recommendations are given for preventing cytomegalovirus disease with prophylactic or preemptive gancyclovir, herpes simplex virus disease with prophylactic acyclovir, candidiasis with fluconazole, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Hopefully, following the recommendations made in the guidelines will reduce morbidity and mortality from opportunistic infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.

### Influence of invasive aspergillosis during acute leukaemia treatment on survival after allogeneic stem cell transplantation: a prospective study of the EBMT infectious diseases working party [^117JHRTH]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a standard therapy for hematologic malignancies and is also used for the treatment of a variety of non-malignant diseases in children and adults. The number of performed alloSCTs is constantly increasing, with nearly 20,000 transplantations reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) per year. The main clinical challenge of alloSCT is its high treatment-associated mortality, known as non-relapse mortality (NRM). Due to the profound secondary immunodeficiency associated with alloSCT, infectious complications are a major contributor to alloSCT-associated NRM.

Acute leukaemia is the main indication for alloSCT. Patients with acute leukaemia are initially treated with intensive chemotherapy to induce remission (induction therapy). Patients with a high risk of relapse subsequently receive alloSCT, which is often the only life-saving procedure available. Almost all acute leukaemia patients experience infectious complications during remission induction therapy. One frequent and severe infectious complication in this setting is invasive aspergillosis (IA), which most commonly affects the lungs but can spread to the central nervous system, soft tissues, intestines, and other parts of the body. Because of its high incidence during leukaemia induction therapy and its long persistence in immunocompromised hosts, a considerable number of alloSCT recipients have a history of IA.

Historically, patients with IA were considered non-eligible to receive alloSCT due to the very high risk of IA-associated complications.

### Imported disease screening prior to chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation for oncohematological malignancies [^112n66WA]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Reactivation of latent imported infections has been periodically reported in migrant patients undergoing immunosuppression. We performed a prospective study at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital (Barcelona, Spain). Migrant patients over 16 years with the diagnosis of any oncohematologic disease were included. Patients were tested for soil-transmitted helminths, hepatitis virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Treponema pallidum, human T-cell lymphotropic virus, latent tuberculosis infection, Toxoplasma spp. Plasmodium infection, Schistosoma spp. Trypanosoma cruzi infection, Leishmania spp., and dimorphic fungi. Patients were treated and followed for one year to assess reactivation. A total of 42 patients were included in this study. The median age was 39 (31–51) years. Twenty-five (59.5%) patients were women. More than half of the patients were of Latin American origin. Sixteen patients (38.1%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Of the patients, 71.4% had at least one imported infection. Patients with at least one positive result in the screening did not show any statistically significant association with the studied variables. We did not find any reactivation of the treated latent infections. After specific treatment, we did not observe any reactivation. Screening of latent imported infections prior to immunosuppressive treatment is easy to perform, and it may be lifesaving.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: A 2023 update [^111nncqq]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

As hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and cellular therapy expand to new indications and international access improves, the number of HCTs performed annually continues to rise. Parallel improvements in HCT techniques and supportive care result in more patients surviving long term, creating further emphasis on survivorship needs. Survivors are at risk for developing late complications secondary to pretransplantation, peritransplantation, and post-transplantation exposures and other underlying risk factors.

Guidelines for screening and preventive practices for HCT survivors were originally published in 2006 and then updated in 2012. An international group of experts was convened to review the contemporary literature and update the recommendations while considering the changing practices of HCT and cellular therapy. This review provides updated pediatric and adult survivorship guidelines for HCT and cellular therapy.

- **Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD)**: The contributory role of cGVHD to the development of late effects is discussed, but cGVHD management is not covered in detail.

These guidelines emphasize the special needs of patients with distinct underlying HCT indications or comorbidities (e.g. hemoglobinopathies, older adults) but do not replace more detailed group-, disease-, or condition-specific guidelines. Although these recommendations should be applicable to the vast majority of HCT recipients, resource constraints may limit their implementation in some settings.

### Essential requirements for setting up a stem cell processing laboratory [^112Arw4m]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The Graft Processing Subcommittee of the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation wrote this guideline to assist physicians and laboratory technologists with setting up a cell processing laboratory (CPL) to support a hematopoietic stem cell transplant program, thereby facilitating the start-up of a transplant program in a new location and improving patient access to transplantation worldwide. This guideline describes the minimal essential features of designing such a laboratory and provides a list of equipment and supply needs, along with staffing recommendations. It describes the typical scope of services that a CPL is expected to perform, including product testing services, and discusses the basic principles behind the most frequent procedures.

- **Quality management (QM) principles**: Specific to a CPL are discussed. References to additional guidance documents that are available worldwide to assist with QM and regulatory compliance are also provided.

### Toxoplasmosis after allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation-disease burden and approaches to diagnosis, prevention and management in adults and children [^1149nbsM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). High credibility.

Toxoplasmosis is a rare but highly lethal opportunistic infection following allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Successful management depends on screening, early recognition, and effective treatment.

- **Objectives**: To review the epidemiology and approaches to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of toxoplasmosis in adult and pediatric allogeneic HCT recipients.

- **Source**: Search of the English literature published in MEDLINE up to 30 June 2020 using combinations of broad search terms including toxoplasmosis, transplantation, diagnosis, epidemiology, prevention, and treatment. Selection of articles for review and synthesis on the basis of perceived quality and relevance of content.

- **Content**: Toxoplasmosis continues to be a major challenge in the management of allogeneic HCT recipients. Here, we provide a summary of published case series of toxoplasmosis in adult and pediatric patients post allogeneic HCT. We review and discuss the pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and recommendations for prevention and treatment. We also discuss the impacts of toxoplasmosis in this setting and factors affecting outcomes, emphasizing attention to neurological, neuropsychological, and neurocognitive late effects in survivors.

- **Implications**: Apart from careful adherence to established strategies of disease prevention through avoidance of primary infection, identification of seropositive patients, and implementation of molecular monitoring, future perspectives to improve the control of toxoplasmosis in allogeneic HCT recipients may include further research and innovation.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis and preemptive approaches for the prevention of infections in the stem cell transplant recipient, with analogies to the hematologic malignancy patient [^1174KgW3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Infectious complications represent one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Prophylactic and preemptive treatment strategies against bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens are routinely implemented during high-risk post-HCT periods at most transplant centers. The basic concepts and guidelines of antibiotic prophylaxis and empirical/preemptive antibiotic treatment in allogeneic HCT recipients are reviewed in this article.

### Toxoplasmosis in transplant recipients, Europe, 2010–2014 [^117VKr6Q]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Transplantation activity is increasing, leading to a growing number of patients at risk for toxoplasmosis. We reviewed toxoplasmosis prevention practices, prevalence, and outcomes for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT; heart, kidney, or liver) patients in Europe. We collected electronic data on the transplant population, prevention guidelines, and regulations, as well as clinical data on toxoplasmosis cases diagnosed during 2010–2014.

Serologic pretransplant screening of allo-hematopoietic stem cell donors was performed in 80% of countries, while screening of organ donors was conducted in 100% of countries. SOT recipients were systematically screened in six countries. Targeted anti-Toxoplasma chemoprophylaxis was heterogeneous. A total of 87 toxoplasmosis cases were recorded, with 58 in allo-HSCTs and 29 in SOTs. The 6-month survival rate was lower among Toxoplasma-seropositive recipients, as well as among allo-hematopoietic stem cell and liver recipients. Chemoprophylaxis improved outcomes for SOT recipients.

Toxoplasmosis remains associated with high mortality rates among transplant recipients. Guidelines are urgently needed to standardize prophylactic regimens and optimize patient management.

### Clinical impact of enhanced diagnosis of invasive fungal disease in high-risk haematology and stem cell transplant patients [^111orjx1]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

To investigate the impact of routine use of biomarkers for diagnosing fungal infection within a care pathway on antifungal usage and clinical outcomes, a cohort of high-risk haematology and stem cell transplant patients was entered into a neutropenic care pathway. In this pathway, targeted diagnostic testing replaced empiric antifungal treatment. Patients were screened twice a week by PCR and antigen testing during fever or when chronic graft versus host disease was present and were followed-up for a minimum of one year.

No excess morbidity or mortality was seen in patients in whom empiric antifungal treatment was withheld, and there were substantial savings in antifungal drug expenditure. The introduction of a comprehensive diagnostic surveillance strategy to exclude invasive fungal infection in high-risk patients with haematological malignancy and those undergoing transplantation can result in improvements in clinical management. There are also potential additional benefits of improved patient survival, decreased morbidity, and decreased hospital stay.

### International recommendations for screening and preventative practices for long-term survivors of transplantation and cellular therapy: A 2023 update [^1146fAM2]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Low credibility.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially lifesaving treatment for many diseases. With expansion to new indications, better international access, and improved outcomes, the population of long-term HCT survivors is rapidly growing. However, survivors face serious long-term medical issues, psychosocial challenges that often impact quality of life (QoL), and decreased life expectancy. Consequently, prevention and recognition of late effects, followed by prompt intervention, are crucial to improving long-term outcomes in survivors. Additionally, there is an urgent need to better understand the biology and patient experience of HCT's late effects, as well as the ideal health care delivery infrastructure for managing this growing population.

Previous guidelines for long-term survivors of HCT were produced as collaborative efforts by multiple societies in 2006 and 2012. To update guidelines and provide further geographic diversity, we convened a working group of experts from multiple international organizations as well as patient advocates. We set out to design these recommendations to adapt to evolving treatment paradigms in transplantation and cellular therapy. The topics are organized by organ system or complication type. Tables with recommendations have been created by organ system, and supplementary tables that include more detailed information are also provided. Owing to the overall scope of the topic, several appendices are included.

It should be noted that many late effects may take years or even decades to manifest and recommend

### CMV-IgG pre-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the risk for CMV reactivation and mortality [^112YD6xd]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) represents one of the most important opportunistic infections after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Despite relevant advances in diagnostics and therapy, CMV continues to adversely affect the clinical outcome in this group of vulnerable patients. The risk of CMV infection after allo-HSCT varies according to the serostatus of donor (D) and recipient (R). CMV infections following allo-HSCT are mostly the consequence of viral reactivation in seropositive recipients (R+). Up to 80% of CMV seropositive recipients can experience viral reactivation after allo-HSCT, with the CMV discordant serostatus (D-/R+) associated with the highest risk for severe CMV disease.

Besides being one of the most important risk factors for CMV reactivation and disease, a CMV positive serostatus of the recipient pre-transplantation (TX) is known to be an independent risk factor for poor outcome after allo-HSCT. The negative impact of CMV includes direct effects mediated by viral replication and indirect biological effects induced by viral immunomodulatory properties. CMV reactivation is reported to be associated with an increased risk for secondary bacterial and fungal infections, as well as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Furthermore, most of the available anti-CMV agents are characterized by relevant drug toxicity, which also impacts negatively on the recovery post-TX.

Two main strategies are available for CMV prevention in allo-HSCT recipients. In case of preemptive therapy, patients are closely monitored after TX by real-time PCR.

### The fourth international consensus guidelines on the management of cytomegalovirus in solid organ transplantation [^113rPDod]. Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, particularly in organ transplant recipients, the TTS 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining CMV cell-mediated immunity testing in CMV seropositive candidates. This is especially important when there is potential for false-positive antibody results due to passively transferred immunity, such as from transfusion of blood products or IVIG. Recognize that a negative CMV cell-mediated immunity result indicates a negative CMV infection status, whereas a positive result indicates a true history of CMV infection.
