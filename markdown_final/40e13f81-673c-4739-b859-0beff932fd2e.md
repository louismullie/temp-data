## Question

How do nociceptive and neuropathic pain differ in individuals with cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how nociceptive and neuropathic pain differ in individuals with cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and mechanisms to anchor the distinction. Then, I should verify cancer-specific etiologies and how often pain is mixed. Next, I will compare clinical characteristics and sensory phenotypes. After that, I need to review assessment approaches and diagnostic tools. I will then analyze differences in treatment responsiveness and guideline-based management. I should also consider prognostic implications and quality-of-life impact. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical takeaways, including precision phenotyping and the need for dynamic reassessment [^116RQd13] [^1123mbHd] [^114pqTWK] [^115gRtiA] [^1158w2f4] [^114W13eH] [^117SA13r] [^1163Fhwf].

> Let me first confirm the core definitions and mechanisms. Nociceptive pain in cancer arises when peripheral nociceptors transduce noxious stimuli from tissue injury or inflammation into action potentials that propagate to the central nervous system, a detect-and-protect process involving ion channel activation and receptor potentials in nociceptors [^112izMz9] [^112CJwnv]. Neuropathic pain, in contrast, is pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system, a consensus definition refined by NeuPSIG that also proposes graded certainty levels based on clinical and confirmatory evidence [^116RQd13]. Wait, let me verify a commonly cited shortcut that "neuropathic pain has no transduction"; while some reviews contrast neuropathic versus nociceptive pain by noting the absence of a normal peripheral transduction trigger, that statement is too absolute because neuropathic pain can include ectopic peripheral generators and abnormal impulse initiation within damaged nerves and central pathways, so the mechanistic anchor should remain "lesion or disease of the somatosensory system", not "no transduction" per se [^114ZA4DH] [^116RQd13].

> I will now examine cancer-specific etiologies. For nociceptive pain, direct tumor infiltration of somatic or visceral tissues, inflammatory responses, organ distension or obstruction, and perioperative or radiation-related tissue injury are typical drivers, with bone metastases being a prototypical cause of severe nociceptive pain that often fluctuates with mechanical load and disease activity [^114pqTWK]. For neuropathic pain in cancer, I should confirm major contributors: tumor compression or infiltration of nerves or plexuses, postsurgical or post-radiation nerve injury, and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, which can be very prevalent with neurotoxic agents and a major source of ongoing pain in survivors [^114fRGbh]. Hold on, I should also emphasize that bone metastasis pain is mechanistically complex, commonly mixing inflammatory and neuropathic components, which is why cancer pain frequently presents as mixed nociceptive–neuropathic rather than purely one or the other [^114pqTWK]. Let me double-check population signals: large observational work shows neuropathic cancer pain around a third of chronic cancer pain cases and highlights a strong exposure to chemotherapy among those with neuropathic features, underscoring treatment-related neurotoxicity as a key driver [^112kZ5J1].

> Next, I should review clinical characteristics and sensory phenotypes that help distinguish mechanisms at the bedside. Neuropathic pain often exhibits positive phenomena such as spontaneous burning or electric shock–like pains and evoked dynamic mechanical allodynia alongside negative phenomena like sensory loss in a neuroanatomically plausible distribution, reflecting peripheral and central sensitization and deafferentation mechanisms [^112VvgkG]. Let me think about language patients use: descriptor studies in lung cancer suggest certain words cluster with nociceptive versus neuropathic etiologies, but I should be cautious because descriptor performance is imperfect and context dependent in oncology populations [^111BXhM2]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because in cancer the archetype is multimorphic pain with mixed, overlapping mechanisms within the same patient and even the same site, so serial phenotyping rather than one-time labeling is prudent [^1163Fhwf].

> I need to ensure diagnostic rigor by aligning assessment tools with clinical examination. For intensity tracking across visits, VAS or NRS should be used routinely, but these scales do not phenotype mechanisms by themselves, so I should pair them with screening tools and clinical criteria when neuropathic features are suspected [^11498vmx]. DN4, LANSS, and painDETECT can flag neuropathic components in cancer with moderate accuracy, yet there is only moderate concordance with expert clinical classification, reminding me to confirm syndromic plausibility and sensory signs rather than relying on any single instrument [^115gRtiA] [^116psoxD]. I should confirm that NeuPSIG's graded diagnostic framework remains the reference standard for classifying neuropathic pain and that in cancer populations it often needs adaptation to mixed tissues and evolving lesions, reinforcing the need for repeated, multimodal assessments that incorporate etiology, trajectory, and patient-reported dimensions [^116RQd13] [^1163Fhwf] [^113mmw4r].

> Now, I will compare treatment responsiveness and guideline-based management. Nociceptive cancer pain generally responds to conventional analgesics per the WHO ladder, with ESMO emphasizing regular around-the-clock dosing, oral route preference, and patient education rather than as-needed regimens alone for chronic pain control in oncology [^1123mbHd] [^112ZcrNV] [^111e2unX] [^113szmRN] [^115q5igR]. Neuropathic cancer pain tends to be more refractory to NSAIDs and opioids and often requires first-line adjuvants such as gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, or low-dose tricyclics, with careful titration and monitoring for adverse effects, as recommended by ESMO [^114ZA4DH] [^1158w2f4] [^114kWF5e] [^116MbYWP]. Wait, I should double-check interventional and ketamine guidance because oncology recommendations diverge: ESMO finds insufficient evidence for routine ketamine in cancer neuropathic pain and advises restricting neuropathic interventional procedures to non-cancer neuropathic syndromes, whereas ASPN proposes case-by-case ketamine use for refractory neuropathic cancer pain and supports spinal cord stimulation for refractory CIPN, a difference reflected as well by the negative randomized trial of oral ketamine in largely treatment-induced neuropathic pain cohorts [^111neHPV] [^1151aqzm] [^116X8nwx] [^114ssEhF] [^116Lin9v] [^115Py3Sv] [^117XDmKv]. Let me also remember that when neuropathic components coexist and opioids alone underperform, opioid–adjuvant combinations are explicitly endorsed by ESMO, and for severe unilateral nociceptive pain refractory to conservative therapy, procedures like cordotomy may be considered by interventional guidelines [^115d1Dqf] [^113xWkjW].

> I should confirm the prognostic and quality-of-life implications because they influence therapeutic thresholds. Neuropathic pain has a greater propensity to become chronic and disabling than pain from non-neural tissue injury, and cancer-induced bone pain will persist unless the underlying driver is controlled, which is clinically relevant given prolonged survivorship and ongoing disease activity in many patients [^114ZA4DH] [^114pqTWK]. But wait, what if we underestimate neuropathic components in mixed pain states; indeed, neuropathic elements are common, coexist with nociception in a substantial proportion of patients, and are associated with higher pain intensity and worse quality of life when unrecognized or undertreated, highlighting a persistent treatment gap in oncology cohorts [^117NAzeb] [^114VsYaR] [^113YdHUP] [^112hSGSD].

> Next, I should review evolving precision strategies, because mechanism-targeted care may outperform etiology-only approaches. Phenotyping frameworks after cancer now include nociplastic pain as a third category, encouraging early classification of nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic mechanisms to tailor treatment, and calling for repeated reassessment as syndromes evolve with treatments and disease progression [^117SA13r] [^1163Fhwf]. Let me consider sensory profiling and stratification as well; emerging data suggest that grouping patients by sensory profiles may predict treatment response in neuropathic pain, which could be adapted to oncology as evidence matures, while multimodal analgesia that addresses neuroinflammation and peripheral and central sensitization is often necessary in refractory cases [^113TjGfA] [^116CHKuW] [^112ophMq]. I should also align with NCCN's multidisciplinary approach that integrates pharmacologic, interventional, and supportive measures with safe opioid stewardship across the cancer care continuum [^114W13eH].

> To synthesize actionable clinical differentiators, let me reconsider the practical distinctions without oversimplification. Mechanistically, nociceptive pain in cancer is tissue-driven and transduction-dependent, whereas neuropathic pain is nerve-driven as a direct consequence of somatosensory system lesion or disease; in cancer, mixed states are frequent as tumors and treatments simultaneously injure tissues and nerves [^112izMz9] [^116RQd13] [^114pqTWK]. Clinically, neuropathic pain is more likely to display burning or electric shock–like spontaneous pains, evoked allodynia, and focal sensory deficits, while nociceptive pain tends to track with ongoing tissue injury and inflammatory load, yet overlaps are common in oncology and require serial, multimodal phenotyping rather than a one-time label [^112VvgkG] [^1163Fhwf]. Therapeutically, nociceptive pain often follows the WHO ladder with scheduled dosing and oral preference, whereas neuropathic pain typically requires adjuvant agents and may be relatively opioid-refractory; interventional and ketamine strategies should be individualized given guideline differences and mixed evidence, with particular caution about routine ketamine use in cancer populations [^1123mbHd] [^112ZcrNV] [^1158w2f4] [^111neHPV] [^116X8nwx] [^116Lin9v]. Finally, I need to ensure ongoing reassessment because cancer pain is dynamic and multimorphic, and aligning phenotype with treatment while tracking intensity and function over time is essential to close the undertreatment gap and improve outcomes [^1163Fhwf] [^11498vmx] [^113YdHUP].

Nociceptive pain in cancer arises from **tissue injury** [^112izMz9] (tumor invasion, inflammation, or treatment-related damage) and is typically **responsive to opioids** and NSAIDs [^1123mbHd] [^114W13eH]. Neuropathic pain results from **nerve injury** [^116RQd13] (tumor compression, chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation) [^114fRGbh]. It is characterized by burning, shooting, or electric shock-like sensations [^112VvgkG] [^114ZA4DH] and often requires adjuvant agents such as gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine [^1158w2f4] [^114kWF5e]. Neuropathic pain is more often chronic, refractory, and associated with allodynia or hyperalgesia [^114ZA4DH] [^112iDoAG], whereas nociceptive pain is typically acute, localized, and resolves with healing. Accurate differentiation is essential to select effective, **mechanism-based treatments** [^1123mbHd] [^114ZA4DH] and improve **patient outcomes** [^113TjGfA] [^115aW8Ns].

### Advances in understanding nociception and neuropathic pain [^112izMz9]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The human body is equipped with different types of sensory neurons, and nociceptors are the subset that function as the primary unit of pain. They are equipped with receptors and ion channels that enable the detection of stimuli with the potential to cause damage. When a noxious stimulus activates an ion channel on a nociceptor, such as proton activation of acid-sensing ion channels (ASIC), cation influx depolarizes the nociceptor, producing a receptor potential. If the receptor potential reaches the activation threshold for voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaV), it will trigger action potential generation and transmission of a pain signal to the spinal cord.

In recent years, many new techniques have been developed in pre-clinical research that have accelerated our progress in understanding how nociceptors work and provide tantalizing glimpses of their clinical utility. This work is essential for identifying potential new painkiller targets and developing novel biological treatments for neuropathic pain.

### Neuropathic pain: Mechanisms and their clinical implications [^114ZA4DH]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain can develop after nerve injury, when deleterious changes occur in injured neurons and along nociceptive and descending modulatory pathways in the central nervous system. The myriad neurotransmitters and other substances involved in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain also play a part in other neurobiological disorders. This might partly explain the high comorbidity rates for chronic pain, sleep disorders, and psychological conditions such as depression, and why drugs that are effective for one condition may benefit others.

Neuropathic pain can be distinguished from non-neuropathic pain by two factors. Firstly, in neuropathic pain, there is no transduction (conversion of a nociceptive stimulus into an electrical impulse). Secondly, the prognosis is worse: injury to major nerves is more likely than injury to non-nervous tissue to result in chronic pain. In addition, neuropathic pain tends to be more refractory than non-neuropathic pain to conventional analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. However, because of the considerable overlap between neuropathic and nociceptive pain in terms of mechanisms and treatment modalities, it might be more constructive to view these entities as different points on the same continuum.

This review focuses on the mechanisms of neuropathic pain, with special emphasis on clinical implications.

Pain that is poorly responsive to opioid analgesics presents a challenge for physicians who manage cancer patients. Numerous factors may influence analgesic response during the course of the illness. These include changing nociception associated with disease progression, the appearance of intractable side effects, the development of tolerance, the presence of neuropathic pain, the temporal pattern, and the effects produced by the production of opioid metabolites. These factors influence the delicate balance between pain relief and opioid toxicity that must be achieved in cancer patients with pain.

### Assessing cancer pain-the first step toward improving patients' quality of life [^1163Fhwf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

Numerous studies on cancer patients have shown that cancer pain still remains underestimated, poorly assessed, and under-treated. Pain relief should be considered as early as possible within personalized care and as an integral part of quality healthcare in many countries. Nevertheless, personalized care is still insufficiently taken into consideration, partly due to improper or incomplete assessment of cancer pain. The objective of this article is to propose a practical approach to this complex assessment as the first step to improving patients' quality of life.

- **Methods**: Critical reflection based on literature analysis and clinical practice.

- **Results**: Assessment of cancer pain means evaluating the pain intensity over time, the dimensions of pain (sensory-discriminative, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral), the pathophysiological nature of pain (neuropathic, nociceptive, and nociplastic), the etiology, and the patient's perception (diffuse, localized, global). Cancer patients may have simple or multiple forms of pain (mixed, overlapped, combined, and associated). Furthermore, with the use of new specific therapies, the symptomatology of pain is also changing, and certain cancers are becoming chronic. Thus, cancer pain is an archetype of multimorphic pain, and its dynamic assessments (regular and repeated) require a multimodal and targeted approach in order to offer personalized pain management. Multimodal pain treatment must be adapted to the elements that disrupt cancer pain, to the patient's cancer, and to the specific treatments.

- **Conclusions**: The dynamic assessment of cancer pain is essential to tailor personalized pain management strategies effectively.

### Maximizing treatment efficacy through patient stratification in neuropathic pain trials [^113TjGfA]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Treatment of neuropathic pain remains inadequate despite the elucidation of multiple pathophysiological mechanisms and the development of promising therapeutic compounds. The lack of success in translating knowledge into clinical practice has discouraged pharmaceutical companies from investing in pain medicine; however, new patient stratification approaches could help bridge the translation gap and develop individualized therapeutic approaches.

As highlighted in this article, subgrouping of patients according to sensory profiles and other baseline characteristics could aid the prediction of treatment success. Furthermore, novel outcome measures have been developed for patients with neuropathic pain. The extent to which sensory profiles and outcome measures can be employed in routine clinical practice and clinical trials, and across distinct neuropathic pain aetiologies, is yet to be determined. Improvements in animal models, drawing on our knowledge of human pain, and robust public-private partnerships will be needed to pave the way to innovative and effective pain medicine in the future.

More than 30% of patients with cancer report chronic pain, which indicates both the frequency of cancer-related pain and the failure to optimally manage it. Although access to opioid analgesics has greatly improved over the past 25 years, much remains to be done for patients experiencing severe pain. Opioids are far from ideal analgesics, noted Dr. Robert A. Swarm at the recent NCCN 18th Annual Conference.

Universal screening for cancer pain is part of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for Adult Cancer Pain. This is not a one-time effort but should be part of management throughout the cancer care continuum.

### Pain and nociception: Mechanisms of cancer-induced bone pain [^114pqTWK]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Cancer pain, especially pain caused by metastasis to bone, is a severe type of pain, and unless the cause and consequences can be resolved, the pain will become chronic. As detection and survival among patients with cancer have improved, pain has become an increasing challenge because traditional therapies are often only partially effective. Until recently, knowledge of cancer pain mechanisms was poor compared with understanding of neuropathic and inflammatory pain states. We now view cancer-induced bone pain as a complex pain state involving components of both inflammatory and neuropathic pain but also exhibiting elements that seem unique to cancer pain.

In addition, the pain state is often unpredictable, and the intensity of the pain is highly variable, making it difficult to manage. The establishment of translational animal models has started to reveal some of the molecular components involved in cancer pain. We present the essential pharmacologic and neurobiologic mechanisms involved in the generation and continuance of cancer-induced bone pain and discuss these in the context of understanding and treating patients. We discuss changes in peripheral signaling in the area of tumor growth, examine spinal cord mechanisms of sensitization, and finally address central processing. Our aim is to provide a mechanistic background for the sensory characteristics of cancer-induced bone pain as a basis for better understanding and treating this condition.

### Neuropathic pain in cancer: Systematic review, performance of screening tools and analysis of symptom profiles [^115gRtiA]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the methodological quality of rigorous neuropathic pain assessment tools in applicable clinical studies and determine the performance of screening tools for identifying neuropathic pain in patients with cancer.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search identified studies reporting the use of Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS), Douleur Neuropathique en 4 (DN4), or painDETECT (PDQ) in cancer patients with a clinical diagnosis of neuropathic or non-neuropathic pain. Individual patient data were requested to examine descriptor item profiles.

- **Results**: Six studies recruited a total of 2,301 cancer patients, of which 1,564 (68%) reported pain. The overall accuracy of screening tools ranged from 73% to 94%. There was variation in the description and rigor of clinical assessment, particularly related to the rigor of clinical judgment of pain as the reference standard. Individual data from 1,351 patients showed large variation in the selection of neuropathic pain descriptor items by cancer patients with neuropathic pain. LANSS and DN4 items characterized a significantly different neuropathic pain symptom profile from non-neuropathic pain in both tumor- and treatment-related cancer pain etiologies.

- **Conclusions**: We identified concordance between the clinician diagnosis and screening tool outcomes for LANSS, DN4, and PDQ in patients with cancer pain. Shortcomings in relation to standardized clinician assessment are likely to account for variations in screening tool sensitivity, which should include the use of the neuropathic pain profile.

### Optimizing cancer pain management in resource-limited settings [^1132VMJy]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

Pain is one of the most prevalent consequences of cancer, affecting up to 70% of all patients with cancer over the course of their disease. Despite several treatment options and best practice guidelines, undertreatment of cancer-related pain is widely reported; up to one-third of patients do not receive analgesia proportional to their pain intensity.

Adopting best practices in cancer pain management (CPM) is particularly challenging in resource-limited settings. Inadequate availability of and access to opioid analgesics, the cornerstone for treating cancer pain, are also major challenges in resource-limited settings where many patients are first diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer. Global consumption of opioid analgesics is predominantly driven by high-income countries, whereas 75% of the world population, mainly in lower- and middle-income countries, lack adequate access to pain relief.

- **Impediments to opioid availability**: Restrictive opioid formularies, over-regulation related to licensing and prescription, fear of opioid diversion to illicit channels, issues related to supply and distribution, cultural attitudes towards pain, concerns from patients and healthcare providers about addiction, and restricted financial resources.

Thus, there remains a significant gap between "optimal practice" and actual practice in CPM in resource-limited settings. While several international guidelines provide recommendations on managing cancer pain, these are often predicated on maximal resources.

### Multicenter, cross-sectional observational study of the impact of neuropathic pain on quality of life in cancer patients [^112kZ5J1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In this study, neuropathic cancer pain was diagnosed in 722 patients out of 2003 patients surveyed, with an estimated prevalence of 36%. This was similar to results from a recent systematic review reporting that the prevalence of pain with a neuropathic component was 39.1% (95% CI, 28.9%–49.5%). More recently, a European survey estimated an occurrence rate of 32.6% (95% CI, 29.62–35.58) for cancer-related neuropathic pain among cancer patients having chronic pain.

- **Etiology of NCP**: The etiology of NCP has not been fully defined. According to a systematic review, only 20.3% of cases were attributed to cancer treatment. However, a recently published study suggests that a larger portion of neuropathic pain originates from anticancer treatment (68.9% tumor-related, 42.9% treatment-related). In our present study, most patients with NCP had received or were receiving chemotherapy (87.5%), implying that a larger portion of NCP may be caused by anticancer treatments than previously known.

### Analysis and treatment of different types of neuropathic cancer pain [^117H5nQ6]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a major problem in the treatment of cancer pain. We performed a retrospective analysis of 213 cancer patients with neuropathic pain treated by a pain service following the World Health Organization guidelines for relief of cancer pain. Of these patients, 79% presented with nerve compression pain, 16% with nerve injury pain, and 5% with sympathetically-maintained pain. Whereas nerve compression and nerve injury pain were caused most frequently by cancer growth, sympathetically-maintained pain was caused most frequently by cancer treatment.

There were no significant differences in the use of analgesics, the mean pain intensity, or the efficacy of analgesic treatment among the three groups. Nerve injury pain and sympathetically-maintained pain were treated more frequently with adjuvant analgesics, especially antidepressants and anticonvulsants. The variety of different neuropathic pain syndromes should be separated in future studies of the efficacy of different treatment approaches.

### Methadone and neuropathic cancer pain subcomponents: A prospective cohort pilot study [^114VsYaR]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2023). High credibility.

Forty percent of cancer pain is associated with neuropathic and nociceptive pain simultaneously, and refractory pain affects 15% of cancer pain. Methadone is an effective opioid in treating nociceptive pain and could have an effect on neuropathic pain. Uncertainty remains regarding its effects on the different subcomponents of neuropathic pain.

- **Objectives**: To identify which subcomponents of neuropathic cancer pain are addressed using methadone.

- **Methods**: An observational prospective cohort study of palliative care inpatients after rotation for refractory neuropathic cancer pain. Pain intensity was assessed weekly for 28 days using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI).

- **Results**: Forty-eight patients were included, and 17 completed the 28-day follow-up. VAS pain ratings decreased by at least 20 mm in 47% of patients, and the pain intensity was significantly lower at day 28, with 53% of patients having a VAS score lower than 4 (p < 0.001). The pressure/squeezing component (NPSI score) decreased by more than 2 points in 50% of patients. A linear regression showed that allodynia and pressure/squeezing were responsible for the largest part of the overall alleviation of pain (p = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Methadone could significantly improve neuropathic pain through a targeted effect on allodynia and its pressure/squeezing component.

### Towards precision pain medicine for pain after cancer: The Cancer Pain Phenotyping Network multidisciplinary international guidelines for pain phenotyping using nociplastic pain criteria [^117SA13r]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). High credibility.

Pain after cancer remains underestimated and undertreated. Precision medicine is a concept that refers to the ability to classify patients into subgroups that differ in their susceptibility to, biology, or prognosis of a particular disease, or in their response to a specific treatment, thereby tailoring treatment to individual patient characteristics. When applied to pain after cancer, the ability to classify post-cancer pain into the three major pain phenotypes — nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain — and tailor treatment accordingly is an emerging issue. This is especially relevant as available evidence suggests that nociplastic pain is present in an important subgroup of patients experiencing post-cancer pain.

The 2021 International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) clinical criteria and grading system for nociplastic pain account for the need to identify and correctly classify patients according to their pain phenotype early in their treatment. These criteria are an important step towards precision pain medicine with great potential for the field of clinical oncology. Within this framework, the Cancer Pain Phenotyping (CANPPHE) Network — an international and interdisciplinary group of oncology clinicians and researchers from seven countries — applied the 2021 IASP clinical criteria for nociplastic pain to the growing population of those experiencing post-cancer pain. A manual is provided to allow clinicians to differentiate between predominant nociceptive, neuropathic, or nociplastic pain after cancer.

### Reappraising neuropathic pain in humans — how symptoms help disclose mechanisms [^112VvgkG]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain, which arises directly from a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, is a common clinical problem typically causing patients intense distress. Patients experiencing neuropathic pain display sensory abnormalities upon clinical examination and suffer from a variety of pain types, some spontaneous and others provoked. Spontaneous pain usually manifests as ongoing burning pain or paroxysmal electric shock-like sensations. Provoked pain includes pain induced by various stimuli or even gentle brushing, known as dynamic mechanical allodynia.

Recent clinical and neurophysiological studies suggest that the different types of pain arise through distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Ongoing burning pain primarily reflects spontaneous hyperactivity in nociceptive-fibre pathways, originating from 'irritable' nociceptors, regenerating nerve sprouts, or denervated central neurons. Paroxysmal sensations can be caused by multiple mechanisms; for instance, electric shock-like sensations probably arise from high-frequency bursts generated in demyelinated non-nociceptive Aβ fibres.

Most human and animal findings suggest that brush-evoked allodynia originates from Aβ fibres projecting onto previously sensitized nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn, with additional contributions from plastic changes in the brainstem and thalamus. We propose that the emerging mechanism-based approach to studying neuropathic pain could aid in tailoring therapy to the individual patient and prove useful for drug development.

### Integrating pain metrics into oncology clinical trials [^114pcd6Q]. Clinical Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

Cancer-related pain is highly prevalent and often severe, making it one of the defining experiences for patients with malignancy. Patients and their families frequently face the ever-present reality that cancer treatment and progression may be accompanied by pain. For patients nearing the end of life, there is a significant fear that their final days may be spent enduring the terrible effects of the disease, with pain being the most concerning.

Despite the prevalence of cancer-related pain, there is far less systematic research on the mechanisms of this pain or the development of new agents to mitigate it, compared to research aimed at combating the disease itself. Furthermore, even when research focuses on tumor treatment, the effects of anticancer treatments on pain are often underreported in publications and other forums. This lack of attention is illustrated by the absence of new drug approvals for cancer-related pain in recent years.

The article discusses several methodological and logistical challenges that hinder the ability to assess pain response in clinical trials. It also explores possible ways to address these challenges, highlighting the importance of integrating pain metrics into oncology research.

### Types and epidemiology of cancer-related neuropathic pain: The intersection of cancer pain and neuropathic pain [^112NKdYr]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain, defined as pain resulting from a lesion, damage, or dysfunction of the somatosensory nervous system, can arise through several distinct etiologies, ranging from toxicity, surgery, radiation, and trauma to congenital disorders. Neuropathic pain is widely recognized as a common consequence of cancer and results from the administration of several common oncology drugs. It impacts not only the quality of life but also patient outcomes due to resulting treatment delays, dose reductions, and discontinuations.

We estimate that the cost of this problem in the U.S. alone is approximately $2.3 billion. Despite its widely recognized importance, there is a paucity of reliable information available regarding the incidence and prevalence of patient- and physician-reported severity and time course of cancer-related neuropathic pain. To address this severe knowledge gap, new, high-quality, population-based studies of individual cancer pain syndromes and conditions are needed. However, to gather this information, we also need substantial improvements in the specific classification of cancer-related neuropathic syndromes and better validated diagnostic tools that can help elucidate the incidence, prevalence, severity, and potential economic impact of cancer-associated neuropathies.

### Assessment of cancer-related neuropathy and neuropathic pain [^116vduE5]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Cancer-related neuropathic pain syndromes are common and serious complications of a patient's primary malignancy or its treatment, whether by surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. They may compromise the patient's quality of life as well as their ability to receive effective treatment. In many patients, there may be more than one coexistent neuropathic pain syndrome, posing a diagnostic dilemma that, if unresolved, may result in the institution of therapies that are of limited scope or not targeted at the primary underlying pathophysiology.

There is no single adequate diagnostic method that has been established to reliably diagnose or follow patients with cancer-related neuropathic pain syndromes. Clinical assessment of cancer-related neuropathic pain poses some important challenges diagnostically as well as in defining a clear and reliable endpoint assessment in controlled clinical trials.

Many different approaches have been applied to the development of assessment or diagnostic tools. Careful review of these methods has been helpful in developing a clearer vision for the future design and refinement of more reliable tools and, more importantly, validation of the clinical utility as well as the reliability of such tools when employed as endpoints in clinical trials focused on prevention, mitigation, or treatment of cancer neuropathic pain.

### Individualized neuropathic pain therapy based on phenotyping: are we there yet [^114TPNkp]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with the same neuropathic pain disorder may exhibit different sensory signs and symptoms yet receive identical medicinal treatment. New concepts propose that stratifying patients according to their pain mechanisms, as reflected in their sensory phenotype, could facilitate the implementation of individualized therapy for neuropathic pain. Retrospective classification of patients based on their sensory phenotype has demonstrated predictive validity and reliability for treatment response in specific subgroups. Recent prospective studies utilizing stratification according to sensory phenotypes confirm this concept. In this article, we review the recent accomplishments toward individualized pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain.

### Multicenter, cross-sectional observational study of the impact of neuropathic pain on quality of life in cancer patients [^112hSGSD]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Pain has been recognized as a key symptom in various types of cancer, and it is the most common symptom leading to a cancer diagnosis, affecting about 30% of patients. Although recent guidelines have emphasized the treatment of pain in cancer patients, it remains undertreated. It has also been found that cancer patients with pain have significantly lower performance levels and higher levels of anger, fatigue, depression, confusion, and lethargy compared to those cancer patients who did not experience pain, even after accounting for disease stage.

Neuropathic pain may adversely affect quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients and could also increase care difficulty. Previous studies have investigated the impact of neuropathic cancer pain (NCP) on QOL, but these mostly focused on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) alone in specific disease conditions. NCP is particularly important to diagnose because distinct treatment strategies are required that differ from those needed for nociceptive pain. Critically, the features associated with NCP, including, but not limited to, CIPN, especially among cancer patients, are poorly understood. To obtain a comprehensive and insightful overview of NCP in cancer patients, it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of a large group of general cancer patients with NCP, including those in all stages of disease, regardless of the treatments they have received.

This study was performed on behalf of the Korean Cancer Study Group Neuropathic Cancer Pain Survey and was designed to assess the status of NCP in cancer patients.

### The local molecular signature of human peripheral neuropathic pain [^113rHs8R]. Pain (2025). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition that affects approximately 9% of the population. Compared with pain of nociceptive origin, neuropathic pain is associated with higher pain severity, lower quality of life, and higher healthcare costs. The most common causes of neuropathic pain are peripheral neuropathies and, in particular, focal nerve injuries such as entrapment neuropathies. Focal nerve injuries are associated with both evoked and spontaneous neuropathic pain.

Preclinical research suggests altered signaling between distinct cell types such as neurons, glia, and immune cells may underlie neuropathic pain. Transcriptomic analyses of human dorsal root ganglia associated with neuropathic pain caused by tumor lesions confirm a dominant role of neuroimmune mechanisms. However, the neuroimmune relationship at the site of the nerve lesion in the nerve trunk remains poorly understood in humans because of challenges associated with access to injured human nerves and a lack of modern anatomical and molecular techniques applied to human injured nerves. While some studies have focused on a few selected genes using polymerase chain reaction methodology, recent studies have used bulk RNA sequencing to characterize the transcriptomic signature in human distal nerve trunks. Ray et al. used postmortem tibial nerve tissues and identified sexually dimorphic expression of genes involved in pain, inflammation, and neuro-immunity. Welleford et al. used serial sural nerve biopsies to identify gene signatures associated with acute nerve repair following transection injury.

### Defining neuropathic pain [^112wuqwU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical research and practice have suffered due to the lack of specificity in clinical diagnoses of pain. It is suggested that there should be a distinction between neuropathic and inflammatory pain mechanisms, as well as a differentiation between neuropathic pain and hypersensitivity pain disorders, previously termed neuropathic pain due to neurological dysfunction. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain occurring in the area of the body affected by neurological disease or injury. This type of pain manifests not only with positive sensory phenomena such as pain, dysesthesia, and various types of hyperalgesia but also with negative sensory phenomena, as well as negative and positive motor and autonomic symptoms and signs.

### Pathophysiological mechanisms of neuropathic pain: Comparison of sensory phenotypes in patients and human surrogate pain models [^112iczfn]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

As an indirect approach to relate previously identified sensory phenotypes of patients suffering from peripheral neuropathic pain to underlying mechanisms, we used a published sorting algorithm to estimate the prevalence of denervation, peripheral and central sensitization in 657 healthy subjects undergoing experimental models of nerve block (NB) (compression block and topical lidocaine), primary hyperalgesia (PH) (sunburn and topical capsaicin), or secondary hyperalgesia (intradermal capsaicin and electrical high-frequency stimulation), and in 902 patients suffering from neuropathic pain. Some of the data have been previously published. Randomized split-half analysis verified a good concordance with a priori mechanistic sensory profile assignment in the training (79%, Cohen κ = 0.54, n = 265) and the test set (81%, Cohen κ = 0.56, n = 279).

Nerve blocks were characterized by pronounced thermal and mechanical sensory loss, but also mild pinprick hyperalgesia and paradoxical heat sensations. Primary hyperalgesia was characterized by pronounced gain for heat, pressure, and pinprick pain, and mild thermal sensory loss. Secondary hyperalgesia was characterized by pronounced pinprick hyperalgesia and mild thermal sensory loss. Topical lidocaine plus topical capsaicin induced a combined phenotype of NB plus PH. Topical menthol was the only model with significant cold hyperalgesia. Sorting of the 902 patients into these mechanistic phenotypes led to a similar distribution as the original heuristic clustering (65% identity, Cohen κ = 0.44).

### Understanding the physiopathology of pain pathways for a practical approach of cancer pain management [^112ophMq]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Pain associated with cancer is often the first symptom reported, with significant repercussions on a patient's quality of life. Major causes of pain include mechanical compression, release of algogenic substances by the tumor, and complications of oncologic treatment. Nociceptive and neuropathic pain are induced by various mediators that lead to neuroinflammation, creating peripheral and central sensitization responsible for chronic pain. Understanding the pain pathway may guide appropriate treatment choices. Oral medication should often be reevaluated to consider multimodal analgesia, which may include interventional pain procedures with intrathecal therapy and neuromodulation.

### Mechanisms of disease: Neuropathic pain — a clinical perspective [^112iDoAG]. Nature Clinical Practice Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain syndromes, defined as pain following a lesion or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system, are clinically characterized by spontaneous and evoked types of pain. These pain types are underpinned by various distinct pathophysiological mechanisms in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In some patients, the nerve lesion triggers molecular changes in nociceptive neurons, which become abnormally sensitive and develop pathological spontaneous activity. Inflammatory reactions of the damaged nerve trunk can induce ectopic nociceptor activity, causing spontaneous pain. The hyperactivity in nociceptors induces secondary changes in processing neurons in the spinal cord and brain, such that input from mechanoreceptive A-fibers is perceived as pain. Neuroplastic changes in the central pain modulatory systems can lead to further hyperexcitability.

The treatment of neuropathic pain remains unsatisfactory, and a new hypothetical concept has been proposed, in which pain is analyzed based on underlying mechanisms. The increased knowledge of pain-generating mechanisms and their translation into symptoms and signs might eventually allow a dissection of the mechanisms that operate in each patient. If a precise clinical phenotypic characterization of the neuropathic pain is combined with a selection of drugs that act on those mechanisms, it should ultimately be possible to design optimal treatments for individuals. This review discusses the conceptual framework of the novel mechanism-based classification, encouraging the reader to see neuropathic pain as a clinical entity rather than merely a symptom.

### Adult cancer pain, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114W13eH]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for adult cancer pain provide recommendations for the comprehensive management of pain in patients with cancer. This article will focus on methods for screening for pain, safe and appropriate prescription of opioid and miscellaneous analgesics, and the optimization of nonpharmacologic interventions, including integrative and interventional strategies for the treatment of cancer-related pain. Additionally, the NCCN Guidelines discuss methods for the safe reduction of opioids when appropriate, as well as techniques for encouraging the judicious use of opioids. The complete version of the NCCN Guidelines for adult cancer pain addresses additional issues that are not covered here, including management of pain during a pain crisis, management of procedure-related pain and anxiety, pain management for cancer survivors, and the use of nonopioid and adjuvant analgesics for cancer-related pain.

### Guidelines for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer [^112UwZk3]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2013). Low credibility.

The moral imperative to adequately manage pain is being increasingly recognized worldwide. A comprehensive pain management approach that addresses the various presentations of pain in patients with cancer is required, including appropriate management of breakthrough pain. Breakthrough pain commonly occurs in patients with advanced cancer and is disabling to the individual and burdensome to society, yet it is often inadequately managed. Because pain is heterogeneous, the best management of an individual's pain, including breakthrough pain in cancer, requires a thorough assessment to tailor the treatment strategies.

Recently developed guidelines support this approach and recommend treating breakthrough pain using rapid- or short-acting opioids with pharmacodynamics that mirror the rapid onset and short duration of the presenting pain. This approach should be part of a comprehensive strategy to treat pain within the context of the primary disease trajectory, offering continuity of care and access to specialized palliative care when appropriate.

### Pain related to cancer treatments and diagnostic procedures: a no man's land [^113ykYxS]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

While guidelines are available for the management of cancer-related pain, little attention is given to the assessment and treatment of pain caused by treatments and diagnostic procedures in cancer patients.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the literature on pain related to cancer treatment and diagnostic procedures within a critical analysis.

- **Results**: The data available are sparse, suggesting that little attention has been directed at this important aspect of oncology. This points to potentially suboptimal patient management.

- **Conclusions**: Appropriate studies are necessary in order to understand the incidence and appropriate management of pain, both during and/or after oncological treatments and diagnostic procedures. At the same time, healthcare professionals should have heightened awareness of the causes and treatment of pain with the aim of anticipating and managing pain most appropriately for each individual patient. This is clearly an important component of holistic patient care before, during, and after oncological treatment.

### Benefits of using the brief pain inventory in patients with cancer pain: An intervention study conducted in Swedish hospitals [^111eKFbY]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

In this study, 34% of patients had nociceptive pain, while 63% had mixed pain and 3% had neuropathic pain only. Other studies have reported that neuropathic pain occurs in 44–67% of hospitalized cancer patients. We and others have shown that neuropathic pain is common among cancer patients and that analysis of pain mechanisms is of vital importance to be able to alleviate pain. Neuropathic pain has been shown to affect daily activities. The present study reveals that severe pain had a major impact on daily functions. Most patients with advanced-stage disease have at least two types of pain rooted in different etiologies, which could explain the high occurrence of mixed pain in our study.

At follow-up, we found a significant increase in the regular use of paracetamol and strong opioids, in addition to medications for neuropathic pain and elevated doses of fixed-schedule opioids in the intervention group, which we interpret as one explanation for the significant decrease in pain levels. In the intervention group, 25% were prescribed analgesics for neuropathic pain at follow-up. This is a higher percentage than the 10% and 8% reported elsewhere but in line with Manfrida et al, who report an increase of neuropathic pain drugs of up to 27% after their intervention. In our study, the completed patient body chart and description of pain characteristics in the Brief Pain Inventory likely contributed to the increased prescription of medications to treat neuropathic pain. Furthermore, 80% of patients in the intervention group were prescribed opioids regularly at follow-up. The study by Manfrida et al. explored similar trends.

### Multicenter, cross-sectional observational study of the impact of neuropathic pain on quality of life in cancer patients [^113YdHUP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In summary, this study provides a clinically meaningful overview of neuropathic pain in patients with cancer pain. We found that there was a clear association between neuropathic cancer pain (NCP) and both increased pain severity and worsened quality of life (QOL). These results suggest the need for prospective studies aimed at clarifying the causality between neuropathic pain and worsened QOL. Furthermore, in general, pain was not adequately managed in our study population, and NCP-targeting drugs are not widely used. Therefore, new management strategies with improved efficacy are required, as pharmacological management is not sufficient to alleviate neuropathic pain, and efforts to elucidate the detrimental effect of neuropathic pain will be meaningless in the absence of effective methods to improve it.

### Neuropathic pain: Clinical classification and assessment in patients with pain due to cancer [^115GuCbu]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

The high heterogeneity of cancer pain makes a standardized approach for the assessment of neuropathic pain (NcP) essential to improve the results of treatment and future clinical and preclinical studies. This was considered urgently needed in 2011 by an international initiative and expert consensus meeting held in Milan, and it seems that little progress has been made so far.

From the results obtained in this study, we propose a standardized checklist approach to recognize cancer pain etiology and syndromes. This first etiological information obtained by syndrome identification, combined with Patient Reported Outcome Measurements, such as those included in the DN4, and clinical criteria similar to those suggested by the NeuPSIG, could translate into better identification of the type of pain present. Prospective evaluation of this methodology in future studies should address its clinical usefulness and impact and integrate pain characteristics, which may fail available diagnostic criteria.

### Advances in understanding nociception and neuropathic pain [^112CJwnv]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Pain results from the activation of a subset of sensory neurons termed nociceptors and has evolved as a "detect and protect" mechanism. However, lesion or disease in the sensory system can result in neuropathic pain, which serves no protective function. Understanding how the sensory nervous system works and what changes occur in neuropathic pain are vital in identifying new therapeutic targets and developing novel analgesics.

In recent years, technologies such as optogenetics and RNA-sequencing have been developed. These, alongside the more traditional use of animal neuropathic pain models and insights from genetic variations in humans, have enabled significant advances in the mechanistic understanding of neuropathic pain.

### Percutaneous neurolysis for pain management in oncological patients [^114pc7aq]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Cancer pain is most commonly classified as nociceptive (somatic or visceral) or neuropathic. Different types of pain or pain syndromes are present in all phases of cancer (early and metastatic) and are inadequately treated in 56% to 82.3% of patients. Percutaneous neurolysis and neuromodulation are feasible, reproducible, efficient (70–80% success rate), and safe (approximately 0.5% mean complication rate) palliative therapies for pain reduction in oncologic patients with refractory pain. Percutaneous neurolysis can be performed either by injection of a chemical agent (phenol or alcohol) or by application of continuous radiofrequency or cryoablation. During chemical neurolysis, nerve damage is achieved by means of Wallerian degeneration. A thorough knowledge of neural anatomy and pain transmission pathways is fundamental to appropriate patient and technique selection. Imaging guidance and strict asepsis are prerequisites.

The purpose of this article is to describe the basic concepts of percutaneous neurolysis in oncologic patients. Controversies concerning techniques and products will be addressed. Finally, the necessity for an individually tailored approach for the selection of different techniques and targets will be emphasized.

### Neuropathic pain: Clinical classification and assessment in patients with pain due to cancer [^114Zgfj6]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

- **Retrospective board classification**: The NeuPSIG criteria were applied, acknowledging that they offer a diagnostic clinical algorithm for neuropathic pain (NP). They can integrate methods like DN4 and Clinical Impression, which are not explicitly based on standardized criteria. The Retrospective Clinical Classification of pain pathophysiology, based on the NeuPSIG criteria, was conducted by a specialist board of three pain and palliative care physicians. These physicians were different from those involved in patient enrollment and prospective pain type classification. Their evaluation relied on data from electronic medical records, which included clinical descriptions and available diagnostic tests at the time of enrollment. Importantly, they were blinded to DN4 results and Clinical Impression of the treating physician. The diagnosis of neuropathic pain (NcP) was made in accordance with the NeuPSIG criteria, which include the following: a history of relevant neurological lesion or disease; neuroanatomically plausible pain distribution; pain associated with sensory signs in the same neuroanatomically plausible area; and diagnostic tests confirming a lesion or disease of the somatosensory systems that explain the pain perceived by the patient. Neuropathic pain can be determined at the levels of possible, probable, and definite certainty according to these criteria. The board classified pain as NcP present if there was a probable or definite presence of neuropathic pain according to the NeuPSIG criteria.

### Nociceptive and neuropathic pain in patients with lung cancer: A comparison of pain quality descriptors [^111BXhM2]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

The predictive validity of each word from the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) has not been investigated in relation to pain etiology. The purpose of this study was to explore differences in the words used to describe nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Patients with lung cancer (N = 123) selected words from the 78 MPQ pain quality descriptors and indicated the corresponding pain site for each word. Using only the MPQ pain location, along with cancer and treatment data abstracted from medical records, each pain site was classified as nociceptive or neuropathic (etiology).

Pain etiology and quality descriptors were tested for proportional differences, with sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value calculated for statistically significant descriptors. Of the 457 pain sites, 343 were classified as nociceptive (75%), and 114 as neuropathic (25%). Lacerating, stinging, heavy, and suffocating were selected for a significantly larger proportion of nociceptive sites, whereas throbbing, aching, numb, tender, punishing, pulling, tugging, pricking, penetrating, miserable, and nagging were selected for a larger proportion of neuropathic sites.

Ten words correctly predicted 78% of the sites, with 81% sensitivity to nociceptive pain and 59% sensitivity to neuropathic pain. Interestingly, several pain quality descriptors (burning, shooting, flashing, tingling, itching, and cold) previously associated with neuropathic pain did not distinguish between neuropathic and nociceptive pain. Infrequent selection of many MPQ words and the lack of neurological exam data in the medical records are possible explanations for this finding.

### Treatment of chronic non-cancer pain [^115QrLJe]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is a pervasive problem that affects the patient, their significant others, and society in many ways. The past decade has seen advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain and in the availability of technically advanced diagnostic procedures; however, the most notable therapeutic changes have not been the development of novel evidence-based methods, but rather changing trends in applications and practices within the available clinical armamentarium. We provide a general overview of empirical evidence for the most commonly used interventions in the management of chronic non-cancer pain, including pharmacological, interventional, physical, psychological, rehabilitative, and alternative modalities.

Overall, currently available treatments provide modest improvements in pain and minimal improvements in physical and emotional functioning. The quality of evidence is mediocre and has not improved substantially during the past decade. There is a crucial need for assessment of combination treatments, identification of indicators of treatment response, and assessment of the benefit of matching treatments to patient characteristics.

### Oral ketamine vs placebo in patients with cancer-related neuropathic pain: A randomized clinical trial [^114ssEhF]. JAMA Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Two hundred fourteen patients (median [IQR] age, 58 [51–66] years; 141 [65.8%] female) were randomized, with comparable demographic features between arms. A variety of cancer types were represented; however, in 160 patients (74.7%), the cancer was in remission, and most of these patients had chronic, chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Two hundred nine patients (97.6%) were following treatment regimens for neuropathic pain. Data on the duration of neuropathic pain were not collected. The median morphine-equivalent daily dose for both arms was 0 mg.

There was no difference in the duration of analgesic benefit between arms, as assessed by the adjusted (minimization factors) Cox proportional hazards model (ketamine to placebo HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.70–1.29]; p = 0.75). This was supported by the log-rank test (P = .69). The median duration of analgesic benefit was 0 days (95% CI, 0–1 day) for ketamine and 0 days (95% CI, 0–4 days) for placebo. To illustrate, 34 of 107 patients (31.8%) receiving ketamine vs. 39 of 107 (36.4%) receiving placebo maintained analgesic benefit at day 4 of the stable dosage (95% CI for difference, −17% to 8%). Corresponding figures at day 16 were 24 of 107 patients (22.4%) receiving ketamine and 27 of 107 (25.2%) receiving placebo (95% CI for difference, −14% to 9%). There were no differences between arms among the secondary outcomes.

Clinical insights into neuropathic pain from pre-clinical research: As described in the introduction, neuropathic pain is common, and chronic pain sufferers often receive inadequate pain relief from medications. A 2015 meta-analysis of trials examining pharmacological treatments for neuropathic pain identified that although there is strong recommendation for the use of certain drugs (e.g. gabapentin, pregabalin, serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants), the effects are relatively modest. The number needed to treat (NNT) to produce a 50% reduction in pain for drugs with strong recommendation ranges from 3.6 to 7.7, meaning 4–8 patients must be treated for one patient to experience at least 50% pain reduction when the placebo response is subtracted.

In addition to pharmacological treatment, various other interventions are available for neuropathic pain, including physical and psychological therapies, spinal cord stimulation, surgery, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). However, the discussion here focuses on the potential for developing novel pharmacotherapy resulting from enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of neuropathic pain.

### Neuropathic pain: Clinical classification and assessment in patients with pain due to cancer [^115EUbsq]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

- **Pattern of concordance–discordance**: Regarding neuropathic cancer pain (NcP) assessment between DN4 and Retrospective Clinical Classification (N = 325).

- **Percentage of discordance**: DN4 below threshold vs. Retrospective Clinical Classification positive for the specific pain syndrome categories (N = 325). *The black dotted line indicates the percentage (13.2%) of the specific pattern of discordance (DN4 below threshold vs. Retrospective Clinical Classification positive) in the overall sample.

The distribution of pain syndromes by the presence or absence of NcP according to the Retrospective Clinical Classification in the group of 325 evaluated patients is reported. Pain due to only bone or only visceral lesions was more frequently encountered in patients without NcP, with a prevalence of 45% and 32%, respectively, over 232 cases compared to 5% and 13% over 93 cases of NcP. Instead, for patients with NcP, the combination of bone and nervous tissue damage (39%) and that of soft tissue and nervous tissue damage (16%) accounted for the most frequent syndromes. For patients without NcP, there was only one patient with a combination of bone and nervous tissue damage, whereas there were no cases with both soft and nervous tissue damage. Among patients with NcP, 2% had evidence of only nervous tissue damage.

### Patient-reported neuropathic pain in adolescent and young adult cancer patients [^114U5HGX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain, a known complication of cancer and its treatments, negatively impacts quality of life. There is a paucity of data utilizing screening tools to aid in the diagnosis of neuropathic pain in cancer patients. Our primary objective was to determine the proportion of adolescent and young adult cancer patients reporting neuropathic pain on a patient-completed neuropathic pain screening tool.

- **Procedures**: This prospective, cohort study enrolled patients aged 14–39 years who were receiving therapy for a primary cancer diagnosis, cancer relapse, or had recently completed treatment. The painDETECT, a patient-completed, neuropathic pain screening tool applicable to patients as young as 14, was administered a maximum of three times to on-therapy patients and once to off-therapy patients. Provider documentation of neuropathic pain at the corresponding visit was abstracted from the medical record.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight patients participated. The median (interquartile range) age at study enrollment was 18.1 (16–19.4) years, with 47% identifying as female. Cancer diagnoses included 41% leukemia, 26% solid tumor, 23% lymphoma, and 10% central nervous system tumor. The proportion of patients reporting neuropathic pain was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16–40%) in on-therapy patients and 11% (95% CI 3–27%) in off-therapy patients. Among the patients reporting neuropathic pain, only 26% had a clinical diagnosis of neuropathic pain documented in the medical record at the corresponding visit.

- **Conclusions**: Neuropathic pain occurs in one in four adolescents and young adults receiving cancer therapy.

### Neuropathic pain: Clinical classification and assessment in patients with pain due to cancer [^113mmw4r]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

This study offers a broad representation of cancer pain etiologies and classification, using three different approaches for neuropathic pain (NcP) diagnosis, specifically referring to pain directly caused by the tumor. Although we refrain from defining any of the above-described assessments as "a golden standard", the use of clinical criteria seems necessary to support a homogeneous identification of NcP. The available NeuPSIG criteria can be a reasonable choice; however, their application to the cancer pain population should be adapted to the characteristics of this population.

In 2014, the EAPC/IASP algorithm for diagnostic criteria of NcP was proposed, but it still needs validation. The recent proposal of the ICD-11 classification allows us to describe bone-related cancer pain, visceral cancer pain, and pain due to neurological lesions. Unfortunately, it does not allow us to classify soft tissue cancer lesions, which, in our study, accounted for more than 25% of pain syndromes.

Depending on the tissues involved and the changes in peripheral and central pain pathways, inflammatory, nociceptive, and neuropathic mechanisms may coexist in patients with cancer. Therefore, NcP is rarely found as a consequence solely of a neurological lesion. This was evident in our study, in which only in 2 of the patients diagnosed with NcP, the underlying cause was damage to the nervous tissue alone. It is also possible that specific cancer pain pathophysiologies may overrule the traditional distinction between nociceptive and neuropathic pain.

### A cross-sectional, comparative, syndromic description of oncological mixed pain in medical oncology units in Spain [^115kE1hy]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

The reason cancer pain remains prevalent and hard to classify may be partially explained by the failure to identify neuropathic mechanisms. The objective of this research was to identify the syndromes of cancer pain that may be particularly hard to manage due to their mixed pathophysiology.

A series of 384 patients who had cancer of any type, at any stage, and suffered from chronic pain (symptom onset > 3 months) were assessed during a routine return visit in Spain. Medical oncologists indicated the presence and pathophysiology of 33 predefined pain syndromes on a per-patient basis. This information was then measured against clinical, psychosocial, and healthcare-related data to determine which syndromes pose particular challenges.

The mean (standard deviation) age of patients was 61.6 (12.6) years, and 49.7% were women. Most (82%) had advanced metastatic disease, and 68.7% were on second-line or palliative therapies. The worst syndrome was nociceptive, pure neuropathic, and mixed in 34.6, 26.9, and 38.6% of patients, respectively. Any syndrome could be of mixed pathophysiology. Only 10 syndromes were common (≥ 5% of patients). Syndromes related to malignant bone pain and the involvement of chest wall structures were the most frequent. Certain syndromes, including tumor-related bone pain, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies, paraneoplastic pain syndromes, and malignant neuralgias or injury to cranial nerves, can be particularly challenging when they have a mixed pathophysiology because the neuropathic component is rarely or unevenly considered.

### Prevalence and aetiology of neuropathic pain in cancer patients: a systematic review [^117NAzeb]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

Pain in cancer patients remains common and is often associated with insufficient prescribing of targeted analgesia. An explanation for undertreatment could be the failure to identify neuropathic pain mechanisms, which require additional prescribing strategies. We aimed to identify the prevalence of neuropathic mechanisms in patients with cancer pain to highlight the need for detailed assessment and to support the development of an international classification system for cancer pain.

We searched for studies that included adult and teenage patients (age above 12 years), with active cancer who reported pain and had received a clinical assessment of their pain. We found 22 eligible studies that reported on 13,683 patients. Clinical assessment methods varied, and only 14 studies reported confirmatory testing for either sensory abnormality or diagnostic lesion to corroborate a diagnosis of neuropathic pain.

We calculated that the prevalence of patients with neuropathic pain (95% confidence interval) varied from a conservative estimate of 19% (9.4% to 28.4%) to a liberal estimate of 39.1% (28.9% to 49.5%), when patients with mixed pain were included. The prevalence of pain with a neuropathic mechanism (95% confidence interval) ranged from a conservative estimate of 18.7% (15.3% to 22.1%) to a liberal estimate of 21.4% (15.2% to 27.6%) of all recorded cancer pains. The proportion of pain caused by cancer treatment was higher in neuropathic pain compared with all types of cancer pain.

### Prevalence and incidence of chronic pain with or without neuropathic characteristics in patients with cancer [^11564vQv]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

This prospective national multicenter study was carried out to estimate the prevalence and incidence of chronic pain with or without neuropathic characteristics in patients with cancer in France. All consecutive outpatients (n = 1885) seen over 2 weeks for cancer treatment in 12 oncology units were invited to participate in the study, and 1805 were included.

Patients underwent a clinical examination during visit 1, and a questionnaire was completed to detect chronic pain (defined as daily pain for at least 3 months), and to characterize its intensity, location, and neuropathic characteristics (i.e. DN4 score ≥ 4). The impact of pain on quality of life was assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory. Patients without pain at visit 1 were included in the incidence study and were seen at 3 and 6 months after visit 1.

The overall prevalence of chronic pain was 28.2% (95% CI: 26.3–30.5%), ranging from 22.5% to 35.4%, depending on the location of the primary tumor. Neuropathic characteristics were present in 20.9% of these patients, with a prevalence of 2.9% to 9.7%, depending on primary tumor location. Pain intensity and interference were higher in patients with neuropathic characteristics.

In total, 1285 patients were included in the incidence study, 873 of whom were seen at least once, 3, or 6 months after the first visit. The incidence of chronic pain during the 6-month follow-up period ranged from 13% to 28%, depending on primary tumor location, and neuropathic characteristics were found in 19.9% of patients with chronic pain.

### Diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain [^112LiBq9]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Currently, no consensus on the optimal management of neuropathic pain exists, and practices vary greatly worldwide. Possible explanations for this include difficulties in developing agreed diagnostic protocols and the coexistence of neuropathic, nociceptive, and occasionally idiopathic pain in the same patient. Neuropathic pain has historically been classified according to its etiology (e.g. painful diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, spinal cord injury) without regard for the presumed mechanism(s) underlying the specific symptoms. A combined etiologic/mechanistic classification might improve neuropathic pain management.

The treatment of neuropathic pain is largely empirical, often relying heavily on data from small, generally poorly-designed clinical trials or anecdotal evidence. Consequently, diverse treatments are used, including non-invasive drug therapies (antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and membrane stabilizing drugs), invasive therapies (nerve blocks, ablative surgery), and alternative therapies (e.g. acupuncture). This article reviews the historical practices in the diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain and focuses on the United States, Europe, and Japan.

### Neuropathic pain: Redefinition and a grading system for clinical and research purposes [^116RQd13]. Neurology (2008). High credibility.

Pain usually results from the activation of nociceptive afferents by actually or potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. Pain may also arise from activity generated within the nervous system without adequate stimulation of its peripheral sensory endings. The International Association for the Study of Pain introduced the term "neuropathic pain", defined as "pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system". While this definition has been useful in distinguishing some characteristics of neuropathic and nociceptive types of pain, it lacks clearly defined boundaries. Since the sensitivity of the nociceptive system is modulated by adequate activation, such as by central sensitization, distinguishing neuropathic dysfunction from physiological neuroplasticity has been challenging.

A more precise definition has been developed by a group of experts from the neurologic and pain community: pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. This revised definition fits into the nosology of neurologic disorders. The reference to the somatosensory system is derived from a wide range of neuropathic pain conditions, ranging from painful neuropathy to central poststroke pain. Due to the absence of a specific diagnostic tool for neuropathic pain, a grading system of definite, probable, and possible neuropathic pain is proposed. The grade "possible" can only be regarded as a working hypothesis, which neither excludes nor confirms the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. The grades "probable" and "definite" require confirmatory evidence.

### Neuropathic pain in cancer [^114fRGbh]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Cancer-related neuropathic pain is common; it can be disease-related or related to the acute or chronic effects of cancer treatment. For example, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy occurs in 90% of patients receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy. Cancer treatments have become more effective, and patients are living longer with cancer, resulting in more cancer survivors. However, side effects, particularly neuropathy, have become more problematic.

The key to managing cancer-related neuropathy is a considered assessment, remembering not to miss the opportunity of reversing the cause of the pain with appropriate oncological management. An increasing range of oncological therapies is available, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or one of the evolving approaches, such as immune therapies. Patients are often elderly and with comorbidities, so all treatment decisions have to be made carefully and reviewed appropriately.

Cancer pain is often of mixed etiology or, if purely neuropathic, may be one of several pains experienced by a patient. For these reasons, opioids are used more frequently in patients with cancer-related neuropathic pain. Standard guidelines for the use of anticonvulsants, such as pregabalin and gabapentin; antidepressants, such as duloxetine and tricyclics; and topical treatments, such as capsaicin and lidocaine, may be applicable. However, there is a lack of good-quality clinical trials in cancer-related neuropathic pain. Choice is dictated not just by age, drug interactions, and comorbidities but also by the coexistence of many symptoms in patients.

### Assessment and classification of cancer breakthrough pain: A systematic literature review [^116QNrsN]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Temporal variations in cancer pain intensity are highly prevalent and often difficult to manage. However, the phenomenon is not well understood; several definitions and approaches to the classification and bedside assessment of cancer breakthrough pain (BTP) have been described. This study is a systematic review of published literature on cancer BTP to answer the following questions: which terms and definitions have been used; are there validated assessment tools; which domains of BTP do the tools delineate, and which items do they contain; how have assessment tools been applied within clinical studies; and are there validated classification systems for BTP.

A systematic search of the peer-reviewed literature was performed using five major databases. Of 375 titles and abstracts initially identified, 51 articles were examined in detail. Analysis of these publications indicates a range of overlapping but distinct definitions have been used to characterize BTP; 42 of the included papers presented one or more ways of classifying BTP; and while 10 tools to assess patients' experience of BTP were identified, only 2 have been partially validated. We conclude that there is no widely accepted definition, classification system, or well-validated assessment tool for cancer-related breakthrough pain, but there is strong concurrence on most of its key attributes. With further work in this area, an internationally agreed-upon definition and classification system for cancer-related breakthrough pain, and a standard approach on how to measure it, hold the promise to improve patient care.

### The clinical challenge of chronic neuropathic pain [^116G4yAK]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

The clinician often faces the problem that certain types of chronic pains remain refractory to the commonly used analgesic treatment options. Neuropathic pain, defined as pain caused by direct nerve lesions, may have different causes and a variety of clinical presentations. A correct management of chronic neuropathic pain requires a thorough understanding of the potential causes, diagnosis, and pathophysiological mechanisms.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this review article is to provide the reader with the latest insights in the diagnostic work-out and clinical presentation of neuropathic pain. Additionally, the possible pathophysiological changes induced by nerve lesions are explained.

- **Methods**: An extensive literature review was performed using PubMed citations.

- **Results and conclusions**: This article, based on an extensive literature review, aims to provide a concise review of the knowledge regarding the etiology, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.

### Neuropathic pain: Clinical classification and assessment in patients with pain due to cancer [^116psoxD]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Our study also revealed a moderate concordance between the retrospective clinical classification and the DN4 questionnaire (Cohen's kappa = 0.57). The prevalence of neuropathic pain (NcP) obtained from the retrospective clinical classification (28.6%) was higher than the one obtained by the DN4 (20%), yet it was similar to that reported in the available literature. The evidence available about the agreement between NcP evaluation in clinical practice and the DN4 questionnaire in patients with cancer is limited. Results from a multicenter study of 8615 patients with cancer in Spain revealed that only about half of the cases diagnosed as neuropathic by clinicians were also identified by the DN4. However, criteria used by the oncologists to diagnose NcP were not described, and no etiological classification of pain was provided.

A Greek study showed an agreement of 79% between the DN4 and clinical impression by a pain specialist, but again, the criteria used by the specialist were not specified. In another study, NcP was diagnosed also by pain specialists, without explicit use of clinical criteria, but a distinction between pain due to cancer or treatment was provided. A neuropathic pain component was identified by physicians in 66% of patients (246 out of 371), and only 120 (32.3%) of them had a DN4 score of ≥ 4. In a study by Bouhassira et al, the DN4 result was consistent with the investigator's clinical judgment in 88.1% of cases. A differentiation of pain etiology was also provided, with about half of the cases suffering from pain due to cancer and half from pain due to treatment, but this difference was not considered.

### Neuropathic pain: Clinical classification and assessment in patients with pain due to cancer [^112Uhip8]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Pain due to advanced cancer is still a significant clinical problem, with up to 25% of patients experiencing insufficient analgesia. In particular, neuropathic cancer pain (NcP), which accounts for at least 20% of pain caused by cancer, has been associated with greater analgesic requirements, poorer outcomes, and greater disability. Neuropathic cancer pain is not always well defined and can be difficult to identify. These observations emphasize the need for a reliable identification of neuropathic mechanisms in pain due to cancer.

In this article, we refer to NcP as pain directly caused by cancer progression, which is therefore distinguished from neuropathic pain due to cancer treatment. Because cancer infiltration is associated with local inflammation and tissue damage, leading to nociceptive activation, experts often discuss the presence of a mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain, as pure neuropathic mechanisms can rarely, if ever, be the only pathophysiology underlying pain due to cancer.

The identification of NcP needs to consider, first, the etiology explaining how pain is caused by the cancer lesion or lesions. Usually, this is done using clinical and imaging findings. Long-standing clinical experience has led to the description of cancer pain syndromes and checklists, which recognize the type and number of tissue lesions causing the pain. Different pain characteristics proved to have a different distribution across this syndrome classification. This description distinguishes between pain due to cancer lesions of bone, visceral, soft, and nervous tissues.

### Management of cancer pain in adult patients: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^115y4ADo]. Annals of Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of cancer pain, specifically in relation to non-opioid analgesics, the ESMO 2018 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acetaminophen or NSAIDs, alone or in combination with opioids, for patients experiencing mild-to-moderate cancer pain.
