## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to draft a statement discussing the risks of opioid use in chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiological mechanism by which opioids worsen ventilatory control in hypercapnic patients. Then, I should verify the epidemiologic signal and dose–response data linking opioids to hypercapnic respiratory failure and mortality. Next, I will examine high-risk phenotypes and disease states that amplify opioid-induced respiratory depression risk. After that, I need to review outcome data and guideline-based recommendations, including palliative care exceptions. Finally, I should confirm monitoring and mitigation strategies, including when to use NIV, continuous monitoring, and naloxone, and close with practical prescribing guardrails anchored to label and guideline language [^111e4xsQ] [^112hSTpX] [^notfound].

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis of harm. Opioids suppress medullary respiratory centers, blunt hypercapnic and hypoxic chemoreflexes, and destabilize ventilatory control during sleep by precipitating central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia; in hypercapnic patients with limited reserve, this can trigger acute-on-chronic ventilatory failure, with CO2 retention further deepening sedation in a vicious cycle [^111bUL2V] [^116iW2gM] [^115n8wsh]. Hold on, I should verify label consistency: multiple FDA labels explicitly warn that patients with COPD, cor pulmonale, hypoxia, or hypercapnia are at increased risk of life-threatening respiratory depression even at recommended doses, which aligns with this pathophysiology [^111e4xsQ] [^112hSTpX].

> Next, I should review the epidemiologic footprint. Wait, let me verify the population-level association: a population-based case–control study found opioid use to have a population attributable fraction for hypercapnic respiratory failure of about 41%, comparable to COPD itself, indicating opioids are a major modifiable driver in at-risk communities [^113Vab1B] [^113pi9HY] [^1173s2RU]. I need to check inpatient detection burden too; in the international PRODIGY cohort, 46% of general ward patients on parenteral opioids had at least one adjudicated episode of respiratory depression within 24 hours of continuous capnography/oximetry monitoring, underscoring how often standard intermittent vitals miss OIRD events [^112ukhmG] [^114RxMN5].

> I will now examine disease states that amplify risk. Patients with significant COPD, cor pulmonale, or any substantially reduced respiratory reserve and preexisting hypoxemia or hypercapnia have heightened vulnerability to apnea and hypoventilation from opioids; this is not speculative — FDA labels explicitly highlight these groups and contraindicate unmonitored use in acute or severe bronchial asthma or in the absence of resuscitative capability [^111e4xsQ] [^112hSTpX]. But wait, what if the patient is in an acute hypercapnic exacerbation? The BTS/ICS guideline directs initiation of NIV when pH < 7.35 with PaCO2 > 6.5 kPa (49 mmHg) despite optimal therapy, reinforcing that these patients are already on the cusp of ventilatory decompensation where sedatives and opioids can tip the balance [^111LmNWc] [^1146J1yU]. A low-credibility overdose cohort suggests obstructive lung disease increases intubation risk more than sixfold after drug overdose, consistent with the mechanistic susceptibility in obstructed, hypercapnic physiology, though I should be cautious in overinterpreting this single study [^116Edq2T].

> Hold on, I should verify who is most at risk phenotypically. The PRODIGY tool identifies five reproducible predictors of OIRD on hospital wards: age ≥ 60 years by decade, male sex, sleep-disordered breathing, opioid naivety, and chronic heart failure; high scores correlate with markedly higher event rates and justify continuous monitoring rather than intermittent checks alone [^115iBS4w] [^112ukhmG]. I need to ensure I address co-medications: FDA labeling and observational data consistently warn that concurrent benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants synergistically increase the risks of profound sedation, respiratory depression, and death, and should be avoided or used only with stringent justification and monitoring [^111bUL2V] [^111e4xsQ] [^115qp44n].

> Let me think about clinical consequences and dose–response. There is a dose-dependent association between opioid exposure and mortality in severe COPD cohorts, with higher daily doses correlating with increased death risk, while lower doses (commonly operationalized as ≤ 30 mg oral morphine equivalents/day) did not show a mortality signal in some studies; I should note, however, that these are observational and confounding is possible, so caution is warranted despite the apparent "low-dose safety" window [^1175EPKa] [^113nUBGc]. I should double-check for sleep-related sequelae: chronic opioids induce CSA in roughly a quarter of users, typically after months of therapy and with dose-dependence, which further destabilizes nighttime ventilation and can worsen daytime hypercapnia in susceptible patients [^116iW2gM] [^111bUL2V]. Finally, the hospital impact is nontrivial: OIRD is associated with increased ICU days and adds approximately $3,200–$3,237 to costs in U.S. analyses, reinforcing the economic rationale for prevention and surveillance [^112x8kmM] [^113B468R].

> Next, I should review authoritative recommendations. The BTS/ICS guidance advises avoiding opioids in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure if at all possible; if unavoidable, use the lowest effective dose with continuous monitoring and ensure capability for NIV and escalation, which I should align with label-based warnings against unmonitored use in high-risk pulmonary disease [^1146J1yU] [^111e4xsQ] [^112hSTpX]. I should confirm the post-extubation context: extubated patients with chronic respiratory disorders benefit from early NIV to reduce respiratory failure and possibly reintubation, indicating any opioid exposure in this window must be tightly controlled and paired with proactive ventilatory support when indicated [^114KdQbU] [^1121x4Kx]. For chronic stable hypercapnia from COPD, long-term NIV reduces mortality and health-care use, which indirectly emphasizes minimizing iatrogenic depressants that oppose ventilatory goals [^111uZTNY] [^112Asmmg].

> I need to ensure the palliative care exception is framed correctly. Randomized and observational evidence suggests that for refractory breathlessness in advanced disease, carefully titrated low-dose morphine may improve symptoms, and some cohorts did not show excess mortality at ≤ 30 mg OME/day; however, risks rise with higher doses and with benzodiazepine co-use, so shared decision-making, slow titration, and close follow-up are essential, especially in hypercapnic COPD where ventilatory reserve is minimal [^115udxhQ] [^113nUBGc] [^117HxyLH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied a mortality benefit — let me correct that: the net clinical benefit is symptom relief with uncertain mortality impact, and the observational nature precludes causal safety claims, so individualized risk–benefit assessment is mandatory [^117HxyLH] [^115udxhQ].

> Now, I should outline monitoring and mitigation. Intermittent vital-sign checks miss a large fraction of OIRD events; high-risk patients by PRODIGY score warrant continuous capnography and oximetry, with staffing and protocols to intervene promptly when alarms indicate apnea, severe desaturation, or extreme EtCO2 excursions [^112ukhmG] [^111wPiqv]. I will now examine ventilatory support: in acute hypercapnia or post-extubation risk, NIV reduces failure and aligns with BTS/ICS recommendations to initiate when pH and PaCO2 thresholds are met despite optimal therapy, while permissive hypercapnia strategies may be needed during invasive ventilation for severe obstruction [^111LmNWc] [^115GNgHM] [^117S9eRz]. I should confirm reversal readiness: make naloxone available, educate staff and caregivers on recognizing respiratory depression, and establish rapid response pathways, consistent with FDA guidance [^113hDDzJ] [^115qp44n].

> Special situations need attention. Chronic opioid users do not lose OIRD risk; in fact, chronic exposure narrows CO2 reserve and augments instability during sleep, so we should screen for sleep-disordered breathing and consider positive airway pressure therapy when CSA is present, recognizing that opioid reduction remains central to management when feasible [^116iW2gM] [^117E9jAT]. Postoperative patients, particularly elderly males with heart failure who are opioid naïve, often score high risk by PRODIGY and manifest early OIRD during initiation and titration; continuous monitoring and opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia are prudent here to prevent early decompensation in hypercapnic phenotypes [^112ukhmG] [^114BjYpt]. I should confirm that label language remains consistent across agents: multiple opioid labels reiterate CO2 retention exacerbates sedation and that life-threatening respiratory depression can occur even at recommended doses, especially at initiation or dose escalation, reinforcing the need for conservative dosing and vigilant surveillance in hypercapnia [^115n8wsh] [^115HHaeE].

> Let me reconsider practical prescribing guardrails in hypercapnic respiratory failure. Prefer non-opioid and regional or local strategies first; if an opioid is unavoidable, start at the lowest effective dose, avoid rapid up-titration, and do not co-administer benzodiazepines or other sedatives absent compelling indications, with explicit documentation of rationale and monitoring plans per labeling [^111e4xsQ] [^112hSTpX]. For refractory dyspnea in palliative contexts, consider cautious low-dose morphine with close follow-up and ready access to naloxone, while screening for sleep-disordered breathing and optimizing NIV when indicated to preserve ventilatory safety margins [^115udxhQ] [^113hDDzJ] [^114KdQbU]. I should double-check that care teams align escalation triggers with continuous monitoring thresholds and that NIV resources are available before initiating opioid therapy in decompensating hypercapnic patients, as per BTS/ICS [^1146J1yU] [^1121x4Kx].

> In summary, opioids in chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia pose a mechanistically plausible and epidemiologically substantial risk of respiratory decompensation, with dose-dependent mortality signals at higher exposures, frequent silent OIRD on wards, and amplified vulnerability in COPD, cor pulmonale, and sleep-disordered breathing; practice should default to avoidance, rigorous risk stratification, continuous monitoring, and early NIV when indicated, reserving carefully titrated low-dose opioids primarily for refractory symptoms under close supervision with naloxone at hand [^113Vab1B] [^112ukhmG] [^1175EPKa] [^111LmNWc] [^115udxhQ] [^113hDDzJ].

---

Opioids in chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia carry a **high risk of life-threatening respiratory depression** and CO2 retention, even at recommended doses [^112hSTpX] [^111e4xsQ], due to blunted ventilatory drive [^113seqfM] and impaired gas exchange. Risk is greatest at **initiation [^115n8wsh] and during dose escalation** [^112hSTpX] and is further amplified by concomitant CNS depressants [^111bUL2V], sleep-disordered breathing, and advanced age or frailty [^111e4xsQ]. Opioids can worsen hypercapnia [^1173s2RU], cause central sleep apnea [^113seqfM], and increase mortality [^1175EPKa] and hospitalizations. Use the **lowest effective dose** [^112hSTpX], avoid high doses, and monitor closely with ABGs [^112XA9Ur] and continuous oximetry/capnography [^112ukhmG]. Consider non-opioid alternatives and reserve opioids for refractory symptoms [^115udxhQ] with careful titration and monitoring.

---

## Physiological mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression

Opioids depress ventilation through **multiple mechanisms**, including:

- **Blunted ventilatory drive**: Reduced sensitivity to CO2 and hypoxia, worsening hypercapnia and hypoxemia [^113seqfM].

- **Central respiratory depression**: Direct suppression of brainstem respiratory centers [^115HHaeE], causing hypoventilation and apnea [^112hSTpX].

- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: Central sleep apnea [^113seqfM] and hypoxemia, further impairing gas exchange [^111bUL2V] [^1141JtvA].

---

## Clinical risks associated with opioid use in hypercapnic respiratory failure

Opioid use in hypercapnic respiratory failure is associated with **several clinical risks**:

- **Life-threatening respiratory depression**: Increased risk of apnea and respiratory arrest, even at recommended doses [^111e4xsQ] [^115n8wsh].

- **Exacerbation of hypercapnia**: CO2 retention [^111e4xsQ] can worsen respiratory acidosis and precipitate acute decompensation [^112XA9Ur].

- **Increased mortality and hospitalizations**: Higher risk of death [^1175EPKa] and respiratory-related admissions.

- **Central sleep apnea**: Dose-dependent CSA [^113seqfM] that further impairs ventilation [^111bUL2V].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

Certain patient characteristics **increase opioid-related respiratory risk**:

- **Advanced age**: Elderly patients have higher risk [^1139mMWF] due to altered pharmacokinetics and clearance [^111e4xsQ].

- **Comorbidities**: COPD, cor pulmonale, and reduced respiratory reserve heighten risk [^1173s2RU] [^112hSTpX].

- **Concurrent medications**: Benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants markedly increase risk [^111bUL2V] [^117HxyLH].

- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: OSA and CSA amplify opioid-induced respiratory depression [^113seqfM] [^111bUL2V].

---

## Dose-dependent risks

Opioid respiratory depression is **dose-related**: Higher doses increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypercapnia, and mortality [^1175EPKa], and risk is highest during **initiation and titration**, when doses are being escalated [^115n8wsh] [^112hSTpX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize cautious opioid use in hypercapnic respiratory failure: use the **lowest effective dose** and avoid high-dose regimens [^112hSTpX], with close monitoring of respiratory status, ABGs, and sedation [^111e4xsQ]. Limit concomitant benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants [^111bUL2V] [^117HxyLH]. Educate patients to recognize respiratory depression and seek emergency care when needed [^113hDDzJ].

---

## Alternative analgesic and palliative strategies

Non-opioid options should be **prioritized** [^112hSTpX], including acetaminophen and NSAIDs when appropriate [^111e4xsQ]. Non-pharmacological interventions — such as pulmonary rehabilitation, breathing retraining, and psychological support — should be incorporated. If opioids are necessary, titrate cautiously with close monitoring [^115udxhQ].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Effective monitoring and management include **continuous capnography and oximetry** to detect early respiratory depression [^112ukhmG]. Regular ABG analysis should track CO2 retention and acid-base status; prompt intervention with naloxone [^113hDDzJ] and supportive measures is indicated for respiratory depression [^112hSTpX] [^111e4xsQ].

---

Opioids in chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia **pose substantial risks** of respiratory depression, worsening hypercapnia [^1173s2RU], and increased mortality [^1175EPKa]. Use the **lowest effective dose**, monitor closely, and prefer non-opioid strategies; reserve opioids for refractory symptoms [^115udxhQ] with careful titration and vigilant monitoring.

### Prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards using continuous capnography and oximetry: An international prospective, observational trial [^112ukhmG]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

Opioid-related adverse events are a serious problem in hospitalized patients. Little is known about patients who are likely to experience opioid-induced respiratory depression events on the general care floor and may benefit from improved monitoring and early intervention. The trial objective was to derive and validate a risk prediction tool for respiratory depression in patients receiving opioids, as detected by continuous pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring.

- **Methods**: Prediction of Opioid-induced Respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) was a prospective, observational trial of blinded continuous capnography and oximetry conducted at 16 sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Vital signs were intermittently monitored per standard of care. A total of 1,335 patients receiving parenteral opioids and continuously monitored on the general care floor were included in the analysis. A respiratory depression episode was defined as respiratory rate ≤ 5 breaths/min (bpm), oxygen saturation ≤ 85%, or end-tidal carbon dioxide ≤ 15 or ≥ 60 mm Hg for ≥ 3 minutes; an apnea episode lasting > 30 seconds; or any respiratory opioid-related adverse event. A risk prediction tool was derived using a multivariable logistic regression model of 46 a priori defined risk factors with stepwise selection and was internally validated by bootstrapping.

- **Results**: One or more respiratory depression episodes were detected in 614 (46%) of 1,335 general care floor patients (43% male; mean age, 58 ± 14 years) continuously monitored for a median of 24 hours.

### Mitigo [^111bUL2V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders, including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Risks from concomitant use with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants**: Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from concomitant use of Mitigo® with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g. non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Use of neuroleptics in conjunction with neuraxial morphine may increase the risk of respiratory depression. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen [^111e4xsQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Use of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting, or in the absence of resuscitative equipment, is contraindicated.

- **Chronic pulmonary disease**: Oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression, are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets [see WARNINGS; Life Threatening Respiratory Depression].

- **Elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients**: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see WARNINGS; Life Threatening Respiratory Depression]. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets and when they are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see WARNINGS; Life Threatening Respiratory Depression]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following great system stress or long-term use.

---

### Fentora [^112hSTpX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Life-threatening respiratory depression in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients**: The use of Fentora in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Fentora-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive, including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Fentora.

	- Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Regular evaluation of patients is necessary, particularly when initiating and titrating Fentora and when it is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

- **Adrenal insufficiency**: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. The presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, and weakness.

### Opioids and obstructive sleep apnea [^113seqfM]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Opioids are widely prescribed for pain management, with an estimated 40% of adults in the United States using prescription opioids each year. Opioid misuse leads to high mortality, primarily due to respiratory depression. Animal and human studies indicate that opioid use may lead to sleep-disordered breathing. Opioids affect the control of breathing and impair upper airway function, causing central apneas, upper airway obstruction, and hypoxemia during sleep. The presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression. However, even if the relationship between opioids and central sleep apnea is firmly established, the question of whether opioids can aggravate OSA remains unanswered. Several reports have shown a high prevalence of OSA and nocturnal hypoxemia in patients receiving a high dose of opioids, though other studies do not find a correlation between opioid use and obstructive events. These differences can be attributed to significant interindividual variability, divergent effects of opioids on different phenotypic traits of OSA, and wide-ranging methodology. This review discusses mechanistic insights into the effects of opioids on the upper airway, hypoglossal motor activity, and the association of opioid use with obstructive sleep apnea.

### Intermittent noninvasive ventilation after extubation in patients with chronic respiratory disorders: A multicenter randomized controlled trial (VHYPER) [^114KdQbU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Early noninvasive ventilation (NIV) after extubation decreases the risk of respiratory failure and lowers 90-day mortality in patients with hypercapnia. Patients with chronic respiratory disease are at risk of extubation failure; therefore, it could be useful to determine the role of NIV with a discontinuous approach, not limited to patients with hypercapnia. We assessed the efficacy of early NIV in decreasing respiratory failure after extubation in patients with chronic respiratory disorders.

A prospective randomized controlled multicenter study was conducted. We enrolled 144 mechanically ventilated patients with chronic respiratory disorders who tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial. Patients were randomly allocated after extubation to receive either NIV (NIV group, n = 72), performed with a discontinuous approach for the first 48 hours, or conventional oxygen treatment (usual care group, n = 72). The primary endpoint was decreased respiratory failure within 48 hours after extubation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01047852).

Respiratory failure after extubation was less frequent in the NIV group: 6 patients (8.5%) versus 20 patients (27.8%); p = 0.0016. Six patients (8.5%) in the NIV group versus 13 (18.1%) in the usual care group were reintubated; p = 0.09. Intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and 90-day mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.28 and p = 0.33, respectively). The median postrandomization ICU length of stay was lower in the usual care group: 3 days (IQR 2–6) versus 4 days.

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: a population-based case-control study [^113pi9HY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

**Methods: Overview**: This prospective study was based in the City of Liverpool, a metropolitan area within Sydney, Australia. The study population was restricted to persons aged 40 years and over. A case–control study design was implemented in which cases were people with hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF), and controls were randomly selected members of the source population who did not have HRF. Non-English speaking persons were excluded if an interpreter was unavailable. Nursing home residents were excluded due to difficulties in obtaining informed consent and accurate study measurements. Participants were reimbursed for their time with a gift card to the value of $40 AUD. Study procedures were approved by the South Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written, informed consent.

### Endotracheal intubation after acute drug overdoses: Incidence, complications, and risk factors [^116Edq2T]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury-related fatality in the United States, and respiratory failure remains a major source of morbidity and mortality.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors for endotracheal intubation after acute drug overdose.

- **Methods**: This secondary data analysis was performed on a 5-year prospective cohort at two urban tertiary-care hospitals. The present study analyzed adult patients with suspected acute drug overdose to derive independent clinical predictors of endotracheal intubation.

- **Results**: We analyzed 2,497 patients with acute drug overdose, of whom 87 (3.5%) underwent endotracheal intubation. Independent clinical risk factors for endotracheal intubation were younger age (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96–0.98) and history of obstructive lung disease (OR 6.6, 95% CI 3.5–12.3), though heart failure had no association. Patients with obstructive lung disease had significantly more hypercapnia (mean difference 6.8 mm Hg, 95% CI 2.3–11.3) and a higher degree of acidemia (mean pH difference 0.04, 95% CI 0.01–0.07) than patients without obstructive lung disease. Lack of rapid sequence sedative/paralytic was associated with in-hospital fatality. Early complications of endotracheal intubation itself included desaturation (3.4%) and bradycardia (1%).

- **Conclusions**: Endotracheal intubation was infrequently performed on patients with acute drug overdose, and complications were rare when performed. Risk factors associated with endotracheal intubation included younger age and prior obstructive lung disease.

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: a population-based case-control study [^113Vab1B]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

No single cause was identified as being responsible for more than 50% of hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) cases, based on the population attributable fraction (PAF), as shown in Table 3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) had the highest adjusted PAF at 42% (95% CI 18% – 59%), followed by opioid use with a PAF of 41% (13% – 59%). Despite its low prevalence in the general population (1%), congestive cardiac failure (CCF) contributed substantially to the burden of HRF with a PAF of 24% (7% – 38%).

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^1146J1yU]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

In relation to classification and risk stratification for hypercapnic respiratory failure, particularly regarding prognostic tools, the BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend considering the use of validated tools. These tools are intended to inform discussions about prognosis and the appropriateness of invasive mechanical ventilation, although it is important to note that they are poorly predictive for individual patient use.

### Pentazocine and naloxone [^113hDDzJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression. This risk is greatest when starting pentazocine and naloxone tablets or when the dosage is increased, but it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help immediately in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see WARNINGS; Life Threatening Respiratory Depression].

Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see WARNINGS].

Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if pentazocine and naloxone tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Do not use these drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions].

Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with pentazocine and naloxone tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone, as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g. by prescription, directly from a pharmacist).

### Non-invasive ventilation for the management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115GNgHM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is commonly used to treat patients admitted to the hospital with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy of NIV applied in conjunction with usual care versus usual care involving no mechanical ventilation alone in adults with AHRF due to AECOPD. The aim of this review is to update the evidence base with the goals of supporting clinical practice and providing recommendations for future evaluation and research.

- **Search methods**: Trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and PsycINFO. This also included handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. This update to the original review incorporates the results of database searches up to January 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials that compared usual care plus NIV (BiPAP) versus usual care alone in an acute hospital setting for patients with AECOPD due to AHRF were eligible for inclusion. AHRF was defined by a mean admission pH < 7.35 and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂) > 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Primary review outcomes were mortality during hospital admission.

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: A population-based case-control study [^1173s2RU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) associated with each cause is shown in Table 3. Congestive cardiac failure (CCF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory muscle weakness, and opioid use were strongly associated with the presence of HRF. The area under the curve (AUC) values for forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC), N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and maximum sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP max) as continuous variables were 0.81, 0.74, 0.50, and 0.67, respectively. At the pre-specified cutoff, CCF had the strongest association (OR 13.4, 95% CI 1.40–128). Post-hoc analysis showed that when a lower NT-proBNP cutoff value of 35 pmol/L (296 pg/mL) was used to determine the presence of CCF, the magnitude of association was attenuated but remained statistically significant with an OR of 4.25 (95% CI 1.16–15.6).

- **Population attributable fraction (PAF)**: The PAF was determined separately for each cause, and thus adds to more than 100%. The PAF was not determined when there was no significant relationship between the specified cause and hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) did not appear to be associated with increased risk of HRF, with more controls having this condition compared with cases. There was no difference between groups based on mean AHI, using a 4% desaturation threshold, or using the o.

### Dsuvia [^115n8wsh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Life-threatening respiratory depression**: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. If respiratory depression is not immediately recognized and treated, it may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Dsuvia, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression while on treatment with Dsuvia.

Accidental exposure to or ingestion of even one dose of Dsuvia, especially in children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of sufentanil.

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders, including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider minimizing the use of Dsuvia and carefully monitor the patient for signs of respiratory depression [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Identifying risk factors and developing a nomogram for high flow nasal cannula failure in patients with hypercapnic acute respiratory failure [^11212mE1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Currently, there is a deficiency in nomograms specifically designed for predicting the failure of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy in patients with hypercapnic acute respiratory failure (hypercapnic ARF). The aim of this retrospective study is to develop and evaluate a nomogram that assesses the risk of HFNC failure in this patient population.

- **Methods**: Patients with ARF and hypercapnia (PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg in the initial arterial blood gas) who received HFNC in the intensive care unit (ICU) from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2023, were enrolled in this study. Risk factors were identified through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis. A novel nomogram model was subsequently developed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The model's predictive performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).

- **Results**: A total of 189 patients were included in the analysis, comprising 128 patients in the HFNC success group and 61 in the HFNC failure group. Multivariate logistic regression identified blood urea nitrogen, calcium, sepsis, and the respiratory rate oxygenation index (ROX) after 4 hours of oxygen therapy as independent prognostic factors for HFNC failure. The nomogram exhibited superior performance compared to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (P = 0.011) and the 4-hour ROX index (P = 0.001). Additionally, the calibration curve demonstrated satisfactory predictive accuracy, while DCA highlighted the clinical utility of the nomogram.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^111uLBaV]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Low credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the preferred initial method of mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure during COPD exacerbations. NIV improves hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and work of breathing via the mechanisms discussed above and reduces the need for intubation, mortality, and ICU and hospital length of stay, while also being associated with lower rates of nosocomial pneumonia.

- **Indications, contraindications, and potential complications**: These are outlined in Figure 2.

Initial settings depend on patient characteristics; however, basic principles include titrating PEEP to improve work of breathing while not worsening hyperinflation (see Invasive Mechanical Ventilation section) and setting pressure support to target a tidal volume (Vₜ) of approximately 6 to 8 mL/kg ideal body weight. Patients should be monitored regularly, particularly early in the course, using physical examinations and blood gas assessments to guide settings. For patients with persistent hypercapnia despite the initial application of NIV, the pressure support can be uptitrated to increase Vₜ and minute ventilation.

Sedative or analgesic medications (e.g. opioids or benzodiazepines) are commonly used to manage discomfort or anxiety associated with NIV. Dexmedetomidine, an α₂-adrenergic agonist, is an attractive sedative agent in this setting given its lack of respiratory depression and potential to reduce the risk of intubation and ICU length of stay. However, data on the safety of sedative and analgesic medications during NIV are mixed, with a particular risk of harm when combining agents from different medication classes, and these drugs should be used with caution.

### Perioperative opioid use in total shoulder arthroplasty is associated with dose-dependent risk of major surgical and medical complications [^114WkzeX]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Higher perioperative opioid use has been associated with an increase in periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), thromboembolic complications, respiratory events, gastrointestinal complications, cost, and length of stay following hip and knee arthroplasty. Limited data exist regarding the relationship between the postoperative opioid dose and complication rates following primary total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between perioperative opioid consumption and postoperative complications following TSA.

- **Methods**: The Premier Healthcare Database was queried to identify patients who underwent primary anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty from 2016–2020. Perioperative opioid consumption was totaled utilizing morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) to stratify patients based on quintiles of consumption. Primary outcomes included total opioid consumption, 90-day postoperative complications, revision, and readmission.

- **Results**: One hundred forty thousand two hundred fifty-one patients undergoing primary TSA were identified and stratified based on total opioid consumption into quintiles. Patients with increased MME exposure were significantly younger, more often female, and Black (P < .0001 for all). On multivariate analysis, increased MME exposure was associated with increased risk of multiple surgical complications including superficial wound infection, PJI, periprosthetic fractures, seroma, loosening, unspecified mechanical complications, and 90-day readmission.

### Prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards using continuous capnography and oximetry: An international prospective, observational trial [^111wPiqv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

One strength of the PRODIGY trial design was the inclusion of blinded, continuously monitored oximetry and capnography data, as well as respiratory depression episode adjudication using an independent clinical event committee. This allowed us to observe the true burden of respiratory depression. We included surgical and medical patients transferred to a range of general care floors in Europe, the United States, and Asia, making our findings generalizable. Although it remains to be seen if universal continuous monitoring will lead to a survival benefit for general care floor patients, our data suggest that screening with the easy-to-use PRODIGY score and the use of continuous monitoring, at least in patients with high respiratory depression risk, may prevent harm to the individual patient.

For example, a 72-year-old male patient with chronic heart failure who is opioid naïve is at a more than 2-fold risk of respiratory depression (PRODIGY score = 30; high risk) compared to a 67-year-old female patient with diabetes and chronic kidney disease who has previously received opioids (PRODIGY score = 8; intermediate risk) following a similar surgical procedure, when both receive opioids on the general care floor. Along with the judicious use of opioids, this high-risk patient may benefit from continuous capnography and oximetry monitoring.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: national prospective study [^116TdAty]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Drug effects on the rates of admission to the hospital were expressed as subdistribution hazard ratios and estimated using Fine-Gray regression, which accounts for the competing risk of death. For the analysis of admissions, the time under observation was from the first day of long-term oxygen therapy in the community until the date of the first admission to the hospital for all causes, with censoring at withdrawal of long-term oxygen therapy, death, or study end (31 December 2009). The final admission model was adjusted for WHO performance status, number of previous admissions, number of cardiovascular diagnoses, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and treatment with oral glucocorticoids.

Associations with mortality were expressed as hazard ratios and estimated with Cox regression. For mortality, the observation time was from the start date of long-term oxygen therapy until the date of death from all causes, with censoring at withdrawal of long-term oxygen therapy or 31 December 2009. The final mortality model was adjusted for age, sex, PaO2 air, PaCO2 air, WHO performance status, BMI, anemia, number of cardiovascular diagnoses, renal failure, and oral glucocorticoids.

Sleeping pills did not predict admission to the hospital or mortality or affect the estimates for benzodiazepines and opioids. Findings were similar when we excluded patients taking sleeping pills.

We evaluated interactions by including interaction terms in the fully adjusted models between the effect of benzodiazepines and opioids and concurrent treatment with both drugs, and the presence of hypercapnia (PaCO2 air > 6.5).

### Percocet [^115qp44n]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Life-threatening respiratory depression is a serious risk associated with the use of opioids, including Percocet, even when used as recommended. If not immediately recognized and treated, respiratory depression may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of this condition may involve close observation, supportive measures, and the use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see OVERDOSAGE]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Percocet, the risk is greatest during therapy initiation or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk, proper dosing and titration of Percocet are essential [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION]. Overestimating the Percocet dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.

Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Percocet, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. Patients and caregivers should be educated on how to recognize respiratory depression and the importance of seeking emergency medical help immediately in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients/Caregivers].

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders, including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia.

### Opioid-induced respiratory depression increases hospital costs and length of stay in patients recovering on the general care floor [^112x8kmM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

Of the 1495 prospectively enrolled PRODIGY patients, 1335 underwent continuous capnography and pulse oximetry monitoring and received opioids on the general care floor, including 769 patients in the United States. This sub-analysis of healthcare utilization data, which was prospectively collected during the trial, was performed using the 769 United States patients (N = 566 patients outside of the United States were excluded). Within the United States patient cohort (N = 769), retrospectively collected cost data was unavailable for 349 patients, resulting in a final patient cohort of 420 United States PRODIGY patients for analysis of cost differences between patients with and without ≥ 1 respiratory depression episode.

Although provision of cost data was not a requirement for site participation in the trial, the cost data for the 420 patients was collected from five United States PRODIGY trial sites: Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI; Buffalo General Medical Center, Buffalo, NY; Emory University, Atlanta, GA; MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH; and The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH. Due to confounding factors, such as differences in healthcare policies that affect patient length of stay and readmission procedures between countries, differences in healthcare cost and reimbursement systems between countries, and limited sample sizes when considering PRODIGY results on a country-specific level (N = 28 to N = 213), we chose to focus this cost analysis solely on United States PRODIGY patients, who represent the largest cohort within the hospital cost analysis.

### Opioids for the palliation of refractory breathlessness in adults with advanced disease and terminal illness [^115udxhQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Breathlessness is a common and disabling symptom affecting many individuals with advanced cardiorespiratory disease and cancer. The most effective treatments target the underlying disease. However, this may not always be feasible, necessitating symptomatic treatment in addition to maximal disease-directed therapy. Opioids are increasingly used for breathlessness, though their mechanism of action remains unclear. A few well-conducted, high-quality trials have been conducted in this area.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of opioid drugs in relieving breathlessness in individuals with advanced disease due to malignancy, respiratory or cardiovascular disease, or those receiving palliative care for any other disease.

- **Search methods**: We performed searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science up to 19 October 2015. We hand-searched review articles, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized double-blind controlled trials comparing the use of any opioid drug against placebo or other interventions for the relief of breathlessness. The intervention was any opioid, given by any route, in any dose.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Studies identified by the search were imported into a reference manager database. We retrieved the full-text version of relevant studies, and two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome measure was breathlessness, with secondary outcome measures including exercise tolerance.

Miscellaneous risk factors of NIV failure

Other risk factors for NIV failure in hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) include the delay between admission and NIV use, the number of fiberoptic bronchoscopies performed, duration of NIV use, increase in radiographic infiltrates within the first 24 hours, and causal diagnosis (as de novo) of ARF. Age has been demonstrated to be a risk factor (with a low odds ratio) only in a minority of studies.

- **Hypercapnic respiratory failure**: The utilization of NIV in hypercapnic ARF, as well as the risk factors for its failure, has probably been more intensively studied compared to its use in hypoxic ARF. Although hypercapnic ARF covers ARF due to neurological disorders (such as neuromuscular disorders) or other acute or chronic lung disorders (such as restrictive lung disease), most of the studies conducted in this field have involved patients with COPD exacerbations.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: National prospective study [^113nUBGc]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

The evidence generated indicates that there is a cohort of patients with severe COPD who seem to tolerate regular lower dose opioids in a way that is likely to deliver a net symptomatic benefit. The level of follow-up and healthcare given to patients might influence the outcomes, and our findings should be interpreted in the context of levels of clinical contact.

- **Clinicians' considerations**: This study further supports the safety of regular low-dose systemic opioids to reduce breathlessness in severely ill patients with respiratory compromise and hypercapnia — patients who have an immense need for relief of symptoms. The need for higher opioid doses for symptomatic control should be balanced against the possible increased risk of adverse events. Our study supports the suggestion that benzodiazepines should not be the first-line treatment for breathlessness in those with respiratory failure, given the unclear evidence of net clinical benefit. Benzodiazepines and opioids can be safely combined in lower doses. All treatments assume adequate follow-up of the patient's clinical condition and symptoms, including proper prophylaxis and treatment for expected effects such as opioid-related constipation.

- **Chronic breathlessness management**: The approach for chronic breathlessness is no different from that of opioid treatment for pain. Sustained-release morphine should be considered as a first-line treatment and should be initiated at a low dose regularly and titrated upward over days and weeks, balancing beneficial and adverse effects. Titration up to 30 mg morphine daily might safely improve symptom management.

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: A population-based case-control study [^114dY6SB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Self-reported use of opioid medications contributed significantly to hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF), with a population attributable fraction comparable to that of COPD. In recent decades, Australia and other high-income countries have documented a marked increase in the use of prescription opioids. While the clinical indication for most opioid prescriptions is acute pain, chronic non-cancer pain is associated with continued opioid use. Opioids directly suppress respiration and can also contribute to ventilatory failure indirectly via the mediators of sleep-related hypoventilation, as well as obstructive and central sleep apnea.

Among adults with COPD, incident opioid prescriptions are associated with an increased risk of adverse respiratory outcomes and death. However, safety data among patients with chronic respiratory disease are inconsistent, particularly for those who receive opioids for refractory breathlessness. Few previous studies have included drugs as a potential cause for HRF, generally excluding such patients. We found opioid use to be associated with at least a three-fold increase in the risk of HRF, and hence it may be an important modifiable risk factor in similar populations. Our results emphasize the need to rationalize opioid use to clinical situations where the potential harms are outweighed by the benefits of these medicines.

### Beyond the guidelines for non-invasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure: Implications for practice [^1154cnW7]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation is standard therapy in the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure of various causes. The evidence base for its use, as well as when and how it should be used, has been reviewed in two recent guidelines. In this paper, we explore beyond the guidelines to understand what is happening in everyday clinical practice. We examine how patient selection can be refined to maximize the chances of a successful outcome and consider emerging alternative therapies. The real-world application of non-invasive ventilation often diverges from guideline recommendations, particularly regarding patient selection and timing of initiation. To improve patient outcomes, education programs need to emphasize these issues, and the effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation should be monitored by regular audits.

### Timing of noninvasive ventilation failure: Causes, risk factors, and potential remedies [^11778xMu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The utilization of noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) has become one of the most important developments in the field of mechanical ventilation over the past two decades. The use of NIV during acute respiratory failure (ARF) has increased since the late 1990s for all diagnoses, including patients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), regardless of the supporting evidence for the latter.

NIV failure has been defined as the need for endotracheal intubation (ETI) or death. Its rate greatly varies between 5% and 60%, depending on numerous factors, including the cause of ARF. Unsuccessful NIV was found to be independently associated with death, especially in patients with de novo ARF. This may indicate the need for caution with regard to the application of NIV and for close monitoring to switch promptly to ETI when necessary.

Several investigators have tried to assess the best predictors of NIV failure. However, to the best of our knowledge, despite the rather extensive literature in the NIV field, there is only one paper, published 10 years ago, summarizing the evidence for the risk factors for NIV failure, and no studies of the timing of the failure. Based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three temporal moments were identified: 1) immediate failure (within minutes to < 1 h), 2) early failure (1 to 48 h), and 3) late failure (after 48 h). The purpose of this narrative review is to illustrate the main patient-related predictors or risk factors of immediate, early, and late failure.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1177pCxt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The methodologists extracted data and imported them into RevMan version 5.3 software (Cochrane) for meta-analysis. We used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to conduct all meta-analyses; study weights were generated using the inverse-variance method. We present results of all analyses using relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risk of bias (RoB) independently and in duplicate for each outcome of individual studies using the Cochrane RoB tool that classifies RoB as "low", "high", or "unclear" for each of the following domains: sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. We rated the overall RoB as the highest risk attributed to any criterion.

With input from the panel chairs, the methodologists developed an evidence profile for each PICO. Following GRADE principles, the certainty of evidence for each outcome was judged to be "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low". In accordance with GRADE, the certainty of evidence for each outcome was originally set as high if it originated from RCTs and low if it originated from observational data. We subsequently downgraded the quality of the evidence by one or two degrees if results from individual studies had a serious or very serious RoB, there were serious inconsistencies in the results across studies, the evidence was indirect, the data were imprecise, or publication bias was believed.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111uZTNY]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

- **Economic and societal perspective**: Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD carries a poor prognosis. In a query of electronic medical records, among 491 patients with compensated hypercapnia of various causes, with 170 (35%) having COPD, each 5 mm Hg increase in PaCO2 was associated with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.16). Over the course of a year, these patients accounted for 1,030 hospital admissions, and 218 (44.4%) had two or more hospital admissions. Implementing non-invasive ventilation in this context could reduce healthcare use and costs. In a retrospective study of the Medicare Limited Data Set (2012–18), patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure who received non-invasive ventilation treatment experienced reduced risk of mortality (relative risk reduction 39%) and reduced hospital admissions (17%) compared with a matched cohort who did not have reductions. Furthermore, a cost-effectiveness analysis, based on the results of a randomized controlled trial, showed a favorable incremental cost per quality adjusted life year of $50,856 (£42,406, €49,818) in the United States.

Clearly, the burden of the evidence suggests a salutary effect for non-invasive ventilation in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD. In the following sections, we provide the reader with general recommendations for some of the unresolved issues that surround non-invasive ventilation implementation.

- **Which patients with COPD would benefit from non-invasive ventilation?**

- **Early data for the efficacy**:

### Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for lowering the risk of mechanical ventilation: Research questions and clinical potential for the future [^1113zEc4]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

As a result of technical improvements, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO₂R) now has the potential to play an important role in the management of adults with acute respiratory failure. There is growing interest in the use of ECCO₂R for the management of both hypoxaemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. However, evidence to support its use is scarce, and several questions remain about the best way to implement this therapy, which can be associated with serious side effects.

This review reflects the consensus opinion of an international group of clinician scientists with expertise in managing acute respiratory failure and in using ECCO₂R therapies in this setting. We concisely review clinically relevant aspects of ECCO₂R and provide a series of recommendations for clinical practice and future research. These recommendations cover topics that include the practicalities of ECCO₂R delivery, indications for use, and service delivery.

### Sleep-disordered breathing in patients on opioids for chronic pain [^117E9jAT]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In the past two decades, there has been a substantial rise in the use of opioids for chronic pain, accompanied by an increase in opioid-related mortality and adverse effects. A significant contributor to opioid-associated mortality is the high prevalence of moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing, including central and obstructive sleep apnea, in patients with chronic pain. Although evidence-based treatments are available for sleep-disordered breathing, patients are not frequently assessed for it in pain clinics.

To aid healthcare providers in addressing this clinical issue, we present evidence on the interaction between opioids and sleep-disordered breathing, along with the prevalence and predictive factors for sleep-disordered breathing in patients on opioids for chronic pain. We offer recommendations on evaluating patients on opioids for the risk of moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing in clinical care. This approach could lead to earlier use of therapeutic interventions such as opioid cessation or positive airway pressure therapy for opioid-associated sleep-disordered breathing, thereby improving the quality of life and well-being for patients with chronic pain.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: National prospective study [^113Wnbky]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

In this national prospective study, treatment with lower dose opioids was not associated with an increased risk of admission to hospital or death in patients with COPD who were dependent on oxygen, regardless of whether the patient was naive to opioids, concurrently used benzodiazepines, or had hypercapnia. Treatment with benzodiazepines also did not affect the rate of admission but was associated with a modest increase in mortality. Though this association cannot be interpreted as cause and effect, the association remained after we adjusted for known or plausible confounders.

### Sleep-disordered breathing associated with long-term opioid therapy [^1141JtvA]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Three patients are described who illustrate distinctive patterns of sleep-disordered breathing that we have observed in patients who are receiving long-term, sustained-release opioid medications. Polysomnography shows respiratory disturbances occur predominantly during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are characterized by ataxic breathing, central apneas, sustained hypoxemia, and unusually prolonged obstructive "hypopneas" secondary to delayed arousal responses. In contrast to what is usually observed in subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), oxygen desaturation is more severe and respiratory disturbances are longer during NREM sleep compared to rapid eye movement sleep. Further studies are needed regarding the effects of opioids on respiration during sleep as well as the importance of interaction with other medications and associated risk factors for OSA.

### Timing of noninvasive ventilation failure: Causes, risk factors, and potential remedies [^1147CSyS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Risk factors and predictors of NIV failure are numerous. They differ between hypercapnic and hypoxemic patients and according to the timing of the failure. Every physician dealing with NIV should be aware of these risk factors and closely monitor each patient for their presence or development to achieve a good response and to improve the prognosis. If a patient fails to improve sufficiently, prompt ETI should be performed without delay because there is an increased risk of morbidity and mortality with ETI after failed NIV. A satisfactory initial NIV attempt is not always a marker of a good outcome. Late NIV failure may occur in up to 15% of patients in whom the initial NIV attempt was satisfactory.

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: A population-based case-control study [^115tGmKu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

This study has some weaknesses. We were unable to achieve the recruitment target; however, our analysis found that our sample size was sufficient to detect with statistical confidence the high magnitude of associations observed between hypercapnic respiratory failure (HRF) and the causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive cardiac failure (CCF), and opioid use. Rather than the small groups per se, the primary limitation of this study is the potential selection bias induced by low response and non-participation rates. A relatively small proportion of potentially eligible people proceeded to study participation, despite attempts made by the investigators to minimize inconveniences and provide financial reimbursement for the time spent.

Controls may have been more likely to participate if they had symptoms of, or were concerned about, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). If this effect had occurred in controls but not in cases, it would have led to an underestimation of the association with OSA. Potential cases may have been excluded due to frailty or death. The effect of this selection bias would have been an underestimation of the association with causes known to increase the risk of death, such as CCF. Due to the case-control design, risk factors for the outcome are measured after the occurrence of HRF, although we expect most to be chronic conditions that would have been present prior to hospitalization. Finally, our results may not be generalizable to other populations depending on socioeconomic and other factors affecting the prevalence of each cause.

Nevertheless, our work has several strengths distinguishing it from previous studies. This is one of the few studies that have selected cases in such a manner.

### Association between race and opioid-induced respiratory depression: An international post hoc analysis of the prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression in patients monitored by capnography trial [^1157nMzy]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Low credibility.

Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is common on medical and surgical wards and is associated with increased morbidity and healthcare costs. While previous studies have investigated risk factors for OIRD, the role of race remains unclear. We aim to investigate the association between race and OIRD occurrence on the medical/surgical ward.

- **Methods**: This is a post hoc analysis of the Prediction of Opioid-induced respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) trial; a prospective multinational observational blinded study of 1335 general ward patients who received parenteral opioids and underwent blinded capnography and oximetry monitoring to identify OIRD episodes. For this study, demographic and perioperative data, including race and comorbidities, were analyzed and assessed for potential associations with OIRD. Univariable χ² and Mann-Whitney U tests were used. Stepwise selection of all baseline and demographic characteristics was employed in the multivariable logistic regression analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 1253 patients had sufficient racial data (317 Asian, 158 Black, 736 White, and 42 other races) for inclusion. The incidence of OIRD was 60% in Asians (N = 190/317), 25% in Blacks (N = 40/158), 43% in Whites (N = 316/736), and 45% (N = 19/42) in other races. Baseline characteristics varied significantly: Asians were older, more opioid-naïve, and had higher opioid requirements, while Blacks had higher incidences of heart failure, obesity, and smoking. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression revealed that Asians had increased likelihoods of…

### Prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards using continuous capnography and oximetry: An international prospective, observational trial [^114RxMN5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Opioid-related adverse events are a serious problem in hospitalized patients. Little is known about patients who are likely to experience opioid-induced respiratory depression events on the general care floor and may benefit from improved monitoring and early intervention. The trial objective was to derive and validate a risk prediction tool for respiratory depression in patients receiving opioids, as detected by continuous pulse oximetry and capnography monitoring.

- **Methods**: Prediction of Opioid-induced respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) was a prospective, observational trial of blinded continuous capnography and oximetry conducted at 16 sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Vital signs were intermittently monitored per standard of care. A total of 1335 patients receiving parenteral opioids and continuously monitored on the general care floor were included in the analysis. A respiratory depression episode was defined as respiratory rate ≤ 5 breaths/min (bpm), oxygen saturation ≤ 85%, or end-tidal carbon dioxide ≤ 15 or ≥ 60 mm Hg for ≥ 3 minutes; apnea episode lasting > 30 seconds; or any respiratory opioid-related adverse event. A risk prediction tool was derived using a multivariable logistic regression model of 46 a priori defined risk factors with stepwise selection and was internally validated by bootstrapping.

- **Results**: One or more respiratory depression episodes were detected in 614 (46%) of 1335 general care floor patients (43% male; mean age, 58 ± 14 years) continuously monitored for a median of 24 hours.

### Fentanyl citrate [^115HHaeE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Life-threatening respiratory depression**: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Adequate facilities should be available for postoperative monitoring and ventilation of patients administered anesthetic doses of Fentanyl Citrate Injection. It is essential that these facilities be fully equipped to handle all degrees of respiratory depression. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Fentanyl Citrate Injection are essential. As with other potent opioids, the respiratory depressant effect of Fentanyl Citrate Injection may persist longer than the measured analgesic effect. The total dose of all opioid agonists administered should be considered by the practitioner before ordering opioid analgesics during recovery from anesthesia.

Certain forms of conduction anesthesia, such as spinal anesthesia and some peridural anesthetics, can alter respiration by blocking intercostal nerves. Through other mechanisms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], Fentanyl Citrate Injection can also alter respiration. Therefore, when Fentanyl Citrate Injection is administered, it is critical to monitor respiratory status closely.

### Chronic opioid use and central sleep apnea, where are we now and where to go? A state of the art review [^116iW2gM]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Low credibility.

Opioids are commonly used for pain management, perioperative procedures, and addiction treatment. There is an opioid epidemic in North America, marked by a significant increase in related deaths. Since 2000, chronic opioid users have been recognized to have significant central sleep apnea (CSA). After heart failure-related Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSB), opioid-induced CSA is now the second most commonly seen CSA. It occurs in around 24% of chronic opioid users, typically after opioids have been used for more than two months, and usually correlates with opioid dose and plasma concentration.

Opioid-induced CSA events often mix with episodes of ataxic breathing. The pathophysiology of opioid-induced CSA is based on dysfunction in respiratory rhythm generation and ventilatory chemoreflexes. Opioids have a paradoxical effect on different brain regions, resulting in an irregular respiratory rhythm. Regarding ventilatory chemoreflexes, chronic opioid use induces hypoxia that appears to stimulate an augmented hypoxic ventilatory response (high loop gain) and cause a narrow CO2 reserve, a combination that promotes respiratory instability.

At the time of writing, no direct evidence has shown any major clinical consequence from CSA in chronic opioid users. However, a line of evidence suggests increased morbidity and mortality in overall chronic opioid users. CSA in chronic opioid users is likely to be a compensatory mechanism to avoid opioid injury and is potentially beneficial. The treatments of CSA in chronic opioid users mainly focus on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^111J3bkY]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particularly concerning the management of acute exacerbations requiring invasive ventilation, the BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend discussing the management of potential future episodes of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with patients after an episode necessitating ventilatory support. This recommendation is due to the high risk of recurrence.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: national prospective study [^112SwGFC]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Breathlessness is a major cause of impaired activity and quality of life, affecting as many as a fifth of people aged over 65. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of breathlessness, morbidity, and mortality. Worldwide, more than 300 million people have COPD, many of whom have breathlessness that affects their daily life for many years. Breathlessness predicts mortality in COPD to a stronger degree than impairment of lung function. The burden of breathlessness increases with age and severity of the respiratory disease; 98% of patients with end-stage respiratory disease experience breathlessness, persisting at rest or on minimal exertion, despite optimal treatment of the underlying disease (chronic refractory breathlessness). Patients with severe COPD are more breathless than patients with advanced lung cancer and are breathless for longer periods.

Randomized trials have shown that oral sustained release morphine can relieve chronic refractory breathlessness. However, whether benzodiazepines reduce breathlessness is not clear, and their safety in this setting is unknown. Benzodiazepines are also used to treat anxiety and opioids to treat pain, conditions highly prevalent in patients with severe COPD.

A concern among clinicians is that benzodiazepines and opioids, alone or in combination, could cause adverse events, including respiratory depression, confusion, falls, and even premature death in patients with respiratory compromise. Risks might be higher in frail patients, especially if they have not previously been treated with these medications.

### BTS/ICS guideline for the ventilatory management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in adults [^111LmNWc]. Thorax (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypercapnic respiratory failure — and more specifically, with respect to patients experiencing a COPD exacerbation — the BTS/ICS 2016 guidelines recommend initiating noninvasive ventilation in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD who present with persistent respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.35, PaCO2 > 6.5 kPa or 49 mmHg) despite optimal medical therapy.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: National prospective study [^117HxyLH]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

This study extends previous observations in several important ways. By estimating adverse drug effects in a relevant high-risk population in clinical practice, it supports the conclusion that lower dose opioids are not associated with an increased risk of admission to hospital or death and might be safe for symptomatic treatment even in patients with severe and end-stage COPD. It also suggests that benzodiazepines and higher dose opioids are associated with modestly increased risks of mortality, especially when used concurrently. The possibility of true causal effects, however, needs to be validated by prospective observational and randomized trials.

- **Strengths and limitations of the study**: A major strength of the present study is its inclusion of a large population-based consecutive cohort of older severely ill patients with respiratory failure caused by COPD, many of whom had hypercapnia. Sweden has an integrated, publicly financed health system that provides care independently of the patient's health insurance and financial status, ensuring no patient was lost to follow-up. Analyses were adjusted for major confounders, including comorbidity and concomitant drug treatment, and the findings likely have excellent applicability to clinical practice in similar settings around the world.

	- One limitation is that we cannot rule out residual confounding from unmeasured covariates and from the indications for benzodiazepines and opioids because of the absence of randomization. This bias, however, would tend to overestimate the risk of adverse events.

### Prediction of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards using continuous capnography and oximetry: An international prospective, observational trial [^115iBS4w]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

- **Key points**:

- **Question**: Can we use continuous capnography and oximetry monitoring data to derive a risk prediction tool to predict the risk of respiratory depression episodes in patients receiving parenteral opioid therapy on surgical and medical general care floors?

- **Findings**: The PRediction of Opioid-induced respiratory Depression In patients monitored by capnoGraphY (PRODIGY) trial found a 46% incidence of respiratory depression and developed a novel respiratory depression risk prediction tool. This tool includes five easy-to-assess variables: age ≥ 60 years by decade, sex, opioid naivety, sleep disorders, and chronic heart failure.

- **Meaning**: This risk prediction tool, based on continuous, blinded oximetry and capnography data, accurately predicts respiratory depression in patients receiving parenteral opioids on the general care floor.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112Asmmg]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

After the generation of recommendations, the panel divided into working groups for manuscript preparation. For each PICO question, we summarized the recommendation, provided a narrative summary of the evidence — highlighting the largest and most relevant clinical trials for each PICO question — discussed issues raised as part of the EtD framework, and provided a justification for the final recommendation considering the above, together with implementation considerations and future research directions. Each PICO summary was reviewed by the individual working group and then synthesized by the chairs and methodologists.

Editing and feedback on the manuscript were conducted electronically, coordinated by the panel chairs. The final wording of all recommendations and justifications was agreed upon by the entire panel and submitted to ATS for review and approval. The guideline underwent anonymous peer review by content experts and a methodologist. After multiple cycles of review and revision, the guideline was reviewed and approved by a multidisciplinary board of directors.

### Guidance for the better care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111BhPHN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The expert group considered six questions regarding the effectiveness of drug treatment in COPD and assigned priorities to a range of outcomes that differed between interventions. For instance, the risk of pneumonia was prioritized over efficacy outcomes for questions related to corticosteroids; however, it was not discussed concerning long-acting bronchodilator therapy or opiate use to manage breathlessness. This suggests that prior knowledge of the field influences the weighting given to particular outcomes.

Clinical practice guidance needs to address audiences beyond practicing clinicians, including patients and payers. The authors clearly explain the interests of these different stakeholders and use carefully nuanced language to support their conclusions and interpret what these conclusions might mean for these interest groups. Whether readers of the summary document will grasp these subtleties is unclear and presents a fertile area for further research.

Understanding why guideline writers reached their conclusions is always of interest. This is detailed in the section on committee discussion, which, along with a series of research needs, accompanies each question.

### Prone position for acute respiratory failure in adults [^113dDWRH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Acute hypoxaemia de novo or on a background of chronic hypoxaemia is a common reason for admission to intensive care and for the provision of mechanical ventilation. Various refinements in mechanical ventilation or adjuncts are employed to improve patient outcomes. Mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome, one of the main contributors to the need for mechanical ventilation for hypoxaemia, remains approximately 40%. Ventilation in the prone position may improve lung mechanics and gas exchange and could improve outcomes.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review are (1) to ascertain whether prone ventilation offers a mortality advantage when compared with traditional supine or semi-recumbent ventilation in patients with severe acute respiratory failure requiring conventional invasive artificial ventilation, and (2) to supplement previous systematic reviews on prone ventilation for hypoxaemic respiratory failure in an adult population.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 31 January 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 31 January 2014), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 31 January 2014), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1992 to 31 January 2014) in Ovid MEDLINE for eligible randomized controlled trials. We also searched for studies by handsearching reference lists of relevant articles, by contacting colleagues, and by handsearching published proceedings of relevant journals. We applied no language constraints.

### Risk factors for severe opioid-related adverse events in a national cohort of medical hospitalizations [^1139mMWF]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Opioids are a leading cause of adverse drug events in the hospital. Guidelines recommend that physicians assess the risks of opioids and discuss them with patients when considering opioid use. There are no studies examining patient- and prescribing-related risk factors for opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADEs) in hospitalized medical patients.

- **Objective**: To identify independent risk factors for severe ORADEs in hospitalized medical patients.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Patients**: Medical patients hospitalized at US, non-federal, and acute care facilities, with at least one pharmacy charge for an opioid during hospitalization. Patients with metastatic malignancy, hospice, or palliative care billing codes were excluded.

- **Main measures**: We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to identify risk factors for severe ORADEs, defined by a pharmacy charge for naloxone. Candidate risk factors were chosen a priori based on clinical grounds and prior literature.

- **Key results**: Among 731,208 hospitalizations (median age 60, 56.5% female), a severe ORADE occurred in 2727 (0.4%). Independent risk factors included patient characteristics (advanced age, female gender), comorbidities (congestive heart failure, opioid abuse/dependence, non-opioid drug abuse/dependence, psychosis, depression, obstructive sleep apnea), organ failures on admission (respiratory failure, shock/hypotension, renal failure, hepatic failure, acidosis, and neurologic failure), and medication co-administrations (antipsychotics and short-acting benzodiazepines).

### Delirium in elderly patients with COPD combined with respiratory failure undergoing mechanical ventilation: A prospective cohort study [^116dke3v]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Respiratory failure patients often experience multiple complications due to severe disease progression and rapid development, resulting in a particularly high risk of delirium. In recent years, research on delirium in the ICU has gradually become more detailed and comprehensive. The incidence of delirium in the ICU is reported to be between 10.13% and 78.46%, with mechanically ventilated patients comprising the majority. Currently, there is still a lack of studies addressing the status of delirium in patients with COPD and respiratory failure undergoing mechanical ventilation. The results of this study indicate that the incidence of delirium in patients with COPD combined with respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation is 21.94%.

For patients aged 75 years or older, with a BMI of 19 kg/m² or less, hypertension, an APACHE II score of 15 or more, CPOT of 5 or more, sedation, or PaO₂ of 75 mmHg or less, these conditions are identified as risk factors for delirium in elderly patients with COPD undergoing mechanical ventilation. Early targeted intervention and nursing care are crucial for these patients to reduce the occurrence of delirium.

Advanced age is an independent risk factor for delirium. COPD patients are predominantly elderly. The cause of delirium is associated with abnormal neurotransmitter function and damage to the blood-brain barrier. The receptivity of the elderly brain to external stimuli decreases, while the inflammatory response increases. This is manifested by progressive apoptosis of cells in the brain of the elderly, a decline in brain function, and a decrease in the activity of neurotransmitter synthase in the aging brain.

### Opioid-induced respiratory depression increases hospital costs and length of stay in patients recovering on the general care floor [^113B468R]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Low credibility.

The additive cost burden of respiratory depression is $3,237 (16% increase) with outliers and $3,200 (17% increase) without outliers in hospitalization costs per PRODIGY trial analysis. This is somewhat less than the $4,350–$8,225 range (27–47% increase) reported in the literature. The more conservative cost burden estimate found by the PRODIGY trial may be explained by it being a prospective study that used continuous capnography and oximetry monitoring to identify opioid-induced respiratory depression, requiring strict adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria. In comparison, previous studies, which were retrospective and relied on claims analyses and coded instances of ORADEs, likely missed milder and potentially less costly cases of ORADE.

Although other studies have reported differences in cost and healthcare outcomes for ORADEs, the factors contributing to these outcomes are not well described. Our analysis identified patient characteristics that significantly impacted length of stay and cost. The use of multiple opioids; longer, high-risk, or open surgery; respiratory depression; and medical conditions, including chronic heart failure, hypertension, and sepsis, all contributed to increased length of stay. Interestingly, the PRODIGY score accounts for chronic heart failure and opioid naivety when determining patient risk for respiratory depression. Importantly, respiratory depression contributed to both length of stay and cost, highlighting its importance in determining patient outcomes. The findings of this trial may be of particular interest.

### Incidence of postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression episodes in patients on room air or supplemental oxygen: A post-hoc analysis of the PRODIGY trial [^114BjYpt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

An OIRD (opioid-induced respiratory depression) episode was pre-defined as: respiratory rate ≤ 5 breaths/min (bpm), oxygen saturation ≤ 85%, or end-tidal carbon dioxide ≤ 15 or ≥ 60 mm Hg for ≥ 3 min; apnea episode lasting > 30 s; or any respiratory opioid-related adverse event. Potential OIRD episodes were identified by monitor algorithms and independently assessed by a panel of capnography experts, blinded to patient medical history, including supplemental oxygen (SO) use, to categorize patients as having either ≥ 1 OIRD episode or no OIRD. Patients with > 1 potential OIRD episode underwent OIRD adjudication only until the first OIRD episode was confirmed. This adjudicated data was then used to develop the PRODIGY risk prediction tool, which assesses five patient characteristics (age > 60 in decades, male sex, sleep-disordered breathing, opioid naivety, and chronic heart failure) to determine whether a patient has low, intermediate, or high risk for OIRD.

The objective of this post-hoc analysis was to determine whether patients on room air (RA) experience more OIRD episodes compared to when receiving intermittent or continuous SO. Secondary objectives were to assess the type of OIRD episodes occurring in patients receiving intermittent or continuous SO or on RA, evaluate the association between OIRD episodes during intermittent or continuous SO or on RA as a function of the PRODIGY score, and finally, examine the frequency of OIRD episodes as a function of the time after the end of surgery.

This analysis included data from surgical patients enrolled at two United States sites.

### Case reports in respiratory care [^111zY2wp]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

The information in a case report should be viewed cautiously in terms of generalization beyond the reported example. Appropriately written and interpreted, however, a case report can be a valuable contribution to medical knowledge and educational for both author and reader. This article discusses the essential components of a case report, important issues of patient confidentiality, and how authorship should be determined.

- **Common pitfalls of case report writing**: Ten common pitfalls in case report writing include inexperience, insufficient documentation of the case, insufficient awareness of practice beyond one's own clinical setting, describing substandard care, illogical or unphysiological intervention, poor focus of presentation and discussion, inappropriate manuscript format, poor writing, ineffective illustrations, and poor use of references.

- **Strategies to improve case report writing**: The article presents ten specific ways to avoid or deal with these pitfalls, with the aim of increasing the likelihood that a prospective author's manuscript will be accepted for publication. These ways include seeking appropriate assistance with writing, documenting the case as thoroughly as possible, and carefully justifying any new technique or intervention.

Authors are urged to expend the time and effort required to prepare the manuscript properly, using the journal's guidelines and paying special attention to illustrations and references. It is also recommended to have the manuscript read by a local colleague before formal submission. After submission, authors should view the receipt of reviewers' comments and subsequent manuscript revision as necessary.

### Safety of benzodiazepines and opioids in very severe respiratory disease: National prospective study [^1175EPKa]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

During a median follow-up of 1.1 years (interquartile range 0.6–2.0 years), 138 (6%) patients withdrew from long-term oxygen therapy mainly because of improved oxygenation, and 1129 (50%) patients died.

- **Adjusted mortality estimates**: Benzodiazepines were associated with increased adjusted mortality (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.39). There was a trend of a dose relation between higher benzodiazepine doses and increased mortality (1.01, 1.00 to 1.03; P = 0.082) for each increment in dose of 0.1 defined daily dose/day.

- **Opioids dose-response association**: Opioids showed a linear dose-response association with increased mortality (hazard ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.03; P = 0.038) for each dose increment of 0.1 defined daily dose/day. Lower dose opioids (≤ 30 mg of oral morphine equivalents/day) were not associated with increased mortality (1.03, 0.84 to 1.26). Among opioid-naive patients with comorbid injury (n = 175), opioid treatment was not associated with increased mortality (0.93, 0.43 to 2.02).

- **High vs low dose treatments**: In a detailed analysis of adjusted risks for each dose level of benzodiazepines and opioids, high-dose treatments were associated with increased mortality, while lower dose treatments were not associated with increased risk of death.

- **Dose levels**: Categorized as none (untreated), low dose (≤ 0.3 defined daily dose/day), and high dose (> 0.3 defined daily dose/day).
