## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to find the coordinates of the point of tangency P where the line x + y = 9 touches an ellipse centered at the origin with foci on the x-axis and a focal distance of 4. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard form of the ellipse and what the focal distance implies for c and the relationship between a and b. Then, I should verify the tangency condition using the distance from the center to the tangent line and the ellipse's semi-axes. Next, I will solve for the point of tangency by intersecting the line with the ellipse and ensuring the discriminant is zero. Finally, I will check which option matches the computed coordinates and reconcile any discrepancies I notice along the way.

> Let me first confirm the ellipse parameters. With foci on the x-axis and center at the origin, the standard form is x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, and the focal distance 2c = 4 gives c = 2. I should also recall that c² = a² − b², so a² − b² = 4, which I will use shortly [^notfound].

> Now, I need to think about the tangency condition. For a line px + qy = r to be tangent to the ellipse x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, the condition is a²p² + b²q² = r². Here the line is x + y = 9, so p = 1, q = 1, r = 9, which means a²(1)² + b²(1)² = 9², so a² + b² = 81. Wait, let me verify that I am not mixing up the sign; yes, the formula is a²p² + b²q² = r², so a² + b² = 81 is correct [^notfound].

> I should now solve the system of equations. I have a² − b² = 4 and a² + b² = 81. Adding these gives 2a² = 85, so a² = 85/2 and b² = 81 − 85/2 = 77/2. Hold on, I should double-check the subtraction: 81 − 85/2 = 162/2 − 85/2 = 77/2, which is correct. Thus the ellipse equation is x²/(85/2) + y²/(77/2) = 1, or equivalently 2x²/85 + 2y²/77 = 1 [^notfound].

> Next, I will find the point of tangency by intersecting the line y = 9 − x with the ellipse and enforcing a single solution. Substituting y = 9 − x into the ellipse equation gives 2x²/85 + 2(9 − x)²/77 = 1. Let me expand and collect terms carefully: 2x²/85 + 2(81 − 18x + x²)/77 = 1, which becomes (2/85 + 2/77)x² − 36/77 x + 162/77 − 1 = 0. I should confirm the coefficients before proceeding; yes, that looks right [^notfound].

> For tangency, the discriminant must be zero. Let me compute the discriminant Δ = B² − 4AC, where A = 2/85 + 2/77, B = −36/77, and C = 162/77 − 1 = 85/77. So Δ = (−36/77)² − 4(2/85 + 2/77)(85/77) = 0. I will now solve for x using the quadratic formula with Δ = 0, which gives x = −B/(2A) = (36/77) / [2(2/85 + 2/77)]. Simplifying the denominator, 2(2/85 + 2/77) = 4(1/85 + 1/77) = 4(77 + 85)/(85×77) = 4(162)/(85×77), so x = (36/77) × (85×77)/(4×162) = (36×85)/(4×162) = (9×85)/162 = 765/162 = 85/18. Then y = 9 − x = 9 − 85/18 = (162 − 85)/18 = 77/18. So the point of tangency is (85/18, 77/18) [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the arithmetic because I initially thought 765/162 might simplify to 35/6, but that would be incorrect. 765 divided by 162 is indeed 85/18, not 35/6, so I should correct that mistaken simplification. The correct coordinates are (85/18, 77/18), which corresponds to option C [^notfound].

> I should confirm the answer against the choices. Option C is (85/18, 77/18), which matches our calculation. Options A, B, and D do not match, so the correct choice is C [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **(C) (85/18, 77/18)**.

---

The ellipse is centered at the origin with foci on the x-axis and a focal distance of 4, so **c = 2** and the standard form is (\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1) with (a^2 - b^2 = 4). The line (x + y = 9) is tangent to the ellipse, so substituting (y = 9 - x) into the ellipse equation yields a quadratic in (x) with a discriminant of zero. Solving this gives (a^2 = \\frac{85}{2}) and (b^2 = \\frac{77}{2}). The point of tangency is found by substituting these into the ellipse equation and solving the resulting system, yielding **(85/18, 77/18)**.

---

## Step 1: Determine the standard form of the ellipse

Given the ellipse is centered at the origin with foci on the x-axis, its standard form is:

[
\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
]

where (a > b > 0) and the focal distance is (2c = 4), so (c = 2). The relationship between (a), (b), and (c) is:

[
c^2 = a^2 - b^2 \\implies 4 = a^2 - b^2
]

---

## Step 2: Use the tangency condition

The line (x + y = 9) is tangent to the ellipse. Substitute (y = 9 - x) into the ellipse equation:

[
\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(9 - x)^2}{b^2} = 1
]

Multiply through by (a^2 b^2) to clear denominators:

[
b^2 x^2 + a^2 (9 - x)^2 = a^2 b^2
]

Expand and collect terms:

[
b^2 x^2 + a^2 (81–18x + x^2) = a^2 b^2
]

[
(b^2 + a^2) x^2–18a^2 x + 81a^2 - a^2 b^2 = 0
]

For tangency, the discriminant must be zero:

[
(-18a^2)^2–4(b^2 + a^2)(81a^2 - a^2 b^2) = 0
]

Simplify:

[
324a^4–4(b^2 + a^2)(81a^2 - a^2 b^2) = 0
]

Divide by (4a^2) (since (a \\neq 0)):

[
81a^2 - (b^2 + a^2)(81 - b^2) = 0
]

Expand and simplify:

[
81a^2–81b^2–81a^2 + b^4 + a^2 b^2 = 0
]

[
-81b^2 + b^4 + a^2 b^2 = 0
]

Factor out (b^2):

[
b^2 (b^2 + a^2–81) = 0
]

Since (b^2 \\neq 0), we have:

[
b^2 + a^2–81 = 0 \\implies a^2 + b^2 = 81
]

---

## Step 3: Solve for (a^2) and (b^2)

We now have the system:

[
\\begin{cases}
a^2 - b^2 = 4 \\
a^2 + b^2 = 81
\\end{cases}
]

Add the equations:

[
2a^2 = 85 \\implies a^2 = \\frac{85}{2}
]

Subtract the first from the second:

[
2b^2 = 77 \\implies b^2 = \\frac{77}{2}
]

---

## Step 4: Find the point of tangency

Substitute (a^2 = \\frac{85}{2}) and (b^2 = \\frac{77}{2}) back into the quadratic equation:

[
\\left(\\frac{77}{2} + \\frac{85}{2}\\right) x^2–18 \\cdot \\frac{85}{2} x + 81 \\cdot \\frac{85}{2} - \\frac{85}{2} \\cdot \\frac{77}{2} = 0
]

Simplify:

[
81x^2–765x + \\frac{6885}{4} - \\frac{6545}{4} = 0
]

[
81x^2–765x + \\frac{340}{4} = 0
]

[
81x^2–765x + 85 = 0
]

Solve for (x) using the quadratic formula:

[
x = \\frac{765 \\pm \\sqrt{765^2–4 \\cdot 81 \\cdot 85}}{2 \\cdot 81}
]

Since the discriminant is zero, we have:

[
x = \\frac{765}{162} = \\frac{85}{18}
]

Then, (y = 9 - x = 9 - \\frac{85}{18} = \\frac{162–85}{18} = \\frac{77}{18}).

---

The point of tangency is **(85/18, 77/18)**, which corresponds to option **C**.

Quantifying body orientation change to measure motion salience of neighbors

Previous research has revealed that the directional decisions of individuals in biological swarms are influenced by neighbors with salient movement changes –. However, the way individuals assess the salience of a neighbor's movements from the first-person visual perception remains not fully elucidated. Here, we introduce a direct observational visual cue, i.e. body orientation change (BOC) to measure the motion salience of neighbors from an individual's own view.

To quantify the BOC of neighbors, we first characterize each individual as a non-transparent ellipse with lengths of major axis a and minor axis b (Fig. 1 a), which suggests that neighbors near the focal individual may occlude neighbors that are further away (detailed approaches for identifying the occluded neighbor are presented in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 15). Then, we reconstruct the visual field of each elliptical individual by using the same computational method in Ref.(see Supplementary Note 4 for the detailed computation method). Specifically, the visual field of each individual is defined as the triangular region formed by connecting the focal fish's eye to two points where the rays emanating from its eye are tangent to the edges of each elliptical neighbor. For example, as shown in Fig. 1 a, the tangent points on the elliptical neighbor j observed from the focal individual's eye at times t − 1 and t are denoted as [p 1 = (x 1, y 1), p 2 = (x 2, y 2)] and [p 3 = (x 3, y 3), p 4 = (x 4, y 4)], respectively. As a result, the visual fields of individual i observing neighbor j at times t − 1 and t are the regions shaded in yellow and orange, respectively. Next, we calculate the distance between pairs of tangent points at times t − 1 and t, denoted as theand.

### Smart touchless palm sensing via palm adjustment and dynamic registration [^87365748]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Valley points detection

In this section, we detail the methodology for analyzing the optimized pathsto identify valley points between finger edges. We begin by ordering the paths according to their average y -coordinates, resulting in a sorted collection. To identify the valley points between two refined lines, we seek to find a pair of specific points, one on each line. A straight line drawn through these points should act as a common tangent to both paths, with all points on the two paths located on one side of this tangent line. This ensures consistent relational positioning of points, which is crucial for aligning ROI images across various palm samples.

For two pathsand, the objective is to find specific pointssuch that:where L is the line through, and f L (v) denotes the half-plane relative to line L in which point v resides.

Considering the variation of finger line segments n, we adopt different strategies to identify specific valley points: the valleys between the little and ring fingers, and between the index and middle fingers. For n = 2, the valley points of the palm are identified as. For n = 3, we identifyas the specific valley points. When n = 4, bothandare considered, with the decision based on comparing the Euclidean distances between adjacent points. Specifically, ifwe chooseas the valley points, where d e indicates the Euclidean distance between two points. Otherwise, are determined as the valley points. The final specific valley points are identified as p t 1 and p t 2, respectively, for further processing.

Coordinate system establishment

Figure 5b illustrates the establishment of the palm coordinate system, with its origin set at the midpoint between the specific valley points p t 1 and p t 2. Additionally, the figure shows the geometric relationship between these valley points and the aligned ROI. Based on, the four ROI corner points p r 1, p r 2, p r 3, p r 4 in the palm coordinate system are expressed as:where l r is the Euclidean distance between the valley points p t 1 and p t 2. In addition, t 1 and t 2 are predefined parameters set toand, respectively.

To transform these pointsfrom the palm coordinate system to the image coordinate system, we use the following equations:where (x, y) represents the coordinates in the palm coordinate system,… Using these transformation equations, we can determine the coordinates of the four ROI corners in the image coordinate system, thus aligning the ROI to a unified position.

### Exploiting the tunability of stimulated emission depletion microscopy for super-resolution imaging of nuclear structures [^27f75905]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The application of the method to simulated images of nuclear foci is shown on Fig. 1e–i. A series of n = 8 images was generated to simulate increasing STED power throughout the stack (Fig. 1e), from the confocal image F 1 (P STED = 0) to the one with the highest STED power and therefore the best spatial resolution (F 8, P STED = P max). To create such image stack, point-like objects were convolved with the theoretical PSF of a STED microscope described by Eq. (1), with STED intensity I w varying from 0 in the first frame to I max in the last frame. The corresponding phasor spreads away from the origin, highlighting the heterogeneity of the introduced depletion dynamics (Fig. 1f, see for comparison Supplementary Fig. 2 showing the phasor plot of a series of images acquired at constant STED power). Separating the fluorescence emission contribution from the center of the PSF (P in) from the one originating from the periphery (P out) using the SPLIT algorithm (Fig. 1h) gives rise to an image F in of improved resolution (hereafter referred to as the SPLIT image), when compared with F 8. Fitting the line profiles in Fig. 1i with a multi-peak Gaussian function (not shown), we estimate the respective full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of these particular features to be ~130 and ~114 nm for the STED image F 8 and ~97 and ~88 nm for the SPLIT image. This represents an improvement in resolution in this particular simulation of around 30 nm. Note that while in ref.the intrinsic fluorescence decay of the fluorophore (measured in the nanosecond timescale) was used as means to separate in and out originated photons, here the same goal is achieved by analyzing STED images of varying resolution. For any given pixel (x, y), the fractions of the intensity corresponding to the center and the periphery of the PSF are obtained from the distance between the phasor measured in that pixel, P (x, y), and the phasors P out and P in, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3a). It is worth noting that, even though a phasor position is always described in polar coordinates by a modulation M and a phase ϕ (Supplementary Fig. 3b), in this simulation only the former is encoding significant spatial information visible in the modulation image M (x, y) (Fig. 1g). As expected, M (x, y) presents minima at the center of the foci, and higher values towards their periphery. Note also that the SPLIT algorithm can be used to improve the spatial resolution of any of the STED images available in the stack. For instance, one can generate the SPLIT image using a sum of the images of the stack (Supplementary Fig. 4).

### Engineering phase and polarization singularity sheets [^555d0017]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Engineered polarization singularity sheet

The process for engineering 2D phase-singularity sheets is also directly applicable to engineering 2D polarization singularity sheets. A detailed review of the connection between phase and polarization singularities is provided by Ruchi et al. Polarization singularities can take multiple forms, but here we focus on C -point singularities in which the polarization azimuth Ψ (in a paraxial field, with negligible E z contribution) is singular. Ψ is the angle that the major axis of the polarization ellipse makes with the transverse x -direction (Supplementary Fig. 10). Together with the ellipticity angle θ, which determines the eccentricity and handedness of the ellipse, the pair (Ψ, θ) parameterizes the space of fully polarized light. To deploy phase gradient maximization, we need to identify a complex scalar field σ such that arg(σ) ∝ Ψ. This complex field will exhibit the same geometries in Fig. 1. Maximizing the phase gradient of σ then maximizes the azimuth gradient and produces polarization singularities. One such field is σ = | E x | 2 − | E y | 2 + 2 i ·Re(E x E y *) for which arg(σ) = 2Ψ. This can be written as σ = s 1 + is 2 using the Stokes polarization parameters, which comprise four experimentally measurable intensities that parametrize the full space of polarized (and partially polarized) light. They are defined in Eqs. (4)–(7) using the left-handed convention.where I j refers to the intensity of the polarization component projected in the j direction. For fully polarized light, s 0 2 = s 1 2 + s 2 2 + s 3 2, which allows all polarization states to be assigned a unique point on a sphere in (s 1, s 2, s 3) space — the Poincaré sphere (Supplementary Fig. 10). Lines of constant Ψ are longitudes on the sphere. Just as globe longitudes intersect at the poles so that the longitudinal coordinate is undefined there, Ψ is singular at the Poincaré sphere poles at which circularly polarized light resides. There, s 1 and s 2 go to zero, in analogy to the vanishing of the real and imaginary parts of a scalar complex field at a phase singularity. It is noteworthy, however, that the overall field intensity at the polarization singularity can be non-zero, because s 3 may not vanish.

Visualizing a self-similar propagating ellipse

Figure 5a shows the geometry of an ellipse under the assumptions described above. The R (t) of the ellipse apex (the point of the ellipse farthest from the Sun along the ellipse central direction) is given by DBM. In this section, we derive equations for the ellipse semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b as a function of R (t), the inverse aspect ratio f and the half width λ. We use f = b/a rather than a r = a/b because it simplifies the following calculation. The equations

follow from the definition of f and the definition of angle β, which is the angle between the semi-major axis a and the normal to the tangent at point T (Fig. 5a). The location of T is the point of tangency on the ellipse for a line originating at the Sun. It can be easily seen that β = λ by checking the sum of the angles of the small orange triangle in Fig. 5a in relation to a larger triangle (not highlighted) containing the angles λ and η. The polar angle of the ellipse θ is given by a relationship from general ellipse geometry between β and θ. It is important to emphasize that we further construct the ellipse based on this particular value of θ, for which a line with distance r connects the ellipse center C to point T. Combining equation (2) gives a relationship for the polar angle θ based on known parameters,

From the law of sines on the large orange-shaded triangle in Fig. 5a we derive:

Angle α follows from the angles of the orange-shaded triangle, and distance r from the definition of an ellipse in polar coordinates:

The last equation can be rewritten with the definition of f as

Introducing α from equation (5) and the last equation for r into equation (4) then eliminates the unknowns (α, r) and expresses b in function of known variables:

Equations (7) are the final description of the ellipse parameters. The minor axis b of the ellipse depends on all known variables (R (t), f, λ) through θ and ω, from equations (3) and (6). The major axis a then simply follows from the definition of f in equations (2). The heliocentric distance of the centre of the ellipse is parameter c (Fig. 5b), closing the model equations necessary for visualizing the ellipse.

### Effect of corrective exercise on static balance, food consumption, and body composition in the early period after bariatric surgery [^19c3051d]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Static Balance Measurement

The objective of the static balance test is to measure changes in the position of the center of gravity over time. For this purpose, static balance performance was assessed using the isokinetic balance measurement platform (PROKIN 252, Tecnobody, Bergamo, Italy). The tests were conducted with participants standing barefoot, both with eyes-open and eyes-closed. The position of the feet was determined to be equidistant from the origin point, using the lines on the platform's X and Y axes as references. Participants were instructed to focus their gaze on a fixed point marked at a distance of 1 m in front of them. The arms were placed adjacent to the body, while a brief resting period of approximately 40 s was allowed between test measurements, each spanning 30 s. Each measurement was repeated twice, and the average values of the results were calculated. The assessment of static balance was performed based on data including the average center of pressure in the x-axis (average C.O.P.X) in millimeters, the average center of pressure in the y-axis (average C.O.P.Y) in millimeters, lateral sway speed (medium-lateral speed) in millimeters per second, forward–backward sway speed (average forward–backward speed) in millimeters per second, perimeter used (perimeter-P) in millimeters, and the area used (ellipse area) in square millimeters. This data was utilized to derive the static balance score for each participant. Static balance measurements were taken by an expert physiotherapist who is a researcher at the Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Center of a hospital.

### Accurate localization microscopy by intrinsic aberration calibration [^6597d8f7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Results and discussion

Overview of method

Whereas localization precision requires signal photons, localization accuracy requires microscope calibration. Random arrays of subresolution particles enable characterization of the point spread function and registration of localization data from different wavelengths. Regular arrays of subresolution apertures allow calibration of magnification and distortion, and other aberration effects on localization. Random arrays of molecular nanostructures provide reference positions to determine local magnification. However, no study has completely calibrated a localization microscope. We approach this closer than before by integrating information from two types of emitter arrays. We image fluorescent microparticles and subresolution apertures through focus (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1) and fit bivariate Gaussian models to the images, where x p is the position of a pixel in the x direction, y p is the position of a pixel in the y direction, A is the amplitude, x ′ is the apparent position of an emitter in the x direction, y ′ is the apparent position of an emitter in the y direction, w x is the standard deviation in the x direction, w y is the standard deviation in the y direction, ρ is the correlation coefficient between the x and y directions, and B is a constant background. The image shapes, dependences on field position, and purposes of the two types of emitters all differ. Particle arrays enable calibration of image shape for axial tracking of experimental particles, and aperture arrays enable calibration of magnification and distortion for conversion of units from pixels to nanometers. The apparent lateral positions and image shapes of both types of emitters vary with axial position. The emitters sample the field at discrete locations. At each location, continuous functions in one dimension model the axial dependences of apparent lateral position and image shape. For widefield calibration, continuous functions in two dimensions model the lateral dependence of apparent lateral position and image shape (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2).

### Rapid response of fly populations to gene dosage across development and generations [^08d5402c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Bicoid concentration

Bicoid intensities were acquired from anti-Bicoid staining by extracting the average nuclear intensity for ten nuclei at the anterior pole for each embryo, as per Dubuis et al.

Tll profiles

The intensity profiles were extracted from a rectangular region of 3–4 cells' height along the A-P axis from max-projected confocal images, normalized to peak intensities. The dorsal-ventral position was determined using the border of sna expression.

Nuclei counts

The number of nuclei along the A-P axis was counted along the sna border independently by two experimenters (X.C.L and L.G.), on one Z-slice where eve and sna were in focus. In the posterior region where sna is not expressed, we counted the nuclei along the extension line of the sna border all the way until the posterior end (excluding the pole cells). The counts from the two experimenters were not significantly different. Numbers from the two experimenters were averaged for each embryo. Particularly, the total number of nuclei (left panel in Fig. S4c) were averaged across two measurements by X.C.L. and one measurement by L.G, whereas the nuclei in the most anterior and most posterior regions (middle and right panels in Fig. S4c) were only counted once by each experimenter.

Nuclei distance

While counting the nuclei (see above), we marked the center of each nucleus and extracted their x-y coordinates in ImageJ, in order to calculate the 2D-distance between neighboring nuclei along the A-P axis: where x 1 and x 2 represent the x coordinates of two neighboring nuclei and y 1 and y 2 represent the y coordinates of them. The average inter-nucleus distance was calculated using all nuclei counted along the A-P axis and across two experimenters' measurements for each embryo (Fig. S4d). Additionally, we plotted the inter-nucleus distance (D) as a function of the nucleus position (x 2) along the A-P axis (Fig. S4e), which showed that the difference between F4 and F8 embryos was mainly in the anterior and middle regions of the embryos.

### Controlling light in complex media beyond the acoustic diffraction-limit using the acousto-optic transmission matrix [^62dff92e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

AOTM using two ultrasound beams

The first singular vector of a single AOTM (Figs. 1–2) allows focusing only at a single point located at the center of the ultrasonic focus. Given the large number of measurements required for such focusing, this forms a limitation for the use of this approach for applications such as imaging. However, as was recently shown by Judkewitz et al. in their TROVE work, a joint analysis of several matrices of acousto-optically modulated output modes, measured for different ultrasound foci positions, can allow focus scanning. Here, we apply the same mathematical approach to jointly decompose multiple AOTMs measured for two different ultrasound focus position. Specifically, we exploit the joint analysis of two AOTMs to perform a scan of a tight optical focus over multiple positions. For this purpose, we consider the separate measurement of two AOTMs, T 1 and T 2, using two different ultrasound focused beam that are spatially shifted such that the two ultrasound focal spots, P 1 (x, y) and P 2 (x, y), partially overlap (Fig. 3 a–d). Such ultrasound focal spots are easily obtained in the same experimental setup presented in Fig. 2 by changing the time-delay, Δτ = z/v US, between the ultrasound pulse and the optical pulses (Fig. 3a), where z denotes the axial distance of the acoustic focal spot from the ultrasound transducer, and v US is the speed of sound in the medium. Injecting the first singular vector of T 1 or T 2 would only form a tight optical focus at the center of each of the two ultrasound foci. However, the joint information in the two matrices can be exploited to scan even a sharper focus along the axis connecting the centers of the two acoustic foci (Fig 3i–k).

### Spatial attention selectively alters visual cortical representation during target anticipation [^b6b17f76]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Von Mises fitting procedure

To quantify the 2D visualizations of attentional activity, we reduced the images to one spatial dimension, polar angle, constructing attentional tuning curves as a function of polar angle. For these analyses, we included the vertices whose preferred eccentricity was between 4° and 8° (close to the 6° eccentricity of the Gabor targets) and GLM variance explained was higher than 5%. For each of the target locations, we binned vertices by their polar angle distance from the target in 20° steps from −180° to 180°. Within each bin, we computed the attentional modulation as focal minus distributed response, averaging across the 49 mapping stimuli per vertex, and across vertices within the bin. The bin centers were computed as the average polar angle distance between the target location and the vertices' pRF centers. These calculations produce one attentional tuning curve per target location for each visual area and each participant. Because the tuning curves did not differ systematically across the target locations, we averaged the four tuning curves per visual field map, and fit the averaged tuning curve with a difference of two von Mises functions, using the following equation using MATLAB's besseli function:where S is a scalar, is an offset, is the Von Mises center (assumed to be the same for the positive and negative von Mises), andandare the concentrations of the two von Mises functions. These five parameters were fit for each visual field map in each participant by nonlinear least squares using MATLAB's fit function. We defined the spread of attention in degrees of visual angle as the distance at which the difference of von Mises functions intercept the x -axis, meaning the transition point from attentional enhancement (focal > distributed) to attentional suppression (distributed > focal). To define the x -intercepts on either side of the center, we solved fortwice, atandlower and upper limits for the solution space. Lastly, we calculated the distance of two x-intercepts from each other to quantify the width along the x-axis.

### Descent trajectory reconstruction and landing site positioning of chang' E-4 on the lunar farside [^ee06b86c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Descent trajectory from LCAM images

The sequence images obtained by the LCAM in vertical attitude after the attitude adjusting phase of CE-4 were used for the reconstruction of the landing trajectory in this study.

According to the reconstructed trajectory, CE-4 adopted a vertical descent approach to gradually approach the landing zone after the attitude adjusting phase with an altitude of 5635 m and a velocity of ~85 m/s. During the period of descending to an altitude of 4130 m above the lunar surface, the trajectory moved 77 m to the north and crossed a crater with a diameter of approximately 200 m. CE-4 reached over area A, as indicated in Fig. 1, with a velocity of ~78 m/s. Over area A, CE-4 decreased from 4130 m from the lunar surface to 1495 m, the velocity decreased to ~51 m/s, and the trajectory was adjusted from the northeast; there are some craters with diameters of ~70–100 m to the northwest, where is more flat (Fig. 1d, e). Then, the trajectory moved 244 m to the northwest from the altitude of 1495 m to 99 m and the velocity decreased to 0 m/s. CE-4 reached over area B in Fig. 1 and entered the hover and hazard-avoidance phase.

### Spatial and temporal variability of rotational, focal, and irregular activity: practical implications for mapping of atrial fibrillation [^7d65e050]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Method for AcQTrack pattern quantification. A static map is generated (A) quantifying all pattern occurrences at every vertex of the chamber anatomy. Each occurrence is identified in space and time as a single disc allowing calculation of the total number of occurrences, the percentage time they are present, and the proportion of the chamber surface area affected. See also Figure S3

A cut off threshold is then applied to exclude outlying data and identify the localized region with the most repetitive pattern occurrences. The number of occurrences in each region and the proportion of time that they are present are known. These factors are used to determine the optimum threshold as outlined in Figure 4. The initial static map displays all occurrences with no cut off applied (zero on the X axis i.e. every occurrence is counted). The percentage of the recording time with the relevant pattern is shown on the Y axis. As the cut off is increased along the X axis (i.e. only regions with increasing numbers of occurrences are included), the proportion of time these are present decreases. A threshold is applied relative to the total time pattern occurrences are present. In the example in Figure 4, (for LIA) with no cut off, LIA was present for 85% of the mapping duration. Increases in the threshold resulted in a reduction in the percentage of time that LIA was present. A 10% threshold excludes LIA to the point at which only regions with LIA present for 75% of the recording duration are counted, which corresponds to more than six occurrences over the duration of the recording. Similarly, a threshold that corresponds to a 30% relative reduction from the initial maximum duration identifies the region with only the highest number of occurrences. Where discs representing a detection are overlapping at any time point (potentially representing a meandering central pivot or rotation point) these are counted as a single pattern detection. Once a cut off is applied, only occurrences with the geometric center of the "disc" within the specified zone are included for quantification and any occurrence detected within 5 ms of a preceding occurrence in the same location is excluded to avoid double counting.

### Multifocal imaging for precise, label-free tracking of fast biological processes in 3D [^b2b1b157]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For a circle of radius R centered at r c = (x c, y c), the circle equationcan be rewritten as, where. With the coordinates of the pixel given, we can fit the transformed circle equation linearly to calculate the parameters x c, y c, and b. The linear fit is constructed into the matrix formwhere, andis the weight matrix defined by the square of the pixel intensity.is the approximate solution of this overdetermined equation, which can be calculated with the least-squares principle. Finally, the circle radius R can be determined using the equation:

If the quality of the fit r 2 > 0.8, the radius was used to infer the z -position. If the fit to the radial profile did not match the criterion in more than two planes, the bead was excluded from analysis, and no z -position was determined. The z -position was determined for each remaining bead as follows. In each focal plane, a difference function of the determined bead radius and the plane's calibrated relationship between bead radius and z -position was determined. Each difference function shows two minima, which represent the two most probable z -positions (one located above and another below the focal plane). Finally, the position of the bead was unequivocally determined from the multiple measures of the z -positions across different planes: the combination of z -positions from the different planes with the lowest standard deviation was selected. For each z -position, the precision was predicted based on the calibrated relationship of z -position and fit width. The z -position with lowest precision value was selected as the final bead's z -position.

Images of immobilized beads at different heights set by a piezo-driven objective were used for calibration of z -positions. Radius profiles across z of seven different beads were aligned by minimizing the least-mean-square between all the planes. Finally, aligned profiles were averaged and smoothed. This resulted in a radius function R (z). To estimate the precision error σ z resulting from inferring the z -position of beads using this function, we used error propagation of the inverse function: where σ R is the standard deviation of the calibration for different beads.

Individual bead coordinates on each frame were connected to form tracks using custom-made software written in MATLAB. The software searched for the nearest particle across frames within a distance of less than 1.5 µm.

Consequently, the 2D-edge and vertex detection, as shown in Fig. 4e, g, can be performed by further processing of the obtained orthogonal 1D-edge information. Firstly, based on the linearity of Fourier transform, the edge information on the x - and y -axes can be registered simultaneously by superimposing their corresponding transfer functions in spatial Fourier domain. Hence, 2D-edge detectioncan be achieved by the superposition operation on electric field profiles of Huygens' metasurface along orthogonal axes, as:

Secondly, by extracting the common parts of x - and y -directions edge data that coexist at the same positions, vertex detectioncan be implemented through the multiplication on 1D-edge detection Huygens' metasurface profiles along x -axis and y-axis, as:

### Differential topographic organization and retinal inheritance of direction and orientation selectivity in the visual thalamus [^34b8b19d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Optic axis measurements

Angular eye orientations of anesthetized mice were obtained as previously described byand others. In short, a LED-girdled camera (Dino-Lite Edge) was mounted on a two-axis gimbal (azimuth and elevation, Luigs & Neumann, Ratingen, Germany), and its rotation center was manually adjusted to the pupil by minimizing pupil slippage within the frame (Supplementary Fig. 11). A series of photos taken at different angles were annotated (Fiji) to locate the [X, Y] coordinates of the pupil center as well as the center of the LED-ring corneal reflection (indicating the intersection between the optic axis of the camera and the cornea). Next, horizontal and vertical eye positions were computed as, where CR is the position of the corneal reflection, P the position of the pupil center and R p is the pupil's rotation radius. R p was estimated as, whereis the known angle traversed by the camera (< 30°), separating coordinate pairs 1 and 2.

Assessment of binocular field

To calculate the borders of each eye's field of view, we assumed a field of view of 180° per eye. We calculated the binocular border based on the optic axis position obtained by our measurements (−73.63 ± 5.5° azimuth, 36.7 ± 0.7° elevation, mean ± SD, n = 4 mice) and displayed the range of mean ± SD as a shaded area in Fig. 2g, h.

Transformation to retinal coordinates

To transform coordinates of the visual world (e.g. screen outlines, receptive fields of recorded units) to retinal coordinates for Supplementary Fig. 5, we assumed a point-symmetric mirroring around the optic axis (achieving a 'flipping' of the image through the lens). Points in the world had the same coordinates in azimuth and elevation in a modeled 3D retina. To calculate their coordinates on a flattened retina, we transformed their coordinates from a 3D retina into polar coordinates (with the angle theta defining nasal, dorsal, temporal or ventral). We calculated each point's distance to the optic disc in a 3D curved retina using the Haversine formula, and plotted them at the same distance in a 2D flattened polar plot.

### Accurate localization microscopy by intrinsic aberration calibration [^bf8f784f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Localization accuracy throughout the focal volume

To estimate the accuracy of widefield calibration, we take the values from the local calibration functions, andas the true values. The error at the location of each calibration particle is the residual of the fit of a Zernike model to these values, or, for interpolant models, the value of the interpolant after removal of the calibration particle. For a Zernike model, the errors (Fig. 5) shrink toward the corners of a square field (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12) due to the rapid fluctuation of Zernike polynomials of high order near the periphery of the fitting domain. This corner effect potentially embeds errors in the calibration function, such as interpolation does, and results in a significant deviation of error histograms from normality, with a mean excess kurtosis of 0.66 ± 0.15. Errors from interpolation do not have this trend (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). However, our experimental particles are within a circular subset of the field (Figs. 1 and 6), resulting in error histograms that are closer to normal, with a mean excess kurtosis of 0.34 ± 0.17. These results suggest optimizing accuracy by calibrating an imaging field that encircles the sample by an increasing number of Zernike polynomials.

### Simultaneous orientation and 3D localization microscopy with a vortex point spread function [^d40bbcfd]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fitting molecular dipole orientations using the standard in-focus PSF is difficult because of its symmetries. The PSF is almost rotationally symmetric for all polar angles except around θ = 90 ∘, where there is a slight asymmetry of the PSF as the spot is wider in one direction than the other. The azimuthal precision, quantified by the CRLB, is indeed worse for all polar angles except near θ = 90 ∘ (Fig. 1e). Furthermore, the standard PSF is also symmetric around the polar angles θ = 0 ∘ and θ = 90 ∘ yielding an unfavorable precision in estimating the polar angle around these angles (Fig. 1f). These symmetries are broken by the Vortex PSF, resulting in a good precision over all possible orientations (Fig. 1e, f). Of course, the precision of the azimuthal angle is still expected to diverge to infinity for polar angles approaching θ = 0 ∘ and θ = 180 ∘ as the azimuthal angle is undefined when the dipole is aligned along the optical axis. Note that due to the symmetry of the dipole it is sufficient to use half the unit sphere to uniquely define the dipole angle.

Simulated precision and accuracy

We have tested the vectorial Vortex PSF model with extensive simulations to predict the experimental conditions under which the Vortex PSF can be used to correctly estimate the parameters Θ = (x, y, z, N, b, ϕ, θ, g 2) (see Supplementary Note 1 for a detailed description of the model). The parameters are as follows: x, y, z are the emitter coordinates, N the number of signal photons, b the number of background photons per pixel, and orientation parameters ϕ, θ, g 2 as described earlier (Fig. 1a). We found that all model parameters can be estimated with precision at the CRLB for all molecular orientations and degrees of orientational constraint (Supplementary Fig. 1), provided the signal-to-background ratio (SBR = N / b) is sufficiently high. A practical lower limit, assuming 10 background photons per pixel (typical for SMLM), is around SBR ≥ 200 (Supplementary Fig. 2). At higher signal photon counts the required SBR is less stringent, for example with 4000 signal photons an SBR ≥ 40 (b ≤ 100) is sufficient.

The slope is negative due to the opposing definition of z piezo and the sample z. c The cross-section in x − z and d y − z of a Vortex PSF, with the measurement left and fit right (pixels are stretched proportionally in z, color bar units: photons per pixel). The estimated signal photon counts were in the range 4 × 10 3 −50 × 10 3, and the estimated background photon counts were in the range 10−40 photons per pixel. All scale bars are 500 nm.

The estimated z -position shift between frames of the molecule in Fig. 2a isnm, which matches the piezo shifts of 100 nm. The relationship between the estimated z -position and the piezo position averaged over 37 molecules is fitted with a linear function, resulting in a slope of −0.99 ± 0.01 and has a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 16 nm over a 1200 nm range as shown in Fig. 2b. To further show the quality of fit, cross-sections in the x − z and y − z planes are shown in Fig. 2c, d. The agreement between the experimental data and fit with the vectorial Vortex PSF model is generally excellent. A striking detail is that even the fringe details away from focus match well. The lateral localization error, measured on individual z -slices between the two estimation modes, is 5 nm and 4 nm (RMSE) in the x and y direction. These validation experiments show that the orientation of fixed dipole emitters and their 3D position can be reliably estimated from individual focal-slice Vortex PSF images.

### Architecture of a mammalian glomerular domain revealed by novel volume electroporation using nanoengineered microelectrodes [^52a602f4]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Total cell count analysis: Cell markers were counted and basic statistics calculated. Euclidean distances (Matlab command "pdist2") from somata to the center of the glomerulus were determined per experiment, and plotted as a histogram including SDs, to investigate the distribution of cells. Based on these data, percentage-wise radial distance borders were derived. Subsequently, each cell was attributed to its layer identity and the distance distribution was again calculated. The "layer identity" of each cell is the subregion of the MOB in which the soma is located. We defined four different subregions in our analysis: (1) GL, which is the layer comprising the olfactory glomeruli and the surrounding, tightly packed bands of cells; (2) outer EPL, which is the superficial quarter of the EPL, where cells should be separated by at least the diameter of one cell from the GL (approx. 10–15 µm); (3) inner EPL, which is the inner three quarters of the EPL, where cells should be separated by at least the diameter of one cell from the MCL (approx. 20–25 µm); and (4) MCL, which is the band of cells between the EPL and the IPL.

Transformation operation: To investigate and compare exact spatial positions between animals, a transformation operation was performed, transforming the glomerular architecture of individual experiments to one common coordinate system (Supplementary Fig. 13): First, a landmark mesh of 9 × 9 points was placed at the GL-EPL-border with its center point located in the midplane of the glomerulus on the Y -axis. The points were spaced by 30 µm in the X - and Z -directions. Additionally, the cranial pole of the glomerulus was marked. By using principal component analysis (Matlab command "princomp"), a plane was fitted to the landmark mesh and the normal passing through the origin was determined. This straight line was set as the new Y -axis by rotating the coordinate system around the X - and Z -axes. Finally, the coordinate system was rotated around the Y -axis so that the cranial pole could be preserved.

Although the exact anatomical orientation is not maintained in the transformed space because of slightly different transformation operations in each experiment, the main axes can still roughly be related to the main anatomical axes as follows: X -axis corresponds to the posterior-to-anterior direction, Y -axis to the lateral-to-medial direction and Z -axis to the dorsal-to-ventral direction.

### In situ single-shot diffractive fluence mapping for X-ray free-electron laser pulses [^fecead05]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Schematic evolution of our grating design from regular gratings. The images show the real-space structures a – c and respective diffraction pattern d – f. a A regular grating diffracts incoming light to two symmetric points in Fourier-space d and hence reveals no spatial information on the illumination function. b A two-by-two segmented grating yields two symmetric sets of four diffraction spots e. The intensity of each spot is proportional to the illumination of the corresponding sample quadrant. This constitutes the most basic form of a spatially resolving beam profile monitor based on an integrated grating. c A grating with suitably varying period and orientation forms a magnified image of its own illumination in Fourier-space f. The colors in the real-space images indicate the local grating period and mark the corresponding points in the diffraction images

We start with the following sinusoidal transmission function for a regular grating:Here, ξ and η are spatial coordinates in the sample plane, while p and φ are the grating period and orientation angle, respectively. They are given by the position (x, y, z det) of the grating's first diffraction order in the detector plane:

We turn φ and p into functions of the sample coordinates by setting

When inserted into Eq. (1), the result is a grating, the pitch and orientation of which varies continuously and that diffracts an image of its own illumination function, magnified by the dimensionless parameter m and centered at (x 0, y 0), to the detector. We note that the thereby obtained structures constitute segments of Fresnel zone plates (Supplementary Note 1).

Since Eqs (2) and (3) relate to far-field diffraction, the mapping is only valid if the detector is sufficiently far away from the sample to be in the Fraunhofer regime. Specifically, this requireswhere w 0 is the beam's waist size on the sample.

In simulations with Gaussian beams, we observe that the following condition must simultaneously be satisfied:

This relation enforces that the illumination does not change drastically within a small number of grating periods, which would lead to errors in the diffracted fluence maps (see Supplementary Notes 1 and 2 for a detailed discussion).

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^8ec71b12]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

There are geometric implications of using sequential Bayesian inference as coordinates for n -dimensional decision trajectories (Fig. 1 a, b). Although the decision trajectories have n probability-coordinates, P n, they are constrained such that ∑ i P i (t) = 1; therefore, the decision trajectories populate (n − 1)D simplices. For example, 2AFC decision dynamics are represented as a particle constrained to have P 0 (t) + P 1 (t) = 1, which is the 1D line P 1 = 1 − P 0 on a 2D (P 0, P 1) plot of the beliefs. It follows that 3AFC dynamics take place on a 2D plane (Fig. 1 a) and 4AFC dynamics in a 3D tetrahedron (Fig. 1 b) and so forth. Note that if any hypothesis has zero probability P i (t) = 0, then the space in which the decision trajectory evolves collapses to the remaining non-zero directions. For example, each face of the 4-choice tetrahedron in Fig. 1 b is a combination of three choices with non-zero probabilities and each edge a combination of two such choices.

As a result, decision boundaries are (n − 2)-dimensional objects in n -dimensional probability space. So for n > 2 choices, boundaries can have spatial dependence with respect to the decision space visualized in Fig. 1 a, b. For 2AFC tasks, decision boundaries are points on a 2D line, which are simply the transformed boundaries (equation 2) of the standard two-choice integration-to-threshold model. Likewise, for 3AFC, the decision boundaries are lines on a plane (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) and for 4AFC are planes within a tetrahedron (Fig. 1 a, dark gray planes). The example boundaries shown are flat with a constant decision threshold in each dimension. An interesting consequence is that high-dimensional boundaries can have a nonlinear structure as a function of the n -dimensional beliefs P. Then, the linear 3AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 a, dashed lines) generalize to curves and the planar 4AFC boundaries (Fig. 1 b, dark gray planes) generalize to curved surfaces.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^34973bae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Comparison between analytical model and simulations

Importantly, Eq. (1) describing the probability of branch orientation attains a steady-state solution (∂ t P st (ψ, t) = 0) that is largely independent of the form of the external field, i.e. it applies generically to different geometries after defining the relative branch alignment with respect to the external field. This solution predicts that the alignment of angles with respect to the polarity of the external field will be determined by the von Mises distribution (circular normal distribution):with a concentration parameter given by ν ≡ μ f c / D, and I 0 (ν) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. The fluctuations in the angular alignment as determined by the variance will thus follow a universal scaling approximately given by σ 2 ∝ D / μ f c that underlines the relative contribution of the local noise to the external guidance. For an axial (linear) field parallel to the horizontal axis, for instance, the above solution applies to the distribution of the local angles φ of the branch segments (Fig. 1 d). In a radial external field emerging from a central point of origin, however, the alignment of a branch is determined by the angle difference ψ ≡ φ − θ between its local angle φ and its angle θ with respect to the origin of the external field, and thus ψ, rather than φ, is predicted to follow the von Mises distribution (see Supplementary Figs. 4–9 for the alignment angles for different model assumptions). Comparing these analytical criteria with the numerical simulations led to excellent agreement without using any fit parameter (Fig. 1 d–f).

To summarize, the combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations allows us to make a number of predictions for different topological and geometrical properties of branched structures: A key signature of external guidance is that branching angles should conform to a von Mises distribution while the overall branching structure in an axial field can adopt a well-defined conical domain in the absence of defined boundaries. Furthermore, a signature of the stochastic nature of branching and annihilating random walks is that even with external guidance, the local branch length or overall network size and shape should be highly variable to random branching events and local density-driven termination of tip growth.

### Compact light field photography towards versatile three-dimensional vision [^299f264f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Flash LiDAR coordinate transformation

With the camera being the origin (assuming roughly confocal illumination and detection), the flash LiDAR produces distance measurements in a polar coordinate, not the direct z components. The radial distance along different imaging pixels needs to be transformed into a rectilinear coordinate for correct 3D modeling. Given the camera's intrinsic matrix K and the homogeneous pixel coordinate [u, v, 1], each pixel's projection angle with respect to the camera's optical axis can be derived aswhere the absolute position of a point object is denoted as [x, y, z] in the rectilinear coordinate system. The LiDAR measurement distance r is related to the rectilinear coordinate asCombing Eqs. (6) and (7), the absolute 3D position in the rectilinear coordinate is obtained as

Time-gain compensation of flash LiDAR signal

Unlike conventional scanning-based LiDAR that employs collimated laser illumination, the diverging light in flash LiDAR has a r 2 intensity decay, which makes distant objects to receive (and reflect) much fewer photons. We employed a time-gain compensation (t−d) 2 to partially equalize the signal intensity for objects positioned at a distance larger than d but shorter than d 2, after which the signals are too noisy for non-reflective objects. A customized compensation curve could also be used for the best visualization of the 3D scene, a common practice in medical ultrasound imaging.

NLOS geometric calibration

The absolute 3D coordinates of the relay surface in NLOS imaging are measured via flash LiDAR in real-time. To extract the laser spot position on the wall and to cope with different walls in field applications that will modify the laser position thereon, the fixed propagation line of the laser is characterized in the absolute 3D space. The laser illumination spot on the surface is then dynamically calculated by intersecting the propagation line with the relay wall's 3D point cloud. To parameterize the propagation line, two thin microscopic slides are placed along the collimated beam path, with the tiny Fresnel reflection from the slides encoding two points that the laser passed through. The absolute positions of the two points are then measured using the LiDAR technique.

### Simultaneous orientation and 3D localization microscopy with a vortex point spread function [^dc733469]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For dipole emitters orientated uniformly on unit sphere with g 2 = 0.75 and SBR = 4000/10 the parameters can be estimated with a localization precision of σ x y = 5.6 nm, σ z = 27 nm and orientation precision of σ ϕ = 5.5 ∘, σ θ = 3.1 ∘, and(Supplementary Fig. 1). The polar precision appears almost constant over the unit sphere, whereas the azimuth precision performs well within polar angles (20 ∘ < θ < 160 ∘) after diverging for emitters oriented along the optical axis. Such polar range is notably broader than the standard PSF, as shown in Fig. 1e. The amount of rotational diffusion of an emitter affects the possible orientational and axial precision while it does not affect the lateral precision. The orientation can be estimated to a precision within σ θ < σ ϕ < 10 ∘ given a rotational diffusion g 2 > 0.4 (< 58 ∘ cone half-angle). Outside this range the PSF becomes too smeared out, and the orientation information is mostly lost. The optimal axial performance is for fixed emitters σ z = 23 nm (g 2 = 1), whereas it worsens for freely rotating emitters up to σ z = 49 nm (g 2 = 0). In this case, when the emitters are freely rotating, the Vortex PSF has a slightly worse lateral precision compared to a non-engineered PSF (σ x y = 5.9 nm versus σ x y = 4.5 nm). Generally the estimation for all parameters works well over a z -range of ± 300 nm with a region of interest (ROI) of 15 × 15 pixels around an emitter with a pixel size of 65 nm (Supplementary Fig. 1). This relatively small ROI is ideal for dense single-molecule localization microscopy and attains a reliable parameter estimate for ∣ z ∣ ≤ 300 nm. In Supplementary Fig. 3 we compare the performance to standard defocus-based orientation fitting over a z -range of ± 1000 nm in simulation. The ROI size for this comparison is increased to 31 × 31 pixels. These simulations show that the precision with the Vortex PSF is better than with the standard PSF for z, ϕ, and g 2 around focus ∣ z ∣ ≤ 300 nm and the polar angle (θ) is better in an even wider region ∣ z ∣ ≤ 600 nm. Outside this region the performance is equivalent. With the fluorophores in an aqueous medium (n = 1.333) the difference is less pronounced as the spherical aberrations from the refractive index mismatch break the symmetry around focus but the Vortex PSF still performs better for ∣ z ∣ ≤ 300 nm. In these refractive index mismatched conditions the usable z -range with the Vortex PSF is about twice the range for standard defocused orientation fitting.

### Super-wide-field two-photon imaging with a micro-optical device moving in post-objective space [^e9786d7c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

To estimate the optical properties when imaging through the device, we measured the excitation point spread function of 0.5 µm fluorescent microbeads with two galvanometer scanners. The distance between the bottom surface of the mirror holder and the bottom surface of the coverslip for the glass window (d m–c) was set at 1.15 mm, and the distance between the bottom surface of the glass window and the focal plane, which corresponded to the imaging depth from the cortical surface in vivo (z), was 200 μm (Fig. 2a). With θ set to 0°, the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the fluorescent microbeads at the center of the FOV was 1.26 ± 0.03 µm laterally for the X -axis direction, 0.88 ± 0.07 µm laterally for the Y -axis direction, and 9.96 ± 0.12 µm axially (mean ± s.d. n = 5; Fig. 2b–d). These values are comparable to those obtained in other studies using an ultra-large-sized objective and two gradient-index (GRIN) lenses. The lateral FWHMs were slightly (about 0.4 µm or less) different between the X -axis and Y -axis, and depended on the rotation angle of the mirrors (Fig. 2d). This was consistent with the elliptic shape of the laser beam passing through the rectangular mirrors and the ratio of the major axis length to the minor axis length of the mirrors (4.0/2.5 = 1.6) (Supplementary Fig. 2d). However, the means of the lateral and axial FWHMs along the major and minor axes were similar across any angle (Fig. 2d). This result indicates that the rectangular mirror shape does not have large effects on the imaging of neuronal soma with a diameter of 10–15 µm. The FWHMs within a FOV showed degradation of ~20% from the center to the edge (500 µm from the center; Fig. 2e–g). The fluorescent intensity at the edge of the FOV was ~30% weaker than that at the center (Fig. 2h). These properties were similar when the mirrors were rotated at 45° (Supplementary Fig. 3).

### Dimension-agnostic and granularity-based spatially variable gene identification using BSP [^210a59e5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

BSP accurately and robustly identifies SVGs in 3D simulations

We extended the simulation framework in Trendsceek and SPARK further to demonstrate the power of BSP on 3D transcriptomic data. We compared the detection accuracy of SVGs using BSP with that of SPARK-X. The spatial patterns were constructed by a set of center points generated from a random walk with a fixed step length, and any spots within a certain distance from any of the center points were included as the marked cells. We created three continuous 3D patterns, namely, curved stick (Pattern I), thin plate (Pattern II), and irregular lump (Pattern III), controlled by different directions of random walks, as shown in Fig. 4A.

A Continuous 3D spatial patterns I-III are controlled by the direction of random walks. Left: Pattern I (curved stick): the movements of random walk are monotonic in two directions (x- and z- coordinates, or y- and z-coordinates). Middle: Pattern II (thin plate): the movements of the random walk are monotonic in one direction (z-coordinates). Right: Pattern III (irregular lump): the movements of the random walk are non-monotonic in any direction. B Power comparison of the different methods under varied pattern sizes. Power charts show the averaged true positive rates (y-axis) across ten replicates against the false discovery rates (x-axis) for the detected SVGs using each method. Simulations were performed using fixed moderate pattern sizes, moderate signal strength, moderate noise level, and three spatial expression patterns I-III (left to right). All simulations were generated based on the seqFISH data with ten segments (z-coordinate) and 225 spots of cells on each piece (x- and y-coordinates). Each simulation replicate contains 1,000 SVGs and 9,000 non-SVGs. C Power comparisons between 3D SRT and meta-analysis on 2D slices.

### Drawings of real-world scenes during free recall reveal detailed object and spatial information in memory [^9ab4eef9]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Memories are spatially accurate

Although participants are able to recall many objects from the images with few additional objects, perhaps they remembered the set of objects within an image, but not the spatial layout. To assess the spatial precision of the memory drawings, we asked AMT workers (N = 5 participants per object, 4216 overall) to indicate the locations and size of each drawn object by creating an ellipse encircling each one. We compared the centroids and sizes of the ellipses across conditions with the true centroids and sizes in the original images calculated from ellipses around the object outlines (Fig. 4a).

Fig. 4
Comparison of object location and size across conditions. a Top — the mean X and Y distance between object centroids of the different drawing conditions (Delayed Recall, Immediate Recall, Image Drawing) and object centroids in the original image. Object centroids were determined from ellipses placed around each drawn object by AMT workers. The y -axes represent the distance as the proportion of the x -direction (or y -direction) pixel distance between centroids and the image pixel width (or height). Bottom — the mean ellipsis width and height differences between objects in each drawing condition and the objects in the original images. Y axis values represent width and height differences as a proportion of image width and height, respectively. Each dot represents each of the 60 images used in the experiments, and lines connect the same image across conditions. Significance in Wilcoxon rank-sum tests between conditions is indicated with horizontal lines at the top (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.0167). b Example maps of the average ellipse encompassing the most commonly drawn objects in four of the images. Solid ellipses indicate the average object location in the Delayed Recall drawings, whereas dashed ellipses indicate the average object location in the Image Drawings. Participants in both conditions drew objects in the correct locations and at the right sizes; e.g. in the bathroom, putting the mirror in the upper left, the cabinet in the upper middle, the shower on the right, and the sink on the bottom left. This shows that participants drawing from memory had spatially accurate memory representations, drawing objects in the correct places and correct sizes from objects they had seen in images 11-min earlier

### Simultaneous orientation and 3D localization microscopy with a vortex point spread function [^da9739a1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The length of the supercoiled DNA molecule estimated from localizations is 12.6 ± 0.4 μm (Supplementary Table 2). Compared to the crystallographic length the estimated length is 10% shorter, which may be attributed to the intertwining of the DNA molecule as the straight line projection is an underestimate of the actual DNA molecule length. The ratio between localization density on the coiled section and the individual strands before crossover is 1.94 ± 0.15 (Supplementary Table 2). This doubling of the localization density confirms there are two DNA strands in the coiled section. A significant change in the binding affinity in either of the sections could indicate a change in DNA conformation. In future, it will be of interest to carry out a systematic study on many more plectonemes.

Lastly the orientation of supercoiled sections before and after the plectoneme appear to have opposing orientation shifts. The peak relative orientation in the region to the top right of a plectoneme is Δ ϕ = 111 ∘, θ = 36 ∘ and to the bottom right is Δ ϕ = −102 ∘, θ = 29 ∘, with the full distribution of all 3 sections of a plectoneme shown in Supplementary Fig. 16. These two orientations appear shifted in opposite directions and are not 180 degree rotation symmetric which would be expected from a non-supercoiled strand.

Aside from the discernible plectoneme shape in the lateral localizations, there is further evidence of a difference between the supercoiled DNA and non-coiled λ -DNA. One difference is the change in the preferential binding orientations between the two datasets. Another is the apparent periodicity in localizations of certain orientations along the supercoiled DNA sections. Interestingly the periodicity of these localizations is on the same size scale as the expected superhelix pitch.

### Accuracy of a CT-ultrasound fusion imaging guidance system used for hepatic percutaneous procedures [^10b6e6c2]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the accuracy of a fusion imaging guidance system using ultrasound (US) and computerized tomography (CT) as a real-time imaging modality for the positioning of a 22-gauge needle in the liver.

Materials and Methods

The spatial coordinates of 23 spinal needles placed at the border of hepatic tumors before radiofrequency thermal ablation were determined in 23 patients. Needles were inserted up to the border of the tumor with the use of CT-US fusion imaging. A control CT scan was carried out to compare real (x, y, z) and virtual (x', y', z') coordinates of the tip of the needle (D for distal) and of a point on the needle located 3 cm proximally to the tip (P for proximal).

Results

The mean Euclidian distances were 8.5 ± 4.7 mm and 10.5 ± 5.3 mm for D and P, respectively. The absolute value of mean differences of the 3 coordinates (|x' - x|, |y' - y|, and |z' - z|) were 4.06 ± 0.9, 4.21 ± 0.84, and 4.89 ± 0.89 mm for D and 3.96 ± 0.60, 4.41 ± 0.86, and 7.66 ± 1.27 mm for P. X = |x' - x| and Y = |y' - y| coordinates were < 7 mm with a probability close to 1. Z = |z' - z| coordinate was not considered to be larger nor smaller than 7 mm (probability > 7 mm close to 50%).

Conclusions

Positioning errors with the use of US-CT fusion imaging used in this study are not negligible for the insertion of a 22-gauge needle in the liver. Physicians must be aware of such possible errors to adapt the treatment when used for thermal ablation.

### Location of the zygomaticofacial foramen related to malar reduction [^67fd5ac6]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to elucidate zygomatico-facial foramen (ZFF) relating to malar reduction surgery. Fifty-five dry skulls of adult Koreans were studied. A total of 100 (90.9%) ZFF were observed in 110 skulls. ZFF was variably more than one: one in 56 specimens (50.9%), 2 in 33 (30%), 3 in 10 (9%), and 4 in one (0.9%). ZFF was located 7.3 mm lateral and 3.7 mm inferior to P point, which was defined as crossing a line along the upper border of the zygomatic arch and a vertical line on the lateral orbital rim. The distance from the zygomatic suture to ZFF was 24.4 mm on average. ZFF was located 7.61 mm from the closest orbital rim. ZFF was located 13.0 mm from the nearest zygomatic angle (the junction of the zygomatic arch and lateral orbital rim). Most ZFF were within an ellipse of 15 mm in the major axis and 5 mm in the minor axis. The ellipse was 5 mm from P point. Our data suggest the osteotomy line in malar reduction should be placed at least 10 mm lateral to the lateral orbital rim.

### Accurate localization microscopy by intrinsic aberration calibration [^1c3a83e7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Axial dependence of aberration effects

We emphasize a critical result that is fundamentally problematic for super-resolution. Intrinsic aberrations affect apparent lateral positions, causing systematic errors that depend on axial position (Fig. 2a). These errors approach the imaging resolution, rendering much smaller values of localization precision potentially meaningless or even misleading. To achieve lateral localization accuracy that is truly superior to the imaging resolution, both axial localization and complete calibration of the field dependences are potentially necessary. Fortunately, intrinsic aberrations also encode axial information into emitter images, providing a latent capability for axial localization.

Effects of intrinsic aberrations on apparent lateral position and particle image shape.

These data are from a representative calibration particle at a representative location in the imaging field. a Scatter plot showing apparent lateral position as a function of actual axial position. White data markers indicate the actual lateral position, which we define at the axial position of best focus z f. Uncertainties are smaller than the data markers. b – f Plots showing the dependence on axial position of the parameters (b), (c), (d) A, (e) ρ, and (f), whereis the amplitude after normalization to its value in the image for which ρ = ρ 0, with ρ 0 set to the minimum value of | ρ |.

Residual values indicate an uncertainty for each parameter. Values in the bottom panels are uncertainties of (b - c) apparent lateral positionandfrom the polynomial models, and (e – f) z positionfrom inversion of the polynomial models.

In the fitting routine potential outliers and poor localizations are filtered out as follows. The number of iterations in the MLE is terminated if the relative difference between successive log-likelihood values in the iteration drops below 10 −6 or if the maximum number of iterations, which is set to 30, is reached. Typically fitting converges within 20 iterations, events are rejected if the maximum number is reached without convergence. Moreover, when the estimated molecule position is more than 3 pixels away from the center pixel in the ROI, it is rejected. Finally, converged localizations are tested with a normalized chi-squared (χ 2) test. If a localization has a χ 2 value outside the region 0.75 ≤ χ 2 ≤ 3, it is also rejected. Additional filtering is specified where used.

The resulting localizations are corrected for sample drift following the method of Schnitzbauer et al. implemented in the Picasso software (v0.2.8), available at. The slow timescale lateral drift for the λ -DNA experiments was on the order of 1.5 pixels (~100 nm) over 30 min. Additionally a fine drift correction is applied to this dataset, utilizing straight λ -DNA sections and minimizing the deviations from a spline fit to the DNA axis over time. Supplementary Figure 19 shows that these deviations of two different strands with the same orientation are correlated and can be used to improve the drift correction. For this dataset 27 strands of varying orientations are analyzed and the Δ r deviations are projected into x and y deviations. These x and y deviations are then averaged with a weighting prioritizing good localization precision and a high number of localizations to generate the fine drift trajectory. This reduces the residual drift from a standard deviation of 7.6 nm (Supplementary Fig. 19a) to 3.7 nm (Supplementary Fig. 19b). Subsequently localizations of the same emitter during the emitter's on-time are linked under the condition that the position and orientation estimate between subsequent localizations is less than 3 times the largest uncertainty as shown in Supplementary Fig. 10.

White arrows indicate the locations of the ten 0D singularities. a Numerically simulated xz cut for the ideal metasurface.

The axial displacement arises due to the experimental illumination wavelength of 760.9 nm being slightly longer than the target wavelength of 760 nm. e Experimental transverse (xy) intensity profiles at each of the singularity positions (bright hollow annulus surrounding the 0D singularity) and in-between the singularity positions (focused spot). The longitudinal cuts in (b, c) are obtained by stacking 1201 such transverse images.

We observe that the experimental intensity is about a factor of four times smaller than the numerically predicted intensity. This is due to our intensity normalization choice and diffractive losses from the breaking of the ideal periodic boundary condition that underlies our metasurface library. We underestimate the field intensity by measuring the transmitted field power profile after it passes through the microscope objective and tube lens, thereby incorporating the reflective losses from multiple interfaces. We also overestimate the incident power by neglecting power loss due to Fresnel reflections off the fused silica-air interface.

### Approaches to enhancing radiation safety in cardiovascular imaging: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^785b08f7]. Circulation (2014). Medium credibility.

Fluoroscopic radiation dose metrics and substantial radiation dose levels — The key dose metrics in fluoroscopy are total air kerma at the reference point (K a, r) and air kerma area product (P KA). K a, r represents the x-ray energy delivered to the air at a defined distance from the x-ray tube's focal spot but "does not account for gantry motion" and "is used as a predictor of the risk of threshold-dependent deterministic skin effects but is not a direct measure of peak skin dose". Air kerma area product is "the cumulative sum of the product of instantaneous air kerma and x-ray field area" and "is used to calculate estimates for patient cancer risk… and scatter reaching the staff", and "fluoroscopy time alone is not a useful descriptor of radiation dose". Per FDA regulations, systems manufactured since 2006 display both metrics. Substantial radiation dose level thresholds are: K a, r 5 Gy; P KA 500 Gy cm^2 for a 100 cm^2 field at the skin; and fluoroscopy time 60 min. The substantial radiation dose level "is intended to trigger patient follow-up", and "Patients receiving substantial exposures should be appropriately counseled before discharge" and "All available exposure data should be recorded in the medical record".

(B) The discriminative component of the model. The original image is transformed into a DoG filter bank, an example single element/z-plane of the bank is shown in (4). For each individual nuclei, a discriminative function is created by discretizing the points along equidistant rays extending out from the center of the nuclei (6). A generalized linear model is then fit to model the normalized decay of the DoG image as shown in (8). The y -axis is the normalized DoG value, and the x -axis is the normalized distance from the center of the nucleus (blue/red lines are the x/y plane and z plane, respectively). By the use of a series of transformations, a probability distribution (9) can be used to calculate a 0−1 probability on the existence of any point with a specific shape and location configuration.

For z values ranging from 2 µm above best focus to 2 µm below best focus, Zernike polynomials result in better accuracy than interpolation for both the square and circular fields (Fig. 5d–f), with minimum root-mean-square errors of 1.4 nm for x, 1.6 nm for y, and 62 nm for z. These values are the second of two main components of uncertainty in our study. We report uncertainties for widefield calibration as root-mean-square errors to include any non-zero mean value of error. This calibration reduces the systematic errors in lateral position (Figs. 2b–c and 4d–f) by a factor of two orders of magnitude, to within a root-mean-square error ranging from 1 nm to 5 nm (Fig. 5d–e). For all three widefield calibration models, axial localization errors are smaller above best focus than below best focus (Fig. 5f). Zernike polynomials model such field dependences, providing insight into the localization accuracy that is latent in intrinsic aberrations throughout a deep and ultrawide field, and demonstrating the utility of our method to characterize optimal ranges of the focal volume.

### Acoustophoretic system for seed separation on conveyor belts [^ba18e764]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In order to test the robustness of the system to latency, a single capsicum pepper seed was placed on the end of a static conveyor belt. Placement on the raised conveyor rather than a flat surface, increases the time the particle spends falling, thus increasing the differentiation in change of horizontal ejection distances. Focal points were then created for 10 ms with the maximum ejection pressure (~ 7 kPa), with varying offsets to the object's center in the direction of the ejection axis (X -axis). If we have poor latency in our system, our focal points will lag behind the particle to be ejected, and if we over compensate, it will track in front of the particle. We varied the offset from −10 to +10 mm, approximately the size of the FWHM value of the focal point, to test how location of the focal point against the seed affects ejection distance.

As shown in Fig. 4 c, it was found that when the offset was in front of the center of mass of the particle by 2 mm or more, ejection failed to occur. This is due to the focal point passing beyond the particle's edge. When the focal point is offset increasingly behind the particle's center, the ejection distance initially rises until the focal point aligns with the particle's edge. After this, ejection distance decreases almost linearly, finally failing to eject when 10 mm in front of the particle. Again, this is expected due to the size of the focal point. Error bars in this plot represent the spread of ejection distances recorded over 5 trials for each offset value.

Knowing these distances, we find that the system's sensitivity to latency depends on conveyor speed. At the slowest speed of 1 cm/s used in our experiments, an assumed 100 ms latency would result in a position error of about 1 mm, causing a 20 mm (16.7%) reduction in ejection distance. Whilst this value is not small, it is not thought to have impacted our experiments greatly. At the fastest conveyor speed of 15 cm/s, a 100 ms latency would likely result in frequent ejection failures, emphasizing the importance of maintaining low and consistent latency for high-throughput systems.

### Selective depiction of susceptibility transitions using laplace-filtered phase maps [^f6b33573]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

In this work, we aim to demonstrate the ability of Laplace-filtered three-dimensional (3D) phase maps to selectively depict the susceptibility transitions in an object. To realize this goal, it is first shown that both the Laplace derivative of the z component of the static magnetic field in an object and the Laplacian of the corresponding phase distribution may be expected to be zero in regions of constant or linearly varying susceptibility and to be nonzero when there is an abrupt change in susceptibility, for instance, at a single point, a ridge, an interface, an edge or a boundary. Next, a method is presented by which the Laplace derivative of a 3D phase map can be directly extracted from the complex data, without the need for phase unwrapping or subtraction of a reference image. The validity of this approach and of the theory behind it is subsequently demonstrated by simulations and phantom experiments with exactly known susceptibility distributions. Finally, the potential of the Laplace derivative analysis is illustrated by simulations with a Shepp-Logan digital brain phantom and experiments with a gel phantom containing positive and negative focal susceptibility deviations.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic examination in adults: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^d4e3c4d0]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiography transducer beam focus — The focus should be set at the depth of the structure of interest; narrower widths yield better lateral resolution, and while a single focus is typically used to keep frame rates high and improve temporal resolution, using multiple focal zones may decrease the frame rate; in cases in which the apex needs evaluation, moving the focus to the apex may increase resolution.

### Monolithic focused reference beam X-ray holography [^387f6f9f]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Fourier transform holography is a highly efficient and robust imaging method, suitable for single-shot imaging at coherent X-ray sources. In its common implementation, the image contrast is limited by the reference signal generated by a small pinhole aperture. Increased pinhole diameters improve the signal, whereas the resolution is diminished. Here we report a new concept to decouple the spatial resolution from the image contrast by employing a Fresnel zone plate to provide the reference beam. Superimposed on-axis images of distinct foci are separated with a novel algorithm. Our method is insensitive to mechanical drift or vibrations and allows for long integration times common at low-flux facilities like high harmonic generation sources. The application of monolithic focused reference beams improves the efficiency of high-resolution X-ray Fourier transform holography beyond all present approaches and paves the path towards sub-10nm single-shot X-ray imaging.

### Current and evolving echocardiographic techniques for the quantitative evaluation of cardiac mechanics: ASE / EAE consensus statement on methodology and indications endorsed by the Japanese society of echocardiography [^3abdf36d]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Two-dimensional (2D) STE image acquisition — Frame rates of 40 to 80 frames/sec have been used in applications involving normal heart rates, and higher frame rates are advisable to avoid undersampling in tachycardia; the focus should be positioned at an intermediate depth, sector depth and width should be adjusted to include as little as possible outside the region of interest, and artifacts resembling speckle patterns should be avoided. For software that process single beats, data sampling should start ≈100 msec before the peak R wave of the first QRS complex and end 200 msec after the last QRS to allow correct identification of the QRS complex, because failure may result in erroneous drift compensation; apical foreshortening seriously affects 2D STE and should therefore be minimized, and short-axis cuts of the left ventricle should be circular shaped to assess deformation in the anatomically correct circumferential and radial directions.

### Simultaneous orientation and 3D localization microscopy with a vortex point spread function [^89df7dea]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To demonstrate the ability to resolve the lateral structure independent of defocus we use an intentionally tilted λ -DNA sample. This sample is shown in Fig. 4e, where the estimated z position reveals the slope of the tilted λ -DNA sample. Comparison of the slope of the tilted and non-tilted data set (Supplementary Fig. 9) accurately retrieves the additional tilt of 0.42 ∘ (0. 4 ∘ applied). The z localizations have a variation of 64 nm FWHM around the plane of the cover slip which is to be expected from a meanof 25 nm. Figure 4f shows color-coding with the degree of orientational constraint g 2 that can be used to identify patches where binding to partially detached DNA strands and/or non-specific binding occurs. These are visible with a comparably free dipole value g 2 = 0.3, as opposed to the nearly fixed dipole value g 2 = 0.8 of the DNA strands. The achieved precision from these experiments, determined from repeated localizations of multiple on-events from the same emitter (Supplementary Fig. 10), is 5.4 nm and 29.7 nm in the lateral and axial dimension, and the azimuth and polar angle precision are 6.0 ∘ and 3.9 ∘ with an orientational constraint precision of 0.06. The localization and orientation precision values determined in this way are within the estimated error bars of the CRLB, with the photon distribution showing a median signal of 4600 photons and a median background of 10 photons per pixel (Supplementary Fig. 10).

### Endorectal MRI assessment of local relapse after surgery for prostate cancer: a model to define treatment field guidelines for adjuvant radiotherapy in patients at high risk for local failure [^8352ac6c]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the role of endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in defining local relapse after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer to help to reassess the clinical target volume (CTV) for adjuvant postprostatectomy radiotherapy.

Methods and Materials

Sixty patients undergoing an endorectal MRI before salvage radiotherapy were selected. Spatial coordinates of the relapses were assessed using two reference points: the inferior border of the pubic symphysis (point 1) and the urethro-vesical anastomosis (point 2). Every lesion on MRI was delineated on the planning computed tomography and center of mass coordinates were plotted in two separate diagrams (along the x, y, and z axes) with the urethro-vesical anastomosis as the coordinate origin. An "ideal" CTV was constructed, centered at a point defined by the mathematical means of each of the three coordinates with dimensions defined as twice 2 standard deviations in each of the three axes. The dosimetric impact of the new CTV definition was evaluated in six adjuvantly treated patients.

Results

The ideal CTV center of mass was located at coordinates 0 (x), -5 (y), and -3 (z) mm with SDs of 6 (x), 6 (y), and 9 (z) mm, respectively. The CTV size was 24 (x) x 24 (y) x 36 (z) mm. Significant rectal sparing was observed with the new CTV.

Conclusions

A CTV with an approximately cylindrical shape (approximately 4 x 3 cm) centered 5 mm posterior and 3 mm inferior to the urethro-vesical anastomosis was defined. Such CTV may reduce the irradiation of normal nontarget tissue in the pelvis potentially improving treatment tolerance.

The multiplicity of a conformal mapping.

Metasurface geometries in a, b the virtual space (u-v frame) and in c, d the real space (x – y frame). The relation between these two spaces is governed by the transformation in Eq. (1), and its contour plot containing the isolines of real and imaginary parts of z is shown by the light-gray solid lines in a, b. The filled orange circles and triangle markers in a, b, and e denote theandsingularities of the mapping, respectively. The solid orange lines in a and b denote the branch cut of the mapping, terminating at theandsingularities. All the magenta and black solid lines in a, b correspond to the boundary of the metasurface with the same colors shown in c, d, showing the multiplicity of the mapping. To further demonstrate such multiplicity, four points along the black line of the slab in a, b with coordinates (u, v) = (1, − π), (1, − π /2), (1, 0), and (1, π /2) are highlighted by the open stars, circles, triangles, and squares, and their equivalent points are shown by the same markers in c, d and in the eccentric cylinder of the virtual space in b. The values of a 0 are 0 in a and c, and 0.1 in b and d. Other geometric parameters are Λ = 30 π nm, w 0 = 1.5, u 0 = 1, and d = 0.5. e The left panel illustrates the geometries of the plasmonic metasurfaces in the virtual space for a complex a 0 = δ exp(i θ). The two solid lines show the trajectories of the ln(0) singularities as θ varies from − π to π, for two values of δ = 0.1 (green) and δ = 0.03 (purple). Along the solid green line, we depict the eccentric cylinders with different values of θ, and their corresponding metasurfaces in the real space are shown in the right panel. The orange dashed lines highlight the metasurfaces when δ = 0.

Scale bars are a 10 μm, e 5 μm, and f 1 μm. These experiments were repeated with similar results (N > 10).

PSF fitting methods are sensitive to knowing the experimental parameters (like NA, refractive index etc.) and the Vortex PSF is no exception. The influence of variations of aberrations across the FOV has been investigated and mitigated by creating an aberration map for our microscope (see discussion in section 2.2 and Methods). Spherical aberration can, however, vary easily from sample to sample depending on the refractive index, thickness of the cover slip, and the setting of the correction collar. Pushing the biases of our method to levels below the precision requires caution when using catalogue values. E.g. using the catalogue value for the refractive index of the cover slip (n = 1.523) leads to a bias of 8.1 nm between localizations with θ < π /2 and θ > π /2 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Using an optimized cover slip refractive index of n = 1.5209 this bias is reduced to just 0.8 nm. Without the fine drift correction and optimized refractive index setting the FWHM of localizations of a λ -DNA strand would be 35 nm. Furthermore if the calibrated field-dependent aberrations were not taken into account in the fitting model, the localization distribution would become non-Gaussian with a λ -DNA line-width that is even twice broader (73 nm FWHM, see Supplementary Fig. 8).

### Internal carotid artery in endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery [^a3764887]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The transsphenoidal approach to the pituitary is widely used in pituitary surgery. Even though there are some landmarks for internal carotid artery (ICA) on the wall of the sphenoid sinus, it is not rare to get the artery injured during surgery. We found that the most important landmark, carotid prominence, matched with ICA in merely 37.5% of subjects. In order to find a simple method to locate the artery, we made an anatomical measurement of the ICA and placed the results in a 3-dimensional coordinate system. The sphenoid sinus opening is both the center of the endoscope entry in the anterior sinus wall and the origin of the coordinate system containing 3 orthogonal axes: x, y, and z. The x axis follows the body of the endoscope(out of the sphenoid sinus) parallel to the sagittal plane while z is perpendicular to the sagittal plane. Most of the measurements were obtained in the initial operative plane, which is perpendicular to the sagittal plane and contains the sinus opening and the midpoint of the pituitary fossa. We calculated the coordinates of the midpoint of the pituitary fossa and 4 ICA-related points. The depth of an ICA and the distance between 2 ICAs are also helpful in locating ICA. According to our operation method, all the projective points of the medial edge of ICA on the posterior wall of the sphenoid sinus are lateral to the sphenoid sinus opening, and operating within 0–25 degrees medial to the endoscope body is believed to be safe from ICA injury.

### Relative position of the central hole after EVO-ICL implantation for moderate to high myopia [^f85eb178]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
The red line and circle is shown for the central hole of the EVO-ICL, the purple line and circle is shown for the pupil center, and the blue line and circle is the corneal center of the right eye. Visio image analysis software was used for image analysis

In this study, we set the C C of the fitted corneal image as the reference point (0,0) and the position of C H and C P as (X, Y) using the following formula: D = (X 2 + Y 2) 1/2 and calculated the relative distances from the center hole to the corneal center, D(H-C); the pupil center to the corneal center, D(P-C); and the center hole to the pupil center D(H-P) (Fig. 2). According to the equation: actual distance Ð = relative distance D * WTW (mm)/relative horizontal diameter of the cornea (mm), the actual distances of Ð(H-C), Ð(P-C) and Ð(H-P) were calculated respectively. In all images, the X-axis value of the left eye was converted to a negative value, which was converted to the same nasal and temporal direction as the right eye. The X-axis (ÐHx and ÐPx) and the Y-axis (ÐHy and ÐPy) on Ð(H-C) and Ð(P-C) are shown in Fig. 2. The X-axis (ÐHPx) and the Y-axis (ÐHPy) on Ð(H-P) were defined as the X-axis and the Y-axis of the vector of Ð(H-P).

Kappa angle

Pupil offset was used as the estimate of the Kappa angle and defined as the vector between the corneal vertex and the pupil center in the corneal plane. Pupil offset was measured using Pentacam. The x-offset (K-x) and y-offset (K-y) of the vector were recorded respectively. A positive value is defined as the pupil center nasal to the pachy apex (x-offset) and as the pupil center upper to the pachy apex (y-offset).

### Architecture of a mammalian glomerular domain revealed by novel volume electroporation using nanoengineered microelectrodes [^1400d367]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Cell cluster analysis of MCLPNs

Upon completion of the transformation operation, the center-of-mass (or "common midpoint") was determined by calculating means of the three spatial coordinates. Euclidean distances from MCLPNs to the common midpoint were determined as well as distances in each of the three spatial dimensions, including mean values and SDs. The same distances were then calculated for each experiment and these individual MCL midpoints were separately and consequently compared to the common midpoint. Since MCLPNs were essentially localized on a plane parallel to the X – Z plane, the cellular density was assessed on a maximum Y projection, first counting the cell somata in bins of 20 × 20 µm along the X - and Z -axis. For smoothing, a 4 × 4 sliding frame average was performed calculating the mean of the centered bin.

After separation of MCs and dTCs (see below), the same calculations were performed for each of the two subsets separately. The only difference was that the binned cell count (bin size 50 × 50 µm) was not followed by a smoothing operation because of the low number of cells. Here, only discrete numbers were determined and plotted.

Morphologic reconstruction of cells

Manual and semi-automated tracing of cellular processes of MCs, dTCs, mTCs, and sTCs was achieved using the Filament Editor of the Amira software (Visage Imaging GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Detected nodes, vertices, segments and lines were exported to Matlab for further analysis. To ensure that lateral dendrites were indeed correctly identified in continuity and attributed to their respective somatic origin, we performed an independent second back-tracing from the periphery to the soma in 15 randomly chosen dendrites from 3 of our 5 experiments (i.e. 45 dendrites in total), in which complete agreement with the first tracing was achieved (Supplementary Fig. 14).

### Influence of anterior capsulorhexis shape, centration, size, and location on intraocular lens position: finite element model [^a68ff1cf]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Centered Elliptic Rhexis

Tilting ranged in the 10 −3 to 10 −5 degrees and decentering between 10 −7 and 10 −4 mm, whereas anteroposterior shifting ranged between 10 −1 and 10 −3 mm compared with the reference IOL position.

Mean IOL tilting along the z - and x -axes of all decentered rhexis (any diameter, both circular and elliptic) was significantly greater than that of centered rhexis (P < .01); mean IOL decentering also was higher for decentered rhexis compared with centered ones (P < .05). Anteroposterior shifting and rotation did not show a significant difference among centered and decentered rhexis.

Peak stress values along the z -axis where the haptics contact the capsular bag (90 to 270 degree angle position) were significantly higher for the 4 by 2.0 mm ellipsis compared with all others (Figure 4; P < .05). Capsular bag stress along the z -axis was significantly higher than that along the x -axis for all considered ellipses (P < .001 for all comparisons). Stress at the rhexis edge was significantly lower for all ellipses shaped and orientations except for the 4 by 2.0 mm along the z -axis (P < .05) compared with the stress at the capsular bag equator.

Figure 4.
3D drawing of capsular bag von Mises stress for centered elliptic rhexis: (A) 6 by 4.0 mm along the z -axis; (B) 7 by 4.0 mm along the z -axis; (C) 6 by 4.0 mm along the x -axis; and (D) 7 by 4.0 mm along the x -axis.

Rhexis edge stress at 90 to 270 degree angle positions showed significant variation at 90 to 270 degree angle positions (P < .001 in all cases) among ellipses with the major axis along the z -axis, whereas elliptic rhexis with their major axis along the x -axis showed a significant stress increase at the rhexis edge at 0 to 180 degrees as the major axis increased (Supplement Figure 8). Stress values 180 degrees apart did not show a significant difference (P ∼ 1 in all cases) regardless of the rhexis diameter, witnessing axial stress symmetry.

The primary orientation analyzed in further subfigures is highlighted with the black region. Each bin spans 5 ° in the polar direction and 10 ° in the azimuthal direction, additionally there is a 30 ° coarse grid. c Azimuthal orientation of dipoles on a plectoneme (rotated 90 degrees clockwise to fit figure, scale bar 1 μm). Other plectonemes show similar orientations as seen in Supplementary Figs. 13, 14 and in an additional sample. d Localizations in different angular subsets from the plectoneme highlighted in c, showing periodic clusters of localizations. e Localizations from d arranged in 6.5 nm bins along the x -direction compared to a torsionally relaxed DNA molecule. f Autocorrelation of localizations along the plectoneme in 6.5 nm bins. The equidistant arrows mark periodic peaks in the autocorrelation function, indicating a periodicity of ~150 nm.

Orientation estimation of intercalated emitters with the Vortex PSF reveals various interesting properties of supercoiled DNA structures. Firstly the primary dipole orientation is different compared to the λ -DNA case where no additional torsion was applied. Figure 6b shows the orientation distribution of a supercoiled strand before it twists around itself. The highlighted peak around Δ ϕ = 298 ∘ and θ = 32 ∘ (equivalent to Δ ϕ = 118 ∘ and θ = 148 ∘) occurs on various strands. A 180 ∘ rotationally symmetric population also occurs on other DNA strands that are presumably oriented in the opposite direction with a peak around Δ ϕ = 118 ∘ and θ = 32 ∘ (data not shown). This different azimuthal orientation found in the supercoiled DNA sample could be due to the different surface attachment protocol. This could change the physical space or electrostatic potential around the intercalator and DNA molecule.

### American Thyroid Association guide to investigating thyroid hormone economy and action in rodent and cell models [^dde23543]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Mouse thyroid high-frequency ultrasonography (HFUS) — technical parameters, anesthesia, and quantification — uses a Vevo 770 system with a single element probe of center frequency of 40 MHz; the transducer has an active face of 3 mm with lateral resolution 68.2 μm and axial resolution 38.5 μm, focal length 6 mm, mechanical index 0.14, and dynamic range 52 dB, with an alternative 30 MHz probe (focal depth 12.7 mm; lateral 115 μm; axial 55 μm). HFUS is performed under general anesthesia using 1.5%-2% isoflurane, real-time imaging can be performed at a frame rate of 20 Hz (temporal resolution 50 milliseconds), and studies can be completed in about 20 minutes. Thyroid lobe volume is calculated by the oval formula (width x depth x length x π/6); adult C57BL/6 thyroid volume ranges between 2.81 and 4.9 μL, increases to volumes that range between 4.1 and 8.8 μL with diffuse goiter, and the smallest detectable nodule diameter is 0.46 mm; features suggestive of malignancy include hypoechogenicity, poorly defined margins, internal microcalcification, irregular shapes, and extraglandular extension.

### Evidence for alterations in fixational eye movements in glaucoma [^3819c4b1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fixation changes in glaucoma are generally overlooked, as they are not strikingly evident as in macular diseases. Fundus perimetry might give additional insights into this aspect, along with traditional perimetric measures. In this work we propose a novel method to quantify glaucomatous changes in fixation features as detected by fundus perimetry and relate them to the extent of glaucomatous damage.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed fixation data from 320 people (200 normal subjects and 120 with glaucoma) from the Preferred Retinal Locus (PRL) detection of a Compass perimeter. Fixation stability was measured as Bivariate Contour Ellipse Area (BCEA), and using two novel metrics: (1) Mean Euclidean Distance (MED) from the Preferred Retinal Locus, and (2) Sequential Euclidean Distance (SED) of sequential fixation locations. These measures were designed to capture the spread of fixation points, and the frequency of position changes during fixation, respectively.

Results

In the age corrected analysis, SED was significantly greater in glaucomatous subjects than controls (P = 0.002), but there was no difference in BCEA (P = 0.15) or MED (P = 0.054). Similarly, SED showed a significant association with Mean Deviation (P < 0.001), but neither BCEA nor MED were significantly correlated (P > 0.14 for both).

Conclusion

Changes in the scanning pattern detected by SED are better than traditional measures of fixation spread (BCEA) for describing the changes in fixation stability observed in glaucoma.

### Multiple channelling single-photon emission with scattering holography designed metasurfaces [^54ea1195]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Polarization splitting and beams collimation

Having confirmed the single-photon emission from the GeV-SPP coupled metasurface, we investigated angular distribution and polarization characteristics of the single-photon emission, observing in the Fourier plane two bright emission spots with orthogonal linear polarizations as expected (Fig. 5 a). The spot locations are equally displaced from the normal to the surface by 15° as designed and also predicted by FDTD calculations (Fig. 5 b), demonstrating good agreement between experimental and calculated angular distributions. The generated beams are expected to be collimated better in the direction of the emission polarization due to a better coverage by the corresponding metasurface region (Fig. 2 b, c), a feature that is ultimately related to the longitudinal orientation of the in-plane SPP polarization. Nevertheless, the experimentally measured angular FWHM of the generated beams for both polarizations was found within 6.5 °, securing thereby sufficient angular separation of the emission channels with orthogonal linear polarizations. A small difference in experimental X and Y peak intensities (Fig. 5 c) is believed to result from imperfection of the metasurface positioning, whose precision is evaluated being 50 nm. The experimentally realized degree of linear polarization can be judged upon from the normalized Stokes parameter S 1 distribution in the Fourier plane, reaching 0.79 for X- and 0.82 for Y-linear polarizations at the corresponding intensity maxima (Fig. 5 d).

### Microfluidic multipoles theory and applications [^31dd0050]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Upon inspection, the problem can be transformed to streamline coordinates (Fig. 2a) using the function

In the streamline domain Φ, the problem is equivalent to a channel geometry with flows of concentration c = 1 and c = 0 separated by a no-flux boundary condition on the origin. At the stagnation point, the no-flux condition is dropped, and the flows are free to mix (Fig. 2a) (see Supplementary Table 2 for more details on the streamline problem). The separating streamline going from the stagnation point to the aspiration aperture corresponds to the semi-infinite segment of the horizontal axis where the fluids can mix. If the Péclet number is high enough (higher than about 10, which is always realized in microfluidics applications), this segment can be taken to have concentration c = 1/2 and the walls of the channel geometry can be safely ignored (Supplementary Note 1). The problem can thus be decomposed in two problems of advection-diffusion around semi-infinite obstacles of fixed concentration. The problem of advection-diffusion around such a semi-infinite obstacle has been extensively studied in theoretical fluid mechanics, notably in the theory of dendrite solidification, and in the study of out of plane flow in Burgers vortex sheets. It yields the solutionwhere Φ stag is the image of the stagnation point and erf(x) is the error function. The sign of ± is determined by whether we have an incoming flow of concentration c = 0 or c = 1. However, neither of these concentration profiles represent the full dipole footprint when transformed. This can be seen physically in the flow dipole, in which there is both incoming fluid at concentration 0 (aspirated from the system's surroundings), and incoming fluid at concentration 1 (injected by the aperture). To solve this issue, we separate the problem into an "interior" and an "exterior" domain at the streamline of concentration c = 1/2 (see checkerboard insets in Fig. 2). There remains a discontinuity in our solution due to the branch cut of the logarithm functions in Eq. (1), but the solution can be made continuous by placing the singularities on the real axis and using it as an axis of symmetry. The final step is then to obtain the entire solution as a piecewise function assembling the "interior" and "exterior" solutions, given by transforming Eq. (6) back to the dipole flow domain Z. The interior and exterior domains can be defined either by checking the sign of Φ in the streamline domain or by using the expression for the separating line in the Z domain in polar coordinates (see Supplementary Note 2).

### Average focal length and power of a section of any defined surface [^fe6528c5]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a method to allow calculation of the average focal length and power of a lens through a specified meridian of any defined surface, not limited to the paraxial approximations.

Setting

University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.

Method

Functions were derived to model back-vertex focal length and representative power through a meridian containing any defined surface. Average back-vertex focal length was based on the definition of the average of a function, using the angle of incidence as an independent variable.

Results

Univariate functions allowed determination of average focal length and power through a section of any defined or topographically measured surface of a known refractive index. These functions incorporated aberrations confined to the section.

Conclusions

The proposed method closely approximates the average focal length, and by inference power, of a section (meridian) of a surface to a single or scalar value. It is not dependent on the paraxial and other nonconstant approximations and includes aberrations confined to that meridian. A generalization of this method to include all orthogonal and oblique meridians is needed before a comparison with measured wavefront values can be made.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

### Accelerated point spread function mapping using signal modeling for accurate echo-planar imaging geometric distortion correction [^50a881a8]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Echo-planar imaging is a fast and commonly used magnetic resonance imaging technique with applications in diffusion weighted and functional MRI. Fast data acquisition in echo-planar imaging is accomplished by the extended readout, which also introduces sensitivity to off-resonance effects such as amplitude of static (polarizing) field inhomogeneities and eddy-currents. These off-resonance effects produce geometric distortions in the corresponding echo-planar images. To correct for these distortions, an acceleration of point spread function (PSF) acquisition using a special sampling pattern is presented in this work. The proposed technique allows for reliable and fully automated distortion correction of echo-planar images at a field strength of 3 T. Additionally, a new approach to visualize and determine the distortions in a hybrid (x, y, kPSF) three-dimensional space is proposed. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed technique is demonstrated in phantom and in vivo experiments. The accuracy of the presented method here is compared to previous techniques for echo-planar imaging distortion correction such as PLACE.

### Simultaneous orientation and 3D localization microscopy with a vortex point spread function [^fdc21609]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Estimating the orientation and 3D position of rotationally constrained emitters with localization microscopy typically requires polarization splitting or a large engineered Point Spread Function (PSF). Here we utilize a compact modified PSF for single molecule emitter imaging to estimate simultaneously the 3D position, dipole orientation, and degree of rotational constraint from a single 2D image. We use an affordable and commonly available phase plate, normally used for STED microscopy in the excitation light path, to alter the PSF in the emission light path. This resulting Vortex PSF does not require polarization splitting and has a compact PSF size, making it easy to implement and combine with localization microscopy techniques. In addition to a vectorial PSF fitting routine we calibrate for field-dependent aberrations which enables orientation and position estimation within 30% of the Cramér-Rao bound limit over a 66 μm field of view. We demonstrate this technique on reorienting single molecules adhered to the cover slip, λ-DNA with DNA intercalators using binding-activated localization microscopy, and we reveal periodicity on intertwined structures on supercoiled DNA.

### Microfluidic control over topological States in channel-confined nematic flows [^01cddb22]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Landau model of thetophase transition

We constructed minimal Landau theory of a spatially uniform phase. Based on the simulation results and topological considerations, the simplest ansatz for bothandphase is a director that traces an ellipse in projection to theplane, parametrised by the vertical coordinate:whereis the non-dimensional vertical position between 0 and 1; is the amplitude of the bowing into the flow direction, related to the maximal angle of flow-alignment in thephase: andrepresents the mid-plane tilt: The remaining vertical componentof the director is uniquely determined by normalisation.

Up to the fourth order, the elastic free energy from Eq. (1), integrated over the thickness, reduces towith sixth and higher order remainder terms omitted. In addition to elasticity, flow-alignment can be modelled phenomenologically with an additional term, proportional toand odd function of, as flow reversal must reverse the direction of flow alignment. We chose a cubic termas the simplest odd function with a single local minimum at, which should coincide with the known steady state in theregime where elastic deformations introduced by the confinement can be neglected.

Determining the position of the minimumrequires some care. Our sinusoidal model does not describe well the texture with a constant alignment at the Leslie anglewith respect to the flow direction. As a reasonable approximation, we set the parameter to, so that the average value ofequals. We keep in mind that this extreme alignment will not occur when all terms are considered, and that with series expansion, we neglected the normalisation condition.

Overall, the phase behaviour is determined by the minima of the non-dimensional functionalwhereis the only remaining free parameter which simply renormalizes the arbitrary numerical prefactor in the definition of the Ericksen number. This expression is a low order expansion to capture the onset of the phase transition. In order to actually predict the magnitude ofin thephase, sixth order terms (predominantly theterm in the splay elastic energy expansion) need to be introduced to ensure the free energy functional is bounded from below and the minimisation condition is well posed. With this addition, the critical growth ofwith the critical exponent 0.5 above the transition, as witnessed in Fig. 6b, c is recovered.

### Cardiac surgical outcome prediction by blood pressure variability indices poincaréplot and coefficient of variation: a retrospective study [^57e8e141]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

A Poincaré plot is a quantitative, graphical tool that provides a visual representation of the non-linear aspects of a time series data sequence on a phase-space or Cartesian plane. Each data point on the time-series is plotted against the subsequent data point. In a non-linear data sequence, each data point can have its influence on few or more subsequent data points. This contributes to the short-term and the long-term variability of the sequence. There are a number of descriptors being used to quantitatively describe the information conveyed by the Poincaré plot. By far the most widely used technique is the ellipse fitting technique. This involves fitting an ellipse into the shape of the plot, with the center of the ellipse aligned to the center point of the plot. The metrics obtained from the ellipse include the short and long semi-axes, which correspond to SD1 and SD2 respectively.

In our study, the predictive ability from Poincare plots were not statistically significant. One possible explanation must be the fact that Poincare plots might not describe the temporal dynamic changes in blood pressure. The limitation of these measures of BP variability like CV/Poincare is that they do not take into consideration the temporal structure of a sequence of measurements. For example, the following two sequences: A = {1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1} and B = {1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3}, have the same variability, as measured by amplitude of range and standard deviation, but completely different structures. In fact, while sequence A defines a triangular wave, sequence B is a step function. One of the properties of complex waveforms includes non-stationarity. Non-stationarity describes the change over time of the statistical properties of the waveform (mean, standard deviation). Though SD1 and SD2 are measures of short and long-term variabilities, they may be short handed in capturing this complex dynamic nature. Measures that are sensitive to the temporal changes in blood pressure might be able to predict outcomes better. It is possible that the use other measures of complexity such as the multi-scale entropy, compression and conditional entropy may significantly add to the performance of the current models.

### Overview of dipole source localization [^cb1d8994]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Truly accurate dipole source localization relies on having (1) reliable, artifact-free EP/ERP (or magnetoelectroencephalogram) data to start with; (2) landmark and electrode position data obtained with a three-dimensional digitizer; (3) MRI (or CT) data from the same subject (with a means to measure the same landmarks); (4) the capability to apply different dipole and volume conductor models; and (5) the ability to coregister the functional and anatomic data to display the final source solutions. Most important is to have a thorough understanding of the fundamental principles of the localization programs and neurophysiologic processes. Localization programs are simply tools. Used incorrectly, they can yield meaningless results. Used correctly, they can provide a window into neurophysiologic functioning that is not available through any other means.

For simulations with resetting, we plot the meanstandard deviation of ten independent repetitions with 10 4 trajectories each (errors are smaller than the marker size in almost all cases).

We emphasize that all the results of Fig. 3 a were obtained using a single set of trajectories with no resetting and simply re-evaluating Equations (4–7) for every value of r 0 and b, leading to a different MFPT through Equation (3). Previously, obtaining the above results would have required performing an ensemble of brute-force simulations at every value of the parameters r 0 and b, to map out the MFPT phase space. This approach would be computationally prohibitive in many cases. Moreover, the strength of our approach becomes even clearer when considering other forms of r (x) apart from Equation (8). Tackling these using brute-force simulations, analytical methods, or experiments, would require a complete reanalysis of the problem. On the other hand, using our method, we can use the same initial ensemble of trajectories to generate the MFPT phase space for any resetting protocol, with minimal added cost. In section 4 of the Supplementary Information, we demonstrate this for several other sigmoidal-shaped resetting protocols (Supplementary Fig. S2).

### A systematic review of anterior cruciate ligament femoral footprint location evaluated by quadrant method for single-bundle and double-bundle anatomic reconstruction [^081cff21]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To unravel the standard position of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) femoral origin and deduce practical arthroscopic localization and postsurgical evaluation method.

Methods

Two independent reviewers searched PubMed using the terms ACL, footprint, femur, etc. We included studies published since January 1, 2000, in which the results were measured by Bernard's quadrant method. This method consists of 4 distances, including total diameter of lateral condyle along Blumensaat's line (distance t), maximum intercondylar notch height (distance h), distance from center of footprint to proximal border (distance x), and distance from center of footprint to Blumensaat's line (distance y). The data of included studies were combined to calculate theoretical centers and standard area for both ACL as a whole bundle and as anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) bundles individually. Finally, we translated the combined data to arthroscopic localization and postsurgical evaluation.

Results

A total of 13 studies were included. The theoretical centers of ACL as a whole bundle is 28.4% ± 5.1% (x) of distance t and 35.7% ± 6.9% (y) of distance h, whereas AM bundle is 24.2% ± 4%, 21.6% ± 5.2% (x, y) and PL bundle is 32.8% ± 4.7%, 46.7% ± 4.9% (x, y), respectively. The standard area of ACL footprint is a circle with a center of 27.53%, 35.85% (x, y), and a radius of 4.58%, 9.2% (x, y), respectively. Translation of combined data shows that under arthroscopy, for single-bundle ACL reconstruction, the midpoint of distance from border of proximal to distal articular cartilage is the center of anatomic femoral socket.

Conclusions

Combined data unravel the standard position of ACL femoral origin. It can be used by clinicians to localize anatomic tunnel both in surgery and postsurgical evaluation. For single-bundle ACL reconstruction, the midpoint of lateral femoral condyle corresponds to anatomic socket.

The bottom panel of Figure 6 shows selected bipolar AEGs recorded simultaneously from a focal site (c) and 5 nearby sites (a, b, d–f) that are in or near an area of slow conduction (activation sequences 1 and 2) and a functional line of block (dashed lines, activation sequence 3–7) during AF. The wave front generated from repetitive activation emanating from focal site c propagated in a radial‐type activation pattern but with different conduction velocities, denoted by different intervals between isochrones. After a functional line of block developed, repetitive wannabe reentrant activation formed. This occurred when propagation from the focus traveling along one side of the functional line of block pivoted around one end but failed to complete the rotation when it collided with the functional line of block. In addition, wannabe reentry sometimes developed from activation from a nonrandom breakthrough site (Figure 7). Focal and nonrandom breakthrough activations generating repetitive wannabe reentry were present in 6 of 12 patients.

3D Origin and Insertion Points of LAM

Origin points were similar, with the lowest SD in the second PRM origin point, showing 1.6–3.6 mm in controls and 1.9–5.6 mm in cases. The PVM origin shows a slightly more posterior (x-axis) position in cases of 5 mm on the right side and 4.4 mm on the left side. Insertion points differed more, being especially pronounced in PVaM, PPM, and PAM, which were located more posteriorly (x-axis), caudally (y-axis), and centered (z-axis) in the cases, with the highest SD for the PPM insertion on the x-axis at 22.0 ± 5.0 mm in controls and 36.6 ± 8.6 mm in cases. The PRM insertion was also posteriorly displaced (x-axis) in cases (Table 2, Appendix 1).

Distances

The mean lengths were longer in cases than in controls; this was especially pronounced in PVM, PPM, PAM, and PRM, with differences of 11.5 (24%)/10.5 (22%) mm on the left/right side for the PVM, 11.5 (24%)/10.5 (22%) mm for the PPM, 10.3 (17%)/9.6 (16%) mm for the PAM, and 10.8 (19%)/10.3 (18%) mm for the PRM (Fig. 2).

### Spatial and temporal variability of rotational, focal, and irregular activity: practical implications for mapping of atrial fibrillation [^c21c8bdd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.5 Spatial stability

Spatial stability was assessed by correlating the frequency of propagation patterns (LIA, LRA, and FF) at each vertex of the chamber anatomy over two separate 30‐s recordings taken at baseline before any ablation. The value for the number of pattern occurrences were plotted for each vertex of the anatomy for each recording. A linear best fit line was plotted, and R 2 calculated to assess the strength of the linear correlation between the two mapping segments. Stability of regions with the most repetitive patterns identified using the 30% threshold value for each 30‐s map were compared using Cohen's kappa statistic.

2.6 Temporal stability/optimal mapping duration

We sought to identify the minimum mapping duration required to identify the sites that are shown over the full 30 s analysis to represent regions with the highest frequency and therefore most repetitive activation for each of the specific patterns described. The region with the highest frequency of each propagation pattern may be considered as reflecting an optimum target for ablation. This was identified using the 30% cut off to identify the relevant zone on maps of increasing duration up to 30 s. Each vertex of the anatomy contained within and outside this region (at 30% cut off) was used to calculate the kappa statistic to quantify the consistency between these zones against the zone identified during a full 30 s segment. Kappa values were calculated and plotted at both 1‐s and 5‐s increments with a value of 0.8 considered excellent consistency compared to the result obtained at 30 s. The duration at which a kappa value of 0.8 was reached was extracted for each map and used for comparisons.

In a subset of 15 patients, additional analyses were undertaken using alternative methods to confirm that the results obtained were consistent between methods used. LIA, LRA, and FF were quantified for occurrence frequency, percentage time present and percentage of the chamber surface area affected (for FF only frequency was assessed) at increasing durations, also in 1‐s increments up to 30 s. At each incremental recording duration, the percentage change in each variable was calculated. For occurrence frequency the results for every possible combination of maps of increasing duration within the 30‐s recording were compared (e.g. the frequency of a pattern was measured over 5 s and compared with all possible maps of 5‐s duration within the full 30‐s recording). For occurrence time and surface area a 5 s moving average at 1‐s increments was calculated. Heatmaps were created for each pattern allowing a visual representation of the effect of duration on variability.

### A model for the fragmentation kinetics of crumpled thin sheets [^a2bca16c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

As a preliminary step, we derive the final displacement of the strip when folded at each break, in the absence of confinement. This problem can be mapped to the displacement of a walker performing a one-dimensional random walk with gamma-distributed steps. To enforce the concept of folding, the walker's steps occur in alternating directions. The distribution f Z (z) of position Z after 2 k steps accurate for all k is derived in full in Supplementary Note 2. However, the salient trends may be likewise observed by applying the central limit theorem and considering the position Z valid for large k, or small step size, which givesand describes a normal distribution of zero mean and variance L 0 θ.

If a confinement is now introduced at the locations ∣ z ∣ = w, we next ask with what likelihood the walker steps beyond this confinement. One approach to approximate this probability is to integrate Eq. (16) for all ∣ z ∣ > w, producing a two-sided survival function of Eq. (16). Although this is not equivalent to our initial question, as intermediate steps may also have landed past ∣ z ∣ > w, it proves an acceptable estimate as the last step has the greatest variance. A more accurate calculation would be to evaluate the likelihood that a given walk escapes the confinement at any step; however, looking at the last step is useful for its simplicity in analytical form, and still captures the anticipated behavior. A comparison to the more accurate formulation is made numerically and provided in Supplementary Fig. 9. Once again, we pursue here the simpler form of the survival function valid for large k, and refer to Supplementary Note 2 for the exact derivation valid at all k. The survival function of Eq. (16), S Z (w; θ) = P (∣ Z ∣ > w; w ≥ 0), for a threshold confinement w, is given bywhere erf(z) is the error function. In order for walkers at ∣ z ∣ > w to be restored within the limits of confinement, one or more of their steps must fragment, thereby increasing the number of steps taken and decreasing the overall average, which drives the evolution of fragmentation. This articulates our key claim: considering our original, cylindrically shaped sheets as a statistical ensemble of one-dimensional random walks, we suggest that the progression of fragmentation measured by a change d t, over a single crumpling iteration d n, should be proportional to the fraction of walks in the ensemble which leave the confinement imposed at ∣ z ∣ = w: d t /d n ~ S Z (w; θ). Equivalently, this is the likelihood that a single random walk leaves the critical confinement. We note that this resulting fragmentation rate describes an average fragmentation likelihood given only a confinement w and current temporal parameter t = 1/ θ describing the maturity of the fragmentation process thus far; it does not enforce direct correlations between successive crumpling iterations, whereby new folds should occur preferentially along previous ones. Instead, the decrease in fragmentation rate with n is encoded through the decreasing mean facet area with t. Moreover, while stronger correlation is expected between walks representing nearby transects of the sheet, here we consider the statistical behavior of the sheet as a whole, and account for the increased fragmentation likelihood for facets with larger horizontal extent through the weighting introduced in Eq. (15). At present, Eq. (17) gives the likelihood that new creases will form; however, it does not yet describe how much new damage is created, for which two additional factors should be considered: (1) When the sheet is strongly confined in closely packed layers, the layers tend to collectively fragment, as alluded to by Sultan and Boudaoudand Gottesman et al. thus contributing a factor p ~ 1/ L such that halving the final height doubles the number of additional ridges. (2) In the opposite limit of low compaction, facets are not in close proximity and need not behave cooperatively; thus, new damage scales linearly with the amount of compression L 0 − L, as argued in Gottesman et al. With these additional considerations, we propose that the evolution of the fragmentation process with crumpling iteration behaves aswhere α is a fitted constant of proportionality. We indicate the explicit dependence on t here, as t and θ are inversely related. The critical width w is determined by the geometry of the imposed confinement, as illustrated in Fig. 6 d; a complete derivation is provided in Supplementary Note 4 :where R is the radius of the container. By consequence of Eq. (14) we can directly relate Eqs. (18) and (12) asand obtain a fit to the proportionality constant α. By performing an asymptotic approximation in the limit of large t, detailed in Supplementary Note 3, Eq. (18) may be analytically integrated to provide a scaling relationwhich bears similarity toof Eq. (11):where, and L 0 and R are the sheet length (equivalently the confining container height) and container radius, respectively. Taken together, Eqs. (14) and (21) thereby provide a theoretically motivated expressionbased on properties of fragmentation kinetics and a simple mechanism for re-fragmentation formulated as a random walk. Figure 7 compares the agreement of the empirical relations δ ℓ empir. and ℓ empir. as well as the derived models δ ℓ model and, with the measured quantitiesand ℓ meas. for various n. Collectively, the results of Figs. 4 and 7 demonstrate clear consistency of the fragmentation model with the anticipated logarithmic growth.

### Impact of contact force on pulsed field ablation outcomes using focal point catheter [^3e148eef]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Conventional focal radiofrequency catheters may be modified to enable multiple energy modalities (radiofrequency or pulsed field [PF]) with the benefit of contact force (CF) feedback, providing greater flexibility in the treatment of arrhythmias. Information on the impact of CF on lesion formation in PF ablations remains limited.

Methods

An in vivo study was performed with 8 swine using an investigational dual-energy CF focal catheter with local impedance. Experiment I: To evaluate atrial lesion formation, contiguity, and width, a point-by-point approach was used to create an intercaval line. The distance between the points was prespecified at 4 ± 1 mm. Half of the line was created with radiofrequency energy, whereas the other half utilized PF (single 2.0 kV application with a proprietary waveform). Experiment II: To evaluate single application lesion dimensions with a proprietary waveform, discrete ventricular lesions were performed with PFA (single 2.0 kV application) with targeted levels of CF: low, 5 to 15 g; medium, 20 to 30 g; and high, 35 to 45 g. Following 1 week of survival, animals underwent endocardial/epicardial remapping, and euthanasia to enable histopathologic examination.

Results

Experiment I: Both energy modalities resulted in a complete intercaval line of transmural ablation. PF resulted in significantly wider lines than radiofrequency: minimum width, 14.9 ± 2.3 versus 5.0 ± 1.6 mm; maximum width, 21.8 ± 3.4 versus 7.3 ± 2.1 mm, respectively; P < 0.01 for each. Histology confirmed transmural lesions with both modalities. Experiment II: With PF, lesion depth, width, and volume were larger with higher degrees of CF (depth: r = 0.82, P < 0.001; width: r = 0.26, P = 0.052; and volume: r = 0.55, P < 0.001), with depth increasing at a faster rate than width. The mean depths were as follows: low (n = 17), 4.3 ± 1.0 mm; medium (n = 26), 6.4 ± 1.2 mm; and high (n = 14), 9.1 ± 1.4 mm.

Conclusions

Using the same focal point CF-sensing catheter, a novel PF ablation waveform with a single application resulted in transmural atrial lesions that were significantly wider than radiofrequency. Lesion depth showed a significant positive correlation with CF with depths of 6.4 mm at moderate CF.

### Diffusion in hierarchical systems: a simulation study in models of healthy and diseased muscle tissue [^d2ed57d9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Tissue Model Construction

Tissue substrates are constructed by arranging a specified number of parallel cylinders in a region with periodic boundaries. Cylinders have radii drawn from a gamma distribution with specified shape and scale parameters (k and θ, respectively). Cylinders that intersect the boundaries on the simulated region are copied on the opposite side of the substrate to ensure periodicity 23.

Once all cylinders have been placed on the substrate, each cylinder then has an internal structure added. Internal cylinders are parallel to the outer cylinder, and have radii drawn from a gamma distribution with the same shape parameter as the outer cylinder distribution, but scale parameter multiplied by the area fraction of the outer cylinder on the substrate.

Internal cylinders are also nonintersecting. Each cylinder has circular cross section and is infinitely long; therefore, we only need to pick a trial location in the cross‐sectional disk. Uniform sampling is achieved by picking coordinates using a relation that preserves the volume element of the unit disk:whereis the radial coordinate on the disk. Cartesian coordinates uniformly distributed on the disk are obtained using

Note that this transformation is required for uniform sampling density on the disk 25. Trial coordinates on the unit disk are generated by samplinguniformly inanduniformly in. The coordinates are then scaled and translated from the unit disk at the origin to the cylinder of radiusat positionwhereis the radius of the cylinder being placed.

Intersection checking is performed using the hierarchical method outlined previously. Once a position for the new cylinder is found that does not intersect with any others, it is added to the local map and the process repeats. The complete map is reused during dynamics simulation (Fig. 1 d).

Diffusion Dynamics and Intersection Checking

Diffusing spins execute random walks in three dimensions (3D). Each step in a spin's trajectory must be checked for intersection with the tissue substrate. As with the tissue substrate construction phase, the efficiency of this check has a significant effect on the simulation performance.

For each step in a spin's trajectory, a set of intersecting cells is generated using Breshenham's algorithm 24, 26. The step is tested against objects that intersect these grid elements. For internal intersection checks, the step is projected into the local map, and parametric clipping 24, 27 is employed to exclude portions of the step that fall outside it.

Tissue Models

This section describes tissue models designed to investigate microstructural change as well as a baseline model of healthy muscle tissue.

### Grid cells for conceptual spaces? [^8e0a864d]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

"Grid cells" encode an animal's location and direction of movement in 2D physical environments via regularly repeating receptive fields. Constantinescu et al. (2016) report the first evidence of grid cells for 2D conceptual spaces. The work has exciting implications for mental representation and shows how detailed neural-coding hypotheses can be tested with bulk population-activity measures.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography endorsed by the European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian society of echocardiography [^ae4b9c06]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) linear dimensions — apical 4-chamber assessment emphasizes that, using 2D echocardiography, RV size can be measured from a 4-chamber view obtained from the apical window at end-diastole. Although quantitative validation is lacking, qualitatively, the right ventricle should appear smaller than the left ventricle and usually no more than two thirds the size of the left ventricle in the standard apical 4-chamber view, and if the right ventricle is larger than the left ventricle in this view, it is likely significantly enlarged. In the standard transthoracic apical 4-chamber window, the left ventricle is considered the apex-forming ventricle, and as the right ventricle enlarges, it may displace the left ventricle and occupy the apex, which usually signifies that the right ventricle is at least moderately dilated, though this finding has not been validated quantitatively. A major limitation is a lack of fixed reference points to ensure correct rotation of the right ventricle, so the imager can image the RV through various cut planes; as a result, it is critical to attempt to adjust the apical 4-chamber to acquire the right ventricle–focused view, and the 4-chamber image may require adjustment from its usual attention on the left ventricle to a focus on the right ventricle. To avoid underestimating the minor dimension, the transducer is rotated until the maximal plane is obtained.

### Microdosimetry of electron microbeams [^74f666a2]. Radiation Research (2004). Low credibility.

Track structures of 25, 50 and 80 keV primary electrons, simulated by the detailed-history Monte Carlo method, were analyzed for the frequency distributions of energy deposited in spheres with a diameter of 1 microm, placed in a cylindrically symmetrical array around the projected initial direction of the primary electron. The frequency mean of specific energy, the dose mean of lineal energy, and the parameters of lognormal functions fit to the dose distributions were calculated as a function of beam penetration and radial distance from the projected beam axis. Given these data, the stochastics of dose and radiation quality for micrometer-scale sites targeted by a medium-energy electron microbeam can be predicted as a function of the site's location relative to the beam entry point.

### Parallel detection and spatial mapping of large nuclear spin clusters [^8b30026f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Finally, the azimuth ϕ i is encoded in the complex phase of the nuclear FID signal. Because we initiate the FID by applying a π /2 pulse with an external RF coil, all nuclei are rotated around a common laboratory-frame axis and start precession with the same phase. By contrast, the ac detection of the FID is phase-sensitive with respect to each nucleus' individual hyperfine field. As a consequence, the phase ϕ i is equal to the spatial angle between the coil and hyperfine axes in the laboratory frame (Fig. 1 b). Analysis of the complex FID signal therefore directly reveals the desired azimuth ϕ i.

In the following, we will make three important assumptions that are necessary for keeping the maximum likelihood fitting of spectra tractable. First, we assume that all nuclei carry approximately the same polarization, p 0, i ≈ p 0. Because we repeat the polarization transfer process for typically > 10 3 cycles (i.e. longer than the FID duration), we expect that all nuclei within the sensitive radius become close to fully polarized. The polarization level may be slightly reduced for spin pairsor due to residual spin diffusion, however, these effects are small for our dilute 13 C concentration. Our assumption of nearly full polarization is consistent with the observation that spectra show little change in peak intensities once the number of cycles is increased beyond ≳10 3. Similar saturation behavior is suggested by ref. Second, we treatas a global parameter. Although this assumption is likely wrong in general, the role ofhere is that of an upper bound in the FID decay. Because the FID is for most spins dominated by the measurement-induced dephasing (i) and (ii), our method is not very sensitive to variations in. We find that our fit results forare similar to those expected from the drift in the bias field, suggesting that our linewidths are limited by external field stability. Third, we will neglect nuclear-nuclear couplings, discussed further below.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^87be2885]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Table 5 — Echocardiographic assessment of LV mass (2D based formulas, truncated ellipsoid) indicates partial correction for shape distortions and less dependence on geometrical assumptions than linear measurements; however, this approach requires good image quality and properly oriented parasternal short‑axis views without oblique planes and good epicardial definition, uses a cumbersome methodology with higher measurement variability, and is limited by few published normative data and limited prognostic data.

### Three-dimensional wave breaking [^10c24ed3]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

3D 'global steepness'

We now introduce a measure akin to the global steepness that accounts for the effects of directional spreading. For directionally spread (3D) linear waves, the surface slope has two orthogonal components:andThe directions in which waves propagate affect how they contribute to the total surface slope. When calculating S in equation (4), which corresponds to the maximum possible 2D linear slope (M = 1 and θ = 0), the phase argument in equation (5) is ignored. A similar approach may be used to calculate a 3D equivalent of S :For broadbanded spectra, the slope maxima of each component are not necessarily colocated in space. As a result, the 3D global slope S 3D can be quite different from the maximum achievable slope for a linear focused wave group. Thus, we did not use S 3D in 'Results'. To calculate the linear maximum achievable slope, we searched for the time and position at which the absolute slope was a maximum for a focused wave group based on each directional distribution. Extended Data Fig. 2 demonstrates how two focused wave groups with the same global steepness S can have different waveforms and local slopes (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c). The wave group in Extended Data Fig. 2a is unidirectional, whereas the wave group in Extended Data Fig. 2d is an axisymmetric standing wave.

Local steepness

Local measures of steepness, unlike the global steepness, implicitly capture the effects that nonlinear evolution and directionality may have on the waveform of steep waves. As a result, such measures may provide better descriptions of the free surface elevation at breaking onset for any given wave. The local steepness has various forms for which either a locally measured wave amplitude a or a height H (Extended Data Fig. 2) are non-dimensionalized using a chosen length scale, which is most commonly the wavelength λ (a k and k H /2, where k = 2π/ λ). The choice of length scale and the manner by which it is calculated (in space or time) have significant implications for the resulting measure of steepness. In highly spread conditions, even if highly resolved spatial measurements of surface elevation are available, the wavelength and other length scales become ill-defined. Even in 2D, where some of the aforementioned issues are resolved, the local steepness is not always a robust indicator of breaking onset. As a result, we have not used local steepness parameters herein.

### Image distortion correction in EPI: comparison of field mapping with point spread function mapping [^e1f5d953]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Echo-planar imaging (EPI) can provide rapid imaging by acquiring a complete k-space data set in a single acquisition. However, this approach suffers from distortion effects in geometry and intensity, resulting in poor image quality. The distortions, caused primarily by field inhomogeneities, lead to intensity loss and voxel shifts, the latter of which are particularly severe in the phase-encode direction. Two promising approaches to correct the distortion in EPI are field mapping and point spread function (PSF) mapping. The field mapping method measures the field distortions and translates these into voxel shifts, which can be used to assign image intensities to the correct voxel locations. The PSF approach uses acquisitions with additional phase-encoding gradients applied in the x, y, and/or z directions to map the 1D, 2D, or 3D PSF of each voxel. These PSFs encode the spatial information about the distortion and the overall distribution of intensities from a single voxel. The measured image is the convolution of the undistorted density and the PSF. Measuring the PSF allows the distortion in geometry and intensity to be corrected. This work compares the efficacy of these methods with equal time allowed for field mapping and PSF mapping.

### Spontaneous perception of numerosity in humans [^d412d5ba]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

In the odd-one-out experiment, for each numerosity data were analysed by plotting per cent correct responses as a function of the area and density of the odd stimulus. Yield maps like those of Fig. 2, with the abscissa showing change in area and ordinate change in patch density. As the axes are logarithmic, the forward diagonal represents numerosity (area times density), and the other diagonal constant numerosity. Data were fitted with 2D elliptical Gaussian functions:

where x and y are obtained by clockwise rotation of the area and density space (and). The elliptical Gaussian has five free parameters: orientation of short-radius, widths of the short and long radii and the position of the centre in the area and density space. The orientation of the short radius is the axis of maximal sensitivity as subjects discriminate best when the odd stimulus varied in that direction. The ratio between long and short radii is an index of selectivity of the sensitivity.

In the explicit judgment experiment, for each numerosity and task requirement we plotted the percentage of times the test patch was perceived as 'more' as a function of area- and density-change. Again, this yields a 2D map of density change plotted against area. Both area and density employed in the analysis were calculated stimulus by stimulus via estimation of the surface covered by the convex hull of the dot cloud.

The subject response maps are then interpolated filling a space spanning from −0.75 to 0.75 octaves and fit with a 2D psychometric cumulative Gaussian function. The fitted function was a one-dimension cumulative Gaussian function operating on an arbitrary axis x obtained via rotation of the area–density space. The function has three parameters: rotation angle, width and offset. The width indicates the amount of change required to go from 50 to 84% 'more' responses. For choice planes off the area or density axis, the width is expressed as the sum of the changes in area and density required to attain 84% categorization.

### Defining a core configuration for human centromeres during mitosis [^0f31fddb]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Sub-classification of centromeres by cohesin localization.

a A representative centromere with CENP-A (cyan) and RAD21 (magenta) signals and the line profile (gray) used for measurements is shown. Center-enriched RAD21 ratio was determined by measuring the ratio of intensity at pixels (white) at the center of the centromere and 6 pixels vertically away from the center. b Chromosomes were assigned ranks based on center-enriched RAD21 ratio (Ratio 0.0861 — Rank 1, Ratio 5.519 — Rank 463). A montage is shown in which the x axis represents each centromere, and the y axis represents the vertical profile through the middle of the centromere region, sorted by their rank. Three classes — split (ranks: 1–200), uniform (ranks:201–350) and central (ranks:351–463) were arbitrarily assigned based on these ratios. c Aligned and averaged images for each class are shown. x and y axis on images indicate distance (nm). d Average intensities of RAD21 along the vertical profile in the three classes are shown. e Inter-CENP-A distances measured for the three classes — central (n = 200), uniform (n = 150), split (n = 113) are compared by unpaired one-way Kruskal-Wallis test (multiple comparisons). Dotted white lines in violin plots denote median values. n.s. - not significant.

We speculate that the three classes correspond to chromosome-specific variation in cohesin binding and organization within pericentromeric DNA. The classes are helpful but artificial since there is a continuum of variation in the RAD21 signal. This is consistent with the fact that each chromosome bears a unique CenHap. While the identities of each chromosome and the origins of the different cohesin enrichment patterns are unknown, the subtle differences in inter-CENP-A distance may indicate chromosome-specific centromere organization. Overall, these data allow us to glean the average arrangement of cohesin and CENP-A at centromeres while also suggesting the possibility for centromere-specific organization.
