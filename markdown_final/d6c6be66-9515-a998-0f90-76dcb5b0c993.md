## Question

Vertebral dissection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vertebral artery dissection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining vertebral artery dissection and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify epidemiology and risk factors. Next, I will review clinical presentation and the differential diagnosis. After that, I need to check the imaging strategy and diagnostic pitfalls. Then, I will examine acute management, including thrombolysis, antithrombotic therapy, and endovascular options. I should also consider special populations such as children, pregnancy/postpartum, and connective tissue disorders. Finally, I will assess prognosis, recurrence, and follow-up imaging, and close with practical pearls and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Vertebral artery dissection is a separation of arterial wall layers with blood entering the media, forming an intramural hematoma that can cause stenosis, occlusion, or pseudoaneurysm, and in intradural segments, subarachnoid hemorrhage. Mechanistically, it can be spontaneous or triggered by minor trauma, and intracranial segments lack an external elastic lamina, making them more prone to subadventitial rupture and SAH, whereas extracranial segments more often present with ischemia from thromboembolism or hypoperfusion [^112ADKEL] [^1173YTD2].

> I need to verify epidemiology and risk factors. VAD is uncommon but disproportionately important in younger adults, accounting for roughly 10–20% of ischemic strokes in patients under 45–50 years, with an estimated incidence around 1–5 per 100,000 per year. Minor neck trauma, chiropractic manipulation, and activities involving abrupt neck motion are frequent precipitants, and connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos and fibromuscular dysplasia increase risk. Pregnancy and the postpartum period are also recognized risk contexts due to hormonal and hemodynamic changes, and recent infection, including COVID-19, has been implicated as a potential trigger via endotheliopathy [^112AmqUx] [^114DDRK5] [^114bcsNM] [^112HJAHy] [^112XUxsh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical presentation. I should confirm the symptom spectrum. The classic triad of headache, neck pain, and posterior circulation ischemic symptoms is present in a minority, so a high index of suspicion is essential. Headache and neck pain are common and often ipsilateral, vertigo, dysarthria, ataxia, diplopia, and visual field defects reflect posterior fossa involvement, and Wallenberg syndrome from lateral medullary infarction is prototypical. Importantly, pain can precede ischemia by hours to days, and isolated pain without neurologic deficits occurs in a meaningful minority, which can delay diagnosis if not considered [^114DRvgj] [^112ADKEL] [^114s3dyL].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis and avoid anchoring bias. Migraine, tension-type headache, cervical radiculopathy, vestibular disorders, and demyelinating disease can mimic VAD, and in children, seizures and ataxia may dominate, obscuring the vascular etiology. In trauma, spinal injury symptoms can mask VAD, so I need to ensure I actively look for posterior circulation red flags and maintain vigilance for delayed presentations [^116uSkkS] [^114xYKpv].

> I will now examine the imaging strategy, and I should double-check modality strengths and limitations. Noninvasive CTA of the head and neck is highly sensitive for luminal abnormalities and is often first-line in the ED, while MRI/MRA with fat-suppressed T1 can visualize intramural hematoma and is preferred in children and when radiation avoidance is prioritized. DSA remains the gold standard when noninvasive studies are nondiagnostic or when endovascular therapy is planned. Ultrasound has limited sensitivity for VAD and should not be used to exclude it. High-resolution vessel wall MRI can help distinguish dissection from mimics and characterize intracranial lesions, and diffusion-weighted imaging can occasionally show intramural hematoma signal, though evidence is limited and not definitive [^113EcjFH] [^113SfEc3] [^116wdjAN] [^115YLnh6] [^112AmqUx].

> Wait, let me verify acute management principles. In acute ischemic stroke attributable to extracranial VAD, IV thrombolysis is reasonable if the patient otherwise meets standard eligibility criteria, though data specific to VAD are limited and some observational signals suggest lesser benefit in posterior circulation dissections; mechanical thrombectomy is also reasonable in eligible patients with large-vessel occlusion. For antithrombotic therapy, both antiplatelet and anticoagulant regimens are acceptable for 3–6 months, with randomized data showing no clear superiority of one over the other in preventing recurrent stroke or death, so the choice should be individualized based on bleeding risk, lesion morphology, and patient factors [^116vRvPW] [^113Go7JU] [^114gzeWP] [^112Yd5i2].

> But wait, what if the dissection is intracranial or complicated by pseudoaneurysm. I should confirm that intracranial VAD with SAH or a ruptured dissecting aneurysm warrants urgent endovascular or surgical intervention to secure the vessel, whereas unruptured intracranial dissections with high-risk features may be considered for prophylactic treatment. Recurrent ischemia despite optimal medical therapy is a scenario where endovascular therapy can be considered, though evidence is largely observational and decisions should be made in specialized centers [^111oS8bX] [^114gzeWP] [^111wPjGJ].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with children. Pediatric VAD is a leading cause of posterior circulation stroke, often preceded by minor trauma, and boys are more commonly affected. MRI/MRA is preferred to avoid radiation, and because recurrence risk is higher, especially with dissecting aneurysms, some experts favor anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy, though high-quality pediatric data are sparse and management should be individualized with pediatric neurology input [^116uSkkS] [^113SfEc3] [^116paMTq].

> I should confirm considerations in pregnancy and the postpartum period. Hormonal and hemodynamic changes predispose to spontaneous dissections, and presentation with headache and neck pain should prompt vascular imaging. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin is often favored in the antepartum period, transitioning to warfarin or DOACs postpartum depending on timing and breastfeeding, with endovascular therapy reserved for refractory cases or ruptured aneurysms [^112HJAHy] [^111GZMNS].

> Next, I should review prognosis and recurrence. Most patients recover well, with favorable functional outcomes in the majority, but recurrence risk is highest in the first month and declines thereafter. Annual recurrence approximates 1% or less after the first year, and follow-up imaging at 3–6 months is reasonable to document healing or detect complications such as pseudoaneurysm formation. Persistent or recurrent symptoms warrant repeat vascular imaging to reassess the dissected segment [^113JPQsn] [^116yhcwN] [^113EcjFH].

> Hold on, I should verify practical pearls that change practice. A new, severe, unilateral occipitonuchal headache or neck pain, especially after minor trauma or chiropractic manipulation, should trigger VAD evaluation even with a normal neurologic exam. Early imaging with CTA or MRI/MRA prevents delays, and in children, ataxia, vertigo, or visual field defects should prompt posterior circulation imaging. I need to ensure I ask explicitly about recent neck maneuvers, exercise, or trivial trauma and document any preceding transient neurologic symptoms, as these clues meaningfully raise pretest probability [^114DRvgj] [^116uSkkS] [^114DDRK5].

> In summary, I should double-check that my approach remains systematic: suspect VAD in young patients with new headache or neck pain, especially with posterior circulation symptoms or minor trauma. Use CTA or MRI/MRA promptly. Treat acute ischemic stroke within standard windows including thrombolysis and thrombectomy when indicated. Choose antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for 3–6 months based on individualized risk. Escalate to endovascular therapy for SAH, ruptured aneurysm, or recurrent ischemia despite medical therapy. And tailor management in children and pregnancy while planning follow-up imaging to confirm healing and detect complications [^116vRvPW] [^113EcjFH] [^114gzeWP].

Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a **rare but important cause of stroke in young adults** [^112ADKEL], often triggered by minor trauma or spontaneous events [^114DDRK5]. It presents with **neck pain, headache, and posterior circulation ischemic symptoms** (vertigo, ataxia, dysarthria, visual disturbances) [^114DRvgj] [^112ADKEL]. Diagnosis relies on **CTA or MRI/MRA** [^113EcjFH] to detect intimal flap, intramural hematoma, or pseudoaneurysm [^117Y1Bdg]; DSA remains the gold standard when noninvasive tests are inconclusive [^116wdjAN]. Acute management includes antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for 3–6 months [^116vRvPW] [^112V5KXC]; endovascular therapy is reserved for recurrent ischemia despite medical therapy or for ruptured intracranial dissections [^114gzeWP] [^111oS8bX]. Prognosis is generally favorable, but recurrence risk persists, especially in the first month [^116yhcwN].

---

## Pathophysiology

VAD arises from a **tear in the arterial wall**, allowing blood to enter the media and form an intramural hematoma, which narrows or occludes the lumen and can embolize to the posterior circulation [^112ADKEL]. Intracranial segments are prone to subarachnoid hemorrhage due to thinner walls and lack of external elastic lamina [^1173YTD2].

---

## Risk factors

- **Trauma**: Minor neck trauma, chiropractic manipulation, or sudden neck movements are common triggers [^114DDRK5] [^114bcsNM].
- **Spontaneous**: Connective tissue disorders (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan), fibromuscular dysplasia, and pregnancy/postpartum increase risk [^115qxgQf] [^112HJAHy].
- **Infections**: Recent respiratory or systemic infections may precipitate dissection [^115i6QgS].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

| **Symptom** | **Frequency** |
|-|-|
| Neck pain | 50–70% [^notfound] |
| Headache (often occipital) | 60–80% [^notfound] |
| Vertigo, nausea, vomiting | 40–60% [^notfound] |
| Ataxia, dysarthria | 30–50% [^notfound] |
| Visual disturbances (diplopia, field defects) | 20–40% [^notfound] |
| Horner syndrome (rare in VAD) | < 10% [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **CTA**: Fast, widely available; detects intimal flap, intramural hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and stenosis/occlusion [^117Y1Bdg].
- **MRI/MRA**: Gold standard for intramural hematoma and subtle dissections; fat-suppressed T1 shows crescentic hyperintensity [^117Y1Bdg].
- **DSA**: Reserved for inconclusive noninvasive studies or before endovascular therapy [^116wdjAN].

---

## Management

### Medical therapy

Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) or anticoagulation (warfarin or DOACs) for 3–6 months is recommended; **no clear superiority** has been demonstrated [^114TEdXj] [^116vRvPW]. Thrombolysis is reasonable in acute ischemic stroke when standard criteria are met [^116vRvPW].

---

### Endovascular therapy

Indications include recurrent ischemia despite medical therapy, **progressive stenosis or occlusion**, or ruptured intracranial dissections with pseudoaneurysm [^114gzeWP] [^111oS8bX]. Options include stenting, flow diversion, or parent artery occlusion [^116pYnRB].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Most patients recover with favorable outcomes; however, **recurrence risk is 1–2% per year**, with the highest risk in the first month [^116yhcwN]. Persistent pseudoaneurysm or connective tissue disease increases recurrence risk [^notfound].

---

## Complications

Complications include ischemic stroke (posterior circulation), **subarachnoid hemorrhage** (intracranial dissections), and recurrent dissection or pseudoaneurysm formation [^112ADKEL] [^1173YTD2].

---

## Follow-up

Follow-up imaging at 3–6 months is recommended to assess healing or complications; **MRI/MRA is preferred** to avoid radiation [^notfound].

---

Vertebral artery dissection is a **significant cause of stroke in young adults**, with a presentation of neck pain, headache, and posterior circulation symptoms. Early diagnosis with CTA or MRI/MRA and prompt antithrombotic therapy are essential; endovascular therapy is reserved for select cases. Prognosis is generally good, but recurrence can occur, warranting close follow-up.

Vertebral artery dissection is a lesser known but significant cause of stroke in young, healthy people. Given its infrequency of presentation, emergency physicians may not always recognize its common symptoms — vertigo, diplopia, ataxia, and dysarthria — as a stroke. In this case report, we describe a patient with vertebral artery dissection presenting with atypical symptoms and discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, presentation, clinical examination findings, imaging modalities, and treatment of this disease.

### Dissection of the V4 segment of the vertebral artery: clinicoradiologic manifestations and endovascular treatment [^116pYnRB]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Intracranial vertebral artery (VA) dissection has three clinical presentations: ischemia, hemorrhage, and mass effect. Imaging findings of intracranial VA dissections vary according to clinical presentation. Irregular stenosis or occlusion of the VA is the most common finding in patients with posterior fossa infarction, whereas a dissecting aneurysm is the main feature in those with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. A chronic, giant, dissecting aneurysm can cause mass effect on the brain stem or cranial nerves, as well as distal embolism. Magnetic resonance imaging is useful for detection of intramural hematomas and intimal flaps, both of which are diagnostic of VA dissection. Multidetector computed tomography angiography is increasingly used for diagnosis of VA dissection. Catheter angiography is still beneficial for evaluation of precise endoluminal morphology of the dissection before surgical or endovascular intervention. Endovascular treatment is now considered a major therapeutic option for patients with a ruptured dissecting aneurysm or a chronic dissecting aneurysm. Anticoagulation therapy is currently considered the initial treatment of choice in patients with posterior circulation ischemic symptoms. Endovascular treatment, such as stent-assisted angioplasty or coil occlusion at the dissection site, can be performed in selected patients with posterior fossa ischemic symptoms.

### Vertebral artery dissection [^115U62fQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Vertebral artery dissections are a rare pathology that carries a high risk of stroke in a younger population. They may be caused by minor mechanisms and the index of suspicion should be high. Treatment with anticoagulation or antiplatelets should follow if no surgical management is indicated. We describe a case of a female in her 30s who fell backward off a swing and rolled over her head and complained of continued posterior neck pain. The patient was found to have a vertebral artery dissection on MRI. The patient was then anticoagulated with high-dose apixaban and low-dose aspirin. The emergency medicine provider should be aware of possible low-impact mechanisms that can cause vertebral artery dissection and should have a high index of suspicion. If surgical management is not indicated, anticoagulation should be initiated.

### Imaging of vertebral artery dissection in children: an underrecognized condition with high risk of recurrent stroke [^113SfEc3]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a common cause of a rare condition, pediatric posterior circulation arterial ischemic stroke (PCAIS). VAD is clinically important due to the risk of multifocal and continuing infarcts from artery-to-artery thromboembolism, with the potential for occlusion of arteries that perfuse the brainstem. Early diagnosis is important, as recurrent stroke is a common effect of VAD in children. Although the relative efficacies of different treatment regimens for VAD in children remain unsettled, early initiation of treatment can mitigate the risk of delayed stroke. Clinical diagnosis of PCAIS may be delayed due to multiple factors, including nonspecific symptoms and the inability of younger patients to express symptoms. In fact, subacute or chronic infarcts are often present at initial imaging. Although the most common cause of isolated PCAIS is VAD, imaging of the cervical arteries has been historically underused in this setting. Cervical vascular imaging (MR angiography, CT angiography, and digital subtraction angiography) for VAD must be optimized to detect the sometimes subtle findings, which may be identified at initial or follow-up imaging. Osseous variants of the craniocervical junction and upper cervical spine and other extrinsic lesions that may directly injure the vertebral arteries or lead to altered biomechanics have been implicated in some cases. The authors review characteristic imaging features and optimized imaging of VAD and associated PCAIS and related clinical considerations. Identification of VAD has important implications for evaluation, treatment, and imaging follow-up, as this condition may result in progressive arteriopathy and recurrent stroke. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Cervical artery dissections: a review [^1127maJg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) is an infrequent, yet potentially devastating, cause of stroke. While uncommon, CeAD is important for emergency physicians to quickly diagnose and treat because of the potential for cerebral ischemia, stroke, blindness, or death. To our knowledge, no review articles in the emergency medicine literature have been published on CeAD. A literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and other major abstracts in the English language was performed for the following terms: cervical artery, vertebral artery, and carotid artery dissection. The search included all titles from January 1, 2010 to February 28, 2015 and other relevant articles.

Objectives

We sought to review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation for extracranial CeAD in the adult population, explore recent research on diagnosing this disorder, evaluate the most current research on treatment options, and summarize the prognosis of CeAD.

Discussion

CeAD is an uncommon but important cause of stroke in the young that is likely caused by multifactorial processes. The diagnosis should be considered in those with underlying risk factors, a remote history of minor trauma, and concerning signs and symptoms. The condition should be pursued via magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography angiography. Treatment should be aimed at preventing additional complications, including recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack, with antiplatelets, anticoagulants, or even endovascular or surgical therapy.

Conclusion

Overall, the prognosis of patients with CeAD is good, with relatively low death rates. However, the diagnosis should not be missed, because treatment may help prevent worsening or persistent ischemia, recurrent dissection, and death.

### Carotid and vertebral artery dissections: clinical aspects, imaging features and endovascular treatment [^116wdjAN]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Extracranial arterial dissections are a recognised cause of stroke, particularly in young adults. Clinical diagnosis may be difficult, and the classical triad of symptoms is uncommon. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of extracranial arterial dissections, and this review provides a detailed discussion of the relative merits and limitations of currently available imaging modalities. Conventional arteriography has been the reference standard for demonstrating an intimal flap and double lumen, which are the hallmarks of a dissection, and for detecting complications such as stenosis, occlusion or pseudoaneurysm. Noninvasive vascular imaging methods, such as ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) are increasingly replacing conventional angiography for the diagnosis of carotid and vertebral dissections. Ultrasound provides dynamic and "real-time" information regarding blood flow. Source data of MRA and CTA and additional cross-sectional images can provide direct visualisation of the mural haematoma and information about the vessel lumen. Anticoagulation to prevent strokes is the mainstay of medical treatment, but randomised trials to define the optimal treatment regime are lacking. Surgery has a limited role in management of dissections, but endovascular procedures are gaining importance for treatment of complications and if medical management fails.

### Extracranial cervical artery dissections [^115JUgzY]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Cervical artery dissections (CeAD) include both internal carotid and vertebral artery dissections. They are rare but important causes of stroke, especially in younger patients. CeAD should be considered in patients with strokelike symptoms, a new-onset headache and/or neck pain, and/or other risk factors. Early imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is key to making the diagnosis. Treatment may vary depending on the extent of the dissection, timing of the dissection, and other comorbidities. The overall prognosis is good, but does depend on the initial severity of symptoms.

### Spontaneous dissection of the coronary and vertebral arteries post-partum: case report and review of the literature [^112HJAHy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary and vertebral artery dissections are rare events occurring most commonly in otherwise healthy women during pregnancy or the post-partum period.

Case Presentation

This report describes a 35-year-old female who presented with an acute inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction 7 months post-partum secondary to spontaneous dissection of the left obtuse marginal coronary artery. Despite appropriate medical therapy with dual anti-platelet therapy, the patient presented four weeks later with a spontaneous dissection of the right vertebral artery.

Conclusion

We review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of spontaneous dissections of the vasculature in the peri-partum period.

### Stroke recurrence in children with vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm [^116paMTq]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Pediatric vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm is a subtype of vertebral artery dissection that can be challenging to diagnose and may be associated with stroke recurrence. This study examines the presenting features, clinical outcomes, and recurrence risk in a cohort of children with vertebral artery dissection, comparing those with aneurysms with those without.

Materials and Methods

The medical records of children evaluated for vertebral artery dissection were retrospectively reviewed for neurologic presentation, treatment, stroke recurrence, and angiographic appearance of dissection. Cohort patients were categorized into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of a vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm and compared via the Fisher exact test, Student t test, and log-rank analyses. P < .05 was deemed statistically significant.

Results

Thirty-two patients met the inclusion criteria, including 13 with vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms. Five cases of vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm were missed on the initial evaluation and diagnosed retrospectively. All patients received antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy at the time of diagnosis. Children in the vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm group were more likely to present with stroke (P = 0.059), present at a younger age (P < .001), and have recurrent stroke (P < .001) compared with the group of children with vertebral artery dissection without an aneurysm. After surgery, no patients with vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm experienced recurrent stroke (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Vertebral artery dissecting aneurysm is often missed on the initial diagnostic evaluation of children presenting with stroke. In children with vertebral artery dissection, the presence of an aneurysm is associated with stroke presentation at a younger age and stroke recurrence.

### Vertebral artery dissection: spectrum of imaging findings with emphasis on angiography and correlation with clinical presentation [^114sQ7om]. Radiographics (2000). Low credibility.

A study was performed to evaluate the relationship between the imaging features and clinical presentation of vertebral artery (VA) dissection. Twenty-two patients with 24 VA dissections at angiography and clinical evaluation also underwent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The angiographic patterns of VA dissection were categorized as aneurysmal (n = 10) or steno-occlusive (n = 14). All 10 patients (10 lesions) with the aneurysmal pattern had dissection in the V4 (intradural) segment and presented with headache (n = 5), neurologic deficit (n = 2), dizziness (n = 2), or altered mentality (n = 1). However, the 12 patients (14 lesions) with the steno-occlusive pattern had dissection from the V1 segment to the V4 segment and presented with neurologic deficits caused by infarction of an embolic nature. Overall, the most frequent VA dissection site was the V4 segment. The distribution of the dissection sites and the clinical presentation tended to differ according to the angiographic patterns of aneurysm or stenosis-occlusion.

### Management of intracranial vertebral artery dissections initially presenting without subarachnoid hemorrhage [^111wPjGJ]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The clinical and angiographic follow-up results for intracranial vertebral artery (VA) dissections that initially presented without subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were retrospectively investigated, to clarify their management.

Methods

Twenty-one patients with VA dissections that initially presented without SAH were studied. Initial angiography revealed aneurysmal dilation in 11 cases (typical pearl-and-string sign in 8 cases, aneurysmal dilation only in 2, and aneurysmal dilation with double-lumen sign in 1), occlusion in 7, double-lumen sign in 2, and string-like stenosis in 1. Nine patients (six with pearl-and-string sign, one with occlusion with aneurysmal dilations, and two with double-lumen sign), including three patients who experienced subsequent SAH, underwent endovascular proximal parent artery occlusion. The other 12 patients were treated conservatively. All patients were monitored with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography.

Results

Three patients experienced subsequent SAH, 1 day (two patients) or 51 months after onset. Follow-up angiographic assessments of the 20 patients demonstrated complete resolution in five cases, reduction of aneurysmal dilation in one case, and partial recanalization in one case. However, enlargement or formation of an aneurysmal dilation was recognized in four cases and progression of dissection was observed in one case. Eighteen patients experienced good recoveries, and three patients demonstrated moderate disabilities as a result of the initial ischemic insult.

Conclusion

The risk of bleeding from unruptured VA dissections is higher than previously considered. Therefore, endovascular treatment should be considered for patients with VA dissections with relatively large or growing aneurysmal dilations.

### Lateral medullary syndrome and ipsilateral hemiplegia (opalski syndrome) due to left vertebral artery dissection… [^114s3dyL]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

After a neck trauma, a 26-year-old woman developed sudden left headache and vomiting. On admission, she displayed left Horner syndrome with ipsilateral reduced facial sensation to pain and temperature that was crossed in the body, affecting the right limbs. In addition, she had left hemiparesis with dysesthesia in the left hemibody. Proprioception was normal. Results from laboratory tests, chest radiography, and electrocardiography were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed a large infarct located in the low medulla oblongata and upper cervical cord. Magnetic resonance angiography displayed abrupt luminal stenosis of the left proximal vertebral artery and subacute intramural hematoma, suggesting arterial dissection. The basilar artery was normal. Intravenous heparin sodium was given immediately. During the next 2 weeks, the patient recovered from her weakness almost completely.

She was discharged on the 15th day with a prescription for oral warfarin sodium. García-García J, Ayo-Martín Ó, Segura T. Lateral Medullary Syndrome and Ipsilateral Hemiplegia Due to Left Vertebral Artery Dissection. Arch Neurol. 2009; 66: 1574–1575.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112ADKEL]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cervical artery dissection:

- **Definition**: Cervical artery dissection is a term that encompasses carotid and vertebral artery dissection.
- **Pathophysiology**: The majority of cervical artery dissections are spontaneous, while a smaller percentage of cases involve cervical trauma and cervical spine manipulations. A tear in the intima or rupture of the vasa vasorum with bleeding within the media may represent the initial precipitating factor.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of carotid artery dissections include neck pain, headache, and Horner's syndrome, which may be followed by retinal or cerebral ischemia in carotid artery dissections. Vertebral artery dissection presents with occipito-cervical pain, followed by posterior circulation ischemic symptoms including vertigo, dysarthria, visual field deficit, ataxia, and diplopia. Disease progression may lead to spinal cord infarction and stroke.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Cervical artery dissection is associated with a mortality rate of 15–20% and is increased in patients with severe disability at presentation.

### Behavior of extracranial-to-intracranial extended arterial dissections of the vertebral artery [^1173YTD2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cervicocephalic artery dissection (CCAD) is an important cause of stroke in children and young or middle‐aged adults. It can be generally differentiated into extracranial and intracranial arterial dissections, depending on its location. The incidence of intracranial artery dissections appears to be lower than that of extracranial artery dissections in populations of European ethnic origin, whereas in reports from populations of Asian ethnicity, intracranial artery dissections account for approximately two‐thirds of CCAD.

The differences in the clinical behavior of extracranial and intracranial arterial dissections are partly attributable to differences in arterial wall physiology. Compared with extracranial arteries, intracranial artery walls lack external elastic lamina and have a thinner media thickness. The extracranial arteries are thus more resistant to dissecting tears, resulting in dissections localized to the intima or media. These patients would usually present with neck pain, headaches, or ischemia. Intracranial artery dissection is more susceptible to subadventitial involvement and complete arterial rupture, resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as well as headache or ischemia.

In some patients, dissection originating from the extracranial portion of the cervicocephalic arteries may extend into the intracranial segment. Intracranial extension of extracranial dissection is known to be more frequent in vertebral artery dissections (VADs). However, the clinical behavior of extracranial‐to‐intracranial extended VAD (e+iVAD) has not been elucidated. The rates of ischemic or hemorrhagic presentations and the subsequent risks of ischemic or hemorrhagic complications have not been extensively studied.

Accordingly, we aimed to understand the clinical and prognostic features of e+iVAD. In this single‐center CCAD registry, we compared the clinical and prognostic features of e+iVAD with intracranial VAD (iVAD). We further analyzed high‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR‐MRI) of the intracranial portion of the VAD to elucidate the cause of the differences in clinical presentation.

### Recanalization of vertebral artery dissection [^115G1inP]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We investigated the predictors and time course for recanalization after vertebral artery dissection.

Methods

We prospectively studied 61 consecutive patients with confirmed diagnoses of vertebral artery dissection without intracerebral hemorrhage. Neuroimaging and clinical follow-up were performed at presentation and at 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results

We included 61 patients with confirmed vertebral artery dissection; 19 were evaluated and followed up with conventional angiography, 24 with MR angiography, and 18 with CT angiography. Fifty-one patients had a stenotic dissection, 7 had an occlusive dissection, one had a double-lumen image, and 2 had a pseudoaneurysm. The estimated rate of complete recanalization after vertebral artery dissection was 45.9% at 3 months, 62.3% at 6 months, and 63.9% at 12 months. We found no association between outcome and complete or partial recanalization nor did we find any factors associated with recanalization.

Conclusions

These results suggest that recanalization of vertebral artery dissection occurs mainly within the first 6 months after the onset of symptoms regardless of the location or pattern of the dissection.

### Vertebral artery dissection and posterior stroke in a child [^114PgDeH]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Vertebral artery dissection is a relatively rare disease. Its symptoms and signs can be misleading, making the diagnosis, even with imaging assistance, difficult. We describe an 8-year-old boy in whom a brain tumor was suspected because of neurological signs and findings on computerized tomography of the brain. The differential diagnosis was broadened with further imaging evaluation. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated vertebral artery dissection, which was attributed to a trivial trauma the child had experienced 1 week before presentation. During the follow-up period, the child recovered, except for residual right hemianopsia.

### Management of stroke in neonates and children: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116uSkkS]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Posterior circulation arterial ischemic stroke in children — demographics, presenting features, and vertebral artery dissection: Children typically present at a median age of 7 to 8 years, are predominantly male (67% to 77%), and are previously healthy in most cases. Localizing posterior circulation deficits occur in 70% to 100%, while nonlocalizing symptoms occur in 60% to 70%. Vertebral artery dissection is the most common underlying cause (25%–50%), often preceded by minor head or neck trauma, and multiple posterior circulation infarcts of varying age at presentation are especially suspicious for dissection.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: spontaneous cervical artery dissection [^112m9net]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous cervical artery dissection (sCAD) is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of sCAD, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

sCAD is a condition affecting the carotid or vertebral arteries and occurs as a result of injury and compromise to the arterial wall layers. The dissection most commonly affects the extracranial vessels but may extend intracranially, resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patients typically present with symptoms due to compression of local structures, and the presentation depends on the vessel affected. The most common symptom is headache and/or neck pain. Signs and symptoms of ischemia may occur, including transient ischemic attack and stroke. There are a variety of risk factors for sCAD, including underlying connective tissue or vascular disorders, and there may be an inciting event involving minimal trauma to the head or neck. Diagnosis includes imaging, most commonly computed tomography angiography of the head and neck. Ultrasound can diagnose sCAD but should not be used to exclude the condition. Treatment includes specialist consultation (neurology and vascular specialist), consideration of thrombolysis in appropriate patients, symptomatic management, and administration of antithrombotic medications.

Conclusions

An understanding of sCAD can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Persistent headache without neurologic deficit from a spontaneous vertebral artery dissection [^112KejCL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-traumatic headache is a common complaint seen in the emergency department (ED), accounting for 2.3% of ED visits per year in the United States (Munoz-Ceron et al., 2019). When approaching the workup and management of headache, an emergency medicine physician is tasked with generating a deadly differential by means of a thorough history and physical exam to determine the next best steps.

Case

A 21-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a debilitating new-onset headache, preceded by an isolated vertiginous event 3 days prior. He was found to have a normal neurologic examination. A non-contrast CT scan of the head revealed a large hypodensity within the left cerebellum with a subsequent MRA of the brain and neck notable for a left vertebral artery dissection, complicated by an ischemic cerebellar stroke.

Discussion

With an estimated incidence of 1–5 per 100,000, vertebral artery dissection is a rare cause of stroke within the general population and carries with it a high degree of morbidity and mortality (Rodallec et al., 2008). Vertebral artery dissection is a result of blood penetrating the intimal wall of the artery to form an intramural hematoma. Diagnosis can be difficult in cases presenting subacutely but a thorough history evaluating for red flags and using simple but highly sensitive exams such as the bedside HINTS exam can increase pretest probability of stroke. Clinical syndromes, red flags, and time from onset of symptoms should guide imaging modalities such as CT, CTA, MRI, and MRA in detection of small ischemic changes, intimal flaps, and luminal thromboses.

Conclusion

Vertebral artery dissection should remain high on the differential for an emergency medicine physician when history is suggestive of a new onset headache, preceded by vertiginous symptoms. An absence of recent trauma and a normal neurologic examination does not eliminate the diagnosis.

### Masking of vertebral artery dissection by severe trauma to the cervical spine [^114xYKpv]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A prospective case study was performed.

Objectives

To illustrate the association of cervical trauma with vertebral artery dissection, and to propose a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for suspected traumatic vertebral artery dissection.

Summary Of Background Data

Vertebral artery dissection is a recognized but underdiagnosed complication of trauma to the cervical spine. Symptoms of spinal cord injury, however, may obscure those of vertebral artery dissection, presumably causing gross underdiagnosis of this complication.

Methods

All patients with vertebral artery dissection admitted to the authors' facility between 1992 and 1997 were screened for cervical trauma.

Results

This article presents four patients with severe trauma to the cervical spine, defined as luxation, subluxation, or fracture, in whom symptoms of vertebral artery dissection developed after a delay ranging from several hours to weeks. The traumatic vertebral artery dissection typically was located at the site of vertebral injury or cranial to it. One patient with fracture of the odontoid process survived symptom free without ischemic brain infarctions. Another patient survived with traumatic quadriplegia in addition to large cerebellar and posterior cerebral artery infarctions. Two patients died as a result of fulminant vertebrobasilar infarctions, both with only moderate impairment from the primary spinal cord injury.

Conclusions

Early signs of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain, often localized to the site of intimal disruption, which may be disguised by the signs of the spinal injury. Early Doppler ultrasound and duplex sonography as a noninvasive screening method should be performed for patients with severe trauma to the cervical spine. In cases of vertebral artery dissection, immediate anticoagulation should be initiated. Traumatologists should be aware of this complication in evaluating patients with severe trauma of the cervical spine, and also for a variety of forensic reasons.

### Craniocervical arterial dissection: spectrum of imaging findings and differential diagnosis [^112T2rfH]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Craniocervical artery dissection is a potentially disabling yet probably underrecognized condition that often occurs in young and middle-aged adults. Accurate and prompt diagnosis of this condition is crucial because timely and appropriate therapy can significantly reduce the risk of stroke and long-term sequelae. Because of the great diversity in the clinical features of craniocervical artery dissection, imaging plays a primary role in its diagnosis. The increased diagnosis of this disorder in the past two decades can be attributed to an increased awareness of the clinical manifestations of internal carotid artery and vertebral artery dissection and to use of noninvasive diagnostic imaging techniques. To achieve an accurate diagnosis of craniocervical artery dissection, it is important to be familiar with its pathologic features (intimal tear, intramural hematoma, and dissecting aneurysm); the spectrum of imaging findings at color duplex ultrasonography, computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with MR angiography, and conventional angiography; and potential pitfalls in image interpretation.

### Craniocervical arterial dissection in children: pathophysiology and management [^111uygLo]. Pediatric Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Craniocervical arterial dissection is a commonly reported arteriopathy associated with stroke in children. It is characterized by a high stroke recurrence rate and variable outcomes. Here we review the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic neuroimaging approaches that are helpful in accurate diagnosis and follow-up of children with arterial dissection.

Methods

MEDLINE searches (2000 to 2018) for articles that contained patients aged less than 18 years with craniocervical arterial dissection was performed, with the goal of analyzing their presenting features, pathophysiological mechanisms, and imaging characteristics and interventions.

Results

Sixteen articles met the study criteria and reported 182 cases of craniocervical arterial dissection, 68% male, average age 8.6 years. Dissection was associated with head and neck trauma in 56% of the cases and frequently involved the posterior (61%) and extracranial locations (64%); the vertebral artery was the most commonly involved artery (60%). The most common clinical presentation was hemiparesis (80/160, 50%), followed by headache (64/164, 39%). Magnetic resonance imaging was the preferred neuroimaging method, followed by cerebral catheter angiography as a gold standard definitive neurovascular imaging modality when the initial vascular imaging revealed nondiagnostic findings.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of arterial dissection requires a high index of suspicion and consideration for detailed neurovascular imaging, including both the cranial and cervical regions. Neurovascular imaging challenges, especially visualization of arterial abnormalities, highlight the importance of appropriate and timely use of specific neurovascular imaging techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be the preferred neurovascular imaging modality in children with arterial dissection and may obviate the need for invasive cerebral catheter angiography.

### Traumatic vertebral artery dissection presenting with incomplete congruous homonymous quadrantanopia [^112QizYq]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Vertebral arterial dissection (VAD) may occur after neck trauma, and along with carotid artery dissections may account for 25–30% of ischaemic strokes in patients < 50 years. Diagnosis can be difficult due to its rarity and varied symptoms. Described here-in a case of VAD resulting in multiple cerebral infarctions. The diagnosis was made after finding a small congruous homonymous quadrantanopia.

### More than a pain in the neck: vertebral artery dissection and subarachnoid hemorrhage [^117ATfAz]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Intracranial vertebral artery dissection is an uncommon but important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. These patients have a predilection for early rebleeding that makes early diagnosis and intervention imperative. The arterial dissection and associated dissecting aneurysm are often located close to the origin of the posterior-inferior cerebellar artery. Endovascular treatment techniques have been increasingly employed. An illustrative case that was treated successfully with coils but complicated by a posterior-inferior cerebellar artery territory infarction is presented. The objectives are to highlight the clinical features of this condition and to describe the problems associated with treatment, particularly those related to the posterior-inferior cerebellar artery origin.

Conclusions

Dissection was not uncommon in patients with MI, especially in patients with lateral MI. Young patients with headache and non-sudden onset should remind clinician the possibility of sVAD.

### Cerebrovascular dissections – a review part I: spontaneous dissections [^116yhcwN]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Spontaneous cerebrovascular dissections are subintimal or subadventitial cervical carotid and vertebral artery wall injuries and are the cause of as many as 2% of all ischemic strokes. Spontaneous dissections are the leading cause of stroke in patients younger than 45 years of age, accounting for almost one fourth of strokes in this population. A history of some degree of trivial trauma is present in nearly one fourth of cases. Subsequent mortality or neurological morbidity is usually the result of distal ischemia produced by emboli released from the injury site, although local mass effect produced by arterial dilation or aneurysm formation also can occur. The gold standard for diagnosis remains digital subtraction angiography. Computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and ultrasonography are complementary means o evaluation, particularly for injury screening or treatment follow-up. The annual rate of stroke after injury is approximately 1% or less per year. The currently accepted method of therapy remains antithrombotic medication, either in the form of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents; however, no class I medical evidence exists to guide therapy. Other options for treatment include thrombolysis and endovascular therapy, although the efficacy and indications for these methods remain unclear.

### Unusual visual symptoms in a patient with bilateral vertebral artery dissection: a case report [^115ge65Y]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

We present a previously unreported set of symptoms in a patient found to have bilateral vertebral dissections. Although visual symptoms are common in vertebral dissection, their pattern does not typically mimic those that commonly precede or accompany migraine headache. When they do occur, they usually take the form of diplopia or blurred vision. The patient we describe had visual symptoms that varied over three episodes of headache and included transient visual field loss and scintillations ("lightning bolts"), both common in migraine. However, our patient's new visual symptoms represented a change in pattern from those that had accompanied her previous migraines. This detailed history-taking prompted an evaluation for an etiology other than migraine and prevented a further delay in diagnosis and treatment.

### Spontaneous dissection of the coronary and vertebral arteries post-partum: case report and review of the literature [^1175RX8Y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Spontaneous coronary and vertebral artery dissections are rare, life-threatening events occurring most commonly in otherwise healthy women during pregnancy or the post-partum period. In this patient population, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (CAD) is the cause of approximately 16% of myocardial infarctions (MI), as compared to only 1% in the general population. A more rare occurrence is spontaneous vertebral artery dissection (VAD) which has an incidence of only 0.0015% in the pregnant population. Spontaneous arterial dissection results from rupture and separation of the media creating a false lumen within the vessel wall without a traumatic or iatrogenic cause. Passage of blood into this false lumen forces the intimal-medial layer towards the true lumen of the vessel, causing partial or full obstruction of flow, ultimately leading to an ischemic event.

The pathogenesis of spontaneous vascular dissection is unclear. Spontaneous dissection of the vasculature may be associated with pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, cocaine use, or excessive exercise. Spontaneous CAD and VAD can also be the result of minor blunt force trauma, normally in combination with predisposing factors including collagen disorders such as Ehlers Danlos and Marfan syndrome. Physiological changes of pregnancy have also been proposed as potential mechanisms of injury to the vessel wall. High levels of progesterone or decreased collagen synthesis during pregnancy may weaken the tunica media of the vessel walls. As cardiac output increases by approximately 50% during pregnancy, the increase in shear stress on the vessel wall can cause a greater risk of media rupture.

The clinical presentation of dissection of the coronary or vertebral arteries varies from patient to patient. In women with spontaneous CAD, although chest pain is the most common presenting symptom, they may present with a myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock or sudden cardiac death. Spontaneous VAD can present as headache, neck pain, diplopia, transient ischemic attack, Horner's syndrome, or an ischemic stroke.

### The potential role of diffusion weighted imaging in the diagnosis of early carotid and vertebral artery dissection [^116oLUvL]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This was a retrospective study including patients with confirmed CAD based on clinical and radiological characteristics. This study has been approved by our local institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants regarding the use of clinical, paraclinical, and imaging data for research purposes.

Inclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria were a confirmed diagnosis of an arterial dissection in one or more of the VA or ICA based on clinical presentation and radiological findings. Clinical presentation is as follows: typical signs and symptoms of the cervical arterial dissection (like headaches, neck pain, Horner syndrome) as well as typical stroke-like symptoms (e.g. hemiparesis, hemihypesthesia, ataxia, aphasia, dysarthria, neglect, impaired vision). The time point of the first neurological symptom suggestive of dissection has been considered as CAD onset. We did not differentiate between trauma related or spontaneous CAD. Patients had to meet the following radiological criteria: The dissection had to be confirmed by at least one of the following examinations: MRI (T1w, T2w, and/or MRA), CTA, and/or DSA. In addition, the availability of brain/head and neck MRI including a DWI focusing on the area of the affected artery was mandatory. The final inclusion criterion was the availability of at least one of the angiographic imaging modalities (MRA, CTA or DSA) focusing on the affected artery in order to assess the length of dissected area.

Patient selection

From our continuously maintained stroke database, we screened 48 patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of CAD between January 2014 and December 2018. Eighteen patients were excluded because of missing imaging data (no MRI and/or no DWI available). Two further patients were excluded, one patient because of absence of medical history suggestive of dissection and typical dissection signs and symptoms and the other one because of absence of the imaging-based confirmation of the dissection.

To evaluate the specificity, we created a control group and screened for patients without CAD (with or without atherosclerotic lesions) and patients with a stenosis or occlusion of either of the ICA or the VA.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113EcjFH]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Imaging features and anatomic patterns in cervical artery dissection — diagnostic hallmarks, mimics, and location cues — are detailed: Hallmarks include intimal flap, intramural hematoma, double lumen, dissecting aneurysm, or tapering stenosis/occlusion, but pseudo-occlusion from distal occlusion, duplication or fenestration, chronic double-lumen states, and normal perivascular structures can mimic dissection; a crescentic (versus circumferential) appearance may favor dissection on postcontrast MRA or CTA. Carotid dissections commonly originate in the distal cervical internal carotid artery (2–3 cm above the bifurcation), while in the vertebral artery the majority are in the V2 or V3 segments; atherosclerosis usually occurs at the internal carotid artery bifurcation or V1 and V4 segments and is often associated with calcification, and a carotid web is a thin, linear membrane variant of fibromuscular dysplasia just beyond the carotid bifurcation. Differentiating acute from chronic dissection may be challenging and necessitates CTA analysis for a carotid ring sign or MRI for acute to subacute intramural hematoma.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116vRvPW]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

American Heart Association scientific statement — cervical artery dissection in adults: In patients with acute ischemic stroke attributable to cervical artery dissection, thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy are reasonable in otherwise eligible patients. We suggest that the antithrombotic therapy choice be individualized and continued for at least 3 to 6 months. The risk of recurrent dissection is low, and preventive measures may be considered early after the diagnosis and continued in high-risk patients. Cervical artery (internal carotid or vertebral artery) dissection can occur in the absence of major trauma.

### Vertebral artery dissection in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a case series and literature review [^113UVhkx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Arterial dissection is a rare complication of pregnancy and puerperium. There have been reports of aortic, coronary and cervical artery dissection in association with preeclampsia, however, vertebral artery dissection is rarely reported particularly in the antenatal setting in the presence of a Hypertensive Disorder of Pregnancy (HDP). The general annual incidence of symptomatic spontaneous cervicocephalic arterial dissection is 0.0026% and a data registry reported that 2.4% of these occurred in the post-partum period. The actual incidence of vertebral artery dissection in HDP is unknown as the current literature consists of case series and reports only with most documenting adverse outcomes. Given the presence of collateral circulation, unilateral vertebral artery dissections may go unrecognised and may be more common than suspected.

Case Presentation

We present a case series of four patients with vertebral artery dissection in association with HDP, two of which occurred in the antenatal setting and two in the post-partum setting. All our patients had favourable outcome with no maternal neurological deficit and live infants. Our discussion covers the proposed pathophysiology of vertebral artery dissection in HDP and the management of it.

Conclusion

Our case series highlights the need to consider VAD an important differential diagnosis when assessing pregnant women with headache and neck pain particularly in the context of HDP.

### Clinical and radiological features of medullary infarction caused by spontaneous vertebral artery dissection [^111H5nNc]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introductions

Medullary infarction (MI) is a rare but important type of ischaemic stroke. Increasing attention has been paid to the relationship between lesion topography of MI and different stroke mechanisms. Spontaneous vertebral artery dissection (sVAD) is an important cause of stroke mainly affecting young adults. Some patients with sVAD achieve partly or fully recovery of vertebral artery. The treatment strategies of sVAD are different from strokes of other causes, making it important to identify sVAD in clinical practice.

However, underestimation of sVAD in clinical practice was not uncommon as it requires more extensive investigations regarding arterial vessel walls. So far, little has been known about clinical and radiological features of MI caused by sVAD. The purpose of this study is to investigate clinical and radiological features in patients with MI caused by sVAD and to analyse characteristics that distinguish sVAD from other conditions.

### Behavior of extracranial-to-intracranial extended arterial dissections of the vertebral artery [^111mms26]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

A relatively higher rate of ischemic presentation was observed in the e+iVAD group. This was also observed in another study, which reported even higher rates of ischemic presentation compared with eVAD. The relative frequency of ischemic presentations compared with eVAD could be attributable to higher rates of luminal steno‐occlusions or involvement of branching arteries. The relative frequency of ischemic presentations compared with iVAD could partly be secondary to the heterogeneous presentations of iVAD; however, whether e+iVAD would be more thrombogenic than iVAD requires future research. There is a chance that a longer length of the dissecting segment in e+iVAD would result in more frequent thromboembolic stroke, whereas dissection attributable to perforator occlusion may vary according to the dissection location and perforator initiating sites, such as the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. It may also be partly associated with higher rates of intramural hematoma observed in e+iVAD. Previous literature reports the comparatively lower rate of intramural hematoma associated with iVAD compared with eVAD, also supporting our view that the behavior of e+iVAD resembles that of eVAD. The rate of intramural hematoma observed in HR‐MRI is prone to change with chronological age of arterial dissection. We suggest that there may not have been a higher rate of chronic lesions in the iVAD group. This proposition is based on the observation of more frequent headache presentations in the iVAD group, which is a recognized acute phase biomarker of cervicocephalic arterial dissections.

### Traumatic vertebral artery dissection presenting with incomplete congruous homonymous quadrantanopia [^114iqYEX]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

To describe a rare presentation of vertebral artery dissection (VAD) as a small but congruous incomplete homonymous hemianopia demonstrating use of visual field testing in the diagnosis.

Case presentation

A 30 year old woman had been unwell for 4 months with difficulty focusing, vertigo, dizziness and a feeling of falling to the right. A small but congruous right inferior homonymous quadrantanopia was found on examination leading to further investigation that uncovered a vertebral artery dissection and multiple posterior circulation infarctions including a left occipital stroke matching the field defect.

Conclusions

We describe an atypical case of VAD presenting with a small congruous quadrantanopia. This is a rare but significant condition that predisposes to multiple thromboembolic infarction that may be easily misdiagnosed and a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis.

### Behavior of extracranial-to-intracranial extended arterial dissections of the vertebral artery [^114C36uR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vertebral artery dissections (VADs) may extend from the extracranial to the intracranial vasculature (e+iVAD). We evaluated how the characteristics of e+iVAD differed from those of intracranial VAD (iVAD).

Methods and Results

From 2002 to 2019, among consecutive patients with cervicocephalic dissection, those with iVAD and e+iVAD were included, and their clinical characteristics were compared. In patients with unruptured dissections, a composite clinical outcome of subsequent ischemic events, subsequent hemorrhagic stroke, or mortality was evaluated. High-resolution magnetic resonance images were analyzed to evaluate intracranial remodeling index. Among 347 patients, 51 (14.7%) had e+iVAD and 296 (85.3%) had iVAD. The hemorrhagic presentation occurred solely in iVAD (0.0% versus 19.3%), whereas e+iVAD exhibited higher ischemic presentation (84.3% versus 27.4%; P < 0.001). e+iVAD predominantly presented steno-occlusive morphology (88.2% versus 27.7%) compared with dilatation patterns (11.8% versus 72.3%; P < 0.001) of iVAD. The ischemic presentation was significantly associated with e+iVAD (iVAD as a reference; adjusted odds ratio, 3.97 [95% CI, 1.67–9.45]; P = 0.002]). Patients with unruptured VAD showed no differences in the rate of composite clinical outcome between the groups (log-rank, P = 0.996). e+iVAD had a lower intracranial remodeling index (1.4 ± 0.3 versus 1.6 ± 0.4; P < 0.032) and a shorter distance from dural entry to the maximal dissecting segment (6.9 ± 8.4 versus 15.7 ± 7.4; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

e+iVAD is associated with lower rates of hemorrhages and higher rates of ischemia than iVAD at the time of admission. This may be explained by a lower intracranial remodeling index and less deep intrusion of the dissecting segment into the intracranial space.

### Delayed subarachnoid hemorrhage 7 years after cerebellar infarction from traumatic vertebral artery dissection [^112tUsfZ]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is an important cause of ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Dissections presenting with ischemia rarely cause SAH after more than a few hours, especially without radiographic evidence of pseudoaneurysm. We successfully treated a patient for persistent vessel injury presenting with SAH 7years after presenting with extracranial subocclusive dissection of the right vertebral artery and an associated right posterior inferior cerebellar artery stroke. This is one of only three reported cases of delayed SAH occurring more than 2weeks after an initial ischemic presentation of a VAD, and the only one without radiographic evidence of pseudoaneurysm at standard follow-up duration.

### Delayed vertebral artery dissection after mild trauma in a motor vehicle collision [^111th6e8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Vertebral artery dissection can be insidious and is a leading cause of stroke in young patients, second only behind cardioembolic events [1]. We present the case of a 42-year-old patient who presented to the emergency department with diaphoresis and a complaint of neck pain one month after a low speed motor vehicle collision. The patient was transferred to a stroke center where cerebral angiography showed severe vertebral artery stenosis with likelihood of dissection after a noncontrast CT was negative for hemorrhage. She was definitively treated with antiplatelet therapy and discharged to rehab. By reviewing the most recent literature, we better define this illness. Most commonly, patients with arterial dissection present with head or neck pain, stroke, and Horner syndrome. It is now thought that vertebral artery dissection is a multifactorial disease process where certain intrinsic factors are present in the setting of an exacerbating extrinsic factor such as a low speed car accident, direct trauma, heavy lifting, or a rotational sports injury. And while our patient was treated with antiplatelet therapy and intravascular intervention, vertebral artery dissection is rare and further research is required to better guide treatment as there is no definitive data showing superiority of either anticoagulation or antiplatelet pharmaceutics.

### Dissection of the posterior cerebral arteries… [^1116kQP3]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

He had a brief vision of a scintillating waterfall to his left. A week later, during which he continued to have an occipital ache, he again had a similar visual illusion to his left. Two days later he developed ptosis and left limb incoordination. Nine years previously, during extreme stress, he had developed a left hemiparesis due to a right putaminal hemorrhage and had first been found to be hypertensive. Blood pressure had been well controlled since. Immediately thereafter she noted that the left side of her face, left ear, left side of her trunk, and left limbs became numb. She curled up in a dystonic posture. The pop in the head was very transient, and the numbness went away in an hour. During the next hours and days she bumped into objects on her left but was not aware of a visual defect. Three days later, the left numbness returned, lasted 6 hours, and then cleared, leaving only a slight "dullness" in her left hand.

She became aware of some difficulty seeing objects to her left, an abnormality that persisted. Motor, sensory, and reflex functions were normal, and she walked normally. Magnetic resonance images showed an infarct that involved the right occipital and temporal lobes and the right ventrolateral thalamus in the distribution of thalamogeniculate branches of the PCA. An MRA showed a very abnormal right PCA with portions of dilation and narrowing, but the remainder of the extracranial and intracranial arteries were normal. In patients 1 and 2, the onset of symptoms after activities that involved changes in head position and movement, the onset with head and neck pain, the appearance of the PCAs on vascular imaging, and improvement with time make it clear that the vascular process in these patients was dissection. One of us has seen 2 other patients with intracranial vertebral artery dissections related to physical perturbation. One young man developed headache and diplopia after stretching for a ball during a volleyball game. The second patient was a fireman who was inadvertently hit forcibly on the side of the head by a large hose while helping to put out a fire. He had a dissection that extended from the intracranial vertebral artery into the basilar artery and became quadriparetic.

### Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in symptomatic vertebrobasilar atherosclerosis and dissection… [^115QCFpi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Patients were diagnosed as having vertebral dissection on clinical grounds and typical imaging findings, including angiographic appearance. Lesion location at the V3 segment was also considered suggestive of dissection. Atherothrombotic infarction was diagnosed on the basis of advanced age, presence of cardiovascular risk factors, and angiographic findings of occlusive disease in locations characteristically affected by atherosclerosis, particularly if these occurred in the setting of additional extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic involvement of the contralateral vertebral artery and anterior circulation.

Apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated and compared with DWI abnormalities to eliminate T2 shine-through. Patients with dissection had a history of hypertension in 45%, diabetes in 27%, and dyslipidemia in 54% of cases. Cerebral angiography was performed in 82% of patients, with the remainder undergoing magnetic resonance angiography. All patients had an electrocardiogram on admission, and echocardiography was performed in 86%. Median time to imaging was 48 hours, and 14 patients underwent imaging within 24 hours. Symptoms on presentation, vascular lesion site, and DWI patterns are illustrated in the Figure. The vascular lesion was proximal to the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery in 16 of 39 patients with atherosclerosis and in all cases of dissection.

In the atherosclerosis group, 15 had basilar artery or vertebrobasilar junction stenosis or occlusion, 7 had bilateral vertebral disease, and 17 had unilateral vertebral stenosis or occlusion. Vessel occlusion was present in 7 of 11 patients with arterial dissection. In the atherosclerosis group, 17 patients had at least 1 vertebral occlusion and 7 had basilar occlusion.

### Treatment and outcomes of cervical artery dissection in adults: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114DRvgj]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Clinical diagnostic challenges and symptom profile — because symptoms are often nonspecific, diagnosis is challenging; in a statewide study, 31% of patients were seen in the emergency department for possible related symptoms in the 14 days preceding diagnosis. Evaluation for suspected cervical artery dissection should include a detailed symptom history, questions about minor trauma, and a detailed neurological examination. Common initial symptoms include facial pain, headache (< 65%), and neck pain (≈50%), and isolated pain without cerebral ischemia occurs in 8% to 12% of diagnosed cases. In carotid dissection, pain may be associated with a (partial) Horner syndrome (≈25%) and cranial nerve palsies (≈12%), and both carotid and vertebral dissection can be associated with pulsatile tinnitus (≈8%). A partial Horner syndrome with new or worsening headache may suggest a carotid dissection diagnosis, and headache characteristics are not specific but can rarely be acute and of thunderclap nature.

### Risk factors and clinical presentation of cervical arterial dissection: preliminary results of a prospective case-control study [^114DDRK5]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional case-control study.

Objectives

To identify risk factors and clinical presentation of individuals with cervical arterial dissection.

Background

Cervical arterial dissection is a common cause of stroke in young people and has in rare cases been associated with cervical manipulative therapy. The mechanism is considered to involve pre-existing arterial susceptibility and a precipitating event, such as minor trauma. Identification of individuals at risk or early recognition of a dissection in progress could help expedite medical intervention and avoid inappropriate treatment.

Methods

Participants were individuals 55 years of age or younger from the Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia with radiologically confirmed vertebral or internal carotid artery dissection and an age- and sex-matched comparison group. Participants were interviewed about risk factors, preceding events, and clinical features of their stroke. Physical examination of joint mobility and soft tissue compliance was undertaken.

Results

Twenty-four participants with cervical arterial dissection and 21 matched comparisons with ischemic stroke but not dissection were included in the study. Seventeen (71%) of the 24 participants with dissection reported a recent history of minor mechanical neck trauma or strain, with 4 of these 17 reporting recent neck manipulative therapy treatment. Cardiovascular risk factors were uncommon, with the exception of diagnosed migraine. Among the participants with dissection, 67% reported transient ischemic features in the month prior to their admission for dissection.

Conclusion

Recent minor mechanical trauma or strain to the head or neck appears to be associated with cervical arterial dissection. General cardiovascular risk factors, with the exception of migraine, were not important risk factors for dissection in this cohort. Preceding transient neurological symptoms appear to occur commonly and may assist in the identification of this serious pathology.

### Intracranial vessel wall MR imaging of an intradural vertebral artery dissection [^115YLnh6]. Clinical Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of intracranial arterial dissections can be challenging due to the wide spectrum of imaging presentations. High-resolution vessel wall MR imaging can be a useful adjunct to conventional lumen-based imaging techniques for diagnosing arterial dissections. We present a case of a 37-year-old male with a history of a Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome presenting with acute onset of nausea, vertigo, and left body hemisensory loss of pain and temperature. A conventional brain MRI identified an acute infarct in the right lateral medulla, concordant with clinical symptoms of Wallenberg syndrome. CT angiogram of the head and neck showed lack of opacification of the right intradural vertebral artery. Intracranial vessel wall MR imaging showed findings suggestive of an intimal dissection flap with both intramural and intraluminal thrombus. Intracranial vessel wall MR imaging can provide complementary information to conventional lumen-based imaging to diagnose a vertebral dissection.

### The potential role of diffusion weighted imaging in the diagnosis of early carotid and vertebral artery dissection [^112AmqUx]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Arterial dissection (AD) is characterized by an intima tear leading to an intramural hematoma and a subsequent splitting of vessel wall layers. This causes a stenosis or an occlusion and potentially an aneurysmal dilatation of the vessel. The annual incidence of internal carotid artery (ICA) dissections is 1.72 per 100,000, and the annual incidence rate of vertebral artery (VA) dissections is 0.97 per 100,000. Clinically, cervical (carotid or vertebral) artery dissection (CAD) frequently presents with unilateral head and neck pain and may accompanied by a partial Horner's syndrome (oculosympathetic palsy) and followed in the next hours or days by cerebral and/or retinal ischemia. This classic clinical triad is present in less than one third of patients. However, if the patient presents with two of these three symptoms, this is highly suggestive of a CAD. In young adults, CAD is a frequent cause of ischemic stroke representing about 10–20%. In addition to the characteristic clinical presentation, the diagnosis of CAD is based on imaging, either ultrasound, computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is capable of detecting intramural hematoma (IMH) on T2-weighted and fat suppressed T1-weighted images.

Although the diagnostic strategy regarding CAD is quite straightforward, an early and accurate diagnosis can be challenging, particularly in young patients in whom CAD is one of the most common missed diagnosis of ischemic stroke. In the acute stage (24–48 h after symptom onset), IMH of the dissected artery may not be detected on both T2- and T1-weigthed images potentially leading to delayed or even missed diagnosis of CAD. It has been suggested that the IMH may show isointense signal intensities on fat saturated T1-weighted images compared to the adjacent surrounding tissues up to 7 days after symptom onset challenging an early accurate diagnosis. Therefore, there is a so far unmet medical need for additional imaging markers supporting the clinical diagnosis of CAD. Few studies have suggested that diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) may have potential added value in the early detection of IMH and CAD. A case series of four patients and an additional single case study demonstrated that dissected vertebral arteries can show a high signal intensity on DWI. Another study suggested that the DWI might be a useful complement to conventional MRI for identifying hemorrhage of carotid plaques and differentiation between IMH and intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH). However, larger confirmatory studies are lacking.

### Vertebral artery dissection masquerading as concussion in an adolescent [^112hjvvj]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Educate providers about the clinical presentation and consequences of delaying diagnosis of traumatic vertebral artery dissection with thromboembolic ischemic strokes in the pediatric population. Vertebral artery dissection is often difficult to diagnose and can be a potentially devastating cause of ischemic stroke.

Methods

Review of the chart, peer review/discussion, and imaging interpretation.

Results

A 16-year-old boy was admitted with confusion after a head and neck trauma was sustained while wrestling. (Glasgow Coma Scale = 15, NIHSS = 0). Investigations including computed tomography (CT) head and cervical spine were normal. He then developed severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headaches and was admitted for symptoms of concussion. Ten hours later, patient declined (hypertensive and unresponsive) and was noted to have decerebrate posturing. After emergent intubation, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Repeat CT head showed an acute left cerebellar infarct with associated cerebellar edema resulting in effacement of the fourth ventricle/basilar cisterns and acute hydrocephalus. The CT angiography and magnetic resonance imaging of brain confirmed arterial dissection and near occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the C2 level. Extensive infarct was seen in the left cerebellum, brainstem, and right cerebellum. During a prolonged hospital stay, the family opted to continue care, and he was transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation facility because of limited brainstem activity, being nonverbal, and not demonstrating purposeful spontaneous movements.

Conclusions

Detailed history and thorough neurological examination in conjunction with appropriate imaging are necessary to distinguish between brainstem/cerebellar ischemia from vertebral artery dissection and concussion.

### The diagnosis and management of supraaortic arterial dissections [^111oS8bX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent advances in understanding supraaortic arterial dissections and their diagnosis and management.

Recent Findings

Dissection of the supraaortic arteries, including the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries and intracranial arteries, is increasingly identified as an important cause of stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common cause likely involves minor trauma with preexisting arteriopathy. The imaging diagnosis of dissection is complicated by the wide range of pathological changes that occur after dissection. Modalities include ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, computed tomography angiography, and digital subtraction angiography. The choice of method is best tailored to each patient individually. Similarly, treatments may vary from antiplatelet medications to complex endovascular techniques. There are limited data to guide treating patients with strokes due to arterial dissections. Conservative management is likely optimal for most patients with cervical dissections, endovascular treatments being reserved for the rapidly deteriorating patient only. However, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a dissecting aneurysm require urgent endovascular or surgical treatment of the aneurysm.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of supraaortic arterial dissections is complex, and a variable multidisciplinary approach will likely yield the best outcome.

### Causes of misinterpretation of cross-sectional imaging studies for dissection of the craniocervical arteries [^115NVJtp]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This review presents some of the more common causes of false-positive and false-negative interpretations of cross-sectional imaging studies showing, or designed to show, dissection of the carotid or vertebral arteries.

Conclusion

Dissection of the craniocervical arteries is a diagnosis that can be very difficult on cross-sectional imaging studies such as CT angiography, MRI, and MR angiography.

### Differences and similarities between spontaneous dissections of the internal carotid artery and the vertebral artery [^1112rRdf]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

To compare potential risk factors, clinical symptoms, diagnostic delay, and 3-month outcome between spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection (sICAD) and spontaneous vertebral artery dissection (sVAD).

Methods

We compared patients with sICAD (n = 668) and sVAD (n = 302) treated in 3 university hospitals.

Results

Patients with sICAD were older (46.3 ± 9.6 versus 42.0 ± 10.2 years; P < 0.001), more often men (62.7% versus 53.0%; P = 0.004), and presented more frequently with tinnitus (10.9% versus 3.4%; P < 0.001) and more severe ischemic strokes (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, 10 ± 7.1 versus 5 ± 5.9; P < 0.001). Patients with sVAD had more often bilateral dissections (15.2% versus 7.6%; P < 0.001) and were more often smokers (36.0% versus 28.7%; P = 0.007). Thunderclap headache (9.2% versus 3.6%; P = 0.001) and neck pain were more common (65.8% versus 33.5%; P < 0.001) in sVAD. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (6.0% versus 0.6%; P < 0.001) and ischemic stroke (69.5% versus 52.2%; P < 0.001) were more frequent in sVAD. After multivariate analysis, sex difference lost its significance (P = 0.21), and all other variables remained significant. Time to diagnosis was similar in sICAD and sVAD and improved between 2001 and 2012 compared with the previous 10-year period (8.0 ± 10.5 days versus 10.7 ± 13.2 days; P = 0.004). In sVAD, favorable outcome 3 months after ischemic stroke (modified Rankin Scale, 0–2: 88.8% versus 58.4%; P < 0.001), recurrent transient ischemic attack (4.8% versus 1.1%; P = 0.001), and recurrent ischemic stroke (2.8% versus 0.7%; P = 0.02) within 3 months were more frequent.

Conclusions

sICAD and sVAD patients differ in many aspects. Future studies should perform separate analyses of these 2 entities.

### The use of tissue plasminogen activator in the treatment of wallenberg syndrome caused by vertebral artery dissection [^115XTwY9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is a devastating cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Up to 10% of acute CVAs in young patients are caused by dissection of the vertebral or carotid artery. Wallenberg syndrome results from a CVA in the vertebral or posterior inferior artery of the cerebellum and manifests as various degrees of cerebellar dysfunction. The administration of a thrombolytic medication has been recommended in the treatment of patients with stroke caused by cervical artery dissection. Surprisingly, there is scant literature on the use of this medication in the treatment of this condition.

Case Report

We describe a 42-year-old man with the sudden onset of headache, left-sided neck pain, vomiting, nystagmus, and ataxia 1 h after completing a weightlifting routine. Computed tomography angiography revealed a grade IV left vertebral artery injury with a dissection flap extending distally and resulting in complete occlusion. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging and angiography demonstrated acute left cerebellar and lateral medullary infarcts, consistent with Wallenberg syndrome. The patient was treated with tissue plasminogen activator, which failed to resolve his symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians frequently manage patients with acute CVAs. For select patients, the administration of tissue plasminogen activator can improve outcomes. However, the risk of major hemorrhage with this medication is significant. Cervical artery dissection is an important cause of acute stroke in young patients and is often missed on initial presentation. It is imperative for the emergency physician to consider acute cervical artery dissection as a cause of stroke and to be knowledgeable regarding the efficacy of thrombolytic medications for this condition.

### Fibromuscular dysplasia: what the radiologist should know: a pictorial review [^117VFRWw]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an idiopathic, segmentary, non-inflammatory and non-atherosclerotic disease that can affect all layers of both small- and medium-calibre arteries. The prevalence of FMD is estimated between 4 and 6% in the renal arteries and between 0.3 and 3% in the cervico-encephalic arteries. FMD most frequently affects the renal, carotid and vertebral arteries, but it can theoretically affect any artery. Radiologists play an important role in the diagnosis of FMD, and good knowledge of FMD's signs will certainly help reduce the delay between the first symptoms and diagnosis. The common string-of-beads aspect is well known, but less common presentations also have to be considered. These less common imaging findings include vascular loops, fusiform vascular ectasia, arterial dissection, aneurysm and subarachnoid haemorrhage. These radiologic presentations should be known by radiologists in order to diagnose possible FMD, particularly when present in young females or when associated with personal or familial hypertension, to reduce the delay between the onset of the first symptom and the final diagnosis. The patients have to be referred to specialised FMD centres for dedicated management.

Teaching Points

- Fibromuscular dysplasia is not a rare disease.

- Radiologists should recognise less common presentations to orient specific management.

- Vascular loops, fusiform vascular ectasia and a "string-of-beads" aspect are typical presentations.

- Arterial dissection, aneurysm and subarachnoid haemorrhage are less typical radiologic presentations.

### Case report: COVID-19 infection and cervical artery dissection [^112XUxsh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT.

A 45-year-old woman presented 3 days after symptom resolution from a COVID-19 infection with a left vertebral artery dissection with no known preceding trauma or underlying disposition. She subsequently suffered a left lateral medullary stroke 15 hours after her initial presentation. Cervical artery dissections (CeAD) can occur in the absence of trauma, and in some cases, infection may be a contributing factor. COVID-19 infection can cause an endotheliopathy and inflammatory response, which may contribute to intimal vessel disruption. Whether COVID-19 infection can contribute to CeAD and subsequent stroke is discussed, along with other considerations regarding the pathogenesis of CeAD.

### Subarachnoid hemorrhage as a presentation of basilar artery dissection [^112UC7os]. Neurocritical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Subarachnoid hemorrhages caused by intracranial dissections are rare. The management of dissections in these cases not clear.

Methods

Case report.

Results

An 82-year-old woman presented with acute drowsiness and vomiting. CT scan demonstrated extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage and hydrocephalus that subsequently required placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Angiography revealed extensive basilar artery dissection and no aneurysms. The dissection did not produce a critical stenosis and, taking into consideration that the patient had a previous occlusion of her distal left vertebral artery, it was decided to manage the patient conservatively. On a 3-month follow-up, the patient was free of recurrent events.

Conclusion

Basilar artery dissection can present with subarachnoid hemorrhage. No guidelines are available for management of basilar artery dissections and treatment should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Investigation of the characteristics of headache due to unruptured intracranial vertebral artery dissection [^114TXmv4]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

It is sometimes difficult to diagnose intracranial vertebral artery dissection in patients with headache as the only symptom. Knowledge of the characteristics of the headache would facilitate the diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to clarify the characteristics of intracranial vertebral artery dissection-related headache using our original self-administered questionnaire.

Methods

Via the questionnaire, we ascertained headache characteristics and investigated whether they differed between two types of unruptured intracranial vertebral artery dissection, headache type and ischemic type, based on analysis of the responses. Then, we tried to validate the consistency of commonly used criteria for intracranial artery dissection by comparing them with our results.

Results

Thirty-seven patients were analyzed. Our results identified the following seven headache characteristics in patients with intracranial vertebral artery dissection: (i) occurring in the occipitonuchal region (89%); (ii) unilateral (81%); (iii) pulsatile (70%); (iv) of acute onset (70%); (v) severe (73%); (vi) without nausea or vomiting (73%); and (vii) with concomitant clinical symptoms unrelated to ischemia (81%). Comparison of headache characteristics between the two types of intracranial vertebral artery dissection headache showed that the pain was significantly more severe in headache type than ischemic type intracranial vertebral artery dissection (p = 0.01). Concomitant clinical symptoms occurred significantly more often in ischemic type than headache type intracranial vertebral artery dissection (p = 0.03). Our results generally satisfied the established headache diagnostic criteria.

Conclusion

The pain characteristics of headache type and ischemic type intracranial vertebral artery dissection shown in our study may facilitate its diagnosis.

### Head / neck pain characteristics after spontaneous cervical artery dissection in the acute phase and on a long-run [^115d6Zhq]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Recently, sCeAD-related research has primarily focused on genetic and pathophysiologic work-up as well as the identification of laboratory biomarkers establishing the risk of dissection recurrence. Head/neck pain is well recognised as one of the most frequent symptoms in sCeAD and, as it can predate cerebral ischemia in these subjects, early clinical detection is of the essence Over the past decade, increased availability of MR imaging has facilitated the diagnosis of sCeAD, in the anterior and even more so in the posterior circulation. Most of what we know about headache characteristics in sCeAD stems from older descriptive studies that are likely to have missed smaller and non-stenotic dissections as well as dissections of the vertebral arteries. Through our study, we present an in-depth analysis of head/neck pain encompassing characteristics in the acute phase and on a long-run within our large single-centre long-term cohort of sCeAD patients (ReSect study). To date, sCeAD-related head/neck pain in the acute phase has mostly been described as gradual at onset, of throbbing quality, of moderate to severe intensity and unilaterally ipsilateral to the dissected cervical artery. Our data, as depicted in Tables 1–3 and Figure 1, however, suggests otherwise. In our cohort, each patient reported a sudden onset of head/neck pain, which additionally was continuous in course and rarely responded to self-administered oral analgesics. A pulling pain quality was present in half of patients with sCeAD. Neck pain was mostly reported in the postero-lateral region. Due to the dissemination of the pain, however, the exact localisation could not be addressed systematically in this study. The traditional presentation (throbbing to dull) was the predominant pain characteristic in internal carotid artery dissection in our evaluation. This fits well to the hypothesis that older studies primarily included subjects with internal carotid artery sCeAD with only more recent studies being able to adequately encapsulate vertebral artery dissection as well, as a result of imaging modality improvement. Further, our data does not support recent studies suggesting a high prevalence of thunderclap-like onset of sCeAD-related headache (described in up to 45%) and high frequency of migraine-like features such as phono- and photophobia in sCeAD subjects, if the vertebral artery is affected. Au contraire, thunderclap-like onset was reported in only 5.5% of cases in our cohort and was predominantly evident if subjects presented with cerebral ischemia (11 of 12 reporting thunderclap-like onset had ischemia); however, thunderclap headache per se was not a predictor for ischemia (p = 0.064). Photo- and phonophobia were equally rare. Consequently, in the acute phase, sCeAD-related head/neck pain can be differentiated from primary headache syndromes most certainly as it is characterised as novel in almost all cases; furthermore, accompanying symptoms such as photo- and phonophobia, nausea and osmophobia only rarely occur in sCeAD related head/neck pain (Figure 1). Therefore, it can be emphasised that in an emergency department setting the clinical distinction between sCeAD and primary headaches can be based on the red flag "onset of a new type of headache". Presence of accompanying symptoms, usually related to migraine, render sCeAD less likely. Additionally, our data aids in counselling patients, in that sCeAD-related head/neck pain always resolves within a median of 2 weeks. Still, novel recurring head/neck pain heterogeneous in quality and intensity developed in the long-run in one of four subjects. This is considerably higher than in previous clinical studies of sCeAD-related pain and exceeds the expected rate of developing a new type of chronic headache in the general population.

### Postpartum internal carotid and vertebral arterial dissections [^111GZMNS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Headache and neck pain are common postpartum symptoms. However, these symptoms can rarely be associated with internal carotid artery and vertebral artery dissections. We aimed to review five cases of postpartum cervical artery dissection and to review the clinical course of previously reported cases.

Methods

Patients with postpartum dissections diagnosed at our institution since 2005 were identified through a database maintained by the senior author, and their clinical data were reviewed. Additionally, a literature search for previously reported cases was performed, and the clinical data in those reports were reviewed.

Results

Five patients presented with cervical artery dissections within 6 weeks postpartum. Four patients had delivered vaginally and one delivered by emergent cesarean. Headache and neck pain were the primary presenting symptoms of all five patients. Four patients demonstrated neurologic symptoms, and one had development of stroke. Two patients had single internal carotid artery dissections, one patient had bilateral dissections of the vertebral artery, and two patients had dissections in the internal carotid artery and vertebral artery. All patients were treated with either anticoagulation therapy or antiplatelet therapy. Two patients required endovascular stenting. Four of five patients returned to neurologic baseline after treatment. A literature search yielded 27 previously reported cases, with similar clinical characteristics of older reproductive age, presentation days to weeks from delivery, and recovery to neurologic baseline in the majority of patients.

Conclusion

Postpartum cervical dissections are rare occurrences that require prompt diagnosis to prevent long-term neurologic deficits. Individualized management strategies include medical treatment (anticoagulation therapy, antiplatelet therapy, or anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy) and endovascular recanalization.

### Differential features of carotid and vertebral artery dissections: the CADISP study [^115i6QgS]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether risk factor profile, baseline features, and outcome of cervical artery dissection (CEAD) differ according to the dissection site.

Methods

We analyzed 982 consecutive patients with CEAD included in the Cervical Artery Dissection and Ischemic Stroke Patients observational study (n = 619 with internal carotid artery dissection [ICAD], n = 327 with vertebral artery dissection [VAD], n = 36 with ICAD and VAD).

Results

Patients with ICAD were older (p < 0.0001), more often men (p = 0.006), more frequently had a recent infection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–2.31]), and tended to report less often a minor neck trauma in the previous month (OR = 0.75 [0.56–1.007]) compared to patients with VAD. Clinically, patients with ICAD more often presented with headache at admission (OR = 1.36 [1.01–1.84]) but less frequently complained of cervical pain (OR = 0.36 [0.27–0.48]) or had cerebral ischemia (OR = 0.32 [0.21–0.49]) than patients with VAD. Among patients with CEAD who sustained an ischemic stroke, the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at admission was higher in patients with ICAD than patients with VAD (OR = 1.17 [1.12–1.22]). Aneurysmal dilatation was more common (OR = 1.80 [1.13–2.87]) and bilateral dissection less frequent (OR = 0.63 [0.42–0.95]) in patients with ICAD. Multiple concomitant dissections tended to cluster on the same artery type rather than involving both a vertebral and carotid artery. Patients with ICAD had a less favorable 3-month functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score > 2, OR = 3.99 [2.32–6.88]), but this was no longer significant after adjusting for baseline NIHSS score.

Conclusion

In the largest published series of patients with CEAD, we observed significant differences between VAD and ICAD in terms of risk factors, baseline features, and functional outcome.

### Traumatic vertebral artery dissection presenting with incomplete congruous homonymous quadrantanopia [^114uGrvf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

This case demonstrates the importance of ancillary imaging in making the diagnosis. CT angiography provides accurate imaging of the vessel lumen and dissection length. It can identify VAD in both large and medium vessel dissections in the neck. T1-weighted MRI is an alternative but may not detect initial stages of intramural haemorrhage seen in early VAD. It is for this reason that, recent studies suggest that CTA is the preferred imaging modality to identify cervical dissections, especially for VAD.

Management of VAD to prevent further embolic stroke is done on a case by case basis. There is no data to support the therapeutic superiority of anticoagulants over antiplatelet agents. In this case the patient had no contraindications to anticoagulants including intracranial arterial dissection, large stroke, enlarging intramural haematoma and/or high risk of bleeding. The presence of multiple cerebral emboli with no contra-indication favoured the use of anticoagulants in this case.

### Antiplatelet treatment compared with anticoagulation treatment for cervical artery dissection (CADISS): a randomised trial [^114TEdXj]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection is an important cause of stroke, especially in young people. In some observational studies it has been associated with a high risk of recurrent stroke. Both antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulant drugs are used to reduce risk of stroke but whether one treatment strategy is more effective than the other is unknown. We compared their efficacy in the Cervical Artery Dissection in Stroke Study (CADISS), with the additional aim of establishing the true risk of recurrent stroke.

Methods

We did this randomised trial at hospitals with specialised stroke or neurology services (39 in the UK and seven in Australia). We included patients with extracranial carotid and vertebral dissection with onset of symptoms within the past 7 days. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an automated telephone randomisation service to receive antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulant drugs (specific treatment decided by the local clinician) for 3 months. Patients and clinicians were not masked to allocation, but investigators assessing endpoints were. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral stroke or death in the intention-to-treat population. The trial was registered with EUDract (2006-002827-18) and ISRN (CTN44555237).

Findings

We enrolled 250 participants (118 carotid, 132 vertebral). Mean time to randomisation was 3.65 days (SD 1.91). The major presenting symptoms were stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n = 224) and local symptoms (headache, neck pain, or Horner's syndrome; n = 26). 126 participants were assigned to antiplatelet treatment versus 124 to anticoagulant treatment. Overall, four (2%) of 250 patients had stroke recurrence (all ipsilateral). Stroke or death occurred in three (2%) of 126 patients versus one (1%) of 124 (odds ratio [OR] 0.335, 95% CI 0.006–4.233; p = 0.63). There were no deaths, but one major bleeding (subarachnoid haemorrhage) in the anticoagulant group. Central review of imaging failed to confirm dissection in 52 patients. Preplanned per-protocol analysis excluding these patients showed stroke or death in three (3%) of 101 patients in the antiplatelet group versus one (1%) of 96 patients in the anticoagulant group (OR 0.346, 95% CI 0.006–4.390; p = 0.66).

Interpretation

We found no difference in efficacy of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs at preventing stroke and death in patients with symptomatic carotid and vertebral artery dissection but stroke was rare in both groups, and much rarer than reported in some observational studies. Diagnosis of dissection was not confirmed after review in many cases, suggesting that radiographic criteria are not always correctly applied in routine clinical practice.

4. The subgroup analyses showed that the antithrombotic treatment effect depended on whether the patients had a dissecting aneurysm at baseline. Patients without a dissecting aneurysm at baseline had a significantly reduced likelihood of the primary outcome when treated with anticoagulants rather than with antiplatelets. Future trials of CAD should therefore include this regimen.

Another possible treatment would be a combined strategy of antiplatelet agents and low-dose anticoagulants, similar to that tested in the COMPASS study. 29 A large observational study is currently under way to compare outcomes with different antithrombotic treatment options, including dual antiplatelet agents and direct oral anticoagulants, in a large CAD cohort of approximately more than 3600 participants, and will provide important results. 30 However definitive data on the optimal regimen for secondary prevention will only be provided by large, well-powered RCTs.

### Cervical arterial dissection: time for a therapeutic trial? [^113JPQsn]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cervical arterial dissection is a major cause of stroke in young adults, yet despite standard treatment with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, its management remains uncertain. The goal of this study was to assess the natural history of the disorder and to decide on the feasibility of a therapeutic trial.

Methods

Collaborating members of the Canadian Stroke Consortium prospectively enrolled consecutively referred patients with angiographically proven acute vertebral or carotid arterial dissection. Data recorded included clinical and radiological details, recurrence of ischemic cerebral events, and medical or surgical treatment.

Results

Of 116 patients, 67 had vertebral and 49 had carotid dissections, with no difference in age or sex. In 68 (59%), trauma occurred at the time of dissection. During the course of a 1-year follow-up, at least 17 patients (15%) had recurrent transient ischemic attacks, stroke, or death, mainly in the weeks immediately after the dissection. In 105 patients with complete follow-up, the event rate in those treated with anticoagulants was 8.3% and in those treated with aspirin was 12.4%, a nonsignificant difference of 4.1%. Using these data, we calculate that for a 2-arm trial (aspirin versus anticoagulants) with 80% power and 5% significance, 913 patients are needed in each group.

Conclusions

From our data indicating an initial relatively high recurrence rate, a multicenter trial of anticoagulants versus aspirin involving a total of 2000 patients is feasible.

### Pediatric homonymous superior quadrantanopia in the presence of acute vertebral artery dissection [^113JJh3H]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Spontaneous dissection of the vertebral artery is a dangerous and often underdiagnosed cause of posterior circulation and occipital lobe stroke in the young. Vertebral artery dissection should be considered in young patients with a history of minor, nontraumatic changes in head position and visual disturbances.

Methods

Clinical records for this patient were retrospectively reviewed at Miami Children's Hospital and associated pediatric ophthalmology clinic.

Results

A previously healthy 8-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of headache and blurred vision that developed after going on a high-velocity amusement park ride. Confrontation visual field testing showed a subtle superior visual field deficit superiorly. Computer topography scan of the head without contrast was performed and showed bilateral occipital hypodense lesions consistent with ischemic infarction. A filling defect was seen in the transverse portion of the right vertebral artery at the level of C2 as it exited the right transverse foramen, consistent with an acute arterial dissection at this level. Automated visual field testing showed macular sparing left homonymous superior quadrantanopia.

Conclusions

Most patients with vertebral artery dissection present with signs of posterior circulation ischemia consisting of neurological deficits, headaches, or neck pain. This case report highlights the unique clinical features and diagnostic imaging seen in the work-up of this rare disease process and exemplifies the importance of identifying acute visual symptoms in an emergency situation.

### Case report: COVID-19 infection and cervical artery dissection [^116MMesU]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

We report a patient with vertebral artery dissection causing lateral medullary infarction in the setting of a recent COVID-19 infection. The role of COVID-19 in CeAD remains unclear. Although further study is needed, COVID-19 may increase susceptibility to CeAD through several potential mechanisms, including cough, endotheliopathy, and inflammatory disruption of connective tissue in the intimal layer. Patients with a COVID-19 infection should be carefully monitored for dissection and endothelial disease, and with the appropriate clinical signs, including new headache, neck pain, and neurological deficits, suspicion for a possible CeAD is warranted.

### A preschool-age child with first-time seizure and ataxia [^112cAAQS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 4-year-old previously healthy child who had a possible first-time seizure at home, and upon a second Emergency Department evaluation was found to have gross cerebellar ataxia suggestive of acute stroke. Initial computed tomography scan and metabolic work-up were unrevealing. Subsequent neuroimaging demonstrated stroke in the left medulla and cerebellum secondary to left vertebral artery dissection. Cervical artery dissection may cause up to 20% of strokes in childhood and adolescence. Unlike typical adult presentations, antecedent or concurrent head and neck pain occurs less often in pediatric dissections. Symptoms of posterior circulation ischemia resulting from vertebral artery dissection may include vertigo, vomiting, ataxia, dysarthria, and seizure. Willingness to utilize newer, non-invasive imaging modalities may lead to earlier recognition of cervical artery dissection when patients have prodromal symptoms or episodes of transient ischemia. Vertebral artery dissection should be included in the differential diagnosis when evaluating children with first time seizure, headache, or neck pain.

### Headache in cerebrovascular diseases [^1166f9Cx]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Artery dissection

Cervical artery dissection (CAD) is divided into internal carotid artery dissection and vertebral artery dissection (VAD), in which blood flows into the wall of the cervical artery to form an intramural haematoma, which leads to stenosis, occlusion or aneurysmal changes of the artery.

Carotid dissection is the cause of stroke in 20% of young people. The average age of onset is 44 years. The pathophysiological mechanism of dissection is still unclear. Hypertension, migraine (especially migraine without aura), neck trauma and new infections (intracranial or systemic infections) are considered risk factors for carotid artery dissection. In most cases, headache and neck pain can be the initial symptoms. The headache or neck pain is likely caused by the direct tear in the blood vessel wall. Blood vessels, like arteries, have many nerves surrounding them. Irritation of the vessel wall likely leads to a series of events, including proinflammatory neurotransmitters from the perivascular nerve terminals. This may cause pain away from the area of the dissection. A retrospective study of carotid artery dissection and VAD found that 57% of patients had headache symptom. Headache associated with CAD has no special manifestation and sometimes it mimics other headaches such as migraine, cluster headache or thunderclap headache. Headache is often acute and continuous for days or longer, and located at the same side of the affected cervical vessel. If the patient only suffers from neck pain, the degree is often mild to moderate, and if he has headache with or without neck pain, the intensity is usually moderate to severe. Headache is more common in posterior circulation stroke than in anterior circulation, and the reasons have been speculated as follows. First, there are more dense vessels and abundant trigeminal nerve distribution in the posterior circulation system; second, the posterior cerebral arteries and superior cerebellar arteries supply part of the dura mater; third, the posterior circulation vessels might be more susceptible to spreading depolarisations.

CAD can be identified by a variety of different imaging modalities including CT angiography (CTA), MRI and DSA. Each of them offers their own advantages and disadvantages based on the clinical scenario. Therefore, the final diagnosis of carotid artery dissection should be made by combining the medical history, clinical manifestations and dynamic imaging findings.

Figure 1
Flowchart of patient selection.

BA indicates basilar artery; HR‐MRI, high‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging; PCA, posterior cerebral artery; and PICA, posterior inferior cerebellar artery.

Variables and Image Analysis

Clinical presentation was classified as ischemic, hemorrhagic, or headache and others. Baseline demographics were collected. The primary arterial luminal morphology was described as steno‐occlusion and dilatation (including stenosis and dilatation) patterns. The location of the dissection was categorized as intracranial (iVAD), extended (e+iVAD), or purely eVAD (excluded from study). Basilar artery involvement was documented. The primary treatment modality of the patient was classified as intra‐arterial intervention (primary intra‐arterial embolization, delayed intra‐arterial embolization, or intra‐arterial reperfusion) or medical management. In patients with ischemic presentation, the initial clinical severity was graded using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, which was measured 3 times daily during acute stroke unit care and then daily until discharge. Ischemic early neurologic deterioration was classified as an increase of ≥ 2 points in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score within 7 days postadmission in patients presenting with cerebral ischemia. Subsequent ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke was identified. Serial angiographic images were analyzed to evaluate arterial healing in patients who were not treated with primary intra‐arterial embolization.

Definition of Clinical Outcome

In patients presenting with unruptured VAD, the rates of clinical outcomes, including subsequent ischemic events (new ischemic stroke or ischemic early neurologic deterioration), subsequent hemorrhagic stroke, and mortality, were assessed up to the most recent follow‐up. Because of the heterogeneous outcome parameters in patients with unruptured iVAD, these parameters were combined to form a composite clinical outcome (subsequent ischemic event, hemorrhagic stroke, or mortality). Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis was performed to assess the comparative outcomes across groups concerning composite clinical outcomes, instances of subsequent ischemic events, subsequent hemorrhagic stroke, and mortality. Vascular outcomes, such as aneurysmal changes or arterial healing, were also evaluated. Aneurysmal change was characterized as an increase in the luminal diameter of the dissecting segment beyond the expected original diameter in any follow‐up angiography. Arterial healing was defined as any improvement observed in follow‐up luminal angiography after the diagnosis of prior stenosis or dilation. Arterial healing was evaluated in patients who did not receive interventional treatment during admission.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with carotid or vertebral artery dissection, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend extracranial endovascular therapy (stenting) in patients with AIS and extracranial carotid or extracranial vertebral arterial dissection experiencing definite recurrent cerebral ischemic events despite medical therapy.

### Spontaneous carotid and vertebral artery dissection in children [^1179YMDB]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Carotid and vertebral artery dissection is a rarely reported cause of stroke in childhood and adolescence, especially if there is not a direct trauma to the neck. Four patients, under 15 years of age, presented with an internal carotid artery dissection, and one patient presented with a vertebral artery dissection. They were all making a physical effort when the event occurred. The five patients had ischemic symptoms, and in two the events were preceded by transient ischemic attacks. Headache was associated in four patients. The diagnosis was made by magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, which included transfemoral angiography in two patients. All improved before leaving the hospital, and four patients did not suffer recurrent episodes. The diagnostic accuracy of artery dissection has improved because of noninvasive neuroimaging testing, but it should still be suspected in any pediatric ischemic stroke, especially if there is headache or cervical pain associated.

### Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and bilateral vertebral artery dissection presenting in a patient after cesarean section [^114v3bcA]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is characterized by sudden-onset thunderclap headache and focal neurologic deficits. Once thought to be a rare syndrome, more advanced non-invasive imaging has led to an increase in RCVS diagnosis. Unilateral vertebral artery dissection has been described in fewer than 40% of cases of RCVS. Bilateral vertebral artery dissection has rarely been reported. We describe the case of a patient with RCVS and bilateral vertebral artery dissection presenting with an intramedullary infarct treated successfully with medical management and careful close follow-up. This rare coexistence should be recognized as the treatment differs.

### MR diagnosis of vertebral artery dissection: value of 3D time-of-flight and true fast imaging with steady-state precession fusion imaging [^114EhXBb]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Our study had limitations. The major limitations to this pilot study include the small sample and lack of a normal vessel group. To confirm the coherence between TOF and true FISP, we might have to consider a control group of normal vessels. Second, complete blinding of the readers to the sequence type was not possible because their signal characteristics are quite typical. Third, TOF imaging may be affected by flow changes compared with contrast-enhanced MRA. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that luminal stenosis was overestimated on fused images. Lastly, fusion imaging of TOF and true FISP only evaluates the relationship between the inner and outer contours of vessels, without differentiating between arterial wall thickening due to arteriosclerosis and dissected arteries. To exclude atherosclerotic diseases, clinical presentations, supportive radiologic evidence and follow-up imaging are needed.

In conclusion, the fusion images provided more information regarding the arterial vessel wall. Fused images aided distinction between vertebral artery dissection versus vertebral artery hypoplasia. Fused images may have a supplementary role to play in TOF MRA images in the diagnosis of vertebral artery dissection.

### Comparison of test performance characteristics of MRI, MR angiography, and CT angiography in the diagnosis of carotid and vertebral artery dissection: a review of the medical literature [^113bmBf5]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Initial assessment of patients with suspected dissection of the carotid or vertebral arteries typically is made by MRI, alone or in combination with MR angiography (MRA) or CT angiography (CTA). We reviewed the medical literature to determine, based on test performance characteristics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, whether evidence could be found to support routine use of one imaging technique over the other for assessment of suspected dissection.

Conclusion

Test characteristics for MR techniques such as MRI and MRA were relatively similar to those for CTA in diagnosis of carotid and vertebral artery dissection.

### Vertebral artery dissection in a patient with wildervanck syndrome [^1132zkuW]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Vertebral artery dissection as a cause of stroke is rarely reported in children. The association between vertebral artery dissection and Klippel-Feil syndrome is also very rare. We report on a case of vertebral artery dissection with posterior circulation involvement in a child with Klippel-Feil syndrome after a hard physical-training lesson. She was also diagnosed with Wildervanck syndrome, with additional clinical findings. Vertebral artery dissection should be considered in patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome who present with acute-onset neurologic signs. Movements such as hyperextension with rotation of the neck should be avoided in these cases.

### The potential role of diffusion weighted imaging in the diagnosis of early carotid and vertebral artery dissection [^111zCHfQ]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main objective of this study was to investigate the role of the diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in detecting the acute dissection of ICA and VA as well as the assessment of the length of the dissected vessel. In our patient cohort, we found that DWI is highly sensitive for the detection of dissected cervical arteries even in the first hours after symptom onset and can reliably assess the length of the dissection.

Despite advances in imaging techniques regarding the assessment of small and medium-size arteries including vessel wall imaging, an early and accurate diagnosis of CAD remains challenging in the clinical routine setting. The most serious consequence of CAD, in particular when the diagnosis is missed or delayed, are brain infarctions. The prevalence of ischemic stroke after ICA and VA dissection has been reported to be 60% relatively high particularly in VA dissections. In our study, brain infarctions were present in 100% of the patients presenting with VA dissections and in 68% of the patients presenting with ICA dissections. The different prevalence if strokes in our study population might be due to inclusion bias.

Table 9 — vascular causes of syncope list key features and risks: Aortic dissection may present with neurological symptoms, myocardial infarction, and heart failure (HF), and syncope can occur in as many as 13% of aortic dissections; the risk of in-hospital death, tamponade, and neurological deficits is higher in patients with syncope. Subclavian steal involves flow reversal in a vertebral artery ipsilateral to a hemodynamically significant stenosis of the subclavian artery, with severe cases causing vertebrobasilar ischemia that may rarely result in syncope, and syncope is generally associated with upper-extremity activity. For coarctation of the aorta, if severe, it can result in HF or aortic dissection, and associated bicuspid aortic valve stenosis may be considered with syncope.

### Behavior of extracranial-to-intracranial extended arterial dissections of the vertebral artery [^116QjRZv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

The current study has some limitations. First, although there were differences in ischemic and hemorrhagic presentations between groups, differences in subsequent ischemic events or hemorrhagic stroke failed to reach significance. This may be attributable to the fact that patients were treated to reduce hemorrhagic or ischemic complications in an individual basis, as represented by a higher rate of interventional treatment in the unruptured iVAD group. Furthermore, the rate of subsequent ischemic events or hemorrhagic stroke was too low to achieve statistical significance. A prospective cohort with a larger number of patients may be needed to confirm that the pathophysiological tendencies observed in the early period of VAD extends to the later periods. Second, the current study was retrospective, and HR‐MRI was not performed in all patients. The design included all consecutive patients with VAD presenting to a Regional Emergency Medical Center, regardless of HR‐MRI status, focusing on patient demographics. Although this is a limitation, we believe that the HR‐MRI findings of higher rates of IRI in iVAD are further generalizable to excluded patients usually presenting with SAH and angiographically visible dissecting aneurysms (high IRI). Third, pure eVAD was excluded from the analysis. This was inevitable because of the limited number of patients (N = 12), which would hinder statistical analysis. In the study, most patients with extracranial VAD (7 of 12) experienced symptoms associated with ischemic presentations. A single‐center cervicoencephalic artery dissection registry that recruited patients of European ethnicity reported only 19 patients with purely intracranial dissections among 328 patients, showing striking differences according to ethnicity. A previous literature of CCAD in Korean patients reported a predominance of 66% intracranial dissections when combining both the anterior and posterior circulation. This study focused on the posterior circulation, resulting in a lower rate of eVAD. Furthermore, our hospital operates a regional trauma center, and trauma patients are admitted by the trauma team. As this study included patients only admitted to the department of neurology or neurosurgery, minor trauma patients presenting with eVAD may have been excluded. Fourth, as mentioned above, the proportion of intracranial artery dissections in all cervicocephalic dissections exhibits substantial variability across different ethnic origins and age groups. Accordingly, the current study findings may not be fully generalizable to Whiteor Hispanic patients. Fifth, for the measurement of IRI, only the distal normal arterial diameter was used rather than the mean of proximal and distal arterial diameters. This was attributable to the difficulty in measuring the outer arterial wall diameter in the V3 segment adjacent to the subcutaneous tissue. However, we believe that the current methods still represent a lower degree of acute hemodynamic stress applied to the intracranial VAD for e+iVAD and differences in the subsequent risk for rupture.

### Spontaneous subclavian artery dissection causing ischemia of the Medulla oblongata and cerebellum [^115ppcog]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous subclavian artery dissection is a rare etiology. Spontaneous artery dissection causing brain ischemia is rare in all ischemic strokes. However, in young to middle-aged patients with brain ischemia, spontaneous carotid or vertebral artery dissection causing ischemic stroke accounts for 10–25%.

Case Report

A 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of left-arm paresthesia and numbness followed by symptoms of vertigo and vomiting. A neurological examination showed left-arm paresthesia, horizontal-rotational nystagmus, and left-side dysmetria according to a finger-to-nose test. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed left subclavian artery dissection. Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrated hyperintensity in the left medulla oblongata and inferior part of the cerebellum. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Spontaneous artery dissection is an important etiology of ischemic stroke among young patients. Cervical magnetic resonance angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of arterial dissection. Cervical disc disease is a common etiology in a patient with neck and shoulder pain without cause or neurologic symptoms, when cervical MRI is negative, however, spontaneous subclavian artery dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient, especially in a case of younger patient, presents with acute new-onset neck and shoulder pain followed by the onset of neurological symptoms.

### Acute coronary syndromes can be a headache [^115zojDB]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Ischaemic heart disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Patients typically present with chest pain and breathlessness either on exertion or at rest. Cardiac ischaemia can also lead to headache, although this is very rarely its only manifestation. Headache is mostly associated with migraine, cluster and tension headache disorders. More sinister causes include subarachnoid haemorrhage, temporal arteritis, meningitis, venous sinus thrombosis as well as vertebral and carotid artery dissection. A case of headache is presented where the underlying cause was cardiac ischaemia, itself the result of triple vessel coronary artery disease. This, also referred to as cardiac cephalgia, should be suspected in the older patient with risk factors for atherosclerotic disease presenting with recent-onset headache. Diagnosis of this requires high clinical suspicion and is essential for correct patient management.

### Diffusion-weighted imaging of intramural hematoma in vertebral artery dissection [^112ySJYF]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Dissections of the carotid and vertebral arteries can be detected by several imaging modalities, but there is yet no consensus on the most efficient and effective choice.

Methods

We performed diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in four patients with vertebral artery dissection documented with T2- and T1-weighted axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and conventional angiography. Intervals from the onset of headache to evaluation ranged from one day to two weeks.

Results

All the patients showed high signal intensity within the affected vertebral artery on DWI.

Conclusion

The movements of water molecules are more or less restricted within the clots according to the stage of thrombus formation in arterial dissection. Our study may provide another potential imaging method in the difficult task of proving arterial dissection.

### Intravenous thrombolysis in cervical artery dissection-related stroke: a nationwide study [^112Yd5i2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

These results align with our observation that IVT does not confer additional benefits over standard antiplatelet therapy in patients with minor strokes. Given the potential risks associated with IVT, such as hemorrhagic complications, our findings support a more tailored approach to thrombolytic therapy. This is especially relevant in the current era of emerging treatments, including anti‐amyloid therapies, which may influence the risk‐benefit balance of IVT in patients with minor stroke. However, a prior meta‐analysis of randomized trials found that alteplase was effective across all stroke severities, irrespective of age or NIHSS score. This suggests that the debate on IVT in minor stroke remains unresolved.

Our findings indicate that IVT efficacy varies by dissection location, with greater benefit seen in dissections involving carotid arteries. This contrasts with findings from the population with general stroke, such as the Thrombolysis Implementation and Monitor of acute ischemic Stroke in China (TIMS‐China) study, which found IVT to be more effective in posterior circulation strokes. The difference may be explained by the unique mechanisms of stroke in dissection compared with other causes. In carotid dissections, stroke often results from thromboembolism or vessel occlusion, making IVT more effective. In contrast, vertebral dissections can cause stroke by obstructing perforating arteries from the dissecting flap, leading to pontomedullary or spinal cord infarcts, which are less responsive to thrombolysis. Alternatively, our results may be influenced by treatment indication bias. Patients with more severe vertebral dissection symptoms were likely more often treated with IVT, whereas those with milder presentations, such as Horner syndrome, may not have been, potentially skewing outcomes. Additionally, the NIHSS score, which weighs heavily on anterior circulation symptoms, may not fully capture the severity of posterior circulation strokes, further complicating interpretation.

### Cervical artery dissection – clinical features, risk factors, therapy and outcome in 126 patients [^114bcsNM]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The highly variable clinical course of cervical artery dissections still poses a major challenge to the treating physician. This study was conducted (1) to describe the differences in clinical and angiographic presentation of patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissections (CAD, VAD), (2) to define the circumstances that are related to bilateral arterial dissections, and (3) to determine factors that predict a poor outcome. Retrospectively and by standardised interview, we studied 126 patients with cervical artery dissections. Preceding traumata, vascular risk factors, presenting local and ischemic symptoms, and patient-outcome were evaluated. Patients with CAD presented more often with a partial Horner's syndrome and had a higher prevalence of fibromuscular dysplasia than patients with VAD. Patients with VAD complained more often of neck pain, more frequently reported a preceding chiropractic manipulation and had a higher incidence of bilateral dissections than patients with CAD. Bilateral VAD was significantly related to a preceding chiropractic manipulation. Multivariate analysis showed that the variables stroke and arterial occlusion were the only independent factors associated with a poor outcome. This study emphasises the potential dangers of chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine. Probably owing to the systematic use of forceful neck-rotation to both sides, this treatment was significantly associated with bilateral VAD. Patients with dissection-related cervical artery occlusion had a significantly increased risk of suffering a disabling stroke.
