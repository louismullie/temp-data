## Question

Pink eye treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pink eye (conjunctivitis) treatment, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and establishing the differential diagnosis. Then, I should verify how to distinguish bacterial from viral and allergic etiologies at the bedside. Next, I will review when antibiotics are indicated versus when supportive care suffices, including stewardship and delayed prescribing. After that, I need to check which antibiotic to choose, dosing, and special populations. I will then examine non-antibiotic options and infection control. Finally, I should confirm red flags for urgent referral and synthesize a practical algorithm with counseling points and follow-up timing.

> Let me first confirm the condition and scope. Conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva with redness, discharge, and irritation; it is common in primary care and often self-limited, but I need to ensure I do not miss sight-threatening masqueraders that present with a red eye, such as corneal ulcer, anterior uveitis, acute angle closure, scleritis, or endophthalmitis, which require urgent ophthalmic management rather than routine conjunctivitis care [^115FXmnz].

> Wait, let me verify the etiologic framework before jumping to treatment. Viral conjunctivitis is the most common in adults and is typically watery and bilateral with adenoviral features; bacterial conjunctivitis often shows purulent discharge and sticky lids, especially in children; allergic conjunctivitis is intensely itchy and bilateral with a clear discharge; and noninfectious causes like irritants or contact lens–related inflammation should be considered when discharge is minimal and symptoms are atypical or persistent [^114Gxx2a] [^112dFymp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "pink eye" being uniformly bacterial. I should double-check the diagnostic clues that push probability toward bacterial disease: a history of gluey or sticky eyelids on waking and the presence of mucoid or purulent discharge together yield a post-test probability around 96% for bacterial infection in children, which supports empiric antibiotics in that phenotype, whereas watery discharge and upper respiratory prodrome favor viral etiology [^116Zw2zC] [^112dFymp].

> I need to check the role of antibiotics in mild bacterial conjunctivitis. The natural history is favorable, with many cases resolving spontaneously; however, topical antibiotics modestly increase early clinical and microbiological cure and reduce persistence, so the decision should balance symptom burden, contagion concerns, and stewardship principles, including delayed prescribing for low-risk patients [^112ZYxCy] [^116E3SJr] [^112gCnTG].

> Let me consider when not to prescribe antibiotics. Viral conjunctivitis does not respond to antibacterial agents, and indiscriminate topical antibiotics should be avoided; supportive care with lubricants, cold compresses, and strict hygiene is appropriate, and I should counsel that most acute viral and many mild bacterial cases resolve within 5–7 days without specific therapy [^114aP5sv] [^114LJtjF] [^115FXmnz].

> Next, I should review antibiotic selection. There is no evidence that any particular topical antibiotic is superior; practical choices include macrolides such as erythromycin ointment or bacitracin, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones like besifloxacin or gatifloxacin, with selection driven by availability, cost, and local resistance patterns; in many settings, chloramphenicol remains a suitable first-line option due to sustained sensitivity among common pathogens [^112ZYxCy] [^113614g7] [^114nZNYs] [^115gaRYD] [^116ae71C].

> I should confirm dosing and duration. A 5–7 day course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective; for example, erythromycin 0.5% ointment applied as a 1 cm ribbon to the lower conjunctival sac three to four times daily for 7 days is a reasonable regimen, and adherence can be improved by choosing ointment in young children or those with drop intolerance [^113614g7] [^112ZYxCy].

> But wait, what if access to antibiotics is limited or stewardship is prioritized. Povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution can be considered as an alternative antiseptic therapy in low-resource settings, and delayed prescribing strategies can reduce unnecessary use while maintaining safety in mild cases likely to self-resolve [^112ZYxCy] [^112gCnTG].

> I will now examine special populations. In contact lens wearers, I should suspect Pseudomonas and consider a fluoroquinolone if bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected, and in children with highly suggestive features, empiric therapy is reasonable; in neonates and infants, any conjunctivitis warrants urgent evaluation for gonococcal or chlamydial disease and systemic therapy because of the risk of invasive infection and corneal compromise [^114Gxx2a] [^116Zw2zC] [^114DEtT2].

> Let me think about non-antibiotic management and symptom control. Supportive care with preservative-free lubricating drops, cold compresses, and antihistamine drops for allergic symptoms is appropriate; for ocular rosacea, preservative-free lubricants and lid hygiene are recommended, and in Sjögren-related dry eye, frequent preservative-free lubrication is advised; I should also remember that antihistamine eye drops can rarely cause allergic contact dermatitis of the periorbital skin, so persistent irritation merits evaluation for contact allergy [^114LJtjF] [^115pg8L9] [^114uwhxB] [^115hn9RR].

> I need to ensure infection control counseling is explicit. Patients are contagious until symptoms resolve; strict hand hygiene, avoidance of face-touching, and not sharing towels, pillows, or eye makeup are essential; in congregate settings, severity-based precautions and rooming-in for mild disease can limit transmission while maintaining access to care [^116J3g7h] [^11755Euo] [^114LJtjF].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent ophthalmology referral. Severe pain, vision loss, corneal opacity or infiltrate, copious purulent discharge, marked photophobia, distorted pupil, or failure to improve after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy should prompt urgent evaluation; in contact lens wearers, any red eye with pain or photophobia raises concern for keratitis and requires expedited care [^113ttBcu] [^115FXmnz] [^112EQ8jW].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. First, confirm the diagnosis and exclude sight-threatening causes; second, classify likely etiology by discharge character, itch, and history; third, if viral is likely, provide supportive care and hygiene counseling; fourth, if bacterial features are present or risk is high, offer a 5–7 day topical antibiotic or a delayed prescription; fifth, if severe features or red flags are present, refer urgently; finally, arrange follow-up in 48–72 hours to reassess response and adjust management as needed [^112ZYxCy] [^115FXmnz].

> I should double-check that my counseling aligns with evidence and stewardship. Explain that most cases resolve spontaneously, antibiotics shorten symptoms by about a day and reduce infectiousness modestly, and that overuse fuels resistance; provide written hygiene instructions and set expectations for a 5–7 day course with reassessment if not improving, which improves adherence and reduces unnecessary re-prescriptions [^115L23qK] [^116E3SJr] [^114LJtjF].

> Finally, let me verify a couple of nuances. Topical anesthetics can provide brief relief but should not be used chronically due to corneal toxicity; if a corneal ulcer is suspected, immediate fluoroquinolone therapy and urgent ophthalmology referral are indicated; and in wilderness or resource-limited contexts, erythromycin ointment remains a reasonable empiric choice when bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected and no specialist care is immediately available [^113614g7] [^112EQ8jW] [^111ac7Ws].

---

Pink eye treatment depends on the cause: **viral conjunctivitis** is self-limited and managed with supportive care (cold compresses, lubricating drops, strict hygiene) [^114LJtjF]; **bacterial conjunctivitis** is treated with topical antibiotics (erythromycin, trimethoprim-polymyxin B, or fluoroquinolones) for 5–7 days to shorten symptoms and reduce transmission [^112ZYxCy] [^115L23qK]; **allergic conjunctivitis** responds to topical antihistamines/mast-cell stabilizers (olopatadine, ketotifen) and oral antihistamines [^115hn9RR]. Contact lens wearers should stop lenses and use fluoroquinolone drops; **severe cases** (corneal involvement, immunocompromised, or gonococcal/chlamydial infection) need urgent ophthalmology referral [^113ttBcu]. No treatment fully prevents transmission; **strict hand hygiene** and avoiding shared items are essential [^116J3g7h].

---

## Viral conjunctivitis

Viral conjunctivitis is the most common type and is **highly contagious** [^113614g7]; it typically resolves spontaneously within 1–2 weeks [^112gCnTG].

- **Supportive care**: Cold compresses, lubricating eye drops, and strict hygiene (frequent handwashing, avoiding eye rubbing, not sharing towels or makeup) are recommended [^115FXmnz] [^116J3g7h].

- **Antiviral therapy**: Generally not indicated unless caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella-zoster virus (VZV), in which case topical antivirals (e.g. ganciclovir, trifluridine) may be prescribed [^112gCnTG].

- **Contagiousness**: Patients remain contagious until symptoms resolve; strict hygiene is essential to prevent spread [^116J3g7h].

---

## Bacterial conjunctivitis

Bacterial conjunctivitis is common in children and is characterized by purulent discharge and eyelid crusting; **topical antibiotics** shorten the duration and reduce transmission [^112ZYxCy] [^115L23qK].

- **First-line antibiotics**: Erythromycin ointment, trimethoprim-polymyxin B, or sulfacetamide drops are effective and commonly used [^113614g7].

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Reserved for severe cases, contact lens wearers, or when MRSA is suspected (e.g. besifloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin) [^111nAcTs].

- **Duration**: Typically 5–7 days; symptoms should improve within 48–72 hours [^112ZYxCy].

- **Contagiousness**: Patients are contagious until 24–48 hours after initiating antibiotics and symptoms resolve [^notfound].

---

## Allergic conjunctivitis

Allergic conjunctivitis is characterized by itching, tearing, and conjunctival edema; **avoiding allergens** and using antihistamines are key [^112dFymp].

- **Topical antihistamines/mast-cell stabilizers**: Olopatadine, ketotifen, or azelastine provide rapid relief [^115hn9RR].

- **Oral antihistamines**: Useful for systemic allergy symptoms [^notfound].

- **Corticosteroids**: Short courses of mild topical steroids (e.g. loteprednol) for severe cases, under ophthalmic supervision [^1112KZBq].

---

## Special considerations

- **Contact lens wearers**: Discontinue lens use; treat with topical fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin) due to risk of Pseudomonas infection [^112EQ8jW].

- **Neonatal conjunctivitis**: Requires urgent ophthalmology referral and systemic antibiotics due to risk of serious infection [^114DEtT2].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Require aggressive treatment and close follow-up due to higher risk of complications [^notfound].

---

## Prevention of transmission

Strict hand hygiene, avoidance of shared personal items, and staying home until symptoms resolve are essential to limit spread [^116J3g7h] [^11755Euo]. No treatment completely prevents transmission; **adherence to hygiene measures** is critical [^116J3g7h].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients should seek care if they experience **vision changes, severe pain, light sensitivity, corneal opacity, or symptoms persisting beyond a week** [^113ttBcu] [^115FXmnz]. Pink eye treatment is cause-specific: viral cases need supportive care, bacterial cases need antibiotics, and allergic cases need antihistamines; **strict hygiene** prevents spread [^114LJtjF] [^113614g7] [^115hn9RR] [^116J3g7h].

## References

### Besifloxacin: a novel anti-infective for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis [^111nAcTs]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Bacterial conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye, is demographically unbiased in its prevalence and can be caused by a variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Timely empiric treatment with a broad-spectrum anti-infective, such as a topical fluoroquinolone, is critical in preventing potentially irreversible ocular damage. However, the rise in ocular methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates and the patterns of fluoroquinolone resistance for patients with other ocular bacterial infections mandate the need for new agents targeted for ocular use. Besifloxacin, a novel broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, is approved for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. It has a uniquely balanced dual-targeting activity that inhibits both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and is associated with a lower incidence of resistance development. Besifloxacin is not marketed in other formulations, ensuring that its exposure is limited to bacterial populations in and around the eye. This specifically precludes any bacterial exposure to besifloxacin resulting from systemic use, which further reduces the likelihood of emergence of bacterial resistance. In vitro, besifloxacin has demonstrated equivalent or superior activity compared with other commonly used topical antibiotics. In clinical trials, besifloxacin has consistently demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with bacterial conjunctivitis. Besifloxacin is considered safe and is well tolerated with no observed contraindications.

### Effect of "Pink eye" label on parents' intent to use antibiotics and perceived contagiousness [^111iPv7B]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Parents of children who presented for a pediatrics appointment responded to a clinical vignette that described a child with symptoms consistent with acute viral conjunctivitis. In a 2 × 2 randomized survey design, the physician in the vignette either used the term "pink eye" or "eye infection" to describe the symptoms, and either told parents that antibiotics are likely ineffective at treating the symptoms or did not discuss effectiveness. When the symptoms were referred to as "pink eye", parents remained interested in antibiotics, despite being informed about their ineffectiveness. By contrast, when the symptoms were referred to as an "eye infection", information about antibiotic ineffectiveness significantly reduced interest, Mdiff = 1.63, P < .001. Parents who received the "pink eye" label also thought that the symptoms were more contagious and were less likely to believe that their child could go to child care, compared with parents who received the "eye infection" label, Mdiff = 0.37, P = 0.38.

Conjunctivitis (pink eye)

Background

Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the inside surface lining of the eyelids and covering of the eyeball. The eye may appear red and may have a clear or cloudy discharge. Conjunctivitis has both noninfectious and infectious causes that can be bacterial or viral. Conjunctivitis does not necessarily require treatment with topical or oral antibiotics.

Many large, community-based outbreaks of conjunctivitis, including outbreaks among school children, on college campuses, and in military facilities have been documented. – In neonates, conjunctivitis can be associated with serious invasive disease that involves multiple organs. Careful hand hygiene can reduce transmission.

Individuals who have conjunctivitis should be considered contagious until their symptoms have resolved. The viruses and bacteria that most commonly cause conjunctivitis are transmitted to eyes from hands that are contaminated with the infectious eye drainage, from contaminated objects (shared towels and washcloths, eye drop solution, or contact lens solution), or potentially by direct inoculation into the eye via large respiratory droplets from an ill individual who is coughing.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals with severe conjunctivitis (i.e. copious eye discharge, eye irritation causing frequent eye rubbing or itching, or conjunctivitis accompanied by fever or respiratory symptoms) from entering the family-centered residential facility.
Allow individuals with mild conjunctivitis ("pink eye" with no active discharge, minimum eye irritation, and no fever) to enter the facility, but require such guests to stay in their personal room until their symptoms have resolved.
Allow individuals who were exposed to a person with conjunctivitis but who do not have symptoms of illness to enter the facility. No special precautions are required.
Educate guests and visitors about the importance of frequent hand hygiene, avoidance of sharing personal items (e.g. towels and washcloths, eye drops, and contact lens solutions), and prompt removal and careful handling of contaminated items (e.g. tissues, towels, and linens).

### Reyataz [^111hZs1b]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

-

If you take too much REYATAZ, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

When your supply of REYATAZ starts to run low, get more from your healthcare provider or pharmacy. It is important not to run out of REYATAZ. The amount of HIV-1 in your blood may increase if the medicine is stopped for even a short time. The virus may become resistant to REYATAZ and harder to treat.

What are the possible side effects of REYATAZ?

REYATAZ can cause serious side effects, including:

-

A change in the way your heart beats (heart rhythm change). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you get dizzy or lightheaded. These could be symptoms of a heart problem.

-

Skin rash. Skin rash is common with REYATAZ but can sometimes be severe. Skin rash usually goes away within 2 weeks without any change in treatment. Severe rash may develop in association with other symptoms which could be serious. If you develop a severe rash or a rash with any of the following symptoms, stop taking REYATAZ and call your healthcare provider right away:

o

general feeling of discomfort or "flu-like" symptoms

o

fever

o

muscle or joint aches

o

red or inflamed eyes, like "pink eye" (conjunctivitis)

o

blisters

o

mouth sores

o

swelling of your face

o

painful, warm, or red lump under your skin

-

Yellowing of your skin or the white part of your eyes is common with REYATAZ, and is usually not harmful in adults and infants older than 3 months of age; but it could also be a symptom of a serious problem. These effects may be due to increases in bilirubin levels in your blood (bilirubin is made by the liver). Although these effects may not be damaging to your liver, skin, or eyes, tell your healthcare provider right away if your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow.

### 'The mean mummy way'-experiences of parents instilling eye drops to their young children as described in online forums and blogs [^115iWNyB]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Minimize child's distress and awareness

Parents used distraction of many sorts (entertainment, games, and play) to minimize the child's immediate reactions to eye drop administration. Some encouraged the child to watch TV so they would not see the eye drop bottle approaching. Others achieved compliance by putting the drops on closed eyes, as described here:

'Did you try letting him lie down with his eyes closed? Incline his chin back a bit and put the eyedrops in the corners of his eyes.then tell him to open his eyes… It helped that they couldn't see the drop coming!' (F14, JH)

Alternatively, parents waited until their child was asleep then lifted the eyelids and inserted the drops.

Other management strategies

Some parents ' gave up' (their own words) on instilling the eye drops to their child because of the inherent difficulties as well as believing their child's eye problem would ' clear up on its own ' within a few days. Rather than seeing the child distress and lack of cooperation as a challenge to be overcome, some parents questioned the necessity of what they had been asked to do.

'We gave up. [Child] had pink eye with his last ear infection and the urgent care doc prescribed eye drops that we were supposed to give every 4 hours. I called my regular doctor and asked if it was really necessary. And pink eye with drops will, on average, clear up in 3.4 days and without will clear up in 4.5 days'. (F2, SK)

Other parents adopted alternative treatments, for example cleaning with 'breast milk', or bathing the child's eyes with 'salt water', 'warm water', or 'cold tea'.

'I expressed breastmilk into a clean bowl, dipped in cotton wool and then wiped over each eye several times a day. Cleared up in around 3 days if I remember rightly'. (F4, FT)

Others recommended asking for ointment rather than drops, or keeping the eye drops warm to reduce stinging.

'It did help to use warm drops. I kept the bottle in my pocket or bra, so it was body temperature'. (F15, BT)

### Efavirenz [^115C25ck]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Some nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, slow thoughts and physical movement, and delusions [false beliefs] or hallucinations [seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear]) may occur months to years after beginning efavirenz tablets therapy. Promptly contact your health care provider should any of these symptoms occur.

- Skin rash is common with efavirenz but can sometimes be severe. Skin rash usually goes away without any change in treatment. If you develop a rash with any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor right away:

- skin rash, with or without itching
- peeling skin

- fever
- mouth sores

- swelling of your face
- red or inflamed eyes, like "pink eye (conjunctivitis)

- blisters or skin lesions

- Liver problems, including liver failure and death can happen in people who take efavirenz. Liver problems can happen in people without a history of liver problems. Your doctor will do blood tests to check your liver before you start efavirenz and during treatment. Tell your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms:

- your skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow (jaundice)
- you don't feel like eating food for several days or longer

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^116aTGr1]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Wilderness eye pathologies — evidence scope and treatment realities are summarized as follows: Wilderness eye pathologies encompass a diverse group of injuries and illnesses that often require specialized equipment, medications, and expertise, and although this review provides an evidence-based overview of the most commonly encountered eye pathologies experienced in the wilderness, evidence regarding wilderness treatment is limited to case reports and the extrapolation of clinical and hospital care. Treatment in the wilderness is often based on available supplies and treatments rather than on the most evidence-based interventions, and with proper planning, tools, and physical examination skills, most providers can determine the need for further intervention or evacuation in cases of ocular pathology in the wilderness.

### Not just pink eye: allergic contact dermatitis to alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution [^115hn9RR]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Discussion

Alcaftadine, the active ingredient in Lastacaft, is primarily a H 1 histamine receptor antagonist and mast cell stabiliser. It is available in the United States as an over‐the‐counter medication and is commonly used in the treatment of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Prior to this report, only one case of ACD to alcaftadine 0.25% solution had been described.

Ketotifen and olapatadine are other antihistamines used as active ingredients in eyedrop solutions and have also been reported to cause ACD. Antihistamine eye drops are used to treat allergic conjunctivitis and ACD to these agents can present with similar symptoms, such as itching, swelling, and redness, delaying timely recognition and treatment. This report highlights the importance of considering patients' ophthalmic products as causes of periorbital dermatitis. Custom patch testing to these products can help identify novel allergens, such as alcaftadine, that are not included in a standard series and would otherwise be missed as important allergens.

### Isotretinoin (Amnesteem) [^113kJNuX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What are the possible side effects of Amnesteem?

Amnesteem can cause birth defects (deformed babies), loss of a baby before birth (miscarriage), death of the baby, and early (premature) births. See "What is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?"
Amnesteem may cause serious mental health problems. See "What is the most important information I should know about Amnesteem?"
serious brain problems. Amnesteem can increase the pressure in your brain. This can lead to permanent loss of eyesight and, in rare cases, death. Stop taking Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you get any of these signs of increased brain pressure:
bad headache
blurred vision
dizziness
nausea or vomiting
seizures (convulsions)
stroke
skin problems. Skin rash can occur in patients taking Amnesteem. In some patients a rash can be serious. Stop using Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you develop conjunctivitis (red or inflamed eyes, like "pink eye"), a rash with a fever, blisters on legs, arms or face and/or sores in your mouth, throat, nose, eyes, or if your skin begins to peel.
stomach area (abdomen) problems. Certain symptoms may mean that your internal organs are being damaged. These organs include the liver, pancreas, bowel (intestines), and esophagus (connection between mouth and stomach). If your organs are damaged, they may not get better even after you stop taking Amnesteem. Stop taking Amnesteem and call your doctor if you get:
severe stomach, chest or bowel pain
trouble swallowing or painful swallowing
new or worsening heartburn
diarrhea
rectal bleeding
yellowing of your skin or eyes
dark urine
bone and muscle problems. Amnesteem may affect bones, muscles, and ligaments and cause pain in your joints or muscles. Tell your doctor if you plan hard physical activity during treatment with Amnesteem. Tell your doctor if you get:
back pain
joint pain
broken bone. Tell all healthcare providers that you take Amnesteem if you break a bone.
Stop Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you have muscle weakness. Muscle weakness with or without pain can be a sign of serious muscle damage.
Amnesteem may stop long bone growth in teenagers who are still growing.
hearing problems. Stop using Amnesteem and call your doctor if your hearing gets worse or if you have ringing in your ears. Your hearing loss may be permanent.
vision problems. Amnesteem may affect your ability to see in the dark. This condition usually clears up after you stop taking Amnesteem, but it may be permanent. Other serious eye effects can occur. Stop taking Amnesteem and call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your vision or dryness of the eyes that is painful or constant. If you wear contact lenses, you may have trouble wearing them while taking Amnesteem and after treatment.
lipid (fats and cholesterol in blood) problems. Amnesteem can raise the level of fats and cholesterol in your blood. This can be a serious problem. Return to your doctor for blood tests to check your lipids and to get any needed treatment. These problems usually go away when Amnesteem treatment is finished.
serious allergic reactions. Stop taking Amnesteem and get emergency care right away if you develop hives, a swollen face or mouth, or have trouble breathing. Stop taking Amnesteem and call your doctor if you get a fever, rash, or red patches or bruises on your legs.
blood sugar problems. Amnesteem may cause blood sugar problems including diabetes. Tell your doctor if you are very thirsty or urinate a lot.
decreased red and white blood cells. Call your doctor if you have trouble breathing, faint, or feel weak.
The common, less serious side effects of Amnesteem are dry skin, chapped lips, dry eyes, and dry nose that may lead to nosebleeds. Call your doctor if you get any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

### Not just pink eye: allergic contact dermatitis to alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution [^1122Dp3Y]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

Periorbital dermatitis is frequently due to allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and patients describe symptoms of swelling, itch, and redness on the eyelids and surrounding skin. Common causative allergens include metals, preservatives, fragrances, and acrylates, whereas common sources include cosmetics and other personal care products, jewellery and nail products. Additionally, allergens in topical medications, mainly eye drops and antibiotics, have been recognised as important precipitants of periorbital ACD.

### Diagnosis and management of the acute red eye [^111cZfao]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The red eye is one of the most frequent presenting complaints in the emergency department setting. A wide spectrum of disease processes may present as a red eye, ranging from benign self-limiting etiologies to serious vision-threatening ones. The emergency physician must be adept at recognizing "red flags" from the history and physical examination that necessitate immediate treatment and referral. In addition, it is imperative for the emergency physician to recognize the need for immediate versus elective ophthalmologist consultation for the various conditions. This article includes a discussion of the key historical features, clinical presentations, physical examination findings, and management of the more common causes of the red eye.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness [^115mR5Zh]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society — conjunctivitis in wilderness settings is common, as "Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye", with "Common etiologies includ[ing] allergies, viruses, and bacteria". Bacterial conjunctivitis "gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge". Management differs by cause: "Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics", and "studies have demonstrated that use of antibiotics results in faster clinical and microbiological remission", with "no studies showing superiority of any one antibiotic" so choice is based on availability; "Erythromycin ointment, 1-cm ribbon, placed in the lower conjunctival sac 3 or 4 times daily for 7 days is a reasonable option". Because "viral conjunctivitis is extremely contagious", "proper hand washing is essential… to avoid spread throughout a group or to the contralateral eye". "Topical anesthetic eye drops are diagnostically beneficial and provide acute relief…; however,… they should not be used chronically as they are toxic to the corneal epithelium". Recommendation ratings: Topical or systemic antibiotics: 1A; Hand washing: 1C.

### Extramedullary hematopoiesis of the conjunctiva presenting as active systemic disease in a patient with myelofibrosis [^112y2x3A]. Cornea (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report the clinicopathological correlation of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) of the conjunctiva in a patient with a history of myelofibrosis.

Methods

Case report.

Results

Elevated pink conjunctival lesions developed bilaterally in a 73-year-old man who had been treated for myelofibrosis for 13 years. EMH was detected in the examination of tissue from the lesion of the inferior fornix of the right eye.

Conclusions

The appearance of conjunctival lesions in a patient with myelofibrosis may indicate underlying pathology of EMH that may necessitate a change in systemic treatment of this condition.

### Intracameral gnathostomiasis presenting as neuroretinitis [^116jpREL]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, we report the first case of intraocular gnathostomiasis characterised by the concurrent presentation of panuveitis and neuroretinitis. Although rare, gnathostomiasis may manifest as neuroretinitis, highlighting the importance of considering parasitic aetiologies in patients exhibiting ocular inflammation, particularly in regions where such infections are endemic. An initial course of systematic corticosteroids, followed by a 21-day regimen of albendazole after surgical removal of the nematode, may contribute to a favourable prognosis.

Patient's perspective

I initially assumed it was a simple case of red eye (pink eye) that could be easily treated. However, after examinations, I was informed of inflammation extending from the front (anterior segment) to the back of my right eye (posterior segment). A subsequent examination a week later brought the surprising revelation of a worm inside my eye, necessitating urgent surgery to stop the inflammation. A week after the surgery, I could see just a bit better, but with an additional drug (albendazole) for 21 days, though not fully restored to my original vision, significant progress was evident, with the doctor attributing residual impairment to a 'macular star' caused by fat in my central vision.

Learning points

Intraocular gnathostomiasis, although rare, can manifest as neuroretinitis, emphasising the importance of considering parasitic aetiologies in patients presenting with ocular inflammation in endemic regions.
The clinical presentation of intraocular gnathostomiasis can mimic other ocular conditions, making it crucial to maintain a high index of suspicion and perform thorough diagnostic evaluations, including slit-lamp examination and serological testing.
Surgical removal of the nematode remains the primary treatment modality for intraocular gnathostomiasis, coupled with systemic corticosteroids and a 21-day treatment course of albendazole, may contribute to a positive prognosis.
Co-infections, such as toxoplasmosis or cat scratch disease, may complicate the clinical picture, highlighting the necessity of comprehensive diagnostic workups to identify concurrent infections and guide appropriate treatment strategies.
A multidisciplinary approach involving ophthalmologists, parasitologists and infectious disease specialists is essential for accurate diagnosis, timely intervention and optimal management of intraocular gnathostomiasis, particularly in resource-limited settings in endemic regions.

### Unilateral mydriasis due to angel's trumpet [^112CALbU]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are many causes of bilateral and unilateral mydriasis. Common garden plants, such as Brugmansia (Angel's trumpet), contain tropane alkaloids.

Case Report

An 11-year-old girl was brought to the Emergency Department because of discomfort and difficulty with near vision in the left eye, accompanied by unilateral mydriasis (pupil approximately 8 mm, unresponsive to both papillary light reflex and accommodation reflex). The consensual papillary light reflex of the right eye, the anterior chambers, the fundi, and the extraocular movements were intact. The history revealed that she had been playing in the garden and had just touched "a nice pink flower, similar to a trumpet". Treatment was symptomatic and supportive, and the anisocoria resolved 48 hours after exposure. Morphological and chemical investigations showed high amounts of parasympatholytic tropane alkaloids in a corolla area rich in Dargendorff-positive glandular hairs.

Discussion

Simple topical exposure to the flowers of Angel's trumpet, without instillation of plant sap into the eye, can produce self-limited unilateral mydriasis.

Conclusions

This case adds to the differential diagnosis of acute anisocoria in otherwise healthy children. An accurate and detailed history will avoid unnecessary and expensive diagnostic tests. It is important for parents and garden suppliers have information about the potential adverse effects after handling Angel's trumpet plants.

### Conjunctival melanoma treatment outcomes in 288 patients: a multicentre international data-sharing study [^115b6RL3]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Tumour pigmentation

The tumour colour was documented in 123 eyes. Dark brown (n = 47/123, 38.2%) was most common followed by light brown (n = 27/123, 21.9%), pink (n = 23/123, 18.7%), black (n = 11/123, 8.9%), red (n = 8/123, 6.5%), grey (n = 3/123,2.4%) and two each were defined as yellow or white in colour.

Tumour ulceration

Tumour surface ulceration was noted in 9.7% eyes (n = 14/143).

Acquired melanosis

Acquired melanosis was noted in 31.9% eyes (n = 92/288); these tumours were most commonly light brown in colour (n = 41/92, 44.6%) followed by dark brown (n = 13/92, 14.1%) and rarely pink (n = 3/92, 3.2%). The melanosis extended for 2 clock hours (mean = 2.03 ± 3.8 clock hours, median = 4 clock hours, range = 1–10 clock hours) and 78.2% (n = 72/92) had a nodular component.

Tumour invasion

Eyelid invasion was seen in 3.5% eyes (n = 10/288) and orbital invasion in 1.4% eyes (n = 4/288). Invasion into the globe or paranasal sinuses was not noted.

Pathological features

Specimens for histopathological examination were available in 271 eyes (n = 271/288, 94%). The mean diameter of the melanoma was 7.3 ± 4.4 mm (median = 6.25 mm, IQR = 4–10 mm, range = 0.9–27 mm) while the mean thickness was 1.9 ± 2.2 mm (median = 1 mm, IQR = 0.6–2.5 mm, range = 0.2–16 mm). Maximum tumour thickness was > 2 mm in 27% (n = 54/201) and ≤ 2 mm in 73% (n = 147/201). Lymphatic invasion was noted in 6.8% (n = 10/148).

### Prospective, non-interventional, multicenter study of the intraocular pressure-lowering effects of prostaglandin analog / prostamide-containing therapies in previously treated patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension [^113sSTfr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment and assessments

The visit at which the PGA/P-containing medication was prescribed was considered the baseline visit (V1). The hypotensive agent and dosing regimen were selected by the physicians per their usual standard of care. Patients were instructed to administer their study treatment once daily in the evening (if latanoprost, travoprost, or bimatoprost, for example, was prescribed) or once daily in the morning (if bim/tim, for example, was prescribed), per the respective product prescribing information. On the visit day, patients in the bim/tim group were asked to administer eyedrops after all assessments were completed.

At V1 (before the new treatment was initiated), the following information was recorded: patient demographics, time since first diagnosis, glaucoma diagnosis in each eye, IOP value, treatment status (treatment-naïve or previously treated), the most recent IOP-lowering medications used prior to the visit, and the reason(s) a PGA/P-containing therapy was being initiated. Target IOP for each eye of individual patients was also determined at V1 by the treating physician per standard clinical practice. Subsequent visits were scheduled at approximately the same time of day (preferably between 8:00 and 10:00 am) at 4–6 weeks (V2) and 8–12 weeks (V3) post treatment initiation per standard clinical practice. Alternatively, a visit was scheduled at early discontinuation.

All diagnostic and care procedures were conducted at physician discretion in keeping with local standards of medical care. IOP was measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry (unmasked) at V1 (prior to the first dose of PGA/P-containing study treatment) and at each of the subsequent visits. At the final visit, IOP-lowering efficacy was rated by each physician and categorized as IOP lower than target, reaching target, lower but did not reach target, unchanged, or increased. In addition, tolerability was assessed using the standard Allergan photonumeric bulbar conjunctival hyperemia grading scale: 0/none (normal), +0.5/trace (trace flush, reddish pink), +1/mild (mild flush, reddish color), +2/moderate (bright red color), and +3/severe (deep, bright diffuse redness). Patients and physicians also rated overall tolerability as very good, good, moderate, or poor. The type and occurrence of AEs, as well as discontinuations, were documented throughout the study.

### Treatment costs of cystoid macular edema among patients following cataract surgery [^1148JFuQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cataract is a leading cause of visual impairment in the US, with almost one-third of adults aged 65 years and older having been diagnosed with the condition. It is the most common cause of low vision among adults older than 40 years. More than 20 million Americans have cataracts in one or both eyes, and prevalence increases with age. Among Medicare beneficiaries, ~20% had a claim for cataract diagnosis between 1981 and 1988; cataracts were responsible for more than half of all allowable charges for eye care in the 1980s. This continued to be the main source of Medicare ophthalmic charges in the 1990s. Despite the expense of the surgery, cataract surgery has consistently been demonstrated to be cost-effective, with recent analyses reiterating this finding given trends in disease and treatment strategies.

Visual impairment can affect health-related quality of life and functioning, and cataract extraction has been shown to significantly improve the quality of life. However, there are risks associated with cataract extraction. Cystoid macular edema (CME) may present after cataract surgery. Clinically significant CME is a pervasive condition that has been studied extensively. It is a primary leading reason for visual impairment following cataract extraction and, if left untreated, may result in retinal changes and irreversible vision loss. Patients who develop CME experience blurriness or visual distortion, may exhibit photosensitivity, and may have dim or pink-tinted vision. Although acute cases of CME may resolve within 4 months or even more quickly with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), for patients with certain comorbidities, particularly diabetes or uveitis, CME may take up to 12 months to return to pre-CME vision. When CME fails to resolve with topical medical therapy, intravitreal injections of corticosteroids or antivascular endothelial growth factor and surgical treatments such as pars plana vitrectomy may be appropriate, but each therapy carries certain risks.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^112EQ8jW]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corneal ulcers — recognition and initial wilderness management prioritize emergent care, culture when near expert evaluation, and empiric fluoroquinolone therapy when far from care, with explicit dosing instructions and evacuation. Signs include significant pain, white or gray corneal infiltrate, and an epithelial defect on fluorescein exam; emergent treatment is important, and contact lenses must be discontinued. If the patient is within 1–3 h of an ophthalmologist's evaluation, we recommend the ophthalmologist obtain a culture before initiating treatment; if more than a few hours from expert evaluation, we recommend beginning empiric antibiotic treatment with fourth-generation fluoroquinolone eye drops, such as moxifloxacin 0.5%, loading by instilling 1 drop every 5 min for the first 30 min, then 1 drop every 30 min for 6 h, followed by 1 drop every hour until seen. Oral fluoroquinolones are warranted if nothing else is available (such as moxifloxacin, 400 mg daily for 7 days), and cycloplegic medication (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h) can be given; evacuation should be emergent. Recommendation grades include: Antibiotics, topical — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Antibiotics, systemic — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Cycloplegic — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Evacuation — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Dacryocystitis — this infection of the lacrimal sac arises from obstruction of the lacrimal duct and presents as pain, swelling, and redness over the lacrimal duct at the nasal corner of the eye; initial treatment can include oral antibiotics and warm compresses, with the preferred antibiotic amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg) orally, 2 times daily for 10 days, and oral fluoroquinolones (such as moxifloxacin) will likely suffice if not included in the kit; if this condition worsens, the patient should be evacuated nonemergently. Antibiotics: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Clinical features of bacterial conjunctivitis in children [^116Zw2zC]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Conjunctivitis is a common cause of primary care and emergency department (ED) visits. There is a paucity of data in recent literature on the prevalence of pediatric bacterial conjunctivitis, and there are no evidence-based clinical guidelines for empirical treatment. The study objective was to describe clinical features most predictive of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a prospective study in a children's hospital ED. Conjunctival swabs for bacterial culture were obtained from patients aged 1 month to 18 years presenting with red or pink eye and/or the diagnosis of conjunctivitis.

Results

A total of 111 patients were enrolled over one year. Patients had a mean (± SD) age of 33.2 (± 37.5) months, and 55% were male. Eighty-seven patients (78%) had positive bacterial cultures. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 82% (71/87), Streptococcus pneumoniae for 16% (14/87), and Staphylococcus aureus for 2.2% (2/87). Five clinical variables were significantly associated with a positive bacterial culture. Regression analysis revealed that the combination of a history of gluey or sticky eyelids and the physical finding of mucoid or purulent discharge had a posttest probability of 96% (95% confidence interval = 90% to 99%). Subjective scoring by physicians for a positive culture was 50.6%.

Conclusions

Conjunctivitis in children is predominantly bacterial, with nontypeable H. influenzae being the most common organism. A history of gluey or sticky eyelids and physical findings of mucoid or purulent discharge are highly predictive of bacterial infection. Based on the above data, empirical ophthalmic antibiotic therapy may be appropriate in children presenting with conjunctivitis.

Iritis (anterior uveitis) — presentation, treatment, and evacuation: Nontraumatic iritis may present with pain, redness of the conjunctiva, blurred vision, and photophobia, with consensual photophobia on exam; standard therapy includes corticosteroids such as prednisolone 1% eye drops — 1 drop into the affected eye every hour if severe or every 4 h if mild, and if drops are unavailable or the condition is worsening, oral steroids can be given — prednisone 40 mg to 60 mg oral daily. If there is concern for herpetic lesions or other serious infection, steroids should be avoided; in this case, a topical nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drug (NSAID) may be beneficial. Cycloplegic (mydriatic) drops such as atropine are key for pain control, but cycloplegics should be avoided if there is concern for elevated intraocular pressures, with dosing of 1 drop in the affected eye 2 times daily. Evacuation should be emergent because iritis can be complicated by scarring of the pupil and elevated IOP. Recommendation ratings specify: Topical steroids — Strong recommendation, low‑quality evidence; Systemic steroids — Weak recommendation, low‑quality evidence; Mydriatic drops — Strong recommendation, low‑quality evidence; Topical NSAID — Weak recommendation, low‑quality evidence; Emergent evacuation — Strong recommendation, low‑quality evidence.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Presence or absence of ocular surface inflammation directs clinical and therapeutic management of dry eye [^111gbFa9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

A retrospective single center medical chart review of 100 patients seen over the preceding 180 days was conducted in a large multispecialty private ophthalmology practice in Southwest Florida. A chart review was performed to identify the most recent 100 patients who presented with symptoms of dry eye, were tested with InflammaDry, were started on therapy, and were seen in follow-up ~90 days later. According to the Shulman Institutional Review Board (Cincinnati, OH, USA) exemption classifications, this retrospective study was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval and patient consent.

Data collected included age, gender, InflammaDry test results before and after treatment, and a dry eye symptom questionnaire results before and after treatment.

The InflammaDry test was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions to determine if patients exhibited elevated levels of MMP-9, which represented clinically significant ocular surface inflammation. The InflammaDry test required an ophthalmic technician to collect a tear sample from the patient's palpebral conjunctiva. The palpebral conjunctiva was gently dabbed 6–8 times in multiple locations, releasing the lid after every 2–3 dabs to allow the patient to blink. Then, the sampling fleece was allowed to rest against the conjunctiva for an additional 5 seconds until the sampling fleece was saturated with tears (10 µL) and either demonstrated a pink color or appeared glistening. After obtaining the sample, the sample collector was assembled onto the test cassette. The assembled test was activated by dipping the absorbent pad into a buffer solution for ~20 seconds. After 10 minutes had elapsed, the test was interpreted. The presence of 1 blue line and 1 red line in the test's result window was indicative of a positive test result (MMP-9 ≥ 40 ng/mL). The intensity of the red line is directly related to the amount of MMP-9 present; thus, mild dry eye is associated with fainter result lines than more severe dry eye. The presence of a red line of any intensity confirmed the presence of elevated MMP-9. One blue control line indicates a negative test result (MMP-9 < 40 ng/mL).

Corneal abrasion — field management emphasizes topical therapy, pain control, and avoiding patching, with graded recommendations provided. Corneal abrasions in the wilderness should be treated with topical antibiotics (such as erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 h), cycloplegics (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h), NSAIDs (such as ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 6 h), and frequent use of artificial tears; sunglasses may help reduce photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching, and bandage soft contact lenses should be used only if there is no retained corneal foreign body, they are used with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 h. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide acute relief but prolonged use should be avoided because they are potentially toxic to the corneal epithelium; a recent randomized trial of tetracaine versus saline for uncomplicated abrasions concluded there was no significant difference in corneal healing with an overall patient perception of improved pain control. Recommendation grades include: Topical antibiotics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Cycloplegics — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; NSAIDs — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Artificial tears — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Sunglasses — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Avoidance of patching — Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence; Emergent evacuation for open globe or deep epithelial defects — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Bulbar conjunctival sporotrichosis presenting as a salmon-pink tumor [^116MXqLb]. Cornea (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a patient with bulbar conjunctival sporotrichosis presenting as a salmon-pink tumor.

Methods

This was an interventional case report. A 62-year-old woman presented with conjunctival injection in her left eye. Despite administration of topical dexamethasone sodium, ofloxacin, and levocabastine hydrochloride, her symptoms failed to improve and she was referred to us.

Results

Four weeks after referral to us, the patient gradually developed conjunctival injection in both eyes and a salmon-pink tumor in the bulbar conjunctiva of the left eye. Excision biopsy was performed and pathologic examination revealed an epithelioid granuloma with microabscesses and infiltration of plasma cells with yeast-like spherules. A sporotrichin intradermal test was strongly positive. Based on a diagnosis of sporotrichosis, we treated her with topical fluconazole 0.2% in both eyes and oral potassium iodide (450 mg). The bilateral conjunctival injection and subconjunctival tumor in the left eye gradually resolved and had completely disappeared after 3 months of treatment.

Conclusion

This is the first report of bulbar conjunctival sporotrichosis with a salmon-pink conjunctival tumor. Although rare, ophthalmologists should be aware of this entity during examination of patients with intractable conjunctival injection.

### Unusual iris metastasis from anal cancer: a case report [^1116vo3Q]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

We report a case of anal cancer with iris metastasis and summarize the iris metastasis literature. A 69 years old woman with a history of anal cancer presented with a visual field loss. Slit lamp examination showed a pink ovular mass on the iris of the left eye which was typical of iris metastasis. Because of worse prognosis of metastatic cancer and any ocular complications, the patient was treated by radiotherapy which allowed a clinical improvement. A review of medical records was performed to assess the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment. Anal carcinoma can metastasize to the iris. Radiotherapy allows a good local control of tumour but the prognosis depends on systemic disease which is generally bad.

### Genome editing in the treatment of ocular diseases [^112hm8wE]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Application of genome editing in the treatment of ocular diseases

The human eye is a complex and essential organ that plays a pivotal role in perceiving light, color, and depth to facilitate daily activities and interactions. The human eye consists of various interconnected cell types, ranging from the corneal epithelium in the anterior chamber of the eye to the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the brain. In particular, photoreceptors, which are responsible for the initiation of the visual signaling cascade, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which support the function of photoreceptors and contribute to visual chromophore regeneration, play key roles in detecting light and transmitting visual information to the brain. Vision loss can occur as a result of disruptions to these cells, caused by either pathogenic mutations or environmental factors, significantly impacting the quality of life. Approximately 2.2 billion individuals worldwide are affected by visual impairments, underscoring the need for innovative treatments for both inherited and nongenetic ocular disorders.

### Pharmacologic treatments for rosacea [^113MPPsR]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Rosacea represents a common and chronic inflammatory skin disorder. Clinical features include transient and permanent erythema, inflammatory papules and pustules, phymatous changes, and ocular signs and symptoms. Rosacea is generally classified into four subtypes and one variant. Subtype 1, erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, includes clinical features of flushing and persistent central facial erythema with or without telangiectasia. Subtype 2, papulopustular rosacea, is characterized by persistent central facial erythema with transient papules or pustules or both on the central face. Subtype 3, phymatous rosacea, includes thickening of the skin with irregular surface nodularities and enlargement. Subtype 4, ocular rosacea, includes inflammation of different parts of the eye and eyelid. A variant, granulomatous rosacea, is noninflammatory and is characterized by hard, brown, yellow, or red cutaneous papules or nodules of uniform size. Patients may present with more than one subtype, and each individual characteristic may fluctuate. There is debate whether rosacea progresses from one subtype over time or subtypes represent discreet entities. Defining clinical presentation and improved understanding of pathophysiology has resulted in identification of novel treatment approaches. This contribution outlines a rationale for treatment, highlights an evidence-based approach with approved treatments, and considers novel developments and off-license therapy available.

### Predictive value of dermoscopy for the treatment of port-wine stains with large spot 532 nm laser [^111rmZ2j]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

We wanted to evaluate dermoscopy as a tool to predict the efficacy of port-wine stain (PWS) laser treatment.

Study Design and Methods

Large spot 532nm laser was used for the treatment of 67 PWS. Efficacy was assessed with an objective 3D digital imaging analysis. Dermoscopy images were taken before the treatment and analyzed semi quantitatively for features and patterns.

Results

The following dermoscopic features: "superficial vessels", "deep vessels", "deep lakes", "superficial lakes", and "thick vessels total" were identified as positive determinants of maximal global clearance effect (GCEmax), whereas "thin long vessels", "bright background total", "whitish veil", "white circles", and "perifollicular erythema" were found to be negative determinants. Rapid response correlated positively with "superficial vessels", "superficial lakes", and "thick vessels total" scores and showed inverse correlations with "bright-red background", "bright background total", "white circles", "peacock eyes", and "perifollicular erythema" scores. "Superficial vessels", "thick vessels total", and "pale-pink patchy background" were predictors of the lack of response. Dominance of "deep vessels" was a predictor of 75% of responses and dominance of "brown areas" feature was the predictor of clearance. Patients responded to treatment differently, depending on the dermoscopic pattern of PWS.

Conclusion

Dermoscopy may be useful to predict the response of PWS to laser treatment: its rapidity, the risk of no response, and 75% response and clearance. Lasers Surg. Med. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Precision ophthalmology: a call for Africa not to be left in the dark [^117SZTh9]. Gene Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Notwithstanding these considerations, eye diseases remain at the forefront of personalised treatment innovation. In 2020, the BRILLIANCE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03872479) was the first to insert CRISPR-Cas9 directly into the human body. This pioneering work was again carried out to address congenital blindness; the gene-editing therapeutic EDIT-101 was designed to target a specific intronic variant of the CEP290 gene, and the Phase 1/2 trial demonstrated 'proof of concept and favourable safety profile'.

It is estimated that one third of blindness amongst the working-age population has a genetic basis. These heritable conditions primarily affect the photoreceptor cells (the rod and cone cells) of the retina and/or the retinal pigmented epithelium. The retina functions to translate light signals into electrochemical signals which the brain then interprets, so these inherited retinal disorders (IRDs) result in familial forms of vision loss which can progress to total blindness. As a group, IRDs are one of the most genetically and clinically heterogenous medical conditions, with ~280 associated genes. Finding the causal genetic variant(s) for a patient or family is like searching for the proverbial needle in a haystack.

The number of genes involved in IRDs is perhaps unsurprising when one contemplates the speed at which the retina needs to respond to minuscule changes in light, movement, shadows, objects, etc. for normal vision to occur. The visual transduction pathway, which is constantly converting photons of light into electrochemical signals, is supported by the visual cycle which is rapidly replenishing essential compounds. The retina is therefore an extremely sophisticated, specialised, and metabolically active layer of tissue; mitochondrial genes are highly expressed, splicing activity is elevated when compared to other tissues, and there is unparalleled gene transcript diversity due to novel splicing events/alternative splicing. Taken together, this explains why the retina is particularly sensitive to dysfunction or disequilibrium. Furthermore, unlike other Mendelian disorders, IRDs have a low impact on reproductive fitness, allowing mutations to be passed on to subsequent generations (often prior to disease onset in autosomal dominant forms). It is believed that this is the main reason for the vast number of IRD genes and mutations. The hundreds of genes also reduce the likelihood of two partners/parents in the general population carrying pathogenic variants in the identical gene, despite an extremely high global carrier frequency (estimated ~1 in 3 individuals for autosomal recessive IRDs).

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^111swohR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blepharitis

Lid and ocular surface diseases often share a constellation of signs, including lid margin erythema, meibomian gland inspissation, conjunctivitis, conjunctival erythema, tear film instability, and keratitis. Blepharitis is a common inflammatory ocular disease that affects the eyelid margin, frequently resulting in disruption of the ocular surface and tear film. When present, blepharitis can damage the ocular surface and exacerbate concurrent ocular surface disorders. Because of its chronic nature and frequent comorbidity with other ocular surface diseases, managing these patients can be difficult. There are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for blepharitis, so the goal is often palliative, providing short-term management of signs and symptoms, with strategies such as warm compresses and lid hygiene, topical anti-inflammatory agents, and topical and oral antibiotics. While these options may temporarily relieve patient symptoms, they rarely address the root cause of the disease.

### Dry eye symptoms and impact on vision-related function across international task force guidelines severity levels in the United States [^115nF17E]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Dry eye disease is frequently undertreated. Barriers to appropriate treatment include the time required to adequately diagnose and determine appropriate treatment based on the patient's severity level, the perception by clinicians that the condition has minor impact on patient well-being, the perception by patients that the disease is normal or less important than other conditions that require treatment, lack of understanding of the disease process, and a perceived paucity of therapeutic options. Supplemental artificial tears and eyelid hygiene are common treatment modalities for dry eye disease, yet many patients continue to experience significant disruption to their daily lives. Our findings suggest that dry eye symptoms are frequently troublesome to the patient at all levels of disease severity, and require attention and adequate treatment. A complete and comprehensive medical and ocular history conducted by clinicians should help correctly identify patients who may have ambiguous symptoms without clinical signs or vice versa, and allow proper treatment and management of dry eye disease.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^116vUc9B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva. Both the palpebral and the bulbar ocular conjunctival surfaces are usually affected and typically become red and inflamed. Antibiotic therapy is widely used for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999; updated in 2006 and again in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 18 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included double-masked randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (UN and SM) independently checked and reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies. We graded the included RCTs for methodological quality using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardised manner. We performed random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan.

Main Results

We identified 11 eligible RCTs which randomised a total of 3673 participants. One further trial, which was published in abstract form in 1990 but has yet to be reported fully, is currently 'awaiting assessment'. Six of the 11 included studies have been included for the first time in this latest (2012) update. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. We judged two of the trials to be of high quality and graded the remainder as poor quality. Meta-analyses of data on clinical and microbiological remission rates revealed that topical antibiotics were of benefit in improving 'early' (days two to five) clinical (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.61) and microbiological (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.76) remission rates. At the 'late' time point (days six to 10), antibiotics were found to still confer modest benefits in clinical remission (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33) and microbiological cure rates (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.52). By days six to 10, 41% (95% CI 38 to 43) of cases had resolved in those receiving placebo. We found no data on the cost-effectiveness of antibiotics. No serious outcomes were reported in either the active or placebo arms of these trials, suggesting that important sight-threatening complications are an infrequent occurrence.

Authors' Conclusions

Although acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently self limiting, the findings from this updated systematic review suggest that the use of antibiotic eye drops is associated with modestly improved rates of clinical and microbiological remission in comparison to the use of placebo. Use of antibiotic eye drops should therefore be considered in order to speed the resolution of symptoms and infection.

Corneal abrasion — treatment and indications for evacuation: Prompt removal of evident corneal foreign body is recommended, and if open globe is suspected or deep corneal epithelial defects are apparent, then evacuation is emergent. Treatment includes topical antibiotics (erythromycin ophthalmic 0.5% ointment 1 cm every 8 hours), cycloplegics (atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 hours), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; ketorolac 0.5%, 1 drop every 8 hours), and frequent artificial tears. Sunglasses may help photophobia, but there is no evidence to support eye patching. Bandage soft contact lenses should be used only when no retained corneal foreign body is present, they are paired with a prophylactic topical antibiotic drop, and they are removed within 24 to 48 hours. Topical anesthetic eye drops provide diagnostic and acute pain relief but should not be used chronically due to corneal epithelial toxicity. Recommendation categories are Topical antibiotics: 1A; Cycloplegics: 1A; NSAIDs: 1A; Artificial tears: 1C; Sunglasses: 1C.

### Infraorbital dark circles: definition, causes, and treatment options [^117PyGfk]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Infraorbital dark circles refer to the conditions that present with darkness of the infraorbital eyelids. Although it is not a medical concern, it can be a cosmetic concern for a large number of individuals. Moreover, clear definition and possible causes have not been elucidated.

Objective

To review the possible causes and treatment options for infraorbital dark circles.

Methods

The article is based on a review of the medical literature and the author's clinical experience in treating infraorbital dark circles.

Conclusion

Possible causative factors of infraorbital dark circles include excessive pigmentation, thin and translucent lower eyelid skin overlying the orbicularis oculi muscle, and shadowing due to skin laxity and tear trough, but because multiple factors cause infraorbital dark circles in the majority of patients, it is essential to identify the cause and choose the appropriate treatment according to the cause.

### Heterologous expression of tyrosinase recapitulates the misprocessing and mistrafficking in oculocutaneous albinism type 2: effects of altering intracellular pH and pink-eyed dilution gene expression [^115UYqUH]. Experimental Eye Research (2006). Low credibility.

The processing and trafficking of tyrosinase, a melanosomal protein essential for pigmentation, was investigated in a human epithelial 293 cell line that stably expresses the protein. The effects of the pink-eyed dilution (p) gene product, in which mutations result in oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2), on the processing and trafficking of tyrosinase in this cell line were studied. The majority of tyrosinase was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and the early Golgi compartment in the 293 cells expressing the protein. Coexpression of p could partially correct the mistrafficking of tyrosinase in 293 cells. Tyrosinase was targeted to the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments after treatment of the cells with compounds that correct the tyrosinase mistrafficking in albino melanocytes, most likely through altering intracellular pH, while the substrate tyrosine had no effect on the processing of tyrosinase. Remarkably, this heterologous expression system recapitulates the defective processing and mistrafficking of tyrosinase observed in OCA2 albino melanocytes and certain amelanotic melanoma cells. Coexpression of other melanosomal proteins in this heterologous system may further aid our understanding of the details of normal and pathologic processing of melanosomal proteins.

### Pharmacist compliance with therapeutic guidelines on diagnosis and treatment provision [^112gCnTG]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Scenario 2: Infective Conjunctivitis

Conjunctivitis, an inflammation or infection of the mucous membrane covering the anterior sclera and inside eyelid, has 2 infectious forms, viral and bacterial, as well as a noninfectious form induced by allergens. Acute conjunctivitis is a relatively common ailment, with an estimated incidence reported in primary care settings of approximately 1.5% to 2% in the developed world. Although viral and bacterial conjunctivitis present with differentiating characteristics (eTable 4 in the Supplement), some studies suggest that pathogenic ambiguity can lead to misdiagnoses in as high as half of all cases, meaning that many patients receive inappropriate treatment. However, the unnecessary provision of antibiotics to individuals with the viral rather than the bacterial form of conjunctivitis adds to the development of antimicrobial resistance from overprescription of antibiotics. In reality, most conjunctivitis cases are self-limiting within 1 to 2 weeks of presentation, with minimal risk of long-term vision loss, a spontaneous remission rate that has led to increasing encouragement of a "delayed prescription" or "delayed antibiotic" approach.

Because in our scenario the visual signs and symptoms for viral and bacterial conjunctivitis precluded the SPs from requesting treatment for themselves, the SPs requested treatment for a family member or partner. For case 2A, when symptoms indicate bacterial conjunctivitis, the ideal management specified in the guidelines is prescription of a topical ocular antibiotic or, for mild cases, antiseptic eye drops (Table 2). Ocular lubricants or saline solutions will not treat the infection, although they can relieve some discomfort. Case 2B describes the presentation of viral conjunctivitis for which antiviral drugs are not recommended; rather, treatment is symptomatic and includes saline solution or an ocular lubricant. Diagnostic ambiguity is present because of conspecific symptom overlap between viral conjunctivitis and the most common type of noninfectious conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, whose incidence is very high. In the empirical analysis, we controlled for the contradistinctive symptoms of itchy or burning eyes and/or a history of allergies by asking the SP (posing as a family member or partner) the following diagnostic questions: "Do they have any allergies?" (with an answer of "No") and "Do they have any other symptoms?" (with an answer of "Yes, they had a cold about a week ago") (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

Cell Proliferation

Nine tissue explants from nine eyes incubated in EdU were evaluated for DNA synthesis 2 days and 7 days following SLT using confocal microscopy. Two days following laser application there was no significant change in DNA synthesis when compared with control tissue (0.250 ± 0.280 mitotic cells/100 μm z stack for laser treatment vs 0.454 ± 0.477 mitotic cells/100 μm z stack for control, p = 0.305). (Table 1) By 7 days, there was a trend toward increased DNA synthesis in laser treated eyes (2.074 ± 2.659 mitotic cells/100 μm z stack for laser treatment vs 1.537 ± 1.560 mitotic cells/100 μm z stack for control, p = 0.358). (Table 1) This increase was seen in 5 of 9 explants. The majority of the cells undergoing DNA synthesis were observed within the TM, outer wall cells of Schlemm's canal and cells in the sclera near the outer wall of Schlemm's canal (Figure 6).

### Adult bacterial conjunctivitis: resistance patterns over 12 years in patients attending a large primary eye care centre in the UK [^114nZNYs]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2017). Medium credibility.

Key messages

What is already known about this subject?

Bacterial conjunctivitis is common and often treated empirically with topical antimicrobials. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials has led to increased bacterial resistance.

What are the new findings?

Among Gram-positive bacteria, the most prevalent cause of bacterial conjunctivitis, chloramphenicol sensitivity remains high.

How might these results change the focus of research or clinical practice?

Topical chloramphenicol remains a suitable first-line treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis.

Adverse Events

Five of the 10 patients (8/15 eyes; 53.3%) in the RT group developed cataracts, and four patients (6/8 eyes; 75%) underwent cataract surgery. Six patients (8/15 eyes; 53.3%) developed dry eye, which was improved by eye drops in all patients. Of four patients (6 eyes) in the rituximab group, one patient (1 eye) treated with rituximab monotherapy developed fever and general malaise, and one patient (2 eyes) treated with rituximab with CHOP and CVP had numbness of the hands and fingers, abdominal pain, and pancytopenia. All cases improved with symptomatic therapies.

Case Report (Case 14)

Case 14 was a 73-year-old woman who visited our hospital with conjunctival tumors in both eyes. Conjunctival malignant lymphoma was suspected because of the presence of salmon-pink lesions in both eyes on slit-lamp examination (Figure 4). She underwent surgical resection of the lesions and conjunctival MALT lymphoma was confirmed by pathological examination of the resected specimen (Figure 5). The lymphoma was classified as Ann Arbor Stage II, because she had completed RT for MALT lymphoma in the right lung a few months before visiting our hospital. She was treated with rituximab alone with no adverse events, and had complete remission, but subsequently relapsed in the left lung 47 months after treatment initiation. She then opted for observation without treatment.

### Lower eyelid dark circles (tear trough and lid-cheek junction): a stepwise assessment framework [^111n4dh1]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The utilization of HA fillers for dark eye circles is popular but challenging and associated with a high rate of complications. We present a comprehensive assessment framework that combines inspection, assessment, and palpation. The overall aim is to encourage practitioners to pause and think before they treat, rather than simply treating the problem location. Careful step-by-step assessment, conducted with judicious lighting, can help to identify patients in whom dark eye circles may be improved without the need to directly inject HA filler into the tear trough. Correct patient classification can facilitate individualized treatment planning and optimize treatment outcomes while avoiding the known challenges associated with treating this area.

### Virtual consultation for red eye [^115FXmnz]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

What you should do

Recognising when to refer patients with a red eye to ophthalmology services, whether it is routine or urgently, is crucial (box 4). Figure 1 represents possible diagnoses to consider based on initial assessment.

Box 4
Conditions that require urgent referral to an ophthalmologist

Severe "conjunctivitis" that does not improve after several days of antibiotic treatment ("bacterial conjunctivitis") or lubricants ("viral conjunctivitis")
Corneal infection (especially in contact lens wearers)
Anterior uveitis
Acute angle-closure glaucoma
Endophthalmitis (suspect if the patient had intra-ocular surgery within the past week)
Ocular trauma (including mechanical, chemical, and thermal injury)
Scleritis
Orbital cellulitis

Patients with non-sight threatening red eye conditions — such as mild infectious or non-infectious conjunctivitis, subconjunctival haemorrhage, or mild corneal abrasion — can be reassured and managed in the community. Advise that most cases of acute viral and bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve without any treatment in 5–7 days. A trial of topical antibiotics (such as chloramphenicol or fusidic acid) can be started if symptoms are not resolving within three days of onset in bacterial conjunctivitis. If the condition does not improve or if it worsens after treatment, offer referral to an eye casualty unit for urgent ophthalmic assessment.

Suspected severe and potentially sight threatening conditions (box 4) or the presence of red flags (see box 1) warrant prompt ophthalmology referral. Patients with recurrent history of red eye related conditions warrant a face-to-face ophthalmology review. Ocular signs could be too subtle to be picked up by mobile imaging. Contact the local on-call ophthalmology team immediately for these patients.

Education into practice

Recollect a patient with an eye condition you examined recently. What would you do differently based on reading this article?
What red flags would you look for in a patient with red eye that would prompt an ophthalmology referral?

How patients were involved in the creation of this article

Recent examples of patients with a red eye who had been assessed by virtual consultation, including telephone or video consultation, have informed the writing of this article. In addition, images of patients with red eyes taken during virtual consultations have been used after obtaining informed consent. We are grateful for their contribution.

### Antibiotics for trachoma [^113Bktj3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Trachoma is the world's leading infectious cause of blindness. In 1997 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched an Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by the year 2020, based on the 'SAFE' strategy (surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness and environmental improvement).

Objectives

To assess the evidence supporting the antibiotic arm of the SAFE strategy by assessing the effects of antibiotics on both active trachoma (primary objective) and on Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) infection of the conjunctiva (secondary objective).

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1950 to December 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2010), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) (December 2010) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) (December 2010). We used the Science Citation Index to look for articles that cited the included studies. We searched the reference lists of identified articles and we contacted authors and experts for details of further relevant studies. There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 12 December 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials that satisfied either of two criteria: (a) trials in which topical or oral administration of an antibiotic was compared to placebo or no treatment in people or communities with trachoma, (b) trials in which a topical antibiotic was compared with an oral antibiotic in people or communities with trachoma. A subdivision of particular interest was trials in which topical tetracycline or chlortetracycline and oral azithromycin were compared with each other, or in which one of these treatments was compared with placebo or no treatment, as these are the two WHO recommended antibiotics. We considered individually randomised and cluster-randomised trials separately.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted investigators for missing data. Where appropriate, the effect estimates from the individual studies (risk ratios) were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Results

A total of 14 trials randomised individuals with trachoma to oral antibiotic, topical antibiotic, both, or control (no treatment or placebo) and were eligible for inclusion in this review (n = 3587). Overall, the quality of the evidence provided from these trials was low. Nine of the trials compared antibiotic treatment to control. Most of the studies found a beneficial effect of treatment on active trachoma and ocular chlamydial infection at three and 12 months follow up. There was considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity between trials, which meant that it was difficult to reliably estimate the size of the treatment effect. It is likely to be in the region of a 20% relative risk reduction. Seven of the 14 trials compared the effectiveness of oral and topical antibiotics. There was no consistent evidence as to whether oral or topical antibiotics were more effective, although one trial suggested that a single dose of oral azithromycin was significantly more effective than unsupervised use of topical tetracyclineA further eight trials assessed the effectiveness of community-based treatment. In five trials antibiotic treatment was compared to no (or delayed) treatment (57 communities), and in three trials oral antibiotic was compared to topical treatment (12 communities). The quality of the evidence provided by these trials was variable but at least one trial was considered to provide high quality evidence. There was evidence that community-based antibiotic treatment reduced the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular infection 12 months after single-dose treatment. There was some evidence that oral azithromycin was more effective than topical tetracycline as a community treatment. Data on adverse effects were not consistently reported however there were no reported serious adverse events associated with treatment with oral azithromycin or topical tetracycline; in one sample survey of 671 people treated with azithromycin between 10% and 15% experienced gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea or vomiting, or both).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of active trachoma and ocular chlamydial infection in people infected with C. trachomatis, but we do not know for certain the size of the treatment effect in individuals. Mass antibiotic treatment with single-dose oral azithromycin reduces the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular infection in communities.

Presentation and diagnosis

Patients present with a red, painful eye and reduced vision. The onset of symptoms is often insidious and can occur days to weeks after the initial trauma. Clinical examination will often show conjunctival hyperaemia, a white/cream‐coloured corneal opacity, often with a loss of epithelium, and there may be pus in the anterior chamber (hypopyon). If not treated, the inflammation of the cornea can increase, leading to stromal ulceration, corneal thinning and eventually, may result in corneal perforation. This inflammatory process leads to vascularisation and scarring of the cornea, which commonly results in severely reduced vision. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent vision loss. However, in low‐income countries where incidence is highest, presentation to secondary or tertiary eye‐care services is often delayed and patients may have used inappropriate treatments at the primary‐care level, such as corticosteroid eye drops or traditional eye medicines.

Accurate diagnosis of fungal keratitis can be challenging, as on clinical examination alone it can be difficult to determine whether the microbial keratitis is bacterial or fungal. Tools for microbiological diagnosis may be limited, particularly in resource‐poor areas. Diagnosis is usually made by scraping infected corneal tissue from the ulcer, which is then stained for fungi and bacteria, and cultured on solid or liquid material. In severe cases where the diagnosis is unclear, it may be necessary to take a larger corneal biopsy. There is no point‐of‐care diagnostic test for fungal keratitis, which is a significant obstacle in improving therapeutic outcomes resulting from this condition.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Fungal keratitis is challenging to treat, often requiring a long course of treatment with frequent visits to the hospital eye service. Antifungal medicines can be applied as topical eye drops, tablets or intravenous injection, or injection of medicines directly into the subconjunctiva, corneal stroma or anterior chamber. Surgical treatments are usually indicated when there has been a perforation, or for visual rehabilitation, and these include amniotic membrane grafts and therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (corneal graft). Corneal cross‐linking has also been investigated as a potential adjuvant treatment; however, the evidence for the effectiveness of this treatment is limited and a recent large randomised controlled trial found no benefit when compared to standard treatment with topical natamycin 5%. The prognosis of fungal keratitis is poor. Even with the appropriate intensive topical treatment, approximately 25% of cases will lead to perforation or loss of the eye. It is predicted that around 100,000 eyes are removed annually due to late diagnosis and poor therapeutic outcomes.

### Bacterial conjunctivitis [^114Gxx2a]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most cases of conjunctivitis in adults are probably due to viral infection, but children are more likely to develop bacterial conjunctivitis than they are viral forms. The main bacterial pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults and children, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. Contact lens wearers may be more likely to develop gram-negative infections. Bacterial keratitis occurs in up to 30 per 100,000 contact lens wearers.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical treatment in adults and children with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with bacteriologically confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with clinically confirmed gonococcal conjunctivitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 44 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ocular decongestants, oral antibiotics, parenteral antibiotics, saline, topical antibiotics, and warm compresses.

### Interventions for rosacea [^113z15F1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Rosacea is a common chronic skin condition affecting the face, characterised by flushing, redness, pimples, pustules, and dilated blood vessels. The eyes are often involved and thickening of the skin with enlargement (phymas), especially of the nose, can occur in some patients. A range of treatment options are available but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy and safety of treatments for rosacea.

Search Strategy

In February 2011 we updated our searches of the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and Ongoing Trials Registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with moderate to severe rosacea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses were carried out by two independent review authors.

Main Results

Fifty-eight trials, including 27 from the original review, comprising 6633 participants were included in this updated review. Interventions included topical metronidazole, oral antibiotics, topical azelaic cream or gel, topical benzoyl peroxide and/or combined with topical antibiotics, sulphacetamide/sulphur, and others. Only two studies assessed our primary outcome 'quality of life'. Pooled data from physician assessments in three trials provided some evidence that metronidazole was more effective compared to placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.56). Three trials provided data, based on participants' assessments, illustrating azelaic acid was more effective than placebo (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.76). Physician-based assessments in two trials indicated that doxycycline appeared to be significantly more effective than placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.47 and RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.99). There was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between 100 mg and 40 mg doses of doxycycline, but there was evidence of less adverse effects with the lower dose (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.54). One study reported that cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion was significantly more effective than artificial tears for treating ocular rosacea (for all outcomes).

Authors' Conclusions

Although the majority of included studies were assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias there was some evidence to support the effectiveness of topical metronidazole, azelaic acid, and doxycycline (40 mg) in the treatment of moderate to severe rosacea, and cyclosporine 0.5% ophthalmic emulsion for ocular rosacea. Further well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trials are required.

### COVID-19 and the eye [^114ze9qd]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

There is growing literature describing the ocular manifestations of COVID-19. We have assessed published reviews, cross-sectional analyses, and clinical reports to summarize the ocular manifestations of the disease and available vaccines, identify the potential role of ocular transmission, and offer basic clinical guidance to health care providers. Ultimately, self-limiting conjunctivitis and conjunctival hyperemia are the most frequently reported ocular findings; several rarer entities may warrant targeted topical therapies. COVID-19 vaccines have been infrequently associated with the development of rare but significant side effects that may warrant ophthalmologist referral as well as specific treatments. Despite the overall low risk of ocular transmission, eye protection is advisable for health care providers in high-risk scenarios. This review should help to guide the assessment of patients with eye complaints in the setting of COVID-19 to promote appropriate diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and referral.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112ZYxCy]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Mild bacterial conjunctivitis — treatment approach: Mild bacterial conjunctivitis is usually self-limited, and it typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immune-competent adults. Use of topical antibacterial therapy is associated with earlier clinical and microbiological remission compared with placebo in days 2 to 5 of treatment, and these advantages persist over days 6 to 10, but the extent of benefit over placebo lessens over time. Because a 5- to 7-day course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective, the most convenient or least expensive option can be selected; there is no clinical evidence supporting the superiority of any particular antibiotic. Povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution may be as effective as topical antibiotic therapy for treating bacterial conjunctivitis and could be considered when access to antibiotics is limited, such as in low- to middle-income countries, and although there are no data supporting the cost-effectiveness of using antibiotics in mild bacterial conjunctivitis, the shortened morbidity associated with their use makes choice of therapy an individual decision.

### Systemic therapies for inflammatory eye disease: past, present and future [^1118TS8b]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Looking back: dark ages to the renaissance

A characteristic of our medical past was that, though well-motivated by a desire to provide better care to our patients, actual therapeutic practice was often driven more by personality and confidence rather than by careful study and appraisal. Thus up to the early 20th century the therapeutic armory of the physician included useless or harmful practices such as bleeding, purging, and widespread provision of tonics, mercuric compounds and hypnotics. Patients with ocular inflammation were similarly provided for. In the 18th century a popular propriety remedy 'Golden Eye Ointment' was a mercury oxide that was normally mixed with hog's lard, and was promoted as being useful for 'all forms of chronic ophthalmia'. In the late 19th century, Savory's Compendium of Domestic Medicine recommended "In inflammation of the eye, originating from cold or accident, it is advisable to apply three or four leeches round the orbit… they will always be found to be safe, and generally a successful remedy". Rather more useful was the application of tincture of belladonna to induce pupil dilation. In the 1930s the advent of commercially available antibiotics heralded the start of rational treatment for infectious eye disease, but also gave some indication that much inflammatory eye disease was actually non-infectious in origin. It was recognized then that non-infectious inflammatory eye disease would require an entirely different therapeutic approach.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^115L23qK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva and is one of the most common ocular disorders in primary care. Antibiotics are generally prescribed on the basis that they may speed recovery, reduce persistence, and prevent keratitis. However, many cases of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limited, resolving without antibiotic therapy. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999, then updated in 2006, 2012, and 2022.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and side effects of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2022, Issue 5), MEDLINE (January 1950 to May 2022), Embase (January 1980 to May 2022), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.

Clinicaltrials

gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases in May 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment, with or without steroid, had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical and systemic antibiotic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies and determined the included RCTs, which were further assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardized manner and conducted random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan Web.

Main Results

We included 21 eligible RCTs, 10 of which were newly identified in this update. A total of 8805 participants were randomized. All treatments were topical in the form of drops or ointment. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their eligibility criteria, the nature of the intervention (antibiotic drug class, which included fluoroquinolones [FQs] and non-FQs; dosage frequency; duration of treatment), the outcomes assessed and the time points of assessment. We judged one trial to be of high risk of bias, four as low risk of bias, and the others as raising some concerns. Based on intention-to-treat (ITT) population, antibiotics likely improved clinical cure (resolution of clinical symptoms or signs) by 26% (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46; 5 trials, 1474 participants; moderate certainty) as compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis showed no differences by antibiotic class (P = 0.67) or treatment duration (P = 0.60). In the placebo group, 55.5% (408/735) of participants had spontaneous clinical resolution by days 4 to 9 versus 68.2% (504/739) of participants treated with an antibiotic. Based on modified ITT population, in which participants were analyzed after randomization on the basis of positive microbiological culture, antibiotics likely increased microbiological cure (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 10 trials, 2827 participants) compared with placebo at the end of therapy; there were no subgroup differences by drug class (P = 0.60). No study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. Patients receiving antibiotics had a lower risk of treatment incompletion than those in the placebo group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78; 13 trials, 5573 participants; moderate certainty) and were 27% less likely to have persistent clinical infection (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81; 19 trials, 5280 participants; moderate certainty). There was no evidence of serious systemic side effects reported in either the antibiotic or placebo group (very low certainty). When compared with placebo, FQs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90) but not non-FQs (RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.36 to 12.00) may result in fewer participants with ocular side effects. However, the estimated effects were of very low certainty.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this update suggest that the use of topical antibiotics is associated with a modestly improved chance of resolution in comparison to the use of placebo. Since no evidence of serious side effects was reported, use of antibiotics may therefore be considered to achieve better clinical and microbiologic efficacy than placebo. Increasing the proportion of participants with clinical cure or increasing the speed of recovery or both are important for individual return to work or school, allowing people to regain quality of life. Future studies may examine antiseptic treatments with topical antibiotics for reasons of cost and growing antibiotic resistance.

### Characteristics of design and analysis of ophthalmic randomized controlled trials: a review of ophthalmic papers 2020–2021 [^115ndAXe]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy and safety of new treatments for eye diseases. Unlike clinical trials for diseases in other organs, ophthalmic trials may include treatment and follow-up of 1 or both eyes of a participant, and the treatment can be delivered ocularly or systemically; thus, both eyes of a participant can be in the same treatment group or in different treatment groups, complicating the trial design and statistical analysis. Therefore, an appropriate design of ophthalmic trials should consider whether 1 eye or both eyes of a participant are enrolled into the trial, and whether both eyes are assigned to the same treatment or different treatment. These considerations of enrollment of 1 or both eyes and their treatment assignment all impact the sample size/power estimation and statistical analysis of trial data because outcome measures from both eyes of a participant are usually positively correlated. The proper sample size/power estimation and statistical analyses of ophthalmic trials should adjust for the intereye correlation whenever ocular measures from both eyes of a participant are taken and included into statistical analyses.

Lee et alclassified the study design of ophthalmic trials into the following 4 types: 1-eye design, 2-eye design, paired-eye design, and subject design. One-eye design includes only allocation of treatment and outcome assessment for 1 eye from each participant within the trial. On the contrary, 2-eye design includes allocations of treatment and outcome assessments for both eyes of each participant within the trial. Two-eye design is further classified as same-group design, different-group design, and mixed design. In the same-group design, both eyes of a participant are assigned to the same treatment group (e.g. systemic treatment or local ocular treatment). In the different-group design, 2 eyes of a participant are assigned to different local treatment groups. The paired-eye design is a special case of the different-group design, in which only 2 treatments are evaluated through within-participant comparison, and all participants are followed for outcomes in both eyes with 1 eye randomized to 1 treatment and the fellow eye randomized to another treatment. In mixed design, 2 eyes of a participant may be assigned to the same or different treatment. Subject design refers to trials with person-specific primary outcomes, such as quality of life or adverse effects of treatments.

### Diagnosis and management of red eye in primary care [^115y7vo5]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Red eye is the cardinal sign of ocular inflammation. The condition is usually benign and can be managed by primary care physicians. Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. Other common causes include blepharitis, corneal abrasion, foreign body, subconjunctival hemorrhage, keratitis, iritis, glaucoma, chemical burn, and scleritis. Signs and symptoms of red eye include eye discharge, redness, pain, photophobia, itching, and visual changes. Generally, viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting conditions, and serious complications are rare. Because there is no specific diagnostic test to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, most cases are treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics. Allergies or irritants also may cause conjunctivitis. The cause of red eye can be diagnosed through a detailed patient history and careful eye examination, and treatment is based on the underlying etiology. Recognizing the need for emergent referral to an ophthalmologist is key in the primary care management of red eye. Referral is necessary when severe pain is not relieved with topical anesthetics; topical steroids are needed; or the patient has vision loss, copious purulent discharge, corneal involvement, traumatic eye injury, recent ocular surgery, distorted pupil, herpes infection, or recurrent infections.
