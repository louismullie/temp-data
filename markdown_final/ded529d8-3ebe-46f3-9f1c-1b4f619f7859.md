## Question

How should the dose of Toujeo be adjusted in patients previously taking Lantus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to convert a patient from Lantus (insulin glargine 100 U/mL) to Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 U/mL) and what dose adjustments, titration, and monitoring are needed to do this safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic differences between U-100 and U-300 glargine and why unit-for-unit conversion is not appropriate. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled starting dose for switching from Lantus to Toujeo. Next, I will review clinical trial data to estimate the expected dose increase and reconcile any discrepancies. After that, I need to outline titration targets and frequency, monitoring during the transition, and special populations or scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with explicit safety checks and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale for dose adjustment. Toujeo (U-300) is more concentrated and has a flatter, longer pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile than Lantus (U-100), but on a unit-to-unit basis it provides less glucose-lowering effect at steady state, with clamp data showing approximately a 27% reduction in 24-hour glucose-lowering activity versus U-100 at the same dose, which explains why higher unit doses are typically required to match glycemic control [^111isE9T] [^115AMNWM]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude across populations; meta-analytic and clinical program summaries consistently show that patients on Gla-300 require about 10–18% more basal units than on Gla-100 to achieve similar A1c, with higher differentials in type 1 diabetes and smaller differentials in type 2 diabetes, which aligns with the mechanistic expectation of lower biopotency per unit for U-300 [^112JWJi7] [^113qvfEh] [^113Vm5ms].

> I should confirm the FDA-labeled switching instruction. The Toujeo prescribing information directs that for patients currently on once-daily long-acting insulin, start Toujeo at the same unit dose as the prior once-daily basal insulin, but explicitly warns that patients controlled on Lantus will generally need a higher daily dose of Toujeo to maintain the same level of glycemic control, and to monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks after switching [^114iUWsv] [^115KWLq1]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; this "same-unit" start is a conservative initiation to mitigate hypoglycemia risk, anticipating subsequent upward titration based on fasting glucose response, which is the critical operational point here [^116BUzxy].

> Next, I should review clinical trial data to quantify the expected dose increase. In randomized studies, patients switched to Toujeo used approximately 12–18% more basal insulin than those on Lantus while achieving similar A1c endpoints, with the higher end of that range in type 1 diabetes and the lower end in type 2 diabetes, which matches the PK/PD expectation and supports planning for a roughly 10–20% dose increase over the first weeks to months as needed [^113Vm5ms] [^111fUKZ4] [^112JWJi7]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the average increase was closer to 27% based on clamp data; let me reconsider — clamp studies reflect relative biopotency per unit, whereas treat-to-target trials reflect practical titration to fasting targets and often show smaller net dose differentials by study end, so reconciling both, I should frame the expectation as a 10–20% practical increase with the recognition that early glucose readings may look higher until titration catches up [^111isE9T] [^112JWJi7].

> I will now examine titration strategy and targets. Standard treat-to-target titration uses fasting plasma glucose to guide basal dose changes, with typical targets of 80–130 mg/dL and adjustments of about 2–4 units every 3–4 days based on median or mean fasting values, avoiding changes more frequently than every 3 days to allow steady-state effects to emerge. Patient-led or clinic-led algorithms both work when implemented consistently [^116BUzxy] [^115a2C9j]. Let me verify feasibility data; randomized and real-world programs show that weekly or semi-weekly titration with 2–4 unit steps achieves fasting targets reliably with low hypoglycemia risk when paired with structured SMBG, and this applies to Gla-300 as well as Gla-100 [^115cobjQ] [^112fEnBj] [^115a2C9j].

> Next, I should review monitoring during the transition. Because the full glucose-lowering effect of Toujeo may take up to 5 days to manifest and early coverage can be insufficient, I need to ensure daily fasting glucose checks for the first 1–2 weeks, with consideration of additional daytime checks if symptoms or patterns suggest under-treatment, and I should counsel on injection site rotation away from lipodystrophy to avoid erratic absorption during the switch [^114iUWsv] [^1137ZzJ1]. Hold on, I should verify hypoglycemia counseling too; given the potential for transient hyperglycemia early after switching, patients may be tempted to stack correction doses — this should be discouraged in favor of planned titration to avoid rebound hypoglycemia once steady state is reached [^111igXQR].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In chronic kidney disease with eGFR below 50 mL/min/1.73 m², insulin clearance is reduced and dose reductions of 25–50% or more may be needed with careful, slower titration. In hepatic impairment, monitor closely and titrate cautiously. In older adults or those with high hypoglycemia risk, consider a modestly lower starting dose and slower titration while maintaining the same monitoring cadence [^116FpoeU] [^115Jusbb]. I should double-check inpatient considerations; if a patient on Toujeo is admitted and switched to a different basal insulin such as detemir, a 1:1 interchange has been associated with higher hypoglycemia rates, so a dose reduction and close monitoring are prudent until the new regimen stabilizes, underscoring the general principle that cross-analog unit conversions require caution and observation [^115yZpHU].

> Now, I will synthesize the practical recommendation. Start Toujeo at the same total daily unit dose as the patient's current once-daily Lantus dose, recognizing this is a conservative starting point. Anticipate and plan for an increase of roughly 10–20% over the ensuing weeks to achieve similar fasting control, with the understanding that early fasting values may be modestly higher until steady state and titration take effect. Titrate by 2–4 units every 3–4 days toward a fasting target of 80–130 mg/dL, monitor fasting glucose daily for the first 1–2 weeks, and reassess concomitant therapies if fasting improves but A1c remains above goal, at which point adding or intensifying prandial coverage or a GLP-1 RA may be appropriate [^114iUWsv] [^116BUzxy] [^111uX4DA]. But wait, what if the patient is on high-dose basal therapy and pen delivery limits are a concern? For patients requiring more than 80 units per injection, Toujeo Max SoloStar allows up to 160 units per injection in 2-unit steps, which can reduce injection burden during titration without compromising accuracy [^117KJWfF].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and follow-up. Hypoglycemia remains the most common adverse effect and risk rises with aggressive titration or concomitant agents like sulfonylureas; educate on recognition and treatment, and consider de-intensifying secretagogues if hypoglycemia emerges during intensification; document A1c, weight, and fasting glucose at follow-up to ensure the switch achieves the intended glycemic profile without excess adverse effects [^116WUXpf] [^1137ZzJ1]. Hold on, I should verify one more point: the directionality matters; if later switching from Toujeo back to Lantus, a dose reduction of about 20% is recommended to mitigate hypoglycemia risk, which is consistent with the lower biopotency of U-300 per unit and helps close the loop on safe bidirectional switching strategies [^113r9kzd] [^114No5iL].

---

When switching from Lantus to Toujeo, **start Toujeo at the same unit dose** as Lantus [^114iUWsv] and titrate every 3–4 days [^116BUzxy] based on fasting glucose to a target of 80–130 mg/dL [^1155bSDF]. Expect to need **~1.2–1.3 times more units** of Toujeo to match Lantus' effect because Toujeo is less potent per unit [^113Vm5ms] [^111igXQR]. Monitor glucose closely during the first weeks [^1137ZzJ1] and adjust other diabetes medications as needed to reduce hypoglycemia risk [^111igXQR].

---

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences

Toujeo (glargine U-300) has a **longer, flatter profile** than Lantus (glargine U-100), with a half-life of ~19 hours and duration up to 36 hours, enabling once-daily dosing with less nocturnal hypoglycemia [^111DVgnS] [^112s9Tsv]. However, **Toujeo is less potent per unit** than Lantus, so higher unit doses are usually needed for equivalent glycemic control [^112JWJi7] [^111isE9T].

---

## Clinical evidence on dose adjustment

Clinical trials show that patients switched from Lantus to Toujeo typically require **12–18% more units** to achieve similar A1c and fasting glucose [^111fUKZ4] [^113Vm5ms]. For example, in type 1 diabetes, mean basal dose increased from 43 to 51 units (18% increase) [^113Vm5ms]; in type 2 diabetes, increases of 12–15% were observed [^111fUKZ4].

---

## Recommended initial dose adjustment strategy

Per FDA labeling, **start Toujeo at the same unit dose as Lantus** and titrate to effect, expecting to need more units with Toujeo [^114iUWsv] [^115KWLq1]. This unit-for-unit start balances hypoglycemia risk with the need to titrate upward as steady state is reached [^115KWLq1] [^111igXQR].

---

## Practical titration algorithm

A **simple, treat-to-target titration** can be used:

| **Fasting blood glucose (mg/dl)** | **Dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| < 80 | ↓ 2 units |
| 80–130 | No change |
| > 130 | ↑ 2 units |

---

Adjust the dose every 3–4 days [^116BUzxy] until the fasting target is consistently achieved [^112fEnBj].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

During the switch, **monitor fasting glucose daily** for the first few weeks and titrate every 3–4 days [^114iUWsv] [^116BUzxy]. Continue frequent checks until stable, then resume routine monitoring.

---

## Potential risks and precautions

- **Hypoglycemia**: Monitor closely, especially with other glucose-lowering drugs [^111igXQR].
- **Hyperglycemia**: May occur early until steady state (~5 days); titrate promptly [^111igXQR].
- **Injection site reactions**: Rotate sites to avoid lipodystrophy and absorption issues [^111igXQR].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial dose**: Same unit dose as Lantus [^114iUWsv].
- **Expected increase**: ~12–18% higher dose with Toujeo for equivalent control [^115AMNWM].
- **Titration**: Adjust every 3–4 days to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL [^116BUzxy] [^1155bSDF].
- **Monitoring**: Daily fasting glucose checks initially; titrate until stable [^114iUWsv].
- **Safety**: Adjust other diabetes medications as needed to reduce hypoglycemia risk [^111igXQR].

---

Switching from Lantus to Toujeo should start with a unit-for-unit dose, then titrate every 3–4 days to fasting glucose targets, anticipating a **12–18% dose increase** for equivalent control, with close monitoring and medication adjustments to minimize hypoglycemia [^114iUWsv] [^116BUzxy] [^113Vm5ms] [^111fUKZ4].

IDeg versus IGlar U300 (Toujeo ®)

IGlar U300 is a concentrated insulin glargine product (300 units/ml) for once-daily use for the treatment of T1DM and T2DM in adults. With the IGlar U300 prefilled pen, the maximum dose per injection is 80U. IGlar U300 has a flatter and more prolonged (up to 36 h) profile of insulin concentration and glucose-lowering activity compared with IGlar U100 at the same dose. IGlar U300 is not bioequivalent to IGlar U100 and they are not directly interchangeable. An approximately 10–18% higher dose is required when patients are switched from IGlar U100 to IGlar U300.

In clinical trials, IGlar U300 was non-inferior to IGlar U100 in terms of HbA 1c reduction in T1DM, T2DM BOT and T2DM B/B. In T1DM, there was no significant difference in hypoglycaemia (severe, nocturnal or overall) between IGlar U300 and IGlar U100; in T2DM BOT there was no significant difference in severe or nocturnal hypoglycaemia but a significantly lower rate of overall hypoglycaemia with IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100; and in T2DM B/B there was no significant difference in severe or overall hypoglycaemia but a significantly lower rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia with IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100. In all three patient groups, the total daily basal insulin dose was higher with IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100; by 17.5% in T1DM, 17% in T2DM BOT and 10% in T2DM B/B.

Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with TOUJEO. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for TOUJEO with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice.

In the TOUJEO adult program, severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to administer a resuscitative action. In the pediatric program, severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with semiconsciousness, unconsciousness, coma and/or convulsions in a patient who had altered mental status and could not assist in his own care, and who may have required glucagon or intravenous glucose.

The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 1 diabetes receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6.6% at 26 weeks. The incidence of hypoglycemia with a glucose level less than 54 mg/dL with or without symptoms was 77.7% at 26 weeks.

The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6% at 26 weeks and the incidence of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self-monitored or plasma glucose value less than 54 mg/dL regardless of symptoms was 80.3%.

The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 2 diabetes was 5% at 26 weeks in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen, and 1.0% and 0.9% respectively at 26 weeks in the two studies where patients received TOUJEO as part of a basal-insulin only regimen. The incidence of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self-monitored or plasma glucose value less than 54 mg/dL regardless of symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving TOUJEO ranged from 9% to 44.6% at 26 weeks and the highest risk was again seen in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen.

Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control

Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy.

Dose and Regimen for Intensification with Mix50

When using premixed insulin for intensification, regardless of whether the initial dose is basal or premixed, standard practice is to divide the current total daily dose across two doses injected before breakfast and before dinner. Alternatively, Mix50 can be given before breakfast and a low mix before dinner to provide more overnight basal insulin. For patients currently on low mix, consider using Mix50 before any meal where PPG is > 10 mmol/L or whichever meal routinely has the highest carbohydrate content. Dose titration follows the same general pattern as for patients on once-daily insulin. However, the doses should be adjusted independently, depending on the glucose profile; adjust the pre-breakfast dose according to the pre-dinner glucose level and the pre-dinner dose according to the FBG level. A third dose can be added before lunch if target HbA1c or PPG levels are not met. A general guideline for switching patients from low mix to Mix50 is shown in Fig. 4; however, as always, regimens and doses should be tailored to the individual patient.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Onset of Action

The pharmacodynamic profiles for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as a single dose of 0.4, 0.6, or 0.9 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes showed that on average, the onset of action develops over 6 hours post dose for all three single doses of TOUJEO.

Single-Dose Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamics for single 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 U/kg doses of TOUJEO in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study. On a unit-to-unit basis, TOUJEO had a lower maximum (GIRmax) and 24-hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC0–24) compared to LANTUS. The overall glucose lowering effect of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was 12% of the glucose lowering effect of an equivalent dose of LANTUS. Glucose lowering at least 30% of the effect of a single 0.4 U/kg dose of LANTUS was not observed until the single dose of TOUJEO exceeded 0.6 U/kg.

Multiple Once-Daily Dose Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamics of TOUJEO after 8 days of daily injection was evaluated in 30 patients with type 1 diabetes. At steady state, the 24-hour glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC0–24) of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was approximately 27% lower with a different distribution profile than that of an equivalent dose of LANTUS [see Dosage and Administration (2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The glucose lowering effect of a TOUJEO dose increased with each daily administration.

The pharmacodynamic profile for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as multiple once-daily subcutaneous injections of 0.4 U/kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 1.

### Insulin matters: a practical approach to basal insulin management in type 2 diabetes [^115a2C9j]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

How to Dose?

There are several important concepts to remember when dosing basal insulin: (a) the starting dose will be wrong; (b) there is no maximal insulin dose; (c) titration of insulin dose is the key. Each of these concepts needs to be explicitly discussed and understood by the patient in order for titration to be successful. Despite 92% of physicians agreeing that "insulin intensification is an essential element of diabetes management", 30% of primary care physicians "never or rarely" personally intensified insulin (vs 4% of specialists) in the multinational survey MODIFY. Interestingly, in a recent multinational survey, HCPs generally preferred a gradual and safe approach to titration to avoid hypoglycemia whereas patients are frustrated by time to reach goal. It is therefore important to manage the patient's expectations.

The starting dose for basal insulin recommended by this panel is 10 U/day. The dose should be incrementally increased on a regular basis using target FBG as the determinant for dose adjustments. At initiation, educating patients that many people will need at least 40–50 units of basal insulin to achieve target FBG is useful for goal setting and behavior shaping. This may help mitigate patient fear/reluctance to up-titrate.

Box 1A details the recommendations by the panel for basal insulin dose and titration.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^113WYZoL]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Characteristics of Patients Unable to Achieve Target HbA 1c Stratified by Endpoint FPG

Further analysis of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% was conducted according to whether or not they were able to achieve an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L (Table 4). The majority of patients unable to achieve target HbA 1c also failed to reach an FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L (74.5% vs 25.5%). Patients with an endpoint FPG of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L had significantly lower endpoint HbA 1c (7.60 ± 0.88% vs 7.90 ± 0.89%; P < 0.0001), baseline FPG (8.01 ± 1.82 vs 8.97 ± 2.25 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), endpoint FPG (5.46 ± 0.57 vs 8.01 ± 2.32 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), baseline 2-h PPG (11.67 ± 3.09 vs 12.81 ± 3.86 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), endpoint 2-h PPG (9.24 ± 2.66 vs 10.89 ± 2.68 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), BMI (24.12 ± 3.04 vs 25.76 ± 3.67 kg/m 2; P < 0.0001), dose of endpoint insulin glargine in U/day (16.42 ± 6.15 vs 18.39 ± 6.62 U/day; P = 0.0002), and baseline dose of premixed insulin in U/day (29.78 ± 9.28 vs 32.33 ± 11.55 U/day; P = 0.0013) than patients with an endpoint FPG of > 6.1 mmol/L. Other characteristics such as age, baseline HbA 1c, duration of diabetes, dose of endpoint insulin glargine in U/kg/day, and baseline dose of premixed insulin in U/kg/day were similar between both groups.

### Insulin glargine benefits patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic treatment: an observational study of everyday practice in 12, 216 patients [^117CTEG1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

This observational study aimed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of adding insulin glargine (LANTUS((R))) to support oral antidiabetic (OAD) treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes in everyday practice.

Methods

A 9-month, open-label, multicentre, observational study, with an optional 20-month extension phase, in which add-on insulin glargine therapy was initiated in 12,216 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on OADs. The insulin glargine dose was adjusted at the physician's discretion, reflecting everyday practice. The main outcome measures were changes in HbA(1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin dose and body mass index (BMI).

Results

At baseline, mean (± s.d.) age was 63.9 ± 11.3 years; disease duration was > 5 years in 47% of patients, 1–5 years in 39% of patients and < 1 year in 10% of patients, while 4% of patients were newly diagnosed. Addition of insulin glargine to OAD therapy led to reductions in mean HbA(1c) (-1.5% from 8.7%) and FBG (-69 mg/dl from 202 mg/dl) levels after 3 months, which were maintained after 9 months [HbA(1c): -1.7%; FBG: -71 mg/dl (-3.9 mmol/l)] without an increase in BMI. Similar glycaemic control was observed after 20 months in the 2721 patients in the extension study. Adverse drug reactions were documented in 26 patients (0.2%). Of 47 adverse events documented, 19 were due to hypoglycaemia.

Conclusions

In everyday practice, patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled on OADs benefit from add-on basal insulin treatment with insulin glargine as they demonstrate improved glycaemic control without weight gain.

*Doses were adjusted weekly; † doses were adjusted at every visit (AT.LANTUS: weekly during clinic visits or telephone contact visits; ATLAS: clinic visits at baseline, weeks 2, 6, 12, 16 and 24; telephone contact visits were made at weeks 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 20; TAKE CONTROL: weekly for the first 8 weeks, biweekly until week 12, monthly until week 24); ‡ doses were adjusted every 3 days; § doses were adjusted twice a week; doses were adjusted daily

A pooled meta‐analysis that compared the efficacy and safety of IDeg versus Gla‐100 across BEGIN RCTs, which included both insulin‐pretreated and insulin‐naïve people with T2D, showed similar glycaemic control with IDeg and Gla‐100 and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia with IDeg versus Gla‐100 during the overall study period (rate ratio: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.74–0.94]), particularly during the maintenance period (0.75 [0.66–0.87]). 37 However, the lower risk of hypoglycaemia observed with IDeg versus Gla‐100 was not observed during the titration period. 37 It should be noted that the BEGIN RCTs adopted a very stringent FPG target of > 4.0 to < 5.0 mmol/L (> 70 to < 90 mg/dL), 37 which is seldom used in adults with T2D in routine clinical practice, and this may have increased the risk of hypoglycaemia observed in these trials.

Treatment Changes

Gla-300 was administered once daily using a pre-filled insulin pen (Toujeo ® Solostar ®) in the evening, from dinnertime to bedtime according to the patient's and the investigator's choice at the same time of the day ± 3 h if needed. The time of injection could differ from the time of injection of the previous basal insulin. Pens were labeled for the study. Initial dose was equal to the dose with the previous basal insulin when this one was injected once daily (80% of the total insulin dose if twice daily). Gla-300 dose was titrated at least weekly, or every 3–4 days when possible, according to the titration algorithm (Table 1). Non-insulin treatment remained unchanged during the whole study unless a treatment had to be stopped for safety reason according to the investigator. Global treatment adherence was assessed by the investigator between V1 and V2 and between V1 and V3 as ≥ 80% or < 80% according to the remaining insulin in the returned pens, whereas the adherence to the titration algorithm was evaluated at V2 and V3 according to the patient's logbook (F-SMBG, insulin dose, hypoglycemia events, etc.).

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^111uH7rC]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

This study also demonstrates that BMI could be a factor influencing efficacy outcomes. Patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were shown to have lower baseline BMI than patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0%. Higher BMI has been shown to be associated with decreased insulin sensitivity, which may be why patients with lower BMI exhibit greater glycemic control in response to insulin glargine.

Another factor of significance was the insulin glargine dose at endpoint, which was shown to be negatively associated with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%. This may have been on account of the suboptimal glycemic control of patients at baseline. At baseline, the mean HbA 1c of the mITT set was 7.8% and the mean FPG was 8.1 mmol/L.

Findings from this study demonstrate that FPG is an important factor influencing the HbA 1c level of patients. Patients with an improvement in HbA 1c had significantly higher baseline HbA 1c in comparison to the unchanged and deterioration groups. This reflects a more marked reduction in HbA 1c for poorly controlled patients, although this does not necessarily indicate their achievement of HbA 1c < 7.0%. Fasting hyperglycemia is the main contributor to glycemic load for poorly controlled T2DM and this suggests that for patients with poor glycemic control at baseline, treatment with insulin glargine, which targets FPG, has a greater impact on overall glycemic control. This has also been observed in the study by Zhang et al. Patients with higher baseline HbA 1c levels, as a result of the nature of their hyperglycemia, are therefore likely to experience improvements in glycemic control in comparison to those with lower baseline HbA 1c levels during treatment switching.

### Practical use of insulin degludec / insulin aspart in a multinational setting: beyond the guidelines [^111ERzcQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is a fixed‐ratio co‐formulation of insulin degludec, which provides long‐lasting basal insulin coverage, and insulin aspart, which targets postprandial glycaemia. This review provides expert opinion on the practical clinical use of IDegAsp, including: dose timings relative to meals, when and how to intensify treatment from once‐daily (OD) to twice‐daily (BID) dose adjustments, and use in special populations (including hospitalized patients). IDegAsp could be considered as one among the choices for initiating insulin treatment, preferential to starting on basal insulin alone, particularly for people with severe hyperglycaemia and/or when postprandial hyperglycaemia is a major concern. The recommended starting dose of IDegAsp is 10 units with the most carbohydrate‐rich meal(s), followed by individualized dose adjustments. Insulin doses should be titrated once weekly in two‐unit steps, guided by individualized fasting plasma glucose targets and based on patient goals, preferences and hypoglycaemia risk. Options for intensification from IDegAsp OD are discussed, which should be guided by HbA1c, prandial glucose levels, meal patterns and patient preferences. Recommendations for switching to IDegAsp from basal insulin, premixed insulins OD/BID, and basal‐plus/basal–bolus regimens are discussed. IDegAsp can be co‐administered with other antihyperglycaemic drugs; however, sulphonylureas frequently need to be discontinued or the dose reduced, and the IDegAsp dose may need to be decreased when sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors or glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists are added. Considerations around the initiation or continuation of IDegAsp in hospitalized individuals are discussed, as well as in those undergoing medical procedures.

### Real-world dose adjustments of biologic treatments in psoriasis and their economic impact: a Swedish national population study [^112MMhMn]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The weighted mean dose for etanercept was relatively stable throughout, with some variability from approximately the third year of treatment. It is noteworthy that, while remaining within SmPC recommendations, the etanercept dose could be increased from 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly to 50 mg twice weekly for up to 12 weeks if response was not achieved. The influence of this change in dose on overall dosing could not be ascertained from our registry data. Low patient numbers up to the fifth year might also have influenced the reliability of the dosing pattern observed.

Our findings are broadly consistent with the limited evidence available from previous real‐world studies, which reported that biologics are frequently prescribed in practice at doses that are higher than recommended by the manufacturer. In studies reporting specific biologics, dose elevation occurred in a higher proportion of patients with etanercept compared with other biologics, including adalimumab and ustekinumab. Our study, although not directly comparable to others in terms of patient characteristics, doses and treatment durations, supports these findings.

Although analyses of registry data cannot provide insights into reasons for biologic dose increases in individual patients, perception of suboptimal efficacy is likely to be a major contributor. Notably, etanercept showed the greatest mean dose increase in the current study. In addition to suboptimal efficacy, other factors, such as lack of tolerability and market factors, including the availability of new biologics, contribute to changes in the prescription of individual biologics. Additional research is warranted to identify the impact of these factors in clinical practice. Future research could also study why physicians increase dosing rather than switch treatments. There may be a perception that, through increasing the dosing, patients will be able to stay on that specific treatment for longer, even though switching to more effective treatment options might be a better strategy. Additional studies could investigate persistence and patient outcomes when comparing doses of biologics that are at, above and below the recommended doses.

### Transition between subcutaneous and sublingual allergen immunotherapy: recommendations of the Brazilian association of allergy and immunology (ASBAI) [^113ojPe3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

What precautions should be taken when switching from SCIT to SLIT?

The safety of SLIT allows for a change in application route with minimal chance of adverse effects. Patients must have controlled allergic disease. Patients and/or caregivers should be counseled on how to properly perform SLIT. As applications will occur daily or several times a week, the need for adherence to treatment to obtain the desired effects should be reinforced.

The Immunotherapy Department of the Brazilian Association of Allergy and Immunology offers the following recommendations: (1) preferably, use extracts from the same supplier; (2) if the patient undergoing SCIT has already completed the induction phase, the switch to SLIT can be performed by using doses recommended for maintenance from the beginning; (3) perform periodic clinical evaluation, initially monthly, so that the effects of the treatment are analyzed; and (4) after clinical evaluation, adjust the dose when necessary to increase effectiveness and/or prevent adverse effects.

2.3	Starting Dose in Insulin-Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes.
The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of TOUJEO may take five days to fully manifest and the first TOUJEO dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When initiating TOUJEO, monitor glucose daily.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily.

2.4	Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to TOUJEO from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For patients currently on once-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at the same unit dose as the once-daily long-acting insulin dose. For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL), expect that a higher daily dose of TOUJEO will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients currently on twice-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at 80% of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice-daily dosage.
When switching patients to TOUJEO, monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

2 METHODS

2.1 Trial design

EDITION 2, EDITION 3 and EDITION JP 2 were multicentre, randomized, open‐label, two‐arm, parallel‐group, phase 3a studies in different populations of adults with T2DM (NCT01499095, NCT01676220, NCT01689142) and have been described previously. 6, 8, 10 In EDITION 2 and EDITION JP 2, participants must have used basal insulin treatment (≥ 42 U/d in EDITION 2) for more than 6 months, in combination with non‐insulin antihyperglycaemic agents within the previous 4 weeks. For the EDITION 2 trial, exclusion criteria included recent (within the past 2 months) use of sulphonylureas. In the EDITION JP 2 trial, concomitant sulphonylurea and/or glinide treatment was permitted, with doses adjusted if at least two symptomatic or at least one severe hypoglycaemic episode(s) occurred. Overall, 63% of participants in the EDITION JP 2 trial received sulphonylureas and/or glinides, with a similar proportion of participants in the Gla‐300 (62%) and Gla‐100 (64%) groups. 11 Participants in the EDITION 3 trial were insulin‐naïve and were required to have used non‐insulin antihyperglycaemic agents for at least 6 months before screening; if participants were receiving sulphonylureas/glinides, these medications were discontinued.

Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive once‐daily injections of Gla‐300 (Toujeo, Sanofi, Paris, France) using a modified SoloSTAR (Sanofi) pen‐injector in the EDITION 2 trial or a modified Tactipen (Sanofi) injector in the EDITION 3 and JP 2 trials, or Gla‐100 (Lantus, Sanofi) using a SoloSTAR pen. Basal insulin was titrated, seeking a pre‐breakfast SMPG target of 4.4–5.6 mmol/L (80–100 mg/dL).

Basal insulin injections were to be administered in the evening, defined as the time immediately before the evening meal until bedtime, at the same time every day. All participants recorded time of injection.

Alternative titration algorithms can simplify regimen complexity, and thereby help empower patients to manage their diabetes more conveniently and effectively, as demonstrated in AT.LANTUS 19 and the INSIGHT study. 20 The present trial assessed whether similar glycaemic control and tolerability could be achieved with IDegLira using a simpler, more pragmatic once‐weekly titration algorithm in insulin‐naïve patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with OADs than previously employed in the DUAL clinical programme. Therefore, this trial investigated the safety and efficacy of IDegLira titrated once weekly, based on the mean of 2 pre‐breakfast plasma glucose (PG) measurements, vs twice‐weekly titration, based on the mean of 3 pre‐breakfast PG readings (ie, 6 measurements and 2 dose adjustments per week).

Discussion

Insulin replacement therapy is an essential component of the management of T1DM and biosimilar insulins can enhance accessibility to insulin therapy. The present post hoc analysis of the randomized phase III ABES study demonstrated similar efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity outcomes with LY IGlar compared with IGlar over 24 weeks in Chinese patients with T1DM who were receiving daily IGlar plus mealtime insulins pre-study. Glycemic outcomes, including change in HbA1c from baseline and HbA1c target attainment, were similar between the LY IGlar and IGlar groups at week 24, as were total and basal insulin doses. There were no significant differences in the incidence of total, severe, or nocturnal hypoglycemia, and TEAEs were comparable between groups. Immunogenicity outcomes were also comparable for patients receiving LY IGlar and IGlar, with similar rates of insulin antibodies and TEAR observed at study endpoint and overall, and median percentage antibody binding remained well below the threshold for anti-insulin antibody levels (5% binding) in both groups throughout the study.

Regulatory approval of biosimilar medications requires demonstration of a high degree of similarity to the reference product in terms of physicochemical and biologic properties, as well as pharmacologic characteristics, efficacy, and safety in clinical trials. However, the studies designed to support regulatory approval of biosimilar medications do not necessarily address interchangeability, which is a related attribute referring to the ability to switch between two equivalent medications with anticipation of the same effect in a given clinical setting. Although regulatory definitions of interchangeability differ among countries, supportive evidence generally requires evaluation of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity outcomes when patients are switched between the originator and biosimilar product. To our knowledge, the present analysis is the first to provide evidence to support switching from IGlar to LY IGlar in clinical practice in Chinese patients with T1DM. The absence of significant differences between LY IGlar and IGlar is consistent with a recent systematic literature review of 178 studies, in which the authors found no evidence for major efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity concerns when patients are switched to biosimilar from originator biologic medicines.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^117JWpdD]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately three-quarters (74.5%) of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% in this study also failed to achieve FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L. The lack of adequate FPG control in patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% is not surprising given the increased contribution of fasting hyperglycemia to poorly controlled T2DM. Considering their high FPG levels, these patients would have a lower tendency to experience hypoglycemia. Our analysis also showed that the incidence of hypoglycemia did not increase in patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0% compared with patients achieving endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% (P = 0.6889), even though patients in the ≥ 7.0% group were older, with a longer duration of diabetes, and a higher proportion of complications and comorbidities. The average endpoint insulin glargine dose for patients who failed both HbA 1c and FPG targets was 0.26 ± 0.09 U/kg/day, which was approximately 40% lower than the doses (0.4–0.5 U/kg/day) required to achieve adequate glycemic control while maintaining a low risk of hypoglycemia reported by other studies. This indicates that there is still potential for up-titration of the dose of insulin glargine in patients who failed to reach both glycemic targets. Hence, further up-titration of the insulin glargine dose in patients who failed to reach both HbA 1c and FPG targets may not increase the risk of hypoglycemia, and improve the likelihood of achieving adequate FPG control and therefore target HbA 1c.

### Commentary to "Differential effect of hypoalbuminemia on hypoglycemia on type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin glargine 300 U / mL and insulin degludec" by kawaguchi et al. diabetes therapy 2019 [^111CDuBw]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

"For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL) expect that a higher daily dose of TOUJEO will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control".

"At steady state, the 24 h glucose lowering effect (GIR-AUC 0–24) of TOUJEO 0.4 U/kg was approximately 27% lower with a different distribution profile than that of an equivalent dose of LANTUS".

Given that degludec and glargine U100 have been shown to produce parity in HbA 1c in numerous trials at equivalent unit doses, it follows that degludec will have a greater unit potency than glargine U300. This has indeed been confirmed in glucose clamp studies. Assuming that the disparity between glargine U300 and degludec is similar to that between glargine U300 and U100, insulin-naïve patients who commenced the cross-over study on the same unit dose of glargine U300 as of degludec would have effectively commenced on a dose with approximately 27% less glucose-lowering potency. Similarly, previous insulin users switching unit-for-unit from, for example, NPH insulin or glargine U100 to degludec would have maintained an equivalent dose, whereas those switching to glargine U300 would, in effect, have received a substantial dose reduction by 27%. Admittedly, the minimum 10-day titration period would have gone some way to mitigating this dose difference, but this interval is short and would have allowed only a few titration steps. In the second period of the study, patients were crossed over unit-for-unit and the dose left unchanged, so those switching from degludec to glargine U300 would have, in effect, had a 27% dose reduction, whereas those switching from glargine U300 to degludec would have had a substantial dose increase, in effect by 37%.

Conclusions

In this subgroup analysis of the randomized controlled phase III ABES trial, LY IGlar and IGlar had similar efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity over 24 weeks in Chinese patients with T1DM who were receiving pre-study IGlar.

### Impact of dosing on treatment with TNF inhibitors: managing dose adjustment [^113gCTeE]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The introduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represented a significant advance in the treatment of this debilitating disease, and led to dramatic changes in overall treatment goals and guidelines. Despite these advances, best practice use of TNF inhibitors in the clinical setting still needs to be determined. In particular, although all TNF inhibitors have standard, recommended doses that were determined in clinical trials, dose adjustments are often necessary in clinical practice to optimize therapeutic outcomes for individual patients. Dose escalation may be necessary in patients who experience disease flares, or because of insufficient initial efficacy or loss of efficacy over time, while dose tapering can be a response to adverse events, or if a patient achieves remission of disease. The amount of available evidence for managing dose adjustments for the currently available TNF inhibitors varies, and thus the strategies used with each are different. At present, although dose adjustments are common, data are insufficient for consensus guidelines to be recommended.

Importantly, for the first period of the cross-over study, both insulin-naïve patients started on the same unit dose for each insulin (glargine U300 or degludec) and previously insulin-treated patients were switched unit-for-unit to the study insulins. For the second treatment period, the basal insulin was also switched (from glargine U300 to degludec, or vice versa) unit for unit (after a 3–4-day wash-out period) and then left unchanged. This approach presupposes parity in the glucose-lowering potency of the two insulins, but the potency of glargine U300 is known to be reduced compared with insulin glargine 100 units/mL (glargine U100) and degludec. Indeed, the prescribing information for glargine U300 (TOUJEO ®; Sanofi S. A. Paris, France) states:

### Safety and efficacy of switching SAR341402 insulin aspart and originator insulin aspart vs continuous use of originator insulin aspart in adults with type 1 diabetes: the GEMELLI X trial [^116VMB3M]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

SAR341402 insulin aspart (SAR-Asp) is a rapid-acting insulin analog developed as an interchangeable biosimilar to the marketed insulin aspart reference product (NovoLog; NN-Asp). GEMELLI X was a randomized controlled trial to assess outcomes with a biosimilar in line with the US Food and Drug Administration requirements for designation as an interchangeable biosimilar. This report assessed whether multiple switches between SAR-Asp and NN-Asp lead to equivalent safety and efficacy compared with continuous use of NN-Asp in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) treated with multiple daily injections, using once-daily insulin glargine U100 (Lantus) as the basal insulin.

Methods

This open-label randomized (1:1), parallel-group, phase 3 trial compared four × four weeks of alternating use of individually titrated SAR-Asp and NN-Asp (NN-Asp for first four weeks, SAR-Asp in last four weeks; switching group) vs 16 weeks of continuous use of NN-Asp (nonswitching group). End points included pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, adverse events, hypoglycemia, insulin dose, and change in efficacy parameters.

Results

Of the 210 patients randomized, 200 (95.5%) completed the trial. Patients assigned to switching group (n = 104) and nonswitching group (n = 106) showed similar safety and tolerability, including anti-insulin aspart antibody responses, adverse events, and hypoglycemia. At week 16, there was no relevant difference between switching vs nonswitching groups in the change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (least square [LS] mean difference = 0.05% [95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.13, 0.22]; 0.50 mmol/mol [-1.40, 2.39]), fasting plasma glucose (LS mean difference = 0.23 mmol/L [95% CI = -1.08, 1.53]; 4.12 mg/dL [-19.38, 27.62]), and changes in insulin dosages.

Conclusions

Alternating doses of SAR-Asp and NN-Asp compared with continuous use of NN-Asp showed similar safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy in adults with T1D. This study supports interchangeability between SAR-Asp and NN-Asp in T1D management.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^1132nx7g]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The selection of appropriate therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can often be challenging given the availability of a wide variety of therapeutic options. However, it is recognized that most patients with long-standing T2DM will need to incorporate insulin into their treatment regimen at some point because of the progressive nature of the condition. Early initiation of insulin is increasingly advocated to enable patients to achieve adequate glycemic control. Several international guidelines, as well as the Chinese treatment guidelines, recommend that insulin should be considered if the initiation of lifestyle modifications and metformin or combination therapy of two to three oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) is unable to achieve and maintain target glycemic levels. While some guidelines recommend initiation with basal insulin, a long-acting insulin analogue that maintains basal glycemic levels throughout the day, others recommend initiation with basal or premixed insulin. Premixed insulin, a combination of rapid-acting bolus insulin and intermediate-acting basal insulin, was developed to mimic physiological endogenous insulin secretion. Premixed insulin is typically prescribed and initiated in approximately 70.0% of Chinese patients with T2DM, while only around 10.0% receive basal insulin. This is partly because premixed insulin was available in China earlier than basal insulin analogues, and is considerably cheaper. While premixed insulins are considered to be a good option for patients who require both basal and prandial insulin but wish to limit the number of daily injections, the fixed dose combination of basal and rapid-acting insulins means that the dose of insulins cannot be conveniently adjusted to meet individual patient requirements. Additionally, in comparison to treatment with basal insulin, premixed insulin has been associated with inadequate glycemic control, as well as an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

Optimally titrating the dose of insulin glargine is therefore a critical factor influencing achievement of adequate FPG control and therefore target HbA 1c. This finding holds particular significance as it demonstrates a mechanism by which patients can achieve target HbA 1c following a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs. This finding is also relevant to Asia, given that physicians in Asia often have a cautious approach to the titration of insulin, especially as Asian patients with T2DM, who are leaner than Caucasian patients, are perceived to be at an increased risk of hypoglycemia. This fear is unfounded as several studies conducted in Asian patients with T2DM have shown that the rates of hypoglycemia are low with insulin glargine when taken as combination therapy with OADs in insulin-naïve patients or in patients switching from premixed insulin. A study by Riddle et al. which sought to determine the relative contributions of basal hyperglycemia versus postprandial hyperglycemia in patients inadequately controlled on OADs prior to and following treatment intensification with various therapies, demonstrated that symptomatic hypoglycemic events were greater with the other treatments than with basal insulin.

### Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1141RuND]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — COVID-19 recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite anticoagulation — highlights an evidence gap and provides conditional management suggestions. The panel notes 'Our literature search did not identify any randomized trials assessing the efficacy and safety of different anticoagulation regimens for the management of recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19' and 'There are no randomized trials or prospective cohort studies that have evaluated management of patients with recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation'. It advises that 'Important factors to consider include compliance, adequate absorption of DOACs, and absence of potential drug-to-drug interactions', and that 'There are no studies assessing the treatment of recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation with DOACs'. Indirect data include 'recurrent VTE of 9% [95% CI, 2 to 25]' with therapeutic weight-adjusted low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after vitamin K antagonist failure, and dose escalation to '125% and 130%' with reported '8.6% (6 of 70; 95% CI, 4.0–17.5)' recurrent VTE and '4.3% (3 of 70; 95% CI, 1.5–11.9)' major bleeding when 'receiving increased dose (125% to 130%) of LMWH'. Based on these comparisons, the panel states 'we expect the net benefit of increasing the dose of LMWH by 25% to 30%… and switching to LMWH in patients failing oral anticoagulation with a DOAC or vitamin K antagonist', and issues recommendations: 'we suggest increasing the dose of LMWH by 25% to 30%' for recurrent VTE on therapeutic weight adjusted LMWH with documented compliance, and for VTE on apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or vitamin K antagonist in range, 'we suggest switching treatment to therapeutic weight-adjusted LMWH'.

### Use of insulin glargine 100 U / mL for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in east Asians: a review [^115wqvht]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Real-World Use of Insulin Glargine in East Asians

Two Japanese prospective 24-week postmarketing surveillance studies provided important evidence for real-world effectiveness and safety of IGlar in East Asian patients with T2DM. The ALOHA (Add-on Lantus to Oral Hypoglycemic Agents) study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 and involved 5223 subjects. Most were treated with a combination of IGlar + sulfonylurea, either alone or in combination with other OAMs including metformin, α-glucosidase inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones. The second study (ALOHA2) was conducted in 2012 and involved 2630 patients, of whom approximately 60% used DPP-4i, which has become a popular therapeutic option in Japan. Both studies showed that basal insulin therapy initiation is delayed in Japan. Mean HbA1c in insulin-naïve patients starting their insulin therapy and enrolled in the two studies was greater than 9% (75 mmol/mol) and approximately half of ALOHA subjects had microvascular complications of diabetes at baseline. Insulin therapy in combination with OAMs significantly improved glycemic control in study subjects, yet only 15.5% and 26.3% achieved HbA1c < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) in ALOHA and ALOHA2, respectively, a proportion much lower than typically reported in RCTs. This might be explained by insufficient insulin dosing and titration. Initial IGlar doses were lower in the ALOHA cohort than doses recommended and used in Europe and North America, while the study provided evidence that use of higher doses and titration aimed at the effective lowering of FPG to below 110 mg/dL is key for treatment success. Using FPG alone to guide titration of IGlar was shown to be the most successful way of BG monitoring among patients not only in terms of achievement of the HbA1c target of less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) but also reported hypoglycemia rate and highest compliance. Incidence and rates of hypoglycemia were low (incidence of 1% and 5.59%, incidence rate of 0.035 and 0.2332 episodes/patients-years in ALOHA and ALOHA2, respectively). While these studies have limitations and may not provide a comprehensive assessment of hypoglycemia risk, the low hypoglycemia rates reported do not explain suboptimal insulin dosage in patients not achieving optimal glycemic control. Similarly, increases in body weight which typically are associated with effective insulin treatment in T2DM were only moderate in the ALOHA (up to 1.2 kg) and ALOHA2 studies (0.5 kg) and do not explain conservative dosage and titration of insulin.

### Initiation of insulin glargine in suboptimally controlled patients with type 2 diabetes: sub-analysis of the AT.LANTUS trial comparing treatment outcomes in subjects from primary and secondary care in the UK [^112R6UFV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

The AT.LANTUS study compared insulin glargine initiation and titration using one of two algorithms in suboptimally controlled subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on a primary outcome of severe hypoglycaemia. Secondary outcomes included other categories of hypoglycaemia, glycaemic control, weight changes and insulin dose. Here, we report the results of a subanalysis of the trial, which investigated whether insulin glargine can be initiated and titrated as effectively in primary [general practitioner (GP)] as secondary (hospital) care in patients with T2DM in the UK.

Methods

The main study was a multicentre (n = 611), multinational (n = 59), open-label, 24-week randomized trial in 4,588 suboptimally controlled subjects with T2DM. Insulin glargine was titrated to target fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels of ≤ 5.5 mmol/l according to algorithm 1 (clinic-driven titration) or algorithm 2 (patient-managed titration). In this substudy, 819 subjects (GP, n = 215; hospital, n = 604) from 57 primary and 130 secondary care centres were included in the subanalysis; subjects were switched to once-daily insulin glargine from baseline treatments that consisted primarily of oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) (38%) only or premixed insulin ± OAD (23%).

Results

Both the GP and the hospital groups of subjects experienced a low incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (< 1%), with significant decreases in HbA1c levels (-0.51 and -0.95% respectively; p < 0.001), large reductions in FBG levels (-2.72 and 3.0 mmol/l respectively; p < 0.001) and modest weight gain of 1 and 1.2 kg respectively (p < 0.05). With the exception of absolute reductions in HbA1c and reductions in basal and prandial insulin made on switching to insulin glargine, there were few significant differences in subjects managed in primary compared with secondary care.

Conclusions

This study shows that despite differences in diabetes duration and baseline glycaemic control, an insulin glargine-based therapy can be safely and effectively initiated in a diverse range of suboptimally controlled subjects with T2DM in both primary and secondary care settings in the UK. Rates of hypoglycaemia were low and consistent with the results of the main study. Absolute reductions in HbA1c were greatest in the secondary care setting, but similar levels of glycaemic control were achieved in both groups due to differences in baseline HbA1c. In the patients managed in primary care, there was an overall reduction in prandial and basal insulin used when switching to a basal insulin regimen and a lack of titration of prandial insulin. Therefore, the role of prandial insulin, its initiation and titration, appears to be an area that requires more focus in primary care.

### Practical use of insulin degludec / insulin aspart in a multinational setting: beyond the guidelines [^113DbN9H]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is a fixed-ratio co-formulation of insulin degludec, which provides long-lasting basal insulin coverage, and insulin aspart, which targets postprandial glycaemia. This review provides expert opinion on the practical clinical use of IDegAsp, including: dose timings relative to meals, when and how to intensify treatment from once-daily (OD) to twice-daily (BID) dose adjustments, and use in special populations (including hospitalized patients). IDegAsp could be considered as one among the choices for initiating insulin treatment, preferential to starting on basal insulin alone, particularly for people with severe hyperglycaemia and/or when postprandial hyperglycaemia is a major concern. The recommended starting dose of IDegAsp is 10units with the most carbohydrate-rich meal(s), followed by individualized dose adjustments. Insulin doses should be titrated once weekly in two-unit steps, guided by individualized fasting plasma glucose targets and based on patient goals, preferences and hypoglycaemia risk. Options for intensification from IDegAsp OD are discussed, which should be guided by HbA1c, prandial glucose levels, meal patterns and patient preferences. Recommendations for switching to IDegAsp from basal insulin, premixed insulins OD/BID, and basal-plus/basal-bolus regimens are discussed. IDegAsp can be co-administered with other antihyperglycaemic drugs; however, sulphonylureas frequently need to be discontinued or the dose reduced, and the IDegAsp dose may need to be decreased when sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are added. Considerations around the initiation or continuation of IDegAsp in hospitalized individuals are discussed, as well as in those undergoing medical procedures.

### Injectable coformulations in diabetology [^1123gZwT]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Posology

As per the IDegAsp label, IDegAsp can be administered OD or BID with main meal(s). In patients with T2DM, IDegAsp can be administered either alone or with oral anti-diabetic medicinal products and in combination with bolus insulin. In patients with T1DM, IDegAsp is used in combination with short-/rapid-acting insulin with remaining meals. Dose adjustments are recommended to be primarily assessed based on fasting plasma glucose measurements. Flexibility in dosing time of IDegAsp allows for flexibility in the timing of insulin administration, as long as it is administered with main meal(s). If a dose of IDegAsp is missed, patients should not take an extra dose to make up for a missed dose, but can take the missed dose with the next main meal of that day and then resume the usual dosing schedule the following day.

The recommended total daily starting dose for patients with T2DM is 10 unit with the main meal(s), followed by individual dosage adjustments. The recommended starting dose of IDegAsp in patients with T1DM is 60–70% of the total daily insulin requirements with short-/rapid-acting insulin at the remaining meals, followed by individual dosage adjustments.

Patients with T2DM switching from once-daily basal or pre-mixed insulin therapy can be given unit-to-unit, once-daily IDegAsp at the same total insulin dose as the patient's previous total daily insulin dose. Patients switching from more than once-daily basal or pre-mixed insulin therapy can be converted to unit-to-unit, twice-daily IDegAsp at the same total insulin dose as the patient's previous total daily insulin dose. Patients switching from basal/bolus insulin therapy to IDegAsp will need to convert their dose based on individual needs. In general, patients are initiated on the same number of basal units.

Special Populations

IDegAsp can be used in elderly patients (aged > 65 years) and in renal and hepatic impaired patients with intensified glucose monitoring. The insulin dose should be adjusted on an individual basis. The safety and efficacy of IDegAsp in children and adolescents aged under 18 years have not been established, and so this coformulation is not currently approved for use in children.

### Real-world dose adjustments of biologic treatments in psoriasis and their economic impact: a Swedish national population study [^113rBwsM]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective, observational registry study in Sweden in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis revealed that for adalimumab, etanercept, secukinumab and ustekinumab in treatment groups with at least 50 patients each, the mean (weighted) doses were 3–23% higher than SmPC recommendations over the treatment period. As expected, the cumulative costs reflected the changes in dosing for each of the biologics. Longitudinal analyses showed that the pattern of dosing varied over time for individual biologics, with variability between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The observed increase in secukinumab dosing might be attributable to gradual loss of efficacy over time, as reported in previous studies. For many patients, physicians may have preferred to escalate secukinumab dosing rather than switch treatment.

The recommended ustekinumab dosage is four syringes per year, consequently, a change of ± 1 syringe is equivalent to a 25% change in dose, which contributed to the large variability around the median between patients. Unlike other biologics in this study, dosing of ustekinumab can be adjusted according to body weight; however, data on weight were not available in the national patient registries, therefore assessment of dose modifications based on patient weight could not be determined. The recommended ustekinumab dosing is 45 mg every 12 weeks in patients who weigh ≤ 100 kg, and 90 mg every 12 weeks in those who weigh > 100 kg. In our study, approximately 20% of patients initiated on 45 mg were escalated to the 90 mg dose, presumably because of perceived suboptimal efficacy.

### Practical use of insulin degludec / insulin aspart in a multinational setting: beyond the guidelines [^114Ypktu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The recommended starting total daily dose of IDegAsp is 10 units with meal(s), followed by individual dose adjustments. 10 In cases of severe hyperglycaemia (HbA1c > 10% [86 mmol/mol]), a higher initial dose of IDegAsp may be used, at the clinicianʼs discretion. Similarly, body weight should also be considered when initiating dosing of IDegAsp; 0.3 units/kg is recommended for premix insulin in the 2018 ADA/EASD guidelines, 34 although this information is omitted from the 2020 ADA guidelines. Titration of IDegAsp should be individualized based on patient preference and goals, and the risk of adverse events. 10, 34 To guide insulin dose titration, individualized FPG targets are used, and titration is typically carried out in two‐unit steps (Figure 2). Postprandial glucose levels are not usually considered when determining titration algorithms. Titrating once weekly is advisable in the majority of people because of the long half‐life of degludec; 4, 10 individuals should be advised that it can take up to 48–72 hours for degludec to reach steady state, 45 so dose changes should not be made before this.

### Insulin glargine (Toujeo) [^111fUKZ4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Study D, the average age was 58.2 years. The majority of patients were White (94%) and 46% were male; 33% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 34.8 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 12% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

In Study E, the average age was 58 years. The majority of patients were White (78%) and 58% were male; 29% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 33 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 15% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

Safety Outcomes Trial

No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of TOUJEO have been conducted. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORIGIN, has been conducted with LANTUS. It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to TOUJEO.

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN (Hazard Ratio [95% CI] for MACE; 1.02 [0.94, 1.11]).

In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.99 [0.88, 1.11]) or death from cancer (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.94 [0.77, 1.15]) was also similar between treatment groups.

### Improved glycemic control with insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) in patients with type 2 diabetes: real-world effectiveness in Switzerland [^114PfnbT]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300, Toujeo ®) is a long-acting, once-daily basal insulin with improved-more stable and smoother-pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles compared to insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100) and insulin degludec (IDeg). These properties have been shown to translate into an effective HbA1c reduction with the advantage of a lower risk of hypoglycemia in randomized controlled trials of Gla-300 versus Gla-100. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of Gla-300 under real-world conditions in Switzerland.

Methods

The prospective, observational, open-label, multicenter study TOP-2 explored the effectiveness of Gla-300 in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) uncontrolled (HbA1c 7.5–10%) on their previous basal insulin in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The primary endpoints were the percentages of patients achieving a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of ≤ 6.1 mmol/L after 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, and insulin dose as well as hypoglycemia incidence and safety. Here we report the results for the Swiss patient cohort after 12 months of treatment with insulin glargine 300 U/mL.

Results

The 62 patients (33 men) had a mean age of 65 years, a mean diabetes duration of 14 years, a mean body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m 2, and were mainly switched from Gla-100 (44%) to Gla-300. The most common concomitant oral anti-diabetes therapy was metformin (65%). The mean individual HbA1c target chosen by the investigators was 7.4%. After 12 months of therapy, Gla-300 significantly reduced mean HbA1c from 8.2% to 7.6% (p < 0.0001). Likewise, Gla-300 significantly reduced mean FPG from 9.1 mmol/L to 7.4 mmol/L (p < 0.0001). At study end, 32% of patients achieved FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, 55% achieved FPG ≤ 7.2 mmol/L, and 57% achieved their individual HbA1c target. Gla-300 was uptitrated to a mean dose of 40 units per day. Symptomatic hypoglycemia incidence after 12 months was low at 9.7% and a rate of 0.23 events per patient year. Body weight remained stable and was not significantly altered during the study.

Conclusion

Upon switching basaI insulin to Gla-300, overall glucose control significantly improved and glycemic targets were achieved with a low rate of hypoglycemia in T2D patients under real-world conditions in Switzerland.

### Transition of patients to and from insulin degludec: a clinical challenge [^113zRK5i]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

With appearance of new insulins on the market, new clinical challenges, much like unintended consequences, came into light in our daily practice. One of the most pressing issues has become an issue of switching patients to and from newer insulins in various clinical situations. A proper switch from 1 medication to another requires understanding of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of both drugs. Unfortunately, there is no research in this area and, as a result, there are no guidelines nor is there even a consensus. We present 5 clinical scenarios in which the patients were transitioned to or from insulin degludec. Because there are no data and no current consensus, we have polled 200 diabetes care providers soliciting their opinion as to how they would handle these clinical situations. Our poll of endocrinologists revealed multiple approaches as well as elements of confusion among providers. Even though all answers, summarized following each case, might be reasonable, and there might not be a single correct answer, we wish to express our opinion that is based on PK and PD of these insulins. Because there is more than 1 correct way of implementing these transitions, we urge our colleagues to institute a very close follow-up of these patients with frequent adjustments of insulin dose to avoid stacking with potential hypoglycemia.

### Extensive clinical experience: a simple guide to basal insulin adjustments for long-distance travel [^112KdxnD]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

By giving half the dose at 2 different times, the glargine dose is extended out to cover the longer day. Although the patient receives less than optimal insulin coverage at either end of the dosing schedule, the primary goal of preventing hypoglycemia is achieved while still giving insulin in a simple manner.

Patients may ask an important question, "How do I know what the destination time is to switch my watch to?" We recommend using a smartphone to do this by adding the destination city to the standard worldclock app. The handout also includes a space to write this out in advance for the patient. Alternately most flight attendants would be happy to assist, but we recommend the entire form be completed before the patient starts his travels. Use of a time zone map can help to determine how many time zones are traversed.

Scenario #2 – twice daily basal insulin adjustment

Patient B is traveling west from New York to Honolulu. Instead of once daily glargine, the patient takes detemir 10 units twice daily at 8 AM and 8 PM, and rapid acting insulin before meals as part of the basal-bolus regimen. Although the patient takes twice daily basal insulin, the same handout used in the previous example works well and can be used again. The same flight departs at 10 AM EST. Total travel time is 11 hours.

This scenario is very similar to the previous example as the patient takes the total dose of basal insulin the morning before departure. Because detemir does not last quite as long as glargine, a dose becomes due during the flight; half the total dose (5 units detemir) should be given at that time (8 PM EST). Upon arrival at Honolulu, the patient adjusts his watch to HST and the other half of the basal dose (5 units detemir) is given at 8 PM HST. The normal dosing regimen resumes starting at 8 AM again.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^114DHGDM]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Patient characteristics influencing treatment outcomes identified in this study were baseline duration of diabetes, HbA 1c, FPG, and age. Logistic regression analysis revealed that baseline duration of diabetes, HbA 1c, FPG, and age were negatively associated with achieving target HbA 1c levels of < 7.0%. This was reflected in patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% having a shorter mean duration of diabetes, lower HbA 1c and FPG, and younger age at baseline than patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0%. Additionally, a higher proportion of patients with mean duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years were found in the HbA 1c improvement group compared with the unchanged and deterioration groups. The mean age from the HbA 1c improvement to deterioration groups also increased numerically.

The above results suggest that switching treatment to insulin glargine plus OADs in patients earlier, while they are younger, with a shorter duration of diabetes and with lower levels of HbA 1c and FPG, can provide them with a better chance of achieving target glycemic control. Given that islet beta cell function has been shown to progressively deteriorate over time in patients with T2DM, an early transition in treatment for patients inadequately controlled on premixed insulin is more desirable. The above results have also been observed in two real-world Chinese studies which, similar to this study, have evaluated patient characteristics that aid in identifying patients who can benefit the most from a switch in treatment from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs. One of the studies by Zhang et al. demonstrated, through comparison of patient groups who did and did not reach HbA 1c targets (HbA 1c ≤ 6.5%, 6.5% < HbA 1c < 7.0%, or HbA 1c > 7.0%) by the study end, that duration of diabetes and baseline HbA 1c were two factors closely associated with the success of the treatment transition. The other study by Yang et al. also demonstrated, through logistic regression analysis, that the probability of achieving a HbA 1c target of < 7.0% is lower with increased disease duration (odds ratio [OR] = 0.785) and higher baseline HbA 1c (OR = 0.482). The study by Yang et al. also demonstrated that patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were younger than patients with HbA 1c ≥ 7.0% (54.67 ± 7.99 vs 57.42 ± 8.42 years; P = 0.0265). Studies have shown that there is impaired beta cell function and tissue sensitivity to insulin with aging, which may be why younger patients are able to better respond to the switch in treatment, and therefore reach glycemic targets or demonstrate an improvement in HbA 1c, in comparison to those who are older.

### Efficacy and safety of LY2963016 insulin glargine in Chinese patients with type 1 diabetes previously treated with insulin glargine (lantus): a post hoc analysis of a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial [^116k1Cqc]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design

This was a post hoc analysis of a randomized, open-label, 24-week, phase III trial conducted at 20 centers in China (NCT03338023), which has been reported in detail previously. The study was performed in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and applicable laws and regulations. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards at each site before study initiation (Table S2 in the electronic supplementary material). All patients provided written informed consent.

Eligible patients had T1DM of duration at least 1 year, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) less than 11%, and had been receiving basal-bolus insulins or premixed insulins for at least 90 days at screening. Patients were excluded if they had body mass index greater than 35 kg/m 2; exposure to an IGlar other than Lantus in the previous 30 days; severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or emergency room visits for uncontrolled diabetes leading to hospitalization in the previous 6 months; excessive insulin resistance (total daily insulin dose of 1.5 U/kg or higher); or twice-daily IGlar use in the previous 6 months.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either LY IGlar or IGlar delivered using a KwikPen ® injector, each given once-daily (QD), plus mealtime insulin lispro injections (bolus insulin). For patients receiving IGlar at screening, the daily starting dose of LY IGlar or IGlar was the same as the pre-study basal insulin dose. Mealtime bolus insulin was administered at the same dose as the pre-study mealtime insulin, based on unit-to-unit conversion. During the study, investigators guided the adjustment of insulin doses based on self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) data to achieve preprandial blood glucose targets of 79–126 mg/dL (4.4–7.0 mmol/L) while minimizing hypoglycemia.

### Understanding the clinical profile of insulin degludec, the latest basal insulin approved for use in Canada: a narrative review [^112s9Tsv]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

A more concentrated low-volume formulation of glargine has recently been released (glargine units/mL [glargine U300]), which not only permits smaller injection volumes, but modifies the PK/PD profile. Glargine U300 has a half-life of approximately 19 h and hence has a longer duration of action than glargine U100. A meta-analysis of the non-blinded EDITION studies showed glargine U300 to lower the rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia by 18% compared with glargine U100 in patients with T2D (p < 0.05). In patients with T1D, one randomized, controlled, multinational trial found that hypoglycaemia did not differ for glargine U100 and glargine U300, with the exception that during the first 8 weeks of the study there was a significant 31% reduced hypoglycaemia in the glargine U300 treatment arm. However, in a multicenter trial of Japanese T1D patients, the annualized rates of confirmed or severe hypoglycemia were 34% lower with glargine U300 at night and 20% lower overall (statistically significant for both). In a pilot study of 18 young T1D patients with poor glycemic control on morning glargine U100 (mean A1C 7.45% after optimizing prior therapy for 12 weeks) and having hypoglycemic episodes (mean of 0.28 nocturnal events during 12-week optimization period), a switch to glargine U300 resulted in improved A1C (6.90%) and reduced hypoglycemia risk 6 months after the switch. However, the unit-to-unit doses are not equivalent for glargine U100 and U300, and upward dose adjustments are generally required when patients are switched to glargine U300.

2.3	Initiation of Insulin Glargine Therapy

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Use short-acting, premeal insulin to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily.

2.4	Switching to Insulin Glargine from Other Insulin Therapies

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine from other insulin therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

When switching from:

Once-daily TOUJEO (insulin glargine 300 units/mL) to once-daily Insulin Glargine (100 units/mL), the recommended starting Insulin Glargine dosage is 80% of the TOUJEO dosage that is being discontinued.
Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued.
Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued.

### Rate of inpatient hypoglycemia following a 1: 1 dose interchange between concentrated insulin glargine to insulin detemir [^115yZpHU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Insulin remains a mainstay of treating hyperglycemia in an acute setting. Insulin glargine 300 units/mL (Toujeo, iGlar300) has a different pharmacokinetic profile than 100 units/mL basal insulins, such as insulin detemir (iDet100) and iGlar100. While conversion from iGlar300 to iGlar100 requires a 20% dose decrease, there is currently no recommended interchange from iGlar300 to iDet100.

Objective

Compare the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients who received a 1:1 unit interchange from home iGlar300 or iGlar100 to iDet100 while admitted.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate adults within a multi-site network admitted between May and December 2019. Patients were included if they received at least one dose of iDet100 following interchange from home iGlar300 or iGlar100. The primary endpoint was the incidence of hypoglycemic events following a 1:1 interchange of iGlar300 vs. iGlar100 to inpatient iDet100. Secondary outcomes include overall hypoglycemic events, time to hypoglycemia, and doses given before hypoglycemia.

Results

Of 615 patients, 394 received a 1:1 unit interchange to iDet100 (52 from iGlar300 and 342 from iGlar100). Incidence of hypoglycemic events was significantly higher in those with a 1:1 interchange from iGlar300 versus iGlar100 (36.5% vs. 18.7%, p = 0.007). Significant differences were observed in overall hypoglycemic events, time to hypoglycemia, and number of doses given before hypoglycemic event.

Conclusion and Relevance

A 1:1 unit interchange from iGlar300 to iDet100 led to a higher incidence of hypoglycemic events compared to those interchanged from iGlar100. Dose reduction should be considered when transitioning from home iGlar300 to iDet100 in the inpatient setting.

### Efficacy and safety of LY2963016 insulin glargine in Chinese patients with type 1 diabetes previously treated with insulin glargine (lantus): a post hoc analysis of a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial [^113aWPgx]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

A biosimilar is a version of an approved biologic medicine (i.e. the originator product) that must demonstrate highly similar physicochemical characteristics, biologic activity, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety compared with the originator to gain regulatory authorization. Recently, biosimilar versions of IGlar have been developed with the potential to reduce direct healthcare costs and improve access to this medication. LY2963016 insulin glargine (LY IGlar) is an IGlar biosimilar that has an identical primary amino acid sequence, pharmaceutical form, and strength compared with the originator product. It was the first approved insulin biosimilar in the European Union and has also been authorized as a follow-on insulin in the USA. The biosimilarity of LY IGlar vs. IGlar was established in a comprehensive clinical development program that included studies in both Chinese and international populations. LY IGlar and IGlar demonstrated comparable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics in healthy volunteers in separate phase I euglycemic clamp trials conducted in China, Singapore, and South Africa. In randomized phase III studies in patients with T1DM already receiving basal-bolus regimens, LY IGlar and IGlar showed similar efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in the ABES trial in Chinese patients, and in the global ELEMENT-1 trial in predominantly white patients. Randomized phase III studies have also established the biosimilarity of LY IGlar and IGlar in T2DM, including a trial in Chinese patients (ABET), an international trial in predominantly white patients (ELEMENT-2), and an international trial including a high proportion of Asian patients (ELEMENT-5).

With the availability of biosimilar insulin analogues, switching patients from the originator to a biosimilar product becomes a potential strategy to reduce the cost of diabetes treatment and improve medication access. The practice of switching may be supported by studies demonstrating that patients already receiving the originator product do not experience meaningful differences in efficacy, safety, or immunogenicity when transitioning to the same dose of a biosimilar product. To provide evidence relevant to switching patients to LY IGlar from IGlar in clinical practice, we conducted a post hoc analysis of data from Chinese patients included in the randomized phase III T1DM ABES trial who were receiving pre-study IGlar.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Participants

This was a 24 week, open‐label, parallel‐group, randomized, treat‐to‐target study (identifier: NCT02545842). The study design and methods have been reported previously. 7 Briefly, eligible patients were between 18 and 65 years of age, had a diagnosis of T2D, with HbA1c > 7% to ≤ 10.5% despite stable doses of one to three oral anti‐hyperglycaemic drugs (OADs) for at least 3 months, had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of > 7 mmol/L, had a body mass index of ≥ 20 to ≤ 40 kg/m 2, had a duration of diabetes of at least 1 year, and were willing to initiate treatment with basal insulin. Patients were randomly assigned (1:3:3) to one of three FBG target groups: 3.9 < FBG ≤ 5.6 mmol/L (Group 1), 3.9 < FBG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L (Group 2) or 3.9 < FBG ≤ 7.0 mmol/L (Group 3). Randomization was stratified by use of sulfonylurea.

The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and in line with the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for good clinical practice. An institutional review board at each site approved the study, and all participants gave written informed consent.

2.2 Procedures

At randomization, all study patients initiated subcutaneous once‐daily insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Lantus SoloSTAR, Sanofi‐Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) at a dose of 0.2 U/kg. During the study, patients measured FBG daily, using a blood glucose meter, and study physicians reviewed the self‐monitored FBG values and titrated the basal insulin dose at each study visit (Table S1). The lowest value of the last three consecutive self‐monitored FBG values was used for decisions concerning insulin titration at each visit.

Patients continued to receive baseline OADs for the duration of the study; these could be decreased or discontinued only at the investigators' discretion based on safety and in accordance with Chinese treatment guidelines and local label indications.

### Practical guidance on the use of premix insulin analogs in initiating, intensifying, or switching insulin regimens in type 2 diabetes [^1167V4Ym]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Premix insulin analogs are a well-established treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, there is a lack of simple, clear guidance on some aspects of their use. These include choosing a regimen for insulin initiation, recognizing when patients need intensification of therapy, and switching from basal-bolus to a premix insulin analog when appropriate.

Methods

An independent expert panel formulated recommendations on the use in T2D of the premix insulin analog formulations widely available in Australasia, based on the available evidence and their own experience.

Results

Results from trials in both initiation and intensification of insulin show that no single insulin or regimen is best on all endpoints, and that improved glycemic control can be expected regardless of which regimen is used. Thus, individual patient factors and preferences become more important. Guidance is presented to help the clinician choose between a premix insulin analog or basal analog for insulin initiation, and to intensify insulin therapy using premix insulin analogs. Recommendations are made on dosing, titration, the concomitant use of non-insulin glucose-lowering drugs, and other practical issues, and on the special case of switching from basal-bolus to premix insulin analog therapy.

Conclusion

This guidance is intended to help both general and specialist practitioners make informed choices and provide optimal care for patients with T2D. It emphasizes the importance of taking into account individual patient factors and preferences so that the choice of insulin regimen is individualized to the patient in the same way that glycemic targets are now individualized.

### Insulin glargine (Lantus) [^113LKkr9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), adult patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily LANTUS or twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the starting dosage of LANTUS or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started LANTUS at a dosage that was 80% of the total previous NPH insulin dosage. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data. Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the LANTUS and NPH insulin dosages to a target fasting plasma glucose ≤ 100 mg/dL. After the LANTUS or NPH insulin dosage was adjusted, other antidiabetic agents, including premeal insulin were to be adjusted or added. The average age was 55 years. The majority of patients were White (85%) and 54% were male. The mean BMI was approximately 34.3 kg/m2. The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. The LANTUS group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the LANTUS group (Table 11). The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Therapeutically interchangeable? A study of real-world outcomes associated with switching basal insulin analogues among US patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using electronic medical records data [^116nmNub]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease, meaning that most patients will require the introduction of insulin into their treatment regimen at some point during the continuum of care. To facilitate the transition to insulin, numerous clinical and real-world studies have investigated the efficacy and safety of initiating long-acting analogue insulins. In clinical studies, both insulin glargine (GLA; Lantus®, Sanofi US, Inc. Bridgewater, NJ, USA) and insulin detemir (DET; Levemir®, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) have been shown to result in equivalent improvements in glycaemic control with a low incidence of hypoglycaemia when used as part of a basal-bolus regimen–. Although glycaemic outcomes in such trials have been similar for these two basal analogue insulins, it has been noted that higher doses and twice-daily dosing are often required with DET compared with GLA. A recent trial has suggested that when both DET and GLA are used once daily as an adjunct to metformin, a greater proportion of patients treated with GLA reached glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels < 7.0% than did patients treated with DET.

Attempts to examine the relative advantages of these insulin analogues in a real-world setting have proved difficult to interpret. Some studies have reported enhanced glycaemic control with GLA compared with DET, along with improved adherence and persistence, with no difference with regard to hypoglycaemia, healthcare costs or weight gain–; however, other studies found no difference in glycaemic control between the two insulin types, with one suggesting that patients initiating DET were 30% less likely to gain 0.9 kg or more in body weight than GLA users. Studies investigating the efficacy and safety of switching from GLA to DET are similarly conflicting in their findings. Although once-daily dosing of GLA and DET has been shown to result in equivalent 24-h glycaemic control, switching from GLA to DET was associated with improved HbA1c levels and fewer hypoglycaemic events, compared with remaining on GLA in an observational study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM. A retrospective analysis, however, reported that switching from GLA to DET did not improve glycaemic control among a cohort of patients with T2DM.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^116rcVT4]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Data Collection

At baseline (week 1), patient demographic data were obtained together with the disease history and details of diabetes treatment prior to participation in the study. Visits subsequently took place at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 16. Physical examinations were carried out at all visits, and FPG, 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG), safety data, and details of current treatment were recorded. For 2-h PPG, at least the latest recording from the laboratory test or self-monitoring was collected at each visit. However, patients could provide further recordings to assist the treating physician's decision. HbA 1c measurements were collected at weeks 1 and 16. Hypoglycemic events were also recorded, and were defined as all events in which patients showed symptoms of hypoglycemia for which their symptoms could be relieved by ingestion of carbohydrates or their symptoms occurred when blood glucose was ≤ 3.9 mmol/L. The number of patients who had experienced at least one hypoglycemic event since their last visit was recorded from visit 2 (week 2) to visit 5 (week 16).

Data Assessment

The primary endpoint of the Lantus Registry Study was change in HbA 1c from baseline to week 16. Secondary endpoints included FPG, 2-h PPG, and body weight changes from baseline to week 16, as well as treatment satisfaction score changes from baseline to week 16 based on the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status version. The current subgroup analyses were performed to assess the characteristics of patients who successfully achieved or sustained HbA 1c < 7.0% (target HbA 1c). This was evaluated by comparing characteristics of patients who did and did not achieve HbA 1c < 7.0%, as well as by conducting logistic regression analysis. Characteristics of patients who showed improvement, deterioration, or no change in glycemic control following the transition from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus OADs were also assessed. Improvement of glycemic control was defined as a reduction in HbA 1c of ≥ 0.3%. Unchanged glycemic control was defined as a –0.3% to +0.3% change in HbA 1c, and deterioration of HbA 1c was defined as an increase in HbA 1c of ≥ 0.3%. Characteristics of patients who were unable to reach HbA 1c < 7.0% were further analyzed by stratifying these patients into subgroups based on their FPG at endpoint (> 6.1 or ≤ 6.1 mmol/L) and comparing these subgroups.

### Practical guidance on basal insulin initiation and titration in Asia: a Delphi-Based consensus [^112fEnBj]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommended Titration Methods

The dose of insulin should be increased or decreased by 2 U when the current FPG level is below or above the goals, respectively, and should remain unchanged if the target is achieved. Titration of both insulins should be customized on the basis of individualized patient requirements. Gla-300 has a proven efficacy and safety in simple two- to four-step algorithms. Similarly, IDeg, when titrated, either using a simple titration schedule (single pre-breakfast blood glucose reading) with 4 U dosage adjustments or an average of daily readings with 2 U dose adjustments (stepwise weekly titration schedules), has been proven to be effective and well tolerated. For Gla-300, a patient-driven titration algorithm of 1 U/day is reported to be effective. The BRIGHT (Efficacy and Safety of Toujeo® Versus Tresiba® in Insulin-Naive Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Inadequately Controlled With Oral Antihyperglycemic Drug(s) ± GLP-1 Receptor Agonist) study suggested a 12-week titration period for second-generation basal insulin analogues Gla-300 and IDeg, which should be initiated soon after insulin initiation.

However, insulin titration is a largely neglected therapeutic area in the management of T2DM. Thus, there is an unmet need for guideline recommendations on insulin titration, specifically for the Asian population. Therefore, the present consensus statements delineate expert recommendations on insulin titration in the Asian context. They suggested that, ideally, titration should be initiated at the time of insulin initiation, or within 2 weeks from initiation. Basal insulin should be titrated once or twice a week, and the active titration period should be within the first 12 weeks following insulin initiation. The panel recommendations on insulin titration are mentioned in Box 3.

Box 3: Consensus Statements on Insulin Titration

Titration should be ideally started at the same time or within 2 weeks of insulin initiation (the 2-week window is to assess patient comfort and allow familiarization with insulin initiation).
In primary care settings, titration should continue till FPG goals are met. The period of such active titration should ideally be 12 weeks and may go up to 16 weeks in the real-world setting.
Having a simple titration regimen will make it easier to follow and comply for both HCPs and patients.
In primary care physician's settings, basal insulin should be titrated once or twice a week (in conjunction with the SMBG readings).
A simple up–down titration algorithm should be recommended in primary care settings, with a dose escalation of 2–4 U/week.

Baseline Characteristics of the Patients Stratified by Endpoint HbA 1c

Patients were stratified according to an endpoint HbA 1c level of either < 7.0% or ≥ 7.0%. Among them, 1019 patients (55.2%) reached HbA 1c < 7.0% and 828 patients (44.8%) did not. Patient demographics and characteristics of the two groups at baseline are shown in Table 1. Patients with an endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were younger (55.10 ± 11.16 vs 57.90 ± 10.61 years; P < 0.001) and had lower baseline BMI (24.94 ± 2.94 vs 25.34 ± 3.58 kg/m 2; P < 0.05), shorter mean duration of diabetes (6.05 ± 5.60 vs 9.14 ± 6.49 years; P < 0.001), and lower baseline HbA 1c (7.34 ± 1.16% vs 8.28 ± 1.06%; P < 0.001) and FPG (7.60 ± 1.87 vs 8.70 ± 2.19 mmol/L; P < 0.001) than patients with an endpoint HbA 1c of ≥ 7.0%. The HbA 1c < 7.0% group also had a lower proportion of patients with diabetes complications (36.2% vs 45.4%; P < 0.001) and comorbidities (57.2% vs 63.6%; P < 0.01). A lower proportion of female patients achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% compared with those who achieved HbA 1c ≥ 7% (41.3% vs 47.7%; P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients with an endpoint HbA 1c of < 7.0% received a markedly lower dose of premixed insulin prior to treatment switch (0.41 ± 0.14 vs 0.46 ± 0.16 U/kg/day; P < 0.001). There was also a difference in the number OADs taken at baseline between patients who achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% and those who did not (P < 0.001); a higher proportion of patients who achieved HbA 1c < 7.0% took only one OAD at baseline (63.6% vs 49.3%).

### Take control: a randomized trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of self-versus physician-managed titration of insulin glargine 300 U / mL in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes [^1155bSDF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

At week 24, Gla‐300 doses were numerically higher with self‐ versus physician‐managed titration, consistent with the results with Gla‐100 in ATLAS and AT.LANTUS. 17, 18 These higher doses may reflect the more frequent titration that is possible in the self‐managed algorithm. In Take Control, 1.8 times more dose adjustments were made in the self‐ versus physician‐managed group, which may explain the better glycaemic results, although the time taken to reach fasting SMPG target was similar in both groups. Nevertheless, as described above, the proportion of participants achieving HbA1c target was less than one‐third in both groups. While slightly higher proportions of participants achieve HbA1c targets in treat‐to‐target studies such as the EDITION programme, 22 it appears that treatment intensification may be required in many patients. Given that > 60% of participants achieved fasting SMPG targets but only 20% to 30% achieved HbA1c targets, additional treatment intensification with bolus insulin, addition of GLP‐1RA therapy, or other drugs that reduce postprandial glucose peaks may be beneficial in this population with relatively advanced T2DM (mean duration of diabetes of 13 years); however, the suboptimal HbA1c target achievement in Take Control may be related to the higher fasting SMPG target (4.4‐7.2 mmol/L) compared with the EDITION programme (4.4‐5.6 mmol/L). 22

The PRO scores for both titration groups at baseline indicated moderate distress and reasonable confidence in self‐management. Total DDS and DES results improved similarly in both groups, while more individuals in the self‐managed group achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in the DDS emotional burden subscale score, and fewer individuals reported a high emotional burden compared to the physician‐managed group. These results indicate that, by taking responsibility for titrating insulin, patients did not experience more distress related to diabetes, had a tendency towards less emotional burden, and had similar confidence in self‐management of their diabetes versus physician management. In the ATLAS study, there was no difference in the treatment satisfaction or quality‐of‐life outcomes between self‐ or physician‐managed titration of Gla‐100. It remains to be evaluated whether the PRO improvements observed with Gla‐300 in the present study translate to benefits in treatment satisfaction, overall quality of life, and treatment adherence and persistence in real‐life settings.

Allergen immunotherapy — changes in extract and dose adjustment: "An allergen immunotherapy extract must be considered different if there is any change". There is "potentially an increased risk of a systemic reaction" when changed because of variability in composition and potency; if changed, the patient "might need to be retested for specific IgE sensitivity and started on an immunotherapy formulation and schedule that is based on this re-evaluation" (D). The risk of systemic reactions "might be greater with nonstandardized extracts". When changing extracts, the "starting dose should be comparable with the initial dose" as if naïve to immunotherapy, and "a decrease in the dose from the patient's previous injection" might be required depending on the interval since last injection. "For lot changes from the same manufacturer, the physician can consider decreasing the dose by 50% to 90% of the previous dose", whereas "for changes in manufacturer and nonstandardized extracts, a greater decrease in dose might be necessary".

2.3 Treatment and procedures

All patients who met the eligibility criteria at the end of the run‐in period were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice and web‐response system to receive once‐daily subcutaneous injection of Gla‐100 (Lantus SoloSTAR®, Sanofi‐Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) at a standard starting dose (0.2 U/kg) or a higher starting dose (0.3 U/kg). Randomization was stratified by baseline sulphonylurea or glinide use to minimize bias due to a possibly short washout period duration (the 3‐day run‐in period). Patients were advised to administer the insulin dose at the same time each day, preferably at dinner time. While patients, investigators and site staff remained unmasked to treatment, the statistician and sponsor remained masked until after database lock and completion of analyses.

All patients were required to measure and record the values of their four‐point self‐monitoring of blood glucose (before breakfast and 2 hours after breakfast, lunch, and dinner) on the last day of the run‐in period and ≥ 3 consecutive days within the week prior to each visit during the treatment period. Patients were instructed to adjust the insulin doses at each visit based on their median self‐monitored fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels prior to the visit, to achieve a self‐monitored FBG target of 4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L (80–100 mg/dL) using the same titration algorithm (Table S1).

Patients attended their scheduled clinic visits during the screening, run‐in and randomization periods, then at weeks 2, 6, 12 and 16 during the treatment period. In addition, telephone follow‐ups were conducted at 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10 weeks after randomization, and 1 week after the end of treatment. The self‐monitoring of blood glucose values and daily insulin dose were also recorded at each study visit, and additional assessments (HbA1c, body weight) were conducted at week 16. Adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycaemia events were recorded throughout the study, and were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 20.1.

### Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among individuals on basal insulin requiring treatment intensification [^111kjHQC]. Diabetic Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Once‐daily, long‐acting basal insulin improves blood glucose levels through suppression of hepatic glucose production and control of fasting glucose; however, it does not accurately mimic normal diurnal endogenous insulin secretion patterns, which separate basal and prandial insulin requirements 8. Rapid‐acting insulin analogues (e.g. insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine) or premixed insulin (e.g. 70/30 aspart mix, 75/25 or 50/50 lispro mix) 1 may be used for treatment intensification for those unable to achieve appropriate postprandial glycaemic control with basal insulin 8. In a study of participants who did not achieve glycaemic control (HbA 1c ≤ 53 mmol/mol [≤ 7.0%]) after 14 weeks with basal insulin glargine, prandial insulin glulisine was added once, twice or three times daily 10. After 24 weeks, HbA 1c decreased similarly across groups (Table 1), but more participants achieved a target HbA 1c of ≤ 53 mmol/mol (≤ 7.0%) with insulin glulisine injections three times daily. In a prospective, observational study of treatment intensification in individuals with Type 2 diabetes uncontrolled on basal insulin and oral glucose‐lowering therapy, participants received either basal insulin titration to target with optional addition of a rapid‐acting insulin analogue at 12 or 24 weeks or addition of a rapid‐acting insulin analogue at baseline 11. After 24 weeks, HbA 1c reductions were similar in the two groups (P < 0.001 vs baseline), and similar proportions of individuals achieved an HbA 1c concentration of ≤ 53 mmol/mol (≤ 7.0%). The low rate of hypoglycaemic events was similar in the two groups 11. Additional studies of insulin intensification, including AT.LANTUS, are reviewed in Abrahamson and Peters 8 and support the efficacy of this basal‐bolus method; however, as with any insulin treatment, risks of weight gain, hypoglycaemia and the burden of mealtime injections, adjustments for meals, and counting carbohydrates must be considered when determining the appropriate treatment strategy.

5.2	Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen

Changes in Insulin Regimen Including Changes to Administration Site

Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site, or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia, and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral antidiabetic products may be needed.

Changing to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other Insulin Therapies

On a unit-to-unit basis, Insulin Glargine, U-300 has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials, patients who changed to Insulin Glargine, U-300 from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. Higher doses of Insulin Glargine, U-300 were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The onset of action of Insulin Glargine, U-300 develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of Insulin Glargine, U-300 before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating Insulin Glargine, U-300 monitor glucose daily, titrate Insulin Glargine, U-300 as described in this prescribing information, and adjust coadministered glucose-lowering therapies per standard of care [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

### Low-volume insulin degludec 200 units / mL once daily improves glycemic control similarly to insulin glargine with a low risk of hypoglycemia in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes: a 26-week, randomized, controlled, multinational, Treat-to-target trial: the BEGIN LOW VOLUME trial [^113Kw67y]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Treatments

By means of an interactive voice/web response system, eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to either once-daily IDeg 200 units/mL (3-mL FlexTouch; Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) or once-daily IGlar (Lantus 100 units/mL, 3-mL SoloStar; Sanofi U.S. LLC, St. Louis, MO) and continued metformin with or without DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. Trial participants were instructed to continue the same total daily dose of metformin and DPP-4 inhibitor treatment as before the start of the trial. In countries where DPP-4 inhibitor treatment did not have the indication of combination with insulin treatment, participants discontinued DPP-4 inhibitor treatment at randomization.

IDeg 200 units/mL was administered once-daily with the main evening meal and, consistent with its product labeling, IGlar was administered once daily at the same time each day. Insulin treatments were injected subcutaneously in the thigh, upper arm, or abdomen. The starting dose for each insulin was 10 units and, during the treatment period, the dose was systematically titrated using a treat-to-target approach striving for a prebreakfast self-measured blood glucose (SMBG) level of < 5 mmol/L (< 90 mg/dL). Both IDeg 200 units/mL and IGlar were titrated once weekly according to the average of three preceding prebreakfast SMBG levels and other available data (e.g. symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, previous responses to dose adjustments, and any additional nonmandatory blood glucose measurements). The treatment period was 26 weeks, and doses were individually titrated in an effort to achieve a specific target of < 5 mmol/L (< 90 mg/dL) with both treatments. After the 26-week treatment period, participants switched their basal insulin treatment to the intermediate-acting NPH insulin for 1 week to wash out the investigational exogenous insulins and minimize interference with insulin antibody measurements.

The safety committee from the sponsor performed ongoing blinded safety surveillance. Titration of insulin doses was monitored by the outside company Quintiles (Singapore, U.S. and Switzerland) and reviewed by the sponsor's titration committee. Cardiovascular events were adjudicated and assessed by an independent external event adjudication committee.

5.2	Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen

Changes in Insulin Regimen Including Changes to Administration Site

Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site, or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia, and a sudden change in the injection site (to unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Make any changes to a patient's insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant oral antidiabetic products may be needed.

Changing to TOUJEO from other Insulin Therapies

On a unit-to-unit basis, TOUJEO has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In clinical trials, patients who changed to TOUJEO from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS. Higher doses of TOUJEO were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

The onset of action of TOUJEO develops over 6 hours following an injection. In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin, consider the longer onset of action of TOUJEO before stopping IV insulin. The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating TOUJEO monitor glucose daily, titrate TOUJEO as described in this prescribing information, and adjust coadministered glucose-lowering therapies per standard of care [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

2.3	Initiation of Insulin Glargine-yfgn Therapy

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Use short-acting, premeal insulin to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes The recommended starting dosage of Insulin Glargine-yfgn in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily.

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to Insulin Glargine-yfgn from other insulin therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

When switching from:

Once-daily insulin glargine 300 units/mL to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn (100 units/mL), the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is 80% of the insulin glargine, 300 units/mL dosage that is being discontinued.
Once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is the same as the dosage of NPH that is being discontinued.
Twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin Glargine-yfgn, the recommended starting Insulin Glargine-yfgn dosage is 80% of the total NPH dosage that is being discontinued.

### Comparative clinical efficacy and safety of insulin glargine 300 U / mL (toujeo) versus insulin glargine 100 U / mL in type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^112JWJi7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of glargine-U100 (Lantus/Gla-100) with glargine-U300 (Toujeo/Gla-300) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Materials and Methods

A literature search on Gla-300/Gla-100 in diabetes management was conducted using the MEDLINE/Embase/Cochrane databases from inception to 10 January 2021. Eligible studies considered for inclusion were parallel-design, randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The random-effects model was applied for interpretation of the results.

Results

Of 5348 records screened, 592 were assessed for eligibility and 15 RCTs were considered for data extraction and meta-analysis (T2D [N = 10; n = 7082]; T1D [N = 5; n = 2222]). In patients with T1D, all safety parameters were comparable between Gla-100 and Gla-300. In T2D, statistically significant differences were observed in favour of Gla-300 over Gla-100 for nocturnal and total hypoglycaemia. For efficacy parameters, a statistically and clinically significant difference favouring Gla-100 in basal insulin dose requirement was observed for both T2D and T1D. Change in HbA1c showed a statistically but not clinically significant reduction with Gla-100 compared with Gla-300 in T1D. Statistically significant but clinically less relevant differences favoured Gla-300 for control of body weight in T1D and T2D and Gla-100 for fasting blood glucose in T2D.

Conclusions

Gla-100 and Gla-300 had comparable efficacy and safety profiles in both T1D and T2D populations. Gla-300 showed a lower risk of nocturnal and total hypoglycaemia, significant in insulin-experienced/exposed patients with T2D. Patients on Gla-300 required significantly more units of insulin daily than the Gla-100 group to achieve equivalent efficacy.

### Insulin degludec aspart: the first Co-formulation of insulin analogues [^1139mSGD]. Diabetes Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

The use of IDegAsp as an initiation therapy can be in once daily or twice daily doses based upon the clinical situation. It can be prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with metformin. T2DM patients switching from once-daily basal or premix insulin therapy can be converted unit-to-unit to once-daily IDegAsp at the same total insulin dose as the patient's previous total daily insulin dose. Patients switching from more than once-daily basal or premix insulin therapy can be converted unit-to-unit to twice-daily IDegAsp at the same total insulin dose as the patient's previous total daily insulin dose. Patients switching from basal-bolus insulin therapy to IDegAsp will need to convert their dose based on individual needs. In general, patients are initiated on the same number of basal units. In patients with T1DM, the recommended starting dose of IDegAsp is 60–70% of the total daily insulin requirements in combination with short-/rapid-acting insulin at the remaining meals followed by individual dosage adjustments. It is recommended that titration should be based upon monitoring of plasma glucose: the morning dose requirement of IDegAsp may be lower than the dinner dose. Switching from twice daily premixed insulin to two doses of IDegAsp should prompt a 10–20% reduction in initial dose (Table 1). A patient centric approach should be followed while choosing initial doses and up-titrating them.

2.3.2 Bolus dose titration and randomization

Patients were switched from their pre‐study prandial insulin to lispro (unit for unit) at the start of lead‐in. Prandial insulin doses were not changed during lead‐in unless adjustments were necessary for safety reasons or to facilitate basal insulin optimization. After lead‐in, patients were randomized in a 4:4:3 ratio to one of the following:
52 weeks of double‐blind URLi U100 administered 0 to 2 minutes prior to the start of a meal (mealtime)
52 weeks of double‐blind lispro U100 at mealtime
26 weeks of open‐label URLi U100 administered 20 minutes after the start of a meal (post‐meal URLi).

Randomization was determined by a computer‐generated random sequence using an interactive web‐response system, and stratified by country, baseline HbA1c [≤ 58.5 mmol/mol (7.5%), > 58.5 mmol/mol], basal insulin type (glargine, degludec), and method of prandial insulin adjustment (carbohydrate counting or pattern adjustment).

During the initial 12 weeks of treatment, prandial insulin was adjusted as necessary to meet target self‐monitored blood glucose (SMBG) levels in line with recommendations by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists 19 (Tables S3 and S4). During the maintenance period (weeks 12–26), prandial and basal insulin doses were only adjusted if necessary, to maintain glycaemic control or for safety reasons. Recommended insulin titration algorithms were provided in the protocol and the decisions to adjust insulin dose for each patient were the investigator's responsibility.

2.3 Procedures

All participants in both groups made a total of 3 visits over a 16‐week period. The 2nd visit was at week 4 and 3rd visit at week 16 after initial visit. At each visit, all patients had blood test for A1c, CMP, CBC, fasting lipid and measurements of body weight, height, blood pressure and heart rate, answered adverse reaction questions and completed the Diabetes Medications Satisfaction (DM‐SAT) Questionnaire form.

At first visit, the following changes were made in intervention group:

All prandial insulin injections (Humalog, Novolog, Apidra, Novolin R or Humulin R) were discontinued.
Basal insulin (NPH, Lantus, Levemir, Toujeo or Tresiba) were continued at 80% of the home dose. The dose was gradually increased until the patient is back on the home dose (the dose that the patient has been taking at home prior to the enrolment) or fasting BG of 80–130 mg/dl was achieved by using the self‐titration regimen (Appendix 1).
If the patient was on premixed insulin 2–3 times daily, it was switched to a basal insulin alone and Glargine was given at 40% of total daily dose of premixed insulin. The dose was gradually increased until fasting BG of 80–130 mg/dl is achieved by using the self‐titration regimen (Appendix 1).
Metformin at home dose was continued, but other noninsulin diabetes medications were discontinued. If the patient was not on metformin, then metformin ER was started at 500 mg daily with a meal for 2 weeks and then 1000 mg daily as a maintenance dose if tolerated.
Both SGLT2i, empagliflozin 10 mg or 12.5 mg once daily, and GLP1 RA, dulaglutide 0.75 mg subcutaneously once weekly, were added to metformin and a basal insulin.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^114o4hxK]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

This subgroup analysis of data from the 16-week Lantus Registry Study in China investigated the characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) associated with clinical benefits of transitioning therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine (100 U/ml) plus oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).

Methods

The modified intention-to-treat population of the Lantus Registry Study, comprising 1847 patients with T2DM, were included in the current subgroup analyses. Enrolled patients were divided into subgroups based on efficacy variables of endpoint glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), endpoint fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and change in HbA 1c from baseline. The baseline characteristics of those who did and did not achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% were compared, as were those with improvement, no change, or deterioration in HbA 1c. Characteristics of patients who were unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0%, further grouped according to whether or not they achieved FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, were also compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%.

Results

Comparison between subgroups demonstrated that patients with endpoint HbA 1c < 7.0% were significantly younger, with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower baseline FPG, HbA 1c, body mass index, and dose of premixed insulin than patients with endpoint HbA 1c ≥ 7.0%. Logistic regression analysis revealed a negative correlation between baseline age, HbA 1c, FPG, and duration of diabetes with achieving HbA 1c < 7.0%. When stratified according to change in HbA 1c, the improvement group was younger, with higher baseline HbA 1c and a greater number of patients with duration of diabetes ≤ 5 years. Three-quarters of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% also failed to reach FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L.

Conclusion

Younger patients with a shorter duration of diabetes and lower HbA 1c, FPG, and premixed insulin dose following a switch in treatment to insulin glargine (100 U/ml) plus OADs from premixed insulin have greater potential to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0%. Poorly controlled patients with higher baseline HbA 1c are most likely to experience an improvement in HbA 1c following the switch in therapy. The majority of patients unable to achieve HbA 1c < 7.0% also failed to reach FPG ≤ 6.1 mmol/L, highlighting the importance of adequate titration of insulin glargine to achieve adequate FPG control, which can enable achievement of target HbA 1c.

In Study D, the average age was 58.2 years. The majority of patients were White (94%) and 46% were male; 33% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 34.8 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 12% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

In Study E, the average age was 58 years. The majority of patients were White (78%) and 58% were male; 29% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 33 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin compared to LANTUS (Table 6). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 15% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

Cardiovascular Safety

No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of TOUJEO have been conducted. A cardiovascular outcomes trial, ORIGIN, has been conducted with LANTUS. It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to TOUJEO.

The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial (i.e. ORIGIN) was an open-label, randomized, 12,537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). MACE was defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN (Hazard Ratio [95% CI] for MACE; 1.02 [0.94, 1.11]).

In the ORIGIN trial, the overall incidence of cancer (all types combined) (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.99 [0.88, 1.11]) or death from cancer (Hazard Ratio [95% CI]; 0.94 [0.77, 1.15]) was also similar between treatment groups.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The safety and effectiveness of TOUJEO given once daily was compared to that of once-daily LANTUS in 26-week, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2,474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tables 4 and 5). At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with TOUJEO titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of TOUJEO than LANTUS.

Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were Caucasian, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic; 32% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when TOUJEO was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

### Current treatment guidelines and glycated haemoglobin goals for type 2 diabetes: which patients are most likely to benefit from fixed-ratio basal insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist combinations? [^112XFKci]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

When transitioning to iGlarLixi from basal insulin, the starting dose depends on the patient's current basal insulin regimen. It is recommended to start at 30 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on 30 units of basal insulin daily or more, and 15 units of iGlarLixi once daily for those on < 30 units of basal insulin daily, with titration directed by FPG targets. In those transitioning to iDegLira from basal insulin, the starting dose is 16 units once daily, with titration based on FPG, up to a maximum daily dose of 50 units once daily. Short‐acting insulin should generally be discontinued once an FRC is initiated, unless continued for specific prandial needs that are not expected to be covered by the GLP‐1 RA component. The rationale for discontinuing short‐acting insulin once initiating an FRC is that the GLP‐1 RA is expected to provide sufficient prandial glucose control. In most patients, this is sufficient to address post‐prandial glycemic excursions without the need for additional insulin. However, for those with high carbohydrate intake, continued post‐prandial excursions or long‐standing diabetes with impaired beta‐cell function, prandial insulin may be warranted to achieve glycemic targets.

6.3 Changing from a‐1 receptor agonist to an

Switching from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC such as iGlarLixi or iDegLira is a strategy to consider when glycemic control is inadequate, particularly secondary to rising FPG levels not being adequately addressed by the GLP‐1 RA alone. Patient selection should take into account the degree to which HbA1c exceeds the target. Overall, intensifying therapy from a GLP‐1 RA to an FRC provides an improvement in HbA1c of ~1%. In those on a GLP‐1 RA with more marked HbA1c elevations (i.e. HbA1c more than 2% above goal or more than 10%), FRC therapy may not be expected to achieve glycemic targets, necessitating the initiation of a separate basal insulin. Rates of hypoglycaemia are expected to increase with FRC use due to the inclusion of basal insulin, though the hypoglycaemia risk remains low overall. Weight gain should be expected when initiating an FRC compared to GLP‐1 RA monotherapy due to the insulin component, though it is usually modest and offset by the improvement in glycemic control.

2.2	General Dosing Instructions

TOUJEO is available in 2 single-patient-use prefilled pens:
TOUJEO SoloStar contains 450 units of TOUJEO U-300. It delivers doses in 1-unit increments and can deliver up to 80 units in a single injection.
TOUJEO Max SoloStar contains 900 units of TOUJEO U-300. It delivers doses in 2-unit increments and can deliver up to 160 units in a single injection. It is recommended for patients requiring at least 20 units per day.
When changing between TOUJEO SoloStar and TOUJEO Max SoloStar, if the patient's previous dose was an odd number, the dose should be increased or decreased by 1 unit to match the dose increments dialable on each prefilled pen.
The dose counter of the TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar prefilled pen shows the number of units of TOUJEO to be injected and no conversion is required.
Inject TOUJEO subcutaneously once a day at the same time of day.
During changes to a patient's insulin regimen, increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Individualize and titrate the dosage of TOUJEO based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal.
Titrate the dose of TOUJEO no more frequently than every 3 to 4 days.
Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

### Impact of the mode of protraction of basal insulin therapies on their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and resulting clinical outcomes [^111DVgnS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

6.1 Insulin glargine

When concentrating IGlar U100 to 300 U/mL (IGlar U300) for the purpose of being able to administer higher insulin doses in smaller volumes, the expected protraction in action profile was observed. After 1 week at steady state (0.4 units/kg/day), the half‐life was 19.0 hours for IGlar U300 versus 13.5 hours for IGlar U100. 70 Importantly, the PK/PD profile was flatter than that of IGlar U100 and the duration of action extended upwards to 32 hours in patients with type 1 diabetes. 70 A duration of action that extends beyond 24 hours is advantageous as it means that with once‐daily dosing, circulating insulin concentrations will rise over a few days until a steady‐state profile with a low peak:trough ratio is reached. This reduces waxing and waning of effect, thereby reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia. 58 It is also important to note, however, that a significant 27% relative reduction in the biopotency of IGlar U300 at steady state was observed in this study versus IGar U100. 70 IGlar U100 and U300 are therefore neither bioequivalent nor directly interchangeable, and a patient switching to the up‐concentrated formulation will need to adjust dose accordingly. 71 The definition of a unit of IGlar U300 does not take the lower biopotency of IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100 into account, and therefore higher doses of IGlar U300 versus IGlar U100 would be expected. This was found to be the case in clinical trials, with a 12% higher dose of IGlar U300 required after 6 months, 72 and a 44% higher dose increase than with IGlar U300 over 1 year. 73

### Insulin glargin (Lantus) [^112xKd6h]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study F), in patients with type 2
diabetes not using oral anti-diabetic medications (n = 518), a basal-bolus regimen
of LANTUS once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily
was evaluated for 28 weeks. Regular human insulin was used before meals, as
needed. LANTUS had similar effectiveness as either once- or twice-daily NPH
insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose (Table 10) with a similar
incidence of hypoglycemia [See Adverse
Reactions (6.1)].

In a randomized, controlled clinical study (Study G), patients with type 2
diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once-daily LANTUS or
twice-daily NPH insulin. For patients not previously treated with insulin, the
starting dose of LANTUS or NPH insulin was 10 units daily. Patients who were
already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH
insulin dose or started LANTUS at a dose that was 80% of the total previous NPH
insulin dose. The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the
progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale. HbA1c change from baseline was a
secondary endpoint. Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was
desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data.
Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the LANTUS and NPH
insulin doses to a target fasting plasma glucose ≤ 100 mg/dL. After the LANTUS or
NPH insulin dose was adjusted, other anti-diabetic agents, including pre-meal
insulin were to be adjusted or added. The LANTUS group had a smaller mean
reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group, which may be
explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the LANTUS group (Table 10).
Both treatment groups had a similar incidence of reported symptomatic
hypoglycemia. The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia are given in
Table 6 [See Adverse Reactions
(6.1)].

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The efficacy of TOUJEO given once daily was compared to that of once-daily LANTUS in 26-week, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2,474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (Tables 4 and 5). At trial end, the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose with TOUJEO titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal. At the end of the trial, depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy, patients were receiving a higher dose of TOUJEO than LANTUS.

Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

In an open-label, controlled study (Study A), patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 546), were randomized to basal-bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks. TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning (time period covering from pre-breakfast until pre-lunch) or in the evening (time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime). A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal. Mean age was 47 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. Fifty-seven percent were male, 85% were White, 5% Black or African American, and 5% were Hispanic or Latino; 32% of patients had GFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean BMI was approximately 27.6 kg/m2. At week 26, treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.4% (Table 4). Patients treated with TOUJEO used 18% more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS. There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when TOUJEO was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening. There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups.

2.3	Initiation of Insulin Glargine Therapy

Type 1 Diabetes

In patients with type 1 diabetes, Insulin glargine must be used concomitantly with short-acting insulin. The recommended starting dose of Insulin glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes should be approximately one-third of the total daily insulin requirements. Short-acting, premeal insulin should be used to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements.

Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of Insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0.2 units/kg or up to 10 units once daily. One may need to adjust the amount and timing of short- or rapid-acting insulins and dosages of any oral antidiabetic drugs.

2.4	Changing to Insulin Glargine from Other Insulin Therapies

If changing patients from once-daily TOUJEO (insulin glargine) 300 units/mL to once-daily Insulin glargine, the recommended initial Insulin glargine dose is 80% of the TOUJEO dose that is being discontinued. This dose reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin to a regimen with Insulin glargine, a change in the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the amount and timing of the shorter-acting insulins and doses of any oral antidiabetic drugs may need to be adjusted.
If changing patients from once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin glargine, the recommended initial Insulin glargine dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being discontinued.
If changing patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily Insulin glargine, the recommended initial Insulin glargine dosage is 80% of the total NPH dose that is being discontinued. This dosage reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Dosing of insulin glargine in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^115cobjQ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease characterized by insulin resistance and declining beta-cell function, often leading to a requirement for insulin therapy to maintain good glycemic control and prevent diabetes-associated complications. Adequate insulin dosing is crucial to the achievement of good glycemic control with minimal hypoglycemia, and dose titration immediately following insulin initiation is needed to ensure its success. Insulin may be initiated as an add-on therapy to oral treatment using a single evening basal insulin dose and titrating according to fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels (with an ideal target of < 5.5 mmol/L [< 100 mg/dL] to achieve glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] < 7%).

Objective

This review investigated options for, and clinical efficacy of, titration algorithms of insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Articles from peer-reviewed journals were identified through searches of MEDLINE (years: 2000–2006). Search terms included insulin glargine, titration, algorithm, and type 2 diabetes. Studies were assessed and included in this review if they provided information regarding the method of dose titration of insulin glargine used.

Results

A total of 12 studies were identified and included in this review. In the 24-week Treat-to-Target study, in which 756 patients were randomized to receive either insulin glargine or neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, once-daily using a simple titration regimen (titration of daily insulin dose by 0–2, 2, 4, or 6–8 IU if mean fasting plasma glucose over the 3 previous days was ≥ 5.6- < 6.7, ≥ 6.7- < 7.8, ≥ 7.8- < 10.0 or ≥ 10 mmol/L [≥ 100- < 120, ≥ 120- < 140, ≥ 140- < 180, or ≥ 180 mg/dL], respectively, in the absence of plasma glucose < 4.0 mmol/L [< 72 mg/dL]) more patients reached HbA1c ≤ 7% without nocturnal hypoglycemia with insulin glargine versus NPH insulin (33.2% vs 26.7%; P < 0.05). In the 24-week AT.LANTUS (A Trial comparing LANTUS Algorithms to achieve Normal blood glucose Targets in subjects with Uncontrolled blood Sugar) study, 4961 patients were randomized to receive insulin glargine with either clinic-managed (as in the Treat-to-Target study) or patient-managed dose titration (increase insulin dose by 2 IU every 3 days in the absence of blood glucose < 4.0 mmol/L [< 72 mg/dL]). Greater reductions in HbA(1c) were found with patient- versus clinic-managed titration (-1.22% vs -1.08%; P < 0.001), and fewer patients experienced hypoglycemia with clinic-managed titration (29.8% vs 33.3%; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The results from the studies discussed in this review suggest that adequate titration of the insulin dose, either by physicians or by patients, can help patients reach treatment goals, including HbA(1c) < 7% and FBG < 5.5 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL). The choice between algorithms may depend on clinical circumstance and a patient's willingness and ability to become more involved in management of therapy.

### The evolution of insulin and how it informs therapy and treatment choices [^115AMNWM]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

A 3-fold concentrated version of insulin glargine was developed to prolong the duration of action when the results of 2 preliminary studies showed less diurnal variation in glucose-lowering activity with U-300 compared to the same dose of U-100 glargine. Insulin glargine U-300 (300 U/mL) was approved by the FDA in 2015 and marketed as Toujeo ® (Sanofi S/A). The higher concentration of glargine delivered in the same volume further slows the dissolution of the glargine precipitate in the SC space, leading to a better basal insulin. The PK and PD profiles of the U-100 and U-300 formulations of insulin glargine are shown in Fig. 10A. The concentrated U-300 insulin glargine profile has a lower peak and a longer duration of action compared to U-100 insulin glargine at the same U/kg dose. The glucose-lowering effects of U-300 insulin glargine at steady state appear to be lower than U-100 insulin glargine at the same dose level (Fig. 10A). In a study in type 1 diabetes, subjects needed 17.5% more U-300 than U-100 insulin glargine for the same glycemic control. In studies in type 2 diabetes, subjects needed an average of 12% more U-300 than U-100 insulin glargine for the same glycemic effect. Conversely, it is recommended that up to a 20% dose reduction may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when switching from U-300 to U-100 insulin glargine. In addition, dose-dependent kinetics were observed with U-300 insulin glargine in people with type 1 diabetes, which is consistent with the mechanism described (Fig. 10B).

### In silico examination of initiation of long-acting insulin analogs toujeo compared to lantus under 3 dosing titration rules in virtual type 2 diabetes subjects [^117PBGLA]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the benefits and clinical necessity of insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes (T2D), healthcare providers are reluctant to initiate insulin, and patients are reluctant to start it for several reasons, one of these being the complexity of insulin treatment. Patients and their healthcare providers can benefit from titration algorithms (TAs) or rules that assist with the initiation and titration of insulin, performing the calculations that are needed to safely initiate and conservatively adjust.

Methods

The primary objective for this in silico study was to examine the effectiveness of 3 dose TAs (1–3) for optimization of basal insulin glargine (Gla-100 and Gla-300). In the simulations, 100 virtual subjects with T2D were included (50% men, age 62 ± 3 years, HbA1c 8.1% ± 2.9%, body weight 94 ± 16 kg). Subjects were studied under each TA (TA1 and TA2 fasting blood glucose [FBG] targets 90–130 mg/dL, TA3 FBG target 110–150 mg/dL). Initial dose of both insulins was based on 0.2 U/kg body weight. During 3 months, subjects reported their FBG to the LTHome web-based dose guidance system with a rules engine to safely guide long-acting insulin titration and maintenance. Subjects followed dose recommendations to reach designated FBG target ranges.

Results

All subjects reached stable doses under all TAs with both Gla-100 and Gla-300 insulin, and 93 or more of the 100 subjects, depending on the assigned TA, achieved the target FBG range within the 3-month simulation for all TAs. Mean FBG was lowered (Gla-100: 155 ± 40 to 118 ± 11 mg/dL with TA1 and TA2 and 132 ± 12 mg/dL for TA3; Gla-300: 125 ± 14 with TA1 and TA2 and 134 ± 15 mg/dL with TA3). Calculated HbA1c improved from 8.1% ± 2.9% to 7.1% ± 2.5% for TA1 and TA2 and 7.5% ± 2.5% for TA3, a reduction of 0.9% and 0.6% over 3 months for both insulins. Three subjects on Gla-100 and one subject on Gla-300 experienced mild hypoglycemia.

Conclusion

All TAs delivered safe dose recommendations with minimal hypoglycemia, leading to a stable glucose control in the majority of subjects.

2.3	Starting Dose in Insulin-Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin dose. The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short-acting insulin and divided between each daily meal. As a general rule, 0.2 to 0.4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin-naive patients with type 1 diabetes.
The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of TOUJEO may take five days to fully manifest and the first dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When initiating TOUJEO, monitor glucose daily.

Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0.2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily.

2.4	Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy

Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to TOUJEO from another insulin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

For patients currently on once-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at the same unit dose as the once-daily long-acting insulin dose. For patients controlled on LANTUS (insulin glargine, 100 units/mL), expect that a higher daily dose of TOUJEO will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].
For patients currently on twice-daily long or intermediate-acting insulin, start TOUJEO at 80% of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice-daily dosage.
When switching patients to TOUJEO, monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### New insulin glargine 300 U / mL versus glargine 100 U / mL in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes using basal insulin and oral antihyperglycaemic drugs: glucose control and hypoglycaemia in a randomized controlled trial (EDITION JP 2) [^111P6im1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

While type 2 diabetes can initially be controlled in most people with lifestyle modification and oral antihyperglycaemic drug (OAD) treatment, disease progression often leads to a requirement for insulin therapy 1. Nevertheless, a number of barriers may reduce adherence to insulin regimens, and patients and physicians might be wary of intensifying therapy because of fear of hypoglycaemia 2, 3, which probably contributes to the inadequate glycaemic control that is observed in many people 3. The global prevalence of diabetes is increasing rapidly, including in Japan, where changing lifestyles have led to a rapid rise in type 2 diabetes over the last few decades 4, 5, 6. There is considerable need, therefore, for improved management strategies that can help to reduce the burden attributable to diabetes.

Since the market authorization of insulin glargine 100 U/ml [Gla‐100 (Lantus ®; Sanofi, Paris, France)] in 2000 (Gla‐100 was licensed in Japan in 2003), long‐acting basal insulin analogues have had a considerable positive impact on diabetes management 7. Nevertheless, quality of life for people with diabetes might be further improved by therapies that can achieve and maintain glycaemic control, lower hypoglycaemia risk and increase injection interval flexibility. New insulin glargine 300 U/ml (Gla‐300) may help to address these needs; studies in both Japanese and Western populations 8, 9 have shown more stable and prolonged pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles with Gla‐300 versus Gla‐100, and persistence of glycaemic control beyond 24 h in people with type 1 diabetes. Gla‐300 was licensed in the USA, Europe and Japan in 2015 (as Toujeo ® in the USA and Europe; as Lantus ® XR in Japan).

The phase IIIa EDITION programme compared Gla‐300 with Gla‐100 in several different populations, and has shown that Gla‐300 is as effective as Gla‐100 in achieving glycaemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. In addition, a lower hypoglycaemia risk was observed over 6 months in multinational type 2 diabetes populations treated with Gla‐300 combined with mealtime insulin (EDITION 1) or OAD(s) (EDITION 2), and in insulin‐naïve people (EDITION 3) 10, 11, 12. The present study, EDITION JP 2 (NCT01689142), investigated the efficacy and safety of Gla‐300 versus Gla‐100 in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes who were already using basal insulin and OAD(s).
