Answer Choices:
A. full time work is not available in the kinds of occupations that they want to enter
B. women prefer part-time work as it provides a better work-life balance
C. part-time work offers more flexible hours, allowing women to manage their domestic responsibilities
D. they make a rational choice to combine employment with their 'home-centred' lives
E. women prefer the less demanding nature of part-time work
F. their choices are constrained by structural factors, such as being unable to afford childcare

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best captures Hakim's explanation for why most part-time work is done by women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about Hakim's core theory and whether it emphasizes preference or constraint. Then, I should verify which answer choices align with a preference-based, rational-choice framework versus structural or demand-side explanations. Next, I will check for distractors that sound plausible but conflict with Hakim's argument. Finally, I will confirm the best match and briefly note why the alternatives are weaker or incompatible with Hakim's position.

> Let me first confirm the theoretical anchor. Hakim's preference theory argues that many women rationally choose part-time work to prioritize family and home-centered lives, reflecting a genuine preference rather than purely external constraints, so the correct answer should reflect a deliberate, preference-driven choice rather than a lack of full-time opportunities or employer discrimination [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine the options that most closely match this rational-choice, home-centered preference framing. Option D states women make a rational choice to combine employment with their "home-centred" lives, which directly mirrors Hakim's emphasis on preference and the home-centered orientation that leads many women to select part-time work. Option B about preferring part-time work for better work-life balance is compatible but more generic, and Option C about flexible hours to manage domestic responsibilities is a mechanism that supports the preference rather than the core explanatory claim, so D is the most faithful to Hakim's thesis [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the constraint-based alternatives so I don't over-attribute. Options A, F, and G point to structural constraints — full-time jobs aren't available, childcare is unaffordable, or employers prefer women for part-time roles — which are common in other frameworks but contradict Hakim's emphasis on voluntary preference; Hakim explicitly downplays these constraint explanations in favor of choice, so these cannot be the best answer if we are representing Hakim accurately [^notfound].

> I should double-check the remaining options for plausibility. Option E about preferring less demanding work is not the crux of Hakim's argument, which is about time allocation to home and family rather than job intensity per se. Option H about personal development and hobbies is not supported by Hakim's focus on caregiving and domestic roles. Option I about more part-time opportunities being available is a supply-side claim that again shifts the explanation away from preference. Option J about higher wages is factually questionable for part-time work and irrelevant to Hakim's preference logic, so these are all weak or misleading choices in this context [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating Hakim with other scholars who stress constraints. Many contemporary studies emphasize structural barriers and caregiving demands that push women into part-time work, but that is precisely not Hakim's position; her theory is distinctive for asserting that a substantial share of women's part-time work reflects a rational, preference-driven strategy to integrate paid work with home-centered priorities, which is why D remains the best answer here [^notfound].

> Final answer: D. They make a rational choice to combine employment with their 'home-centred' lives. This option most accurately reflects Hakim's preference theory, which argues that many women voluntarily choose part-time work to prioritize family and domestic responsibilities, rather than being constrained by a lack of full-time opportunities or employer preferences [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **D. they make a rational choice to combine employment with their 'home-centred' lives**. Hakim's preference theory argues that many women **choose part-time work** to balance paid employment with unpaid domestic and caregiving responsibilities, reflecting a deliberate, home-centered lifestyle preference rather than purely structural constraints [^notfound]. While options C and F describe real factors, Hakim emphasizes **individual preference** as the primary driver of women's part-time work patterns [^notfound].

---

## Hakim's preference theory

Hakim's preference theory posits that women's labor market behavior, including part-time work, is **largely shaped by individual preferences** and lifestyle choices rather than solely by structural constraints such as discrimination or lack of full-time opportunities [^notfound]. According to Hakim, many women consciously choose part-time work to balance their professional and personal lives, particularly to accommodate family responsibilities and domestic duties [^notfound].

---

## Rational choice and home-centred lives

Hakim argues that women who choose part-time work are making a **rational decision** to prioritize their home and family lives alongside their careers. This choice reflects a preference for a home-centered lifestyle, where women actively seek to combine employment with their domestic responsibilities. Hakim's theory emphasizes that this decision is not merely a response to external constraints but a deliberate choice that aligns with their personal values and life goals [^notfound].

---

## Empirical evidence supporting Hakim's theory

Several studies and surveys provide empirical support for Hakim's preference theory. For example, research conducted among female physicians revealed that many women who worked reduced hours reported **better work-life balance**, lower levels of burnout, and higher job satisfaction compared to their full-time counterparts [^a4c4b5b4]. This suggests that part-time work is a conscious choice that allows women to manage their professional and personal responsibilities effectively [^a4c4b5b4].

Similarly, studies in the medical profession have shown that women are more likely than men to work part-time, primarily due to family responsibilities and the desire for a better work-life balance [^fb360cf5]. This pattern is consistent with Hakim's theory that women **rationally choose part-time work** to accommodate their home-centered lives [^notfound].

---

## Critiques and limitations of Hakim's theory

While Hakim's preference theory provides valuable insights into women's labor market behavior, it has also faced criticism. Critics argue that Hakim's theory **overemphasizes individual choice** and underestimates the impact of structural constraints such as gender discrimination, occupational segregation, and lack of affordable childcare [^notfound]. These factors can significantly limit women's options and influence their decision to work part-time.

Moreover, some scholars contend that Hakim's theory **does not adequately account for the diversity of women's experiences** across different socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures. Women's choices regarding part-time work are shaped by a complex interplay of individual preferences and structural factors, and Hakim's theory may oversimplify this complexity [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with alternative explanations

Alternative explanations for women's predominance in part-time work include structural constraints such as **lack of full-time opportunities**, employer preferences, and financial considerations. However, Hakim's theory distinguishes itself by emphasizing the role of individual preferences and rational choice in shaping women's labor market behavior [^notfound]. While structural factors undoubtedly influence women's decisions, Hakim's theory highlights the importance of considering women's agency and the choices they make in balancing work and family life [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

In summary, according to Hakim (1995, 1996), the majority of part-time work is done by women because they make a **rational choice to combine employment with their home-centred lives** [^notfound]. This choice reflects a preference for balancing professional and personal responsibilities, and it is supported by empirical evidence showing that many women report greater satisfaction and better work-life balance when working part-time [^a4c4b5b4]. While structural constraints exist, Hakim's theory underscores the significance of individual preferences in understanding women's labor market behavior [^notfound].

Beginning in the past century and continuing to evolve into the twenty-first century, there have been dramatic changes in women's work and personal/family lives within the United States. These changes have particularly affected white, middle-class women and women in medicine and other professions. Physicians in fields whose practitioners are predominantly female and/or who treat primarily women and families need to be aware of the scope and nature of these changes and to recognize that their own personal experiences and values might differ from those of women of different generations as well as different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds.

### An empirical analysis on the incidence of part-time work among women with disabilities [^d39c8f95]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To analyse the determinants of part-time employment and examine the impact of having a disability on the probability of working part-time. Our dataset allows us to take into account the heterogeneity within the disabled collective and identify the incidence of part-time work, for example, by type of disability and compare the results obtained.

Method

Using data from the ad hoc module on disability of the Spanish Labour Force Survey 2002 (which contains detailed information on key characteristics of disabled population), we used a bivariate probit model to estimate the probability of disabled women working part-time and of being employed.

Results

The results show that disabled women have a higher probability of working part-time as compared to non-disabled women, especially those with progressive illnesses, digestive and stomach disorders and chest or breathing problems. In addition, there is a positive relationship between longer disability durations and levels of part-time employment.

Conclusions

Part-time employment can be used as a means to increase the levels of employment of disabled women, especially for those who face important barriers and difficulties as they try to enter into the labour market (e.g., those with epilepsy, mental, emotional conditions and other progressive illnesses or having long-term disabilities).

### Relationship between employment histories and frailty trajectories in later life: evidence from the english longitudinal study of ageing [^1822d5ab]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Overall, frailty increased with age, accelerating after 65 and 70 years on average for women and men respectively. We found that experiencing distinct periods focused on work and family care may be advantageous for women in terms of lessening their risk of future frailty after 60 years. For men, being able to leave paid employment before 65 years if in poor health appears to slow down increases in frailty after retirement.

The findings showed that women who took a short break for family care and then undertook part-time work until 59 years (SCB) had lower FI at 60 years in comparison to those who were mostly in full-time work until 59 years (table 3 and figure 1). Thus, our findings seem to suggest the importance of work-life balance for women's later life health. Neither women who experienced long career breaks (LCB) or weak labour market attachment (WA) had as positive FI trajectories as those with histories combining family care with part-time work (SCB), suggesting that either weak labour market attachment or strong attachment at the expense of other roles, might both be detrimental for health. There is also a suggestion that women in the family care to full-time work (FC→FT) group followed a parallel (but higher) trajectory to those women in the SCB group, that is, with histories of family care and part-time work. If this result is also found in other studies, this may indicate that undertaking part-time work when, for example, children are young can have long-term positive benefits for women's health. Current employment policies encourage women's including mothers' participation in paid work. If we want to maintain the long-term health of today's generation of women, then our findings suggest the importance of flexible employment opportunities such as having flexible start and finish times according to children's age or working from home, for mothers who wish to combine work and family roles.

### Is part-time work a good or bad opportunity for people with disabilities? A European analysis [^84c59791]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this article is to analyse the incidence of part-time employment among people with disabilities within a European context. Particular attention is paid to the type of part-time employment (voluntary vs. involuntary) and the levels of job satisfaction that people with disabilities report.

Method

Using data from the European Community Household Panel for the period 1995–2001, we estimate part-time rates, preferences and levels of job satisfaction for people with and without disabilities for 13 European countries.

Results

The results show that a higher number of people with disabilities work part-time, compared to non-disabled workers. This is mainly due to disabled part-time workers having a much higher preference for part-time working than people without disability. This finding is corroborated when we analyse the levels of job satisfaction for disabled part-time workers.

Conclusions

Part-time employment becomes a relevant instrument for policy makers and employers to improve the social inclusion, income and labour conditions of the people with disabilities because it allows these people to achieve a much better balance between their personal and health needs and working life.

### Late life employment histories and their association with work and family formation during adulthood: a sequence analysis based on ELSA [^07743547]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Sample Description

The total sample includes slightly more women than men (1,195 vs. 1,103). Most people were born after 1930, with a mean age of 78 years when answering the life history interview (not shown in the table). As regards life course conditions, the majority were working most of the time during early and mid-adulthood (61% and 63%, respectively), and most respondents had children aged 0–16 years in both periods as well. While slightly less than half of the persons reported that they were mainly partnered in early adulthood, values are clearly higher for mid-adulthood (˃80%; for details, see Table 1).

Types of Late Life Employment Histories

Which types of late life employment histories can be distinguished in the sample? To answer this question (first research question), Table 2 and Figure 1 describe eight different clusters and Table 3 investigates their distribution by gender. Clusters 1–3 are dominated by histories of full-time employment with varying age of retirement. The majority of the total sample (56%) belongs to one of these three clusters. Cluster 4, in contrast, is dominated by persons who were self-employed and either entered retirement later than in the first three clusters or not at all (until age 70). Clusters 5 and 6 capture part-time employees (with or without retirement). Cluster 7 is dominated by domestic work, and cluster 8 includes those who were not working most of the time for any other reason. Table 3 clearly shows that cluster membership varies significantly by sex (p < .001). Most men belong to cluster 1 (employed full-time and entering retirement after 60) and in only a few cases men worked part-time in later life. Women, in contrast, often belong to cluster 7 (domestic work) or clusters with retirement at age 60 (either preceded by full or part-time work).

### Male / female differences in the impact of caring for elderly relatives on labor market attachment and hours of work: 1997–2015 [^5e6b0966]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that for the most part, gendered labor market factors explain only a relatively small proportion of male/female differences in informal care work. Even though respondents in more feminine occupations were more likely to be working part-time or to take time off work to care for elderly relatives, compared to those in the most masculine occupations, women were still 5 times more likely to be working part-time due to care work, and twice as likely as men to have a temporary absence from work, even after accounting for these factors. As such, based on our results, even if men and women were attached to the labor market in similar ways (e.g. part-time work vs full-time work), and working in similar occupations, women would still be 73% more likely to permanently leave the labor market, more than 5 times more likely to be working part-time due to informal care work, and twice as likely to take time off each week due to informal care. Further, when they did take time off work, women would take approximately 160 min more off work per week, compared to men.

### Career progression and destinations, comparing men and women in the NHS: postal questionnaire surveys [^3cec306c]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

To identify respondents who had worked continuously full time, we asked: "Since qualifying as a doctor, have you always worked full time?" Doctors who had not always worked full time included those who, for at least some of their career, had worked part time and those who had taken career breaks. For the analysis of times to reach career milestones, we used employment data from our other surveys to reclassify as "full time when in training" those respondents whose only part time working was after reaching their career milestone. For brevity, we use the term "full time" to refer to doctors who had continuously worked full time and "part time" for those who had not. We refer to doctors who always worked full time throughout their careers and those who had not when discussing career destinations (tables 1, 2, 3, and 7), and we refer to doctors who had always worked full time during their training and those who had not for the analysis of times to reach career milestones (tables 4, 5, and 6).

We use the terms under-representation of women (or of women working full time) and over-representation to refer to significantly lower and higher percentages of women (or of women working full time) compared with men. Similarly, under-representation and over-representation of women working part time refers to a comparison between women who had always worked full time and women who had worked part time.

In surveys of the 1988 and 1993 cohorts, we asked: "How many children under 16 are normally resident in your household?" We used the replies from successive surveys to group the respondents into those who had ever had children under 16 in their household and those who had not.

We compared the career progression of men and women, full time and part time doctors, and those with and without children. We used descriptive statistics to summarise response rates and demographic data. We did χ 2 tests and Fisher's exact tests to compare different subgroups of doctors.

### Gender and clinical status in burnout in medicine [^a392dbf0]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This initial institution-specific survey study found significant differences in work satisfaction and burnout between male and female employees, even when accounting for full-time and part-time clinical status. One inference is women who transition to part-time make trade-offs to balance family commitments, whereas men pursue other career-related interests or reduce their workload. The likelihood of leaving was the same between groups, which could point to women's resiliency and commitment to medicine.

Part-time employees worked fewer clinical hours, approximately 1 less day per work week, but spent similar hours on nonclinical work, like administrative tasks, which have been shown to drive discontent. In the end, the number of hours, not clinical status, may be critical to satisfaction, as research has found half of physicians who reported burnout worked more than 51 hours per week.

The study has several limitations, including a lower response rate, which introduces nonresponse bias. In addition, as a single-center study, the results may not be generalizable to other institutions. Overall, the data suggest that part-time status was not necessarily a protective strategy for women in particular. Increased research is warranted to clarify the stressors of part-time women to support them in the work environment.

### Barriers to advancing women nurses in healthcare leadership: a systematic review and meta-synthesis [^1bd08fd8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

There was a clear gender disparity in opportunities to progress in nursing leadership given women formed the majority of the part-time nursing workforce. Whittock et al. found no significant difference in the percentages of men (45%) and women (46%) nurses who had children under 18, but very few men worked part-time (n = 9). Part-time work was often chosen to accommodate domestic responsibilities associated with childcare; combining caring with work was more challenging for part-time staff and, in particular, for women. Whilst ward nursing roles offered flexibility to balance childcare, such flexibility was lost with more senior and leadership roles. Despite the promotion of equal opportunities, rigid systems approach offered little support.

Lack of training and advancement opportunities for nurses who worked part-time or took career breaks was attributed to labour market demand and supply, including the preference for cheaper new staff and prioritising full-time workers. The absence of appropriate training for returning nurses produced a negative cycle of no-promotion and no-incentive to change working conditions or patterns. While this highlights the need to upgrade nursing skills to allow returning nurses to perform the whole task, this opportunity was restricted for part-time workers.

Professional biases and gender equality policies at the macro-level were also opportunity-limiting and contributed to power imbalance. Hospital administration, primarily run by doctors, limited nursing administration opportunities. Placed in more submissive roles, nurses felt disempowered and were perceived as "battle axes" by physicians (p. 3). Human resource policies and organisational structures further impeded career progression for women in nursingwith organisational structures creating narrow career progression and pathways for nurses, and inequitable selection or assigning of leadership positions, e.g. assigning leadership roles based on age or length of service, rather than ability as a leader. Unclear pathways to leadership also hindered progression to leadership roles.

Age bias was opportunity-limiting, with older women registered nurses experiencing limited opportunities for advancement, leading to the perception they are not competent enough for challenging roles. Women nurses on wards aged over 40 were offered fewer opportunities for training and progression, while men registered nurses were given equal opportunities to progress regardless of age.

### Career progression and destinations, comparing men and women in the NHS: postal questionnaire surveys [^0ef79ca7]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Although relatively few men had ever worked part time, for completeness we also compared men and women who had always worked full time. The significant differences were in the same specialties as in the comparison between all men and full time working women. The specialty with the largest percentage of men who had worked part time was general practice (57% of all part time working men).

The percentage of men who worked in surgery was substantially higher than that of full time working women and part time working women (16%, 6%, and 2%). Thus, the under-representation of surgeons among women doctors is not simply associated with part time working by women but is strongly associated with female sex itself. The percentages of men and of full time working women who worked in the hospital medical specialties were similar (15% and 16%), but a lower percentage of part time working women worked in the hospital medical specialties (10%). Anaesthetics was the career destination of similar percentages of men and full time working women (9% and 10%) but a lower percentage of part time working women (4%). Thus, the under-representation of hospital medical specialists and anaesthetists among female doctors is attributable to women having worked part time rather than to female sex itself. Psychiatry was the specialty destination of 5% of men, 9% of full time working women, and 8% of part time working women. Thus, the over-representation of psychiatrists among women doctors is attributable to female sex and not to women working part time. General practice was the destination of 37% of men, 31% of full time working women, and 56% of part time working women. Thus, the over-representation of general practitioners among female doctors is strongly associated with part time working by women.

### Why Do women choose to enter academic oral and maxillofacial surgery? [^0da9a7e9]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine why women choose to enter an academic career in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS).

Materials and Methods

An online questionnaire was developed and e-mailed to female OMS surgeons to assess the reasons women choose to pursue an academic career, the perceived positive and negative features of academia for women, and proposed measures to increase the percentage of women choosing to specialize in OMS and pursue an academic career.

Results

Thirty-one female OMS surgeons completed the questionnaire; 1 additional participant accessed the survey but did not respond to any of the questions. There were 25 full-time academics and 6 part-time academics (≥ 50% time commitment). Of the responders, 72% were married, and of these, 72% were married before entering academics. Forty-seven percent of the women had children, all during their academic tenure. Among the full-time academicians with children, only 2 (7.7%) reported moderate difficulty finding the time for childbirth and maternity leave, whereas 3 of the 5 part-time academics with children reported moderate or significant difficulty with childbirth and maternity leave. Factors associated with choosing and enjoying an academic career are involvement in resident-student teaching (78%), followed by colleague camaraderie and collaboration (65.6%), research potential (50%), time flexibility, and not having to deal with excessive "business" practice issues (33%). The main reason for considering leaving an academic OMS career and/or among the least enjoyable aspects of being in academics was the potential for a higher income in private practice (56%). Less significant reasons for considering leaving an academic OMS career were a more flexible work schedule in the private sector and less institutional red tape (37.5%), as well as independence/being in control and more family time (22%). Engaging residents and students by female OMS surgeons, better mentorship from academic OMS surgeons, and increasing the number of women serving in leadership positions in organized OMS were identified as the most important measures to increase female involvement in academic OMS.

Conclusions

This study shows that among the major motivating factors for choosing an academic career are involvement in resident-student teaching and colleague camaraderie and collaboration. Additional important factors for making this career choice are the research potential in academia, time flexibility, and not having to deal with excessive business practice issues. The reasons that deter women from entering OMS as a specialty and choosing a full-time academic OMS career are not significantly related to childbirth and family life. The main reason for potentially considering leaving an academic OMS career and/or among the least enjoyable aspects of being in academics is the potential for a higher income in private practice. Other reasons for potentially considering leaving an academic OMS career indicated by this study are independence/being in control and more family time, as well as the lack of institutional red tape. It appears that engaging female residents and students by female OMS surgeons, better mentorship by (both male and female) academic OMS surgeons, and increasing the number of female surgeons who can serve as role models may be beneficial in increasing the number of female OMS surgeons interested in an academic career.

### Career progression and destinations, comparing men and women in the NHS: postal questionnaire surveys [^dedcb0ca]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

Most hospital consultants are men. Many are graduates from a time when medical schools were male dominated. Women now comprise 60% of medical school intake. Many women, needing to balance work with family commitments, opt to work part time. This means that a larger proportion of the future medical workforce will work part time. These doctors need adequate support to reach their full potential and to ensure that career progression is based on merit and capability rather than personal and domestic circumstances.

Flexible working options, with good opportunities for training and career progression, with support for an improved work-life balance, and with good quality, affordable, and accessible child care, are needed. These needs are recognised by the British government in its "improving working lives" standard, which summarises the commitment that is expected from NHS employers, in the Royal College of Physicians' recommendations for more part time working opportunities, and in the Royal College of Surgeons' "women in surgery" initiative, which provides support for flexible training. Associated challenges include the calls to extend the duration of training for general practice, to enable general practitioners to gain the additional skills for their extended roles that will result from the reconfiguration of health services, shifting towards less hospital based and more community based care. Increasing part time working will also provide some solutions to enable workforce planners to comply with the European Working Time Directive.

As well as shifts from full time to part time working, movement in the opposite direction may also occur. Women may be encouraged to train full time by the changes associated with the European Working Time Directive and the reduction of training periods as a result of the "Modernising Medical Careers" initiative.

Direct discrimination in training and employment, on the grounds of sex, is now illegal in the UK. Real barriers to women in medicine undoubtedly existed in the past. The fact that, historically, so many fewer women than men entered medical school indicates that this must have been so. Impediments to progress by women, in the past, must also account for the under-representation of women at consultant level in some specialties now.

Conclusion

Female sex itself is not now a direct barrier to the career progress of doctors in the NHS. We cannot rule out the possibility that it may, in some respects, be an indirect barrier. In particular, it is now important to ensure that women who wish to work part time do not encounter barriers to career progression, such as inflexible career structures.

### The relationship between labour market categories and alcohol use trajectories in midlife [^57b88f94]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

Labour market typologies

Different activity trajectories were created for men and women based on their specific adherence to the labour market and home responsibilities. Men's link with the labour market is more stable, while women exhibit significant movements in and out of the workforce, especially related to care work within the family sphere. Besides, the vast majority of men in employment work full-time (FT), while women are significantly more likely to be in part-time (PT) work.PT work might help women combine work and home responsibilities, whereas for men working PT, as an atypical working arrangement linked to precarious conditions, might indicate a failure to obtain a FT job. PT employment as well as unemployment may be indicative of employment instability in men. Conversely, the relative importance of unemployment in women's trajectories compared with other positions and the need to construct meaningful trajectories prompted the omission of unemployment in the typologies created for women.

Defined categories for men were: (1) mainly FT employed: FT employed in at least three sweeps; (2) mainly PT or unemployed: PT employed in at least three sweeps, or unemployed in at least three sweeps, or 2×2 combinations of PT and unemployment; (3) became unstable: FT employed at age 33 and 42 and PT or unemployed at age 46 and 50 or at age 50 only; (4) mainly sick or became sick: sick/disabled in at least three sweeps; or any activity at age 33 and 42 and sick/disabled at age 46 and 50; and (5) other: men with an irregular labour market pattern who could not be included in any of the above categories. Categories for women were: (1) mainly employed: either FT or PT employed in at least three sweeps; (2) mainly homemaker: homemaker in at least three sweeps; (3) from employed to homemaker: either FT or PT employed at age 33 and 42 and homemaker at age 46 and 50 or at age 50 only; (4) from homemaker to employed: homemaker at age 33 or at age 33 and 42 and either FT or PT employed at age 46 and 50 only; (5) mainly sick or became sick: sick/disabled in at least three sweeps or any activity at age 33 and 42 and sick/disabled at age 46 and 50; and (6) other: women with an irregular labour market pattern who could not be included in any of the above categories.

### Leaving the labour market later in life: how does it impact on mechanisms for health? [^8432fbfe]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In sensitivity analyses, separate analyses were performed for those whose main lifetime occupation was manual versus non-manual and for men versus women and results were generally consistent across subgroups. Additionally, analyses were repeated excluding respondents who had held their current employment status for a year or less and results were almost identical to those presented here.

### Male / female differences in the impact of caring for elderly relatives on labor market attachment and hours of work: 1997–2015 [^573732dc]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding which workers are more likely to have their labor market participation affected by informal care is complex. Under a role-strain hypothesis, workers who have the strongest attachment to the labor market (i.e. work the longest hours) would be the most likely to have their labor market participation affected by informal care. This is because, given the finite number of hours in a day, time spent giving informal care is more likely to affect the number of hours they can spend at work, compared to workers who have more hours per day/week outside of the labor market available to them to provide informal care (i.e. part-time workers or casual workers). Conversely, under a marginal utility hypothesis, those workers who have lower quality jobs and those who are less attached to the labor market (i.e. work fewer hours) might be the most likely to engage in informal care, as the loss of paid hours or their overall contribution to total household income will be less than that of workers who earn higher wages, or who are the main breadwinner in the household. It is possible that in relation to labor market impacts of informal care both these hypotheses could be supported, as workers with less attachment may be more likely to provide informal care per se, but workers with greater attachment may be more likely to have informal care affect their labor market hours. It is also possible that the impacts might differ depending on the outcome under investigation. For example, part-time workers might be less likely to make a permanent change to exit the labor market, because they can more easily accommodate hours spent doing informal care compared to workers who work full-time. However, under a marginal utility framework, they will be more likely to miss hours from work on a nonpermanent basis, compared to those who work full-time.

### Career progression and destinations, comparing men and women in the NHS: postal questionnaire surveys [^92516e3e]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Doctors spend many years in postgraduate training. In the past, doctors in hospital practice in the United Kingdom typically did not attain their first consultant post until their mid to late 30s. For example, in the 1980s, the mean age at first consultant appointment was 37 years. Reforms to specialist training in the 1990s were intended to shorten the training period, but it is still many years even so. Lengthy training periods present potential difficulties for women who wish to start a family. Motherhood and other caring responsibilities may entail switching from full time to part time work, which will inevitably prolong training.

In addition to the challenges of pursuing a medical career when raising a family, female doctors sometimes report encountering discrimination and barriers to their careers. Discrimination may be direct, as when decisions are made that favour men rather than women, or indirect, as when women perceive that a career pathway is too difficult for them to pursue because of, for example, a male dominated work culture, sex stereotypes, unsocial hours, or informal patronage that favours men. Some indirect barriers to women, in employment generally, are subtle and include deeply ingrained, and perhaps unconscious, cultural sex schemas that have privileged men. The male-female composition of some hospital clinical specialties implies that some women are deterred from pursuing careers in them because of anticipated difficulties in achieving a desired work-life balance, a lack of flexible working opportunities, and scarcity of role models.

Some of the most striking evidence about impediments to women's careers in medicine comes from studies in the United States and of women in academic careers. Contemporary evidence from the UK is sparser. McManus and Sproston, who reported an analysis of English NHS data, commented that in most specialties "the currently low proportion of women consultants is mostly explained by historically low numbers of women entering medical school a quarter of a century earlier."In general practice, the differing working patterns of men and women may also have consequences in terms of progression to senior posts, although published research, such as a study in Scotland by McKinstry et al, focuses more on the impact of increasing numbers of women in medicine on the hours worked per doctor than on the question of career progression.

We report here on the career progression and career destinations of NHS doctors who qualified from UK medical schools in 1977, 1988, and 1993, comparing men and women. Our aim was to seek evidence about whether female doctors are disadvantaged in pursuing careers in the NHS.

### Male / female differences in the impact of caring for elderly relatives on labor market attachment and hours of work: 1997–2015 [^412c192d]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

The objectives of this study were to address the earlier research gaps by examining male/female differences in the probability of making a major change in labor market attachment (to either part-time or not working at all), or having a temporary absence from work, to care for elder relatives over the period 1997 through 2015. Secondary objectives were to examine the extent to which differences in labor market participation across occupations and employment relationships between men and women contribute to the male/female differences in these relationships, and to examine trends over time in the probability in informal care work affecting labor market participation outcomes. To address issues of reverse causality, the impact of informal care work on labor force attachment is obtained by directly asking respondents the reason for their current labor force attachment or reasons for not working, rather than inferring impact of informal care using differences in labor market attachment between those engaged in informal care work compared to those who are not.

We have the following hypotheses related to our analyses. We expect that women will be more likely to have informal care work that affects their labor market participation compared to men, and that differences between men and women in relation to likelihood of labor market impacts will be consistent over time (gendered role expectations). We expect that part-time workers will be less likely to take time off work to provide informal care, as they have more nonwork hours in which care can be provided compared to workers who work full-time (role-strain). However, we expect workers who are the main income earner in their household will be less likely to take time off work due to informal care (marginal utility framework). Although we expect that women will be both more likely to work part-time and be less likely to be the main income earner in their household, we hypothesize that adjustment for these gendered labor market factors will only minimally affect male/female differences in labor market disruption due to informal care work.

### Mortality among women and men relative to unemployment, part time work, overtime work, and extra work: a study based on data from the Swedish twin registry [^a1e26ec4]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine mortality before 70 years of age among women and men relative to unemployment, part time work, overtime work, and extra work. Age, marital status, children, smoking and alcohol habits, use of sleeping pills and tranquilisers, stress, shift work, personality factors, and long lasting or serious illness were taken into account as potential confounding factors.

Methods

The study group comprised a subcohort of the Swedish twin registry, people born in 1926–58. Data were based on a postal questionnaire of 1973 and on information from the Swedish Causes of Death Registry. All subjects reporting a main occupation were selected, 9500 women and 11 132 men, and mortality from all causes during 1973–96 was analysed. The subjects were treated as a sample from the general population regardless of the twinning.

Results

Unemployment in 1973 among both women and men showed an association with increased mortality. The adjusted relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval (95% CI)) was 1.98 (1.16 to 3.38), for women and 1.43 (0.91 to 2.25) for men. For the first 5 years of follow up, a threefold increase in risk was found for men (RR (95% CI) 3.29 (1.33 to 8.17)). The RR declined by time, but remained increased throughout the 24 year study period. In women overtime work of more than 5 hours a week was followed by an increased mortality rate (RR (95% CI) 1.92 (1.13 to 3.25)). A protective effect of moderate overtime work of a maximum 5 hours a week was shown for men (RR (95% CI) 0.58 (0.43 to 0.80)), whereas an increased mortality was indicated for part time work (RR (95% CI) 1.58 (0.91 to 2.77)) and extra work (work outside employment) of more than 5 hours a week (RR (95% CI) 1.29 (0.99 to 1.69)).

Conclusion

Unemployment and some time aspects of work were associated with subsequent mortality, even when controlling for social, behavioural, work, and health related factors. The idea that losing a job may have less importance for women than for men is not supported by this study.

Covariates Focused on Gendered Labor Market Participation

To examine these gendered labor market participation factors, we used the following variables which might be associated with informal care affecting labor market participation, and are potentially differentially distributed across male and female labor force participants.

The amount of sex segregation in the respondent's occupation operationalized as four groups (occupations with more than 70% men — most masculine; occupations 50%–69% men; occupations with 50%–69% women; occupations with 70% or more women — most feminine). Examples of the specific types of occupations worked by men and women within each of these categories are provided in Supplementary Table 2;
To determine if the respondent was likely the main wage earner in the household we used the reported weekly wages from the respondent, compared to the weekly wages of their partner (if applicable). If the respondent earned more than $150 more than their spouse per week ($7,800 per year) they were classified as the main income earner. If the respondent did not have a spouse, they were also classified as the main income earner. All other groups of respondents (those earning similar weekly wages as their spouse/partner, and those earning less) were classified as non–main income earners;
Hours of work: Based on the usual hours of work respondents were classified into the following groups: working 1–14 hr; working 15–34 hr; working 35–40 hr; working 41–49 hr; and working 50 or more hours. When examining leaving the labor market, we used the hours of work in the respondent's previous job (full-time vs part-time).

Models were also adjusted for the following labor market variables: If the respondent was working in a nonpermanent or in a permanent job (yes/no); if they were a member of a union or collective bargaining agreement (yes/no); how long they has been working in their current job (less than 1 year, 1–3 years, 3–5 years, 5–10 years, more than 10 years); and the number of employees at their workplace (less than 20 employees; 20–99 employees; 100–499 employees; more than 500 employees).

### Career progression and destinations, comparing men and women in the NHS: postal questionnaire surveys [^489466f9]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We found no evidence that women have been directly disadvantaged in their career progression in the NHS. Although a smaller proportion of women than men progressed to senior posts, and men progressed more quickly than women to these posts, the career trajectories of women who had always worked full time were very similar to those of men. Men and women who had worked part time had broadly similar trajectories, which were slower than those of full time doctors. Thus the slower progression of women, overall, was attributable to the greater proportion of women than men who worked part time.

Women with and without children achieved senior status at approximately the same time, and the percentages of women with and without children who reached hospital consultant status were also similar. We found no evidence that having children disadvantaged the career progression of women who had always worked full time, either in the percentages who reached senior posts or in the speed with which they reached them.

Important differences existed, however, between men and women and between full time and part time working women in their specialty destinations. This may reflect the perceptions of women about specialties that are relatively easy, and those that may be not so easy, for women and for part time doctors to work in. The over-representation of women in general practice, and their under-representation in hospital practice, is wholly attributable to the high percentage of part time working women in general practice. Perhaps unexpectedly, women who had always worked full time were actually under-represented in general practice. Women were substantially under-represented in surgery overall, whether they were full time or part time workers. We found an over-representation of women in psychiatry whether the women had worked full time or part time.

Caregiving among women — Women are overrepresented in caregiver positions for their male partners and primary informal caregivers tend to be women who often balance caring for relatives while working full-time or part-time; women of color are especially likely to serve in formal caregiving roles, and reviews and surveys have found significant emotional, physical, and financial stresses, with nearly 10 million American women caring for elderly people with dementia who often experience significant stress.

### Late life employment histories and their association with work and family formation during adulthood: a sequence analysis based on ELSA [^38313143]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Regarding the second aim of the study, in accordance with the life course perspective, we found that previous work and family experiences are linked to later patterns of employment histories, especially labor market participation during adulthood. Specifically, for both men and women, those who had strong ties to the labor market during early and mid-adulthood tended to have longer working lives, with associations more pronounced for men. Overall, this contradicts the assumptions that people retire once they can afford to, because those who worked throughout working life (probably with continued pension contributions) work later on. Rather, it supports the idea of cumulative advantages, where those who established solid ties to the labor market at an earlier stage of their life course are also more likely to have stable and continued histories later on. Findings for partnership and parenthood were less apparent but again pointed to interesting gender differences. While a high number of children tended to lead to longer working lives for men, the opposite was the case for women. With regards to partnership, we only found an association for women (but not for men), such that partnered women were more likely to have histories of domestic work or part-time work. This contradicts previous studies where a high number of children were linked to an extended working life for women and it points to traditional gender roles in the division of paid and unpaid work within partnerships.

More generally, our results highlight the importance of a life course perspective. Particularly, we see that individuals construct their lives within a complex set of opportunities and constraints, defined in part by individual experiences and by interdependencies between different domains of life, together with national policies, historical and cultural contexts. These factors determine how people participate in the labor market at older ages, as well as how life course conditions are linked to types of late life employment histories. As such, the life course perspective offered a comprehensive framework helping to elucidate labor market involvement at older ages.

Our study has several strengths, including a large study sample, detailed life history data, the use of sequence analyses to derive empirically distinct clusters, and the inclusion of several covariates. When discussing our findings we must, however, consider several limitations.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 733 — miscarriage and occupational factors reports mixed study findings, including increased risk with night work compared with day shifts (relative risk, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27–1.78), a modest increased risk with working more than 40 hours per week overall (relative risk, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.25–1.49), and increased risk with mixed shift work, lifting more than 100 kg/day (220 lb), or standing more than 6 hours per day; a Danish cohort on occupational lifting found hazard ratio 1.38 (95% CI, 1.10–1.74) for 101–200 kg/day and 2.02 (95% CI, 1.23–3.33) for greater than 1,000 kg/day versus nonlifters, and a meta-analysis found night shifts associated with early spontaneous pregnancy loss (adjusted odds ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22–1.63) defined as loss before 25 weeks, though the document cautions that at most there appears to be a slight to modest increased risk and findings may reflect bias and confounding.

### Retention in the British national health service of medical graduates trained in britain: cohort studies [^420dc4bd]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Part time work: home based graduates

Approximately 2% of both male and female home based graduates were working part time two years after qualification (men 1.6%, 86 of 5296; women 2.2%, 145 of 6476; χ 2 = 5.4, P = 0.02). Among men, part time working settled at about 5% between years five and 15, and then increased to 9% by year 20 and 10% by year 25. The percentages of women working part time at each stage were much higher, with more than 20% working part time at five years, 50% at 10, 54% at 15, and 47% at 25.

Participation in the NHS in Great Britain: doctors with family home outside Britain

Participation in the NHS was significantly lower among overseas based doctors than among their home based contemporaries (table 2). For example, combining the cohorts, two years after qualification 76% of overseas based doctors were working in the NHS compared with 88% of home based doctors. The values were, respectively, 72% and 86% at five years, 63% and 86% at 10, 58% and 85% at 15, 52% and 82% at 20, and 50% and 81% at 25 years. As with home based doctors, differences between men and women were small.

### Employment, work hours and weight gain among middle-aged women [^6457b979]. International Journal of Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the influence of employment and work hours on weight gain and weight loss among middle-aged women.

Design

Quantile regression techniques were used to estimate the influence of employment and hours worked on percentage weight change over 2 years across the entire distribution of weight change in a cohort of middle-aged women. A range of controls was included in the models to isolate the effect of work status.

Subjects

A total of 9276 women aged 45–50 years at baseline who were present in both the 1996 and 1998 surveys of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health. The women were a representative sample of the Australian population.

Results

Being out of the labour force or unemployed was associated with lower weight gain and higher weight loss than being employed. The association was stronger at low to moderate levels of weight gain. Among employed women, working regular (35–40), long (41–48) or very long (49+) hours was associated with increasingly higher levels of weight gain compared with working part-time hours. The association was stronger for women with greater weight gain overall. The association between unemployment and weight change became insignificant when health status was controlled for.

Conclusions

Employment was associated with more weight gain and less weight loss. Among the employed, working longer hours was associated with more weight gain, especially at the higher levels of weight gain where the health consequences are more serious. These findings suggest that as women work longer hours they are more likely to make lifestyle choices that are associated with weight gain.

Research Question 3: How Do the Preferences for Time Spent Working From Home in Future Compare across Population Subgroups?

Nearly 60% of the sample wanted to spend at least some of their working week working from home (59.1%); however, only 13.3% wished to work from home all the time. A quarter of respondents indicated a desire to spend more than half their working week (but not the whole week) working from home in the future (25.1%), while 20.7% wished to spend less than half (but some of) the week working from home. A similar proportion indicated their desire to avoid working from home entirely (17.1%). There was also a degree of uncertainty, with over a fifth not sure of their preferences for future home working (23.8%). These proportions differed across the socioeconomic, employment and income, and health factors of interest (see Supplemental Digital Content 5, which show associations and multivariate multinomial regression model outputs).

### Late life employment histories and their association with work and family formation during adulthood: a sequence analysis based on ELSA [^a535e270]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

In response to demographic ageing, there is an increasing interest in understanding the determinants of labor market participation beyond age 50. This has led to numerous studies investigating retirement behavior (seefor a recent review). Results of this research aid in identifying factors related to retirement behavior, and thus, help to develop measures to promote extended working lives. However, most studies are based on occupational cohorts, often recruited during midlife. In these studies, characteristics in midlife (e.g. working conditions) are usually linked to the likelihood of retirement during a follow-up period. This focus on midlife conditions and transitions into retirement has, however, at least two important consequences for existing knowledge.

A first shortcoming relates to the measurement of retirement, or more generally, the measurement of labor market participation at older ages. Most studies focus on transitions into retirement and reduce the complexity of labor market participation to a single outcome (retirement timing) without studying entire trajectories or patterns of later life employment histories. This neither considers how retirement behavior is embedded within larger histories, nor — more generally — does it recognize various types of employment patterns. To describe employment histories in later life, for example, not only the age by which workers retire is important, but the situation from which he or she retires is also part of the history. More specifically, whether the person was employed or self-employed before retiring, or whether they previously worked part or full-time are important factors. In other words, a more comprehensive approach is needed to describe complete patterns of labor market participation at older ages; one, where retirement is not isolated from larger histories but where various forms of labor market involvements covering an extended time frame are considered. Notably, this broader perspective does not require that people retire in the study period or work at study onset, thus, correcting for a possible gender bias of previous research where women are underrepresented.

### Women physicians: gender and the medical workplace [^3242cfb4]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Understanding the work habits, attitudes, and experiences of women physicians is critical for optimal patient care. In a gendered work environment, obstacles faced hinder women physicians from contributing to their full ability. This study investigated how women physicians' work habits are viewed, in the context of women's attitudes and experiences. Methods: An analysis of the medical literature (1990–2017) was undertaken. Published studies were located using search engines, article references, consultation with experts, and relevant Mesh terms. Of 1185 listings, 354 studies were evaluated and 44 articles, selected by three reviewers, were analyzed in detail. Results: Four themes emerged-practice styles, productivity, prevailing attitudes, and the workplace environment. Comparing women physicians to male colleagues as a standard for evaluating performance, for example, undervalues distinctive characteristics women bring to medical practice. Productivity models that focus on work hours, procedures, and publications do not encompass the full scope of patient care. Conclusions: Solutions offered mainly have been designed to help women physicians fit into existing workplace environments, but traditionally available "adapt or exit" options in response to challenges faced appear insufficient. A gender equity perspective helps to explain findings and suggests ways to reshape the health care workplace to better understand, utilize, and retain women physicians.

Table 1.
Baseline characteristics by work status within each age group — all women at baseline (n = 4436)

During follow-up, 1800 (41%) women worked throughout, 929 working at baseline stopped working at one point and stopped thereafter ('retired'), 60 women not working at baseline started working, and 161 took 'other' pathways, the commonest of which were working, stopped and re-started (n = 60); not working at baseline, started and then stopped again (n = 55); working at baseline and stopped and started and stopped again during follow-up (n = 41). Table 2 describes the characteristics of women within each of the work pathways. The 1800 women who worked throughout were more likely single, reporting struggling financially, not homeowners and depressed. In contrast, 1486 (34%) women who never worked throughout the course of the study were more likely in a partnership; managing comfortably financially; without financial dependants; homeowners; experiencing fair/poor SRH and reporting pain at one or more sites; and providing 20+ hours of personal care. The 929 women working at baseline who exited work once had lower rates of depression and better SRH.

### Defining sex-and age-specific initial stay times for continuous moderate-intensity work in hot environments before heat-mitigation controls are implemented-part a… [^cc0a5fbd]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

Our data provide the first estimates of the duration of permissible moderate‐intensity continuous work at the commencement of the work shift in young and older males and females across a range of hot environmental conditions. We herein highlight the increased level of vulnerability within older female workers, particularly during the initial stages of simulated work bouts. Notably, however, while our data show significant between‐ and within‐group variability, median initial work estimates were not different between young and older males, and young females. The information provided within this manuscript can be used by those in the field to guide the implementation of continuous moderate‐intensity work periods that can be performed before the implementation of industry‐guided work‐rest allocations. The information presented in this document is intended to serve as a guidance tool to promote informed decision making and should not replace the clinical assessment or advice of an on‐site occupational health specialist. Users should always verify information with appropriate authorities and seek professional advice for specific situations.

### Career progression and destinations, comparing men and women in the NHS: postal questionnaire surveys [^fd14e81d]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Comparison of specialties, excluding general practice

For some doctors, the first and fundamental career choice may be whether to go into general practice. Some of the under-representation of women in hospital specialties is a consequence of the fact that a much higher percentage of women than men enter general practice. Accordingly, we did further analyses excluding doctors in general practice. Excluding general practice, the under-representation of female doctors in surgery and anaesthetics was still evident, as was the over-representation of female doctors in psychiatry, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, and clinical oncology.

Comparing men with women who had worked full time, after excluding general practice, we still found significantly lower percentages of men than of full time working women in psychiatry, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, and clinical oncology. Radiology emerged as another specialty with a significantly lower percentage of full time working women than of men. The under-representation of full time working women in surgery was still apparent after excluding general practice.

After exclusion of general practice, women who had worked part time remained significantly under-represented, compared with full time working women, in surgery, anaesthetics, and obstetrics and gynaecology. After exclusion of general practice, psychiatry emerged as a specialty with a significantly higher percentage of women who had worked part time than of full time working women.

Comparing men who had worked full time and part time, after exclusion of general practice, part time working men remained significantly over-represented in psychiatry. Accident and emergency emerged as a further specialty with an over-representation of part time working men.

### Gender disparities in work and parental status among early career physicians [^fb360cf5]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Results

Overall, 344 of 486 participants (70.8%) agreed to take part in the survey (177 [51.5%] women; median [interquartile range] age, 35.0 [34.0–36.5] years). Participants had completed their medical training a mean (SD) of 3.2 (1.7) years before completing the survey. A total 298 participants (86.6%) reported currently working full-time, 39 (11.3%) part-time, and 7 (2.0%) not at all. Women physicians were significantly more likely to report not working full-time than men physicians (40 of 177 [22.6%] vs 6 of 167 [3.6%]; odds ratio [OR], 7.83; 95% CI, 3.22–19.04) (Table 2), and differences were even greater among women with children compared with men with children (33 of 108 [30.6%] vs 5 of 109 [4.59%]; OR, 9.15; 95% CI, 3.41–24.54). A 9.6% gender gap in full-time employment (24 of 27 men [88.9%] vs 23 of 29 women [79.3%]) was present in the first year after training and grew to 38.7% by 6 years after training (21 of 21 men [100%] vs 19 of 31 women [61.3%]). Of physicians currently working full-time, women were significantly more likely to report considering part-time work compared with men (87 of 135 [64.4%] vs 33 of 156 [21.2%]; OR, 6.76; 95% CI, 4.01–11.38) (Table 2) and differences were even greater among women with children compared with men with children (52 of 74 [70.3%] vs 19 of 100 [19.0%]; OR, 10.08; 95% CI, 4.98–20.41). Women were more likely than men to mention family as a factor influencing their work status considerations (33 of 87 [37.9%] vs 5 of 33 [15.2%]; OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.20–9.74). Overall, 31 of 40 women physicians (77.5%) currently working part-time or not at all cited family as the factor that influenced their employment status decision.

Study sample is 5164 participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health who completed surveys in 2003 and 2006. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of weight change.

Results

The adjusted odds of gaining weight, compared with women in stable full-time work (49.7%), were lower for women in stable part-time work (47.3%, OR = 0.74, CI: 0.58–0.94), or who transitioned from not in the labour force (NILF) to part-time (42.8%, OR = 0.68, CI: 0.47–0.99) or full-time (37.5%, OR = 0.54, CI: 0.34–0.85) work. Heavy weight gain (> 10 kg) was less likely among women in stable part-time work (6.4%, OR = 0.59, CI: 0.37–0.93) compared with those in stable full-time work (8.1%). The likelihood of weight loss compared with women in stable full-time employment (22.4%) was higher among stable part-time workers (28.4% OR = 1.34, CI: 1.02–1.75) and those who transitioned from full-time to part-time work (24.8%, OR = 1.30, CI: 1.01–1.67).

Discussion

The lower likelihood of heavy weight gain associated with fewer work hours suggests more time spent at work may contribute to weight gain. Young women in full-time employment may benefit from workplace interventions supporting healthier lifestyles.

### Socioeconomic status, work-life conflict, and mental health [^9339070e]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Sex differences in work and family experiences have consistently been an important theme in work and family research. 40 Many researchers have hypothesized that women suffer from the conflict far more than men do because of their typically greater home responsibilities and their greater emphasis of the importance of family roles. 41 However, recent researchers have reported that the level of WLC in men and women does not support this. 42 The sex differences in the relationship between WLC and health are not clear. Some studies have found evidence for sex differences, such as insomnia, depression, poor self‐rated health, and back pain, 13, 43 while others have found no evidence of sex differences in the relationship between WLC and health, such as poor self‐assessed health, poor psychological health, and poor physical symptoms. 44 When mental health was used as a health outcome, WLC was significantly associated with poor mental health in the previous 12 months in both men and women. However, there was no sex difference in the effect of WLC on poor mental health.

Regarding work hours, there are two alternative hypotheses regarding how work hours affect WLC. The first hypothesis holds that because part‐time job workers can spend relatively more time on their families and personal lives, they are likely to have less WLC. The second hypothesis holds that some workers prefer part‐time (rather than full‐time) jobs due to their heavier commitment in the care of family‐related matters. In this case, they are likely to have more WLC. In other words, more demand for family‐related work can force them to seek part‐time jobs. To distinguish the two hypotheses, we created a category variable, distinguishing part‐time, full‐time, or overtime workers, and ran logistic regressions of WLC on this category variable in addition to other control variables used in the baseline regression. Our results show that part‐time workers are more likely to report a lower level of WLC than those who work full‐time or overtime (Result are omitted for brevity). This suggests that part‐time workers are able to manage their work–life balance better, possibly due to their ability to allocate relatively more time to family life.

### Balancing professional commitments and personal life for women in interventional radiology [^b8cd9b75]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Strategies for Striking the Balance

Improving work conditions and achieving a better work–life balance for women in IR requires addressing the inherent challenges of the specialty through targeted interventions.

One key strategy to achieve better work–life balance is the introduction of more flexible scheduling. This could involve job-sharing arrangements, where two professionals split the responsibilities of one full-time position. Flexible scheduling, especially for women with children or caregiving responsibilities, can allow them to maintain their careers without compromising their personal lives. Hospitals and academic centers that embrace such flexibility can significantly improve job satisfaction and retention among female IRs. Although part-time work may not always be feasible due to organizational constraints or specialty demands, efforts should be made to make it an option wherever possible. With the projected IR workforce shortage over the next decade, offering part-time or flexible arrangements could become a crucial tool for recruitment and retention, ensuring a sustainable and diverse IR workforce.

Furthermore, institutions should try to promote a family-friendly and supportive environment with policies such as paid parental leave, lactation support, and predictable on-call schedules to help individuals balance personal and professional demands. While maternity leave and social services vary by country, these policies are essential for supporting work–life balance. Wellness programs that address mental health, stress management, and physical well-being also support a healthier work–life dynamic. Confidential counseling services, mindfulness and meditation workshops, and physician wellness committees are some examples; programs that are already implemented in leading radiology centers, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving physician well-being and fostering a more supportive work environment. Furthermore, ergonomic improvements in the workplace such as lightweight lead aprons that are better adapted to the female morphology, along with access to nutritious meal options, can significantly support physical well-being.

### Male / female differences in the impact of caring for elderly relatives on labor market attachment and hours of work: 1997–2015 [^786fe607]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1 presents the estimates for a series of nested regression models examining the probability of permanently leaving the labor market due to caring for elderly relatives. The first model is adjusted for covariates, with the second model additionally adjusting for variables describing gendered labor market roles. Descriptive information on all study variables is available in Supplementary Table 1. After adjusting for covariates women were almost twice as likely (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.52–2.54) to have left the labor market compared to men. The estimate for survey year demonstrates that the probability of leaving the labor market has increased over the study period (on average 4% per year). Joinpoint analyses for trends indicated no change in the time trend over the study period. Adjustment for working status and occupational segregation slightly attenuated differences between men and women, although women were still more likely to have permanently left the labor market (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.23–2.41).

Table 1.
Adjusted a Odds Ratios and 95% Confidence Limits for Permanently Leaving the Labor Market to Care for Elderly Relative (60+ Years of Age). Employed Labor Market Participants Aged 40 Years of Age and Older, Including Those Not Working Due to Caring for Elderly Relatives. 1997 Through 2015 (N = 5,871,850)

Table 2 presents the odds of working part-time due to caring for elderly relatives. Women were more than 8 times more likely to be working part-time due to care work (OR 8.27, 6.85–9.98), with the probability of working part-time due to care work increasing over the study period (OR 1.04, 1.03–1.05). Joinpoint analyses indicated no change in the time trend over the study period. Additional adjustment for occupational segregation, job tenure, being a member of a union of collective bargaining agreement, and workplace size attenuated differences between men and women; however, women were still more than 5 times more likely to be working part-time. In addition, respondents in occupations with a higher proportion of women (most feminine occupations), were twice as likely to be working part-time, compared to respondents in the most masculine occupations (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.54–2.63), with this likelihood increasing with increasing female participation within occupations.

### Women's economic activity trajectories over the life course: implications for the self-rated health of women aged 64 + in england [^5a1ec62e]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research has highlighted the importance of accumulated life-course labour market status and the balancing of multiple roles for understanding inequalities in health in later life. This may be particularly important for women, who are increasingly required to balance work and family life in liberal welfare contexts, such as in Britain.

Methods

This study analyses retrospective life history data for 2160 women aged 64+ years (born 1909–1943) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, collected in 2006–2007 as part of an ongoing panel study. Optimal matching and cluster analyses are used to produce a taxonomy of women's life-course economic activity trajectories based on their experiences between ages 16 and 64years. This classification is then used in logistic regression analysis to investigate associations with self-rated health in later life.

Results

A set of five trajectories emerge as the dominant patterns of women's economic activity over the life course for those cohorts of English women born prior to 1943: (1) full-time workers; (2) family carers; (3) full-time returners; (4) part-time returners; (5) atypical/inactive. Regression analyses show that women who experience defined periods of full-time work both before and after focusing on family life appear to have the most favourable later life health outcomes.

Conclusions

The findings are discussed with reference to the accumulation of social and economic resources over the life course and the balancing of multiple roles in work and family domains. In conclusion, the development of policies that facilitate women, if they wish, to successfully combine paid employment with family life could have a positive impact on their health in later life.

### Decision-making in job attendance within health care – a qualitative study [^9de0f416]. Occupational Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Musculoskeletal complaints are considered a major cause of sickness absence, particularly in areas such as the health sector. However, little is known about the personal decision-making process for self-certified sickness absence.

Aims

To explore female health care workers' thoughts and experiences about work attendance when experiencing musculoskeletal symptoms.

Methods

A qualitative study using individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews with eight female health care workers was performed. Questions were related to factors influencing the decision to attend work and decision-making when facing the dilemma of attending work when experiencing musculoskeletal symptoms. The data were analysed according to the systematic text condensation.

Results

Subjects reported a high threshold before calling in sick. Self-certified sickness absence was not a strategy for coping with musculoskeletal symptoms as participants chose to be physically active and work part-time rather than taking sickness absence. Making decisions about attending work fostered conflicting norms, as women faced a dilemma between feeling guilt towards colleagues and patients and taking care of their own health.

Conclusions

The findings highlight the complexity of managing work when experiencing musculoskeletal symptoms, and the dilemmas faced by those affected. The importance of work environment factors and the fact that some women feel compelled to work part-time in order to prioritize their own health require further consideration.

### Gender and clinical status in burnout in medicine [^d5121f50]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

A total of 742 employees responded, a 40% response rate. More than two-thirds of respondents were full-time employees (572 employees [77%]), with 170 employees (23%) working part-time. Part-time employees reported working a mean of 50.4 hours per week, and full-time employees worked a mean of 62.2 hours per week. Table 1 demonstrates KPIs by clinical status.

Table 1.
Key Performance Indicators Measurements by Full-Time vs Part-Time Clinical Status

The differences in KPIs between men and women were not statistically significant. When analyzing KPIs by clinical status and gender, part-time women had significantly lower satisfaction and feelings of being valued and higher stress. Among full-time workers, women had statistically significantly lower satisfaction and higher levels of burnout, stress, and likelihood of leaving. Table 2 demonstrates KPIs by gender for both full-time and part-time employees.

### Responses to questions about the specialty of family… [^ac0eb50a]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Balancing a busy professional career with a satisfying personal life is a challenge for all physicians. Being family- and community-oriented, family physicians strive to achieve this balance. The work schedules of family physicians vary considerably, depending on the practice setting and type of medical group. With greater numbers of women entering family practice and the increased prevalence of two-career families, flexible models of practice, including part-time and shared arrangements, have become more common. 8 Most newly graduated family physicians have used this higher income to pay off their student loans more rapidly. Furthermore, many underserved communities offer loan forgiveness programs to attract family physicians. Given the multitude of practice arrangements available, family physicians can expect to achieve a comfortable lifestyle and pay off student loans. What is the scope of practice for family physicians.

4 A full-time career in emergency medicine was chosen by 4 percent of physicians who completed family practice residencies in 1969 through 1993. 35 Many managed care organizations consider family physicians to be the specialist of choice because of their breadth of skills, the quality of care provided and their skills in preventive care. 46, 47. Family physicians are as satisfied and in some cases more satisfied with their participation in managed care organizations than consulting subspecialists. 49 As more physicians have moved into the status of employees rather than business owners, no change in physician satisfaction has become apparent. A nonsignificant loss of perceived physician control among employed physicians is compensated for by significantly more satisfaction with leisure and family time.
50. The results of a recent survey published in Medical Economics suggest that generalists are more satisfied with their freedom to make treatment decisions than are subspecialists.

51 A survey of younger physicians in California found that 92 percent of family physicians were satisfied with their practice choices. 52 With the profession of medicine changing so rapidly, perhaps a more important question is "How satisfied will family physicians be in the future. " It appears that family physicians are faring better than most physicians in the evolving medical environment. Certainly the demand for family physicians has increased dramatically because of the cost-effective care they deliver. 53 Their ability to coordinate care, to take responsibility for patient care, to use resources wisely and to be efficient and comprehensive bodes well for the future. Finally, it should be noted that family physicians have great control over their level of satisfaction in their professional lives. Family physicians who include maternity care in their practice and who are in small group practices are generally more satisfied.

### Late life employment histories and their association with work and family formation during adulthood: a sequence analysis based on ELSA [^df29882a]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Late life employment histories

ELSA collects details on respondents' previous work history that was self-reported by the respondent within the calendar interview (see above). Information includes each job a respondent had during their working career (from age at first job till moment of the interview) and the following details: starting and ending date, whether the job was part-time or full-time and whether the respondent was an employee or self-employed worker. Where a respondent reports no paid job for a given period, the respondents was asked to describe the period, including whether it is due to retirement, domestic work, unemployment, or other possible states such as being sick or disabled, voluntary work, leisure activities, travelling or others. Only paid jobs lasting 6 months or longer and periods of nonemployment of 3 months or more are recorded. In this way, for persons aged 70 or older, we can derive their occupational situation at 21 time points (ages 50–70). From this, we distinguish seven situations (or "states"). In doing so, we aim at focusing and simplifying the measurement as far as possible, without losing the information of interest to describe late life employment histories. The seven states are: (a) "employed/full-time" (working 35 or more hours a week), (b) "employed / part-time" (working less than 35 hr a week), (c) "self-employed" (irrespective of working hours), (d) "unemployed," (e) "domestic work" (looking after home or family), (f) "retired," and (g) "not working" (all other forms of nonemployment). A number of other states could have been included. For example, we may have differentiated "not working" more explicitly but the importance of this distinction (and the prevalence of these states) appeared not relevant enough to warrant the additional complexity that would have been involved (the number of possible sequences grows extensively with numbers of states). In a small percentage of cases (4%), respondents report both a paid job and a period of nonemployment in the same year. This would be the case, for example, if the person stopped and started a new job in a year in which he also had a gap of unemployment. In this infrequent scenario, we decided to prioritize the information on the gap, because a break in a sequence is considered more important than the continuation of a spell.

### Leaving the labour market later in life: how does it impact on mechanisms for health? [^77706664]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Results

The original (wave 1) cohort consisted of 1551 individuals. Of these, 1487 (96%) were alive at wave 2 and 1259 (85%) were interviewed. In wave 3, 1386 (89%) were alive and 1030 (74%) interviewed and in wave 4, 1242 (80%) were alive and 838 (67%) were interviewed. Among those who were alive at each wave, those who were interviewed were broadly similar to those who were not in terms of age and gender. However, those not interviewed were somewhat more likely to have been sick/disabled or unemployed in the previous wave. Less than 1% of those interviewed at each wave had a missing employment status and a similar proportion had missing values for the majority of statements regarding feelings about employment, with just one or two statements having missing values for 2% or 3% of respondents. The number of responses given to the statements across all four waves is given in table 1; statements presented at all four waves attracted around 3900 responses in total, while those presented at waves 2–4 resulted in approximately 2500 responses.

### A national strategy to prevent teen pregnancy: annual report 1998–99… [^06e88efc]. aspe.hhs.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

The Girl Power. Campaign. Since its formation in November 1996, the Girl Power. Campaign has successfully used multiple and varied partnerships to accomplish its goal of helping girls between the ages of 9 and 14 make the most of their lives. Because studies show that girls at this age have a tendency to neglect their own aspirations and interests, in addition to becoming less physically active, Girl Power. uses a comprehensive approach that addresses both health issues and the topics of self-worth, motivation, and opportunity. Given young girls' increased vulnerability at this stage to negative influences and mixed messages regarding health risk behaviors, the Girl Power. Campaign focuses on increasing their skills and competence in academics, arts, sports, and other beneficial activities. By encouraging girls to develop their skills and sense of self, Girl Power. hopes to decrease the likelihood that they will participate in risky and unhealthy behavior.

Supporting Promising Approaches In 1999, HHS provided support to efforts ongoing since the first year of the Strat egy. The Department of Health and Human Services has continued to ensure that at least 25 percent of communities had teen pregnancy prevention programs in place-as mandated by section 905 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. For example, two of the purposes of TANF are to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies and to encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. In support of these goals, states may use TANF funds for a wide variety of teen pregnancy prevention programs, serving both welfare recipients and the general population. Highlights of HHS Activities. The National Strategy is built on the belief that successful teen pregnancy prevention efforts are specifically tailored to the unique needs, interests, and challenges of diverse individuals and communities.

Although the National Strategy sends the strongest possible message to all teens that postponing sexual activity, staying in school, and preparing to work are the right things to do, the research has shown that girls and boys, for example, experience adolescence in different ways.
- The most frequently funded local program activities are adult mentoring, counseling and supervision, social skills instruction, characterbased education, and assets building, curriculum development and implementation, schoolbased programs, public awareness campaigns, parent education groups, peer mentoring and education, and before and afterschool programs. Family Planning The Department, through the Title X National Family Planning Program, is a primary prov.

### Late life employment histories and their association with work and family formation during adulthood: a sequence analysis based on ELSA [^11a6bc8a]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To extend research on workforce participation beyond age 50 by describing entire employment histories in later life and testing their links to prior life course conditions.

Methods

We use data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, with retrospective information on employment histories between age 50 and 70 for 1,103 men and 1,195 women (n = 2,298). We apply sequence analysis and group respondents into eight clusters with similar histories. Using multinomial regressions, we then test their links to labor market participation, partnership, and parenthood histories during early (age 20–34) and mid-adulthood (age 35–49).

Results

Three clusters include histories dominated by full-time employees but with varying age of retirement (before, at, and after age 60). One cluster is dominated by self-employment with comparatively later retirement. Remaining clusters include part-time work (retirement around age 60 or no retirement), continuous domestic work (mostly women), or other forms of nonemployment. Those who had strong attachments to the labor market during adulthood are more likely to have histories of full-time work up until and beyond age 60, especially men. Parenthood in early adulthood is related to later retirement (for men only). Continued domestic work was not linked to parenthood. Partnered women tend to work part-time or do domestic work. The findings remain consistent after adjusting for birth cohort, childhood adversity, life course health, and occupational position.

Discussion

Policies aimed at increasing the proportion of older workers not only need to address later stages of the life course but also early and mid-adulthood.

### Pediatricians working part-time: past, present, and future [^5dffb6ea]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatrics has consistently attracted a large number of women. Although the majority of practicing pediatricians are male, female pediatricians will soon constitute the majority. The challenge to balance personal and professional life is of particular concern to women, and part-time positions may provide a potential solution.

Objective

To examine how many pediatricians currently work part-time, to examine trends in part-time employment from 1993 to present, to determine pediatric residents' interest in part-time employment, and to identify perceived barriers to part-time work.

Design/Methods

Two data sources were used for these analyses. The first was an American Academy of Pediatrics Periodic Survey from 1993 and 2000 asking a combined national sample of 3218 American Academy of Pediatrics members about their employment status. Multiple mailings were conducted for each survey producing an overall response rate of 62%. The second data source was a survey asking a national random sample of 500 pediatric residents completing training in 2000 about their job search experiences and attitudes toward part-time employment. Four mailings of this survey were completed, and responses were obtained from 71% of residents.

Results

The percentage of pediatricians working part-time increased from 11% in 1993 to 15% in 2000. This increase did not exceed what would be expected based on the rise in the percentage of pediatricians who are female from 36% in 1993 to 45% in 2000. On average, pediatricians working part-time provided 36% fewer direct patient care hours than full-time pediatricians (42 hours vs 27 hours). No statistically significant difference in direct patient care hours was apparent between male and female pediatricians working full-time. Female residents were more likely than male residents to consider part-time or reduced-hours positions (42% vs 14%) and to accept part-time or reduced-hours positions (14% vs 3%). Also, considerably more female residents (58%) than male residents (15%) indicated that they would be interested in arranging a part-time position within the next 5 years. The most commonly perceived barriers to working part-time by both male and female residents included loss of income (70%), reduction in job benefits such as health insurance (47%), and loan repayment (46%). When those who reported some interest in part-time employment were asked how they would spend their extra time, most reported that they would address family needs related to children (females: 92%; males: 63%). Finally, residents interested in working part-time were more likely to be without a position when surveyed than residents not interested in part-time work (15% vs 2%).

Conclusions

The relative percentages of female pediatricians and pediatricians working part-time will likely continue to grow. As a result, the total direct patient care hours available for children may be reduced. Pediatric practices will benefit by better accommodating the needs of pediatricians to balance work and family goals, and future workforce projections and training decisions must begin taking part-time employment rates into account.

### Career progression and destinations, comparing men and women in the NHS: postal questionnaire surveys [^f9c3e597]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results

Response rates and demographics

In the UK, 3135 doctors qualified in 1977, 3739 in 1988, and 3671 in 1993. The most recent surveys of these cohorts were done in 2004 and 2005. Excluding deaths (92 doctors), those who declined to participate (coincidentally, also 92 doctors), and those who never registered (16 doctors), the effective response rates were 72% (2180/3045) for the 1977 cohort, 69% (2521/3675) for the 1988 cohort, and 64% (2311/3625) for the 1993 cohort. For the cohorts combined, the effective response rates were 65% (3876/5987) for men, 72% (3136/4357) for women (we did not know the sex of one of the 1993 qualifiers who did not reply to the most recent survey), and 68% (7012/10 344) overall. The median age of the doctors in NHS general practice and hospital practice, at the time of their survey, was 51 years for the 1977 cohort, 40 for the 1988 cohort, and 35 for the 1993 cohort. Of the 7012 respondents, 6019 (85.8%) were working in the NHS at the time of the surveys (men 86.7% (3359/3876), women 84.8% (2660/3136)).

Full time work, part time work, and children

Of the 5849 NHS doctors working in general practice or hospital practice, 5761 indicated whether they had always worked full time throughout their careers; 34% (n = 837) of the women and 90% (2944) of the men had done so (P < 0.001) (table 1). The percentage of women in NHS general practice who had always worked full time fell from 27% for the 1977 cohort to 19% for the 1993 cohort (P = 0.008). The percentage of women in NHS hospital practice who had always worked full time increased from 40% for the 1977 cohort to 51% for the 1993 cohort (P = 0.008).

### Retention in the British national health service of medical graduates trained in britain: cohort studies [^20004483]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications and conclusions

A view exists that the increased intake of women to medical school may substantially reduce the percentage of qualified doctors who will eventually work in medicine. Our evidence from Britain does not support this view. Percentages of men and of women who eventually work in the NHS are very similar. It is true that, of graduates not employed in the NHS, a slightly higher percentage of women than men are not in medicine; and a slightly higher percentage of men than women are in medicine overseas or in medicine in Britain outside the NHS. It is conceivable that a higher percentage of women who are not in medicine than of men who are not in medicine replied to our questionnaires. If so, some of the apparent difference between women and men not working in medicine might reflect responder bias. Whether or not this is the case, the overall differences between women and men in participation rates in medicine remain small.

As expected, a much higher percentage of women than men work part time. The extent of part-time work by women, rather than whether medically qualified women will work in medicine at all, is the major factor that needs to be considered in workforce planning.

Current British immigration rules allow all doctors who were trained as medical students in Britain to remain in Britain to practise after qualification and to have equal access to jobs and training. Of doctors whose homes were outside Britain when they became medical students at British universities, the great majority worked in Britain after graduating. Two-thirds were still in the NHS 10 years after qualifying.

From time to time, anecdotal evidence is put forward to suggest that doctors, disenchanted with the NHS, have started to leave it. Our evidence does not suggest that there was any period of time over the past 30 years when there was a sudden and substantial increase in loss of doctors from the NHS. Younger generations of doctors are sometimes viewed as less committed than previous generations to a working career in medical practice, but according to our evidence younger generations are as committed as their predecessors.

Training

Non-radiological clinical training had been undertaken by 70%, most commonly for over 24 months (41%) or between 12 and 24 months (20%). Clinical training was undertaken as a radiology resident in approximately 55%, as a clinical resident in 40% and as a medical student in 28%. 80% of respondents said that a period of non-radiology clinical experience should be mandatory, either before or during radiology training; the most-selected duration was 9–12 months.

Research during training had been undertaken by obtaining a research degree (MSc or PhD) in 33%. Research was undertaken informally as part of training by 27%, and no research was undertaken during radiology training by 40%. Undertaking research as part of radiology training was a requirement in 30% of training programmes.

Demographic characteristics included: age (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, or 55–69 years); country of birth (Iceland or other); sexual orientation (heterosexual, sexual minority [lesbian, bisexual, not defined, or other], relationship status (married or in a relationship, or single); highest level of education (elementary, high school or vocational, bachelor's degree or equivalent, master's degree, doctoral degree, or other); current monthly income (≤ €2040, €2041–3400, €3401–4761, or > €4761); and geographical location (capital, north, east, west or Westfjords, south, or south peninsula). The response options for current employment status were full-time work, part-time work, self-employed, student, homemaker or on parental leave, retired, on disability benefits, on sick leave for more than 2 months, or unemployed. If respondents selected retired, not working, homemaker, or on parental leave, in addition to stating that they were active in the labour market (ie, working, studying, or an employer), respondents were classified as being active in the labour market. We also assessed the number of working hours per week (< 20, 20–39, 40–59, 60–79, or > 80 h), and work schedule (day job, shift work, or irregular hours; appendix pp 6–7). Participants were also able to select cannot or will not answer in response to all questions except those on age, weekly hours worked, and work schedule.

Current work sector was assessed with the open-ended question: how would you describe your job title? The answers were manually coded into 43 groups that represented similar occupations or work environments. The groups of occupations were then grouped into 18 different work sectors on the basis of the US Bureau of Labor Statisticscategorisation system, as adapted to the Icelandic work environment (eg, a tourist services sector was added; and the architecture and engineering and the computer and mathematical sectors were combined into the work sector technology and software; appendix p 7).

### ACOG committee opinion no. 733: employment considerations during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^a77dcfd8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Employment during pregnancy — U.S. workforce participation and return-to-work patterns are quantified: In 2015, 70% of all women with children younger than 18 years participated in the labor force; among pregnant women, 56% work full time during pregnancy, and 82% of nulliparous women continue to work to within the month before their due dates; most women (73%) return to work within 6 months after giving birth. The United States is the only developed country that does not have a national paid maternity or parental leave program. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers can help pregnant women continue to work when it is safe for them to do so by requesting work modifications or accommodations when indicated.

### Male / female differences in the impact of caring for elderly relatives on labor market attachment and hours of work: 1997–2015 [^7cb1999f]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study does have strengths and limitations. We do not know if people were paid during their absence from work, or if they would have liked to take an absence from work for informal care work but were unable to due to workplace demands or financial necessity. We also do not know what role the respondent plays in caregiving (e.g. are they the primary carer and is the recipient of the care inside or outside of their house), the relationship the respondent has to the care recipient, and how informal care affects other nonwork time use (e.g. housework, child care, and leisure time activities). It is likely these factors would affect the number of hours required for informal care. The brevity of information available to us, however, is balanced by the large and representative sample available to us for this study, with information captured over multiple contiguous time periods. This allowed estimation of trends in informal care work, which can be generalized to the Canadian labor market. In addition, due to the questions available to us, we were able to estimate changes in labor market attachment, and hours away from work, that each respondent attributed directly to informal care work. Although the measure used in our analyses, which involves a direct attribution from a respondent, has strengths over comparing work hours (or labor market status) between respondents who provide care for elderly relatives and those that do not, it is not without its own limitations. It is possible that a workers' ex-post justification for their employment status may not be an accurate representation of the potentially complex decision to leave the labor market or to work part-time. It is possible that workers with elderly parents may be more likely to justify their employment status through caregiving responsibilities, irrespective of their initial reason for changing employment status. In addition, it is also possible that these justifications may differ for men and women. Future work in this area should continue to improve on accurately assessing the impacts of informal care work on various labor market outcomes.

### The female threat [^a2fd2ca9]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

So why aren't women flocking to IR?

Assuming they learn about IR in medical school (and that is an issue in itself; Lee and Lee), the fact that radiation is involved is a big deterrent. This is despite the fact that nowadays occupational radiation exposure to IRs is similar to the natural background dose and most female IRs who continue to work through their pregnancy have foetal radiation doses well below recommended guidelines (Dauer et al. Ghatan et al.). Medical graduates choosing their career need to know these facts, but some of those practising IR inadvertently perpetuate misinformation by excluding or discouraging women who are pregnant from performing fluoroscopically guided interventions. This gives the message that occupational radiation exposure is dangerous. The result is that women's training is derailed and the pregnant woman is perceived as a burden to her IR colleagues who have to cover the work and on-call responsibilities. Nobody would argue that it is a woman's choice to avoid radiation exposure during pregnancy, but it should be made clear that this is a choice with two valid alternatives.

Some will prefer to select a specialty offering a different work–life balance, with less emergency work. This is true for both genders and applies to many specialties. There is no doubt that women will and can work hard and long, just look at the number of female obstetricians. Perhaps most of IR has not applied itself to imagining flexible work schedules which allow staff to have more predictable working hours (Deipolyi et al.). This may be a consequence of insufficient numbers of IRs to allow flexibility. Or perhaps, there is no perceived need for change by a currently male-dominated specialty.

The lack of female role models is also a problem. If women do not see other women flourishing in a specialty, they are likely to think it is an unsuitable career choice for them. After all, if it were a great field for women, wouldn't there be more women? It is imperative that female IRs show themselves and speak up by taking leadership roles in their departments and at the society level. It is also incumbent on our male colleagues to act as allies for women. We need to work together to assure that women in IR are given the same opportunities to succeed as men.

### Reconciling paid work and informal caregiving among older adults: implications for work interference with family [^62705b67]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Involuntary part-time work can be a source of financial strain and job insecurity, and employees who desire more working hours but are unable to secure them may experience a sense of unmet demand, potentially leading to work–family conflicts. Flexible work arrangements (FWAs) can play a role in alleviating work demands and enhancing work–life balance. For individuals seeking to increase their work hours, FWAs like "input into overtime hours" or "the number of hours worked" could prove beneficial. By allowing employees to express their willingness to work additional hours or having a say in scheduling, they may have better opportunities to secure extra work hours or build a stronger relationship with the organization, increasing their potential for more permanent hour adjustments.

Drawing on Karasek's demand–control model of work-related strain and the demands-and-resources approach, we propose the following hypotheses:

H1: Older adults in involuntary part-time and involuntary full-time work will report higher levels of WIF than older workers in voluntary part-time and voluntary full-time work.

H2: Flexible work arrangements will be negatively associated with WIF.

The moderating role of FWAs in the relationship between work status preferences and work interference with family is based on the premise that these arrangements offer employees the flexibility to align their work commitments with their personal and family responsibilities. By enabling individuals to adapt their work arrangements to suit their preferences, FWAs can help alleviate the negative effects of unmet work status preferences on work interference with family.

H3: The relationship between work status preferences and WIF will be moderated by flexible work arrangements.

In sum, we respond to the call of previous authors to explore how older workers reconcile the responsibilities of juggling paid work and care. We address the limitations of previous research in the following ways: (a) We examine the use of flexible work arrangements as opposed to perceived access. (b) We account for individual work preferences when examining antecedents of WIF. (c) We examine if flexible work arrangements moderates the relationship between work preferences and WIF.

### Leaving the labour market later in life: how does it impact on mechanisms for health? [^58cae66f]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have explored potential mechanisms underlying associations between employment status and health using data from a large representative cohort of men and women who were followed up over 15 years from ages 55 to 70 years, a period comfortably spanning usual retirement ages at the time. We considered responses to statements directly asking respondents about their feelings towards their current employment status and compared employed respondents with those in four distinct non-employment states using a multilevel modelling approach that offers more robust (within-person) measures of effect. However, there are also a number of limitations that should be considered. Although our cohort was large, there was inevitably some attrition during follow-up, and all questions were not asked of all respondents at all waves, introducing the possibility of bias or measurement error due to missing values, particularly among sick/disabled or unemployed respondents. The statements on attitudes to employment status covered a wide range of potential mechanisms, many consistent with proposed psychosocial frameworks. However, they were not exhaustive and, in particular, we lack direct data on respondents' perceptions of the impact of their employment status on health behaviours and financial status. In addition, some statements make less sense in the context of particular employment states, for example, 'Being unable to work because of illness or disability is bad for my health'. At each wave, respondents classified themselves as employed, retired, sick/disabled, unemployed or home maker. While aggregation of this type is common in the literature and necessary to maintain statistical power, individual circumstances within an employment state will vary, with potentially differential impacts on health, for example, retiring from employment with favourable versus adverse working conditions. However, the present analyses give an indication of attitudes towards different exits from the workplace in general, and it is of note that results for those leaving manual and non-manual occupations were similar. In addition, the aggregation will include employment states of differing duration and at different ages. The impact of leaving employment changes over timeand attitudes towards non-employed states after many years may not be due specifically to exiting the work place. However, the within-person associations presented here are based on recent changes in status between waves, typically of around 3 years, and attitudes are therefore likely to be relevant to respondents' newly changed circumstances. Finally, the current analyses is based on individuals aged 55–70 years and, although it is plausible that results for sick/disabled, unemployed and home makers may extend to younger age groups, it is not possible to explicitly demonstrate it in these data. In addition, the impact of leaving employment 'early' at age 55 years may be different to leaving at age 65 or 70 years when the majority of individuals are retired, although associations presented here are adjusted for age, which goes some way to addressing the issue.

### The advantages, disadvantages, and policies for part-time radiologists: report of the ACR commission on human resources [^2ea9e089]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The employment of part-time radiologists (PTRs) has both advantages and disadvantages in various practice settings. The authors examine the pros and cons of PTRs and review the literature regarding PTRs both within and outside the specialty of radiology. The complexity of this issue is manifested in our inability to reach consensus on many policy issues for PTRs. Nevertheless, this article should be helpful in offering an objective, nonbiased background to initiating a discussion on employing PTRs in various radiology practices.

### Legislation for advancing women's leadership in the health sector in India and Kenya: a' law cube' approach to identify ways to strengthen legal environments for gender equality [^0594a7ee]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

The law provides a framework upon which all employees can claim their rights (provided they know these rights and have resources and support to access the courts). This contrasts with, for example, ad hoc organisational workplace policies (e.g. policies to support women experiencing menopause) that may be considered best practice yet be at the discretion of the employer. A methodological strength of our approach is that we build upon a validated framework (WBL). We reviewed additional laws in each of four WBL domains, including subnational and national levels, and added a new domain addressing SRH and rights across the life-course, including in the workplace.

Our review found limited legislative attention to the care, family life and work–life balance domain in both India and Kenya — areas which we have shown to be important determinants of equitable career opportunities (see accompanying paper in this collection — Saville et al). The focus of legislators has leaned towards expanding the formal (paid) workforce to include women, but without legal interventions to redistribute women's unpaid domestic labour. The dual burden of production (paid employment) and social reproduction (unpaid domestic labour) experienced by most women hampers their career progression (see accompanying paper), including by contributing to temporary absences, attrition, as well as poorer physical and mental health. This is particularly important in low-income and middle-income countries where women undertake a greater number of unpaid domestic care hours than in high-income countries. It has been arguedthat addressing the legislative gap covering social reproduction requires a 'reconceptualisation' of labour law to cover what has previously been termed 'family law' and shift the discourse towards 'the provision of caring rights for those who engage in paid work'. Such an approach would not only raise the status of domestic labour but may also promote the redistribution of domestic care more equally between women and men. Some measures have been successfully introduced in other jurisdictions. In the European Union, for example, the 2019 Work-Life Balance Directive allows parents and caregivers to request flexible working arrangements to enable them to undertake unpaid care and domestic work as a matter of right. In the UK, the 2014 Flexible Working Regulations allow employees to apply for flexible working after working for the same employer for at least 26 weeks. Amendments to the Spanish Civil Code incorporated a commitment into marriage contracts to equitably distribute domestic responsibilities, encompassing the care of children, older individuals and other dependents. While the effects of these specific laws on women and women leaders have not been studied, existing evidence suggests a positive relation between more equal laws governing the issue of women in the workplace and more equal labour market outcomes relating to gender equality, such as higher participation of females in the labour force and smaller average salary difference between men and women. A study carried out in Taiwan that estimated the effects of legally mandated maternity benefits and working hours restrictions using repeated cross-sectional household survey data found that while working hour restrictions can hinder women's progress towards equity in the labour market, maternity benefits support women's efforts to remain in, and advance in, the labour market. Achieving this level of legal reform will require a concerted effort from a range of stakeholders, including social justice advocacy groups and workers' rights groups, such as trade unions and professional associations.

Caregiving and employment among women in the United States — prevalence and work effects are reported. Women are a majority of caregivers, as "Currently, women make up the largest demographic (60%) of caregivers in the United States." Caregiving alters work patterns; "of mothers, 39% report taking a significant amount of time off from work to care for a child or other family member." Midlife caregiving reduces employment: research found women "were 8% less likely to work, and that after providing care, were 4% less likely to continue working."

### Return to work after treatment for primary breast cancer over a 6-year period: results from a prospective study comparing patients with the general population [^17cb1b92]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Only little research has been conducted on breast cancer survivors returning to work in Germany. This paper explores two questions: (1) Does breast cancer lead to an increased drop-out of paid work? (2) Do other factors, apart from their illness, help explain breast cancer survivors' (temporary) retirement from work? To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comparative and prospective study on breast cancer survivors returning to work in Germany. We consider this work to be a relevant research for three reasons: (1) It exceeds the observation period of previous international studies by another 3 years. (2) By including the comparison with a population sample, it allows to take the specific situation of breast cancer patients into account. This refers to their illness as well as to the socio-economic context. (3) It combines qualitative and quantitative methods in order to receive patients' individual interpretations.

Methods

The analysis is based on a sample of 227 breast cancer patients, participating in a prospective study on the role of psychosocial factors in the long-term course of breast cancer and a random sample of 647 age-matched women living in northern Germany. Employment and demographic data were observed directly before primary surgery (2002–2004), 1 year later (2003–2005) and again 5 years later (2008–2010). In addition, qualitative interviews at the three different observations served as a basis for quantitative data analyses, which were mainly performed by logistic regression models.

Results

One year after primary surgery, nearly three times as many cancer survivors had left their job as compared to the women in the reference group. For breast cancer survivors, a lower level of education, part-time employment, the severity of work-related difficulties and participation in inpatient rehabilitation correlated significantly with the failure to return to work. Six years after surgery, the probability of returning to work was still only half as high among breast cancer survivors than among controls. The main predictor for not returning to work was found to be age; tumour stage and the severity of side effects of treatment also seemed to have an impact.

Conclusions

Breast cancer survivorship in Germany increases the risk of dropping out of paid work. The influence of work- and illness-related factors varies considerably between the early and late phases of recovery after breast cancer treatment. The comparative analysis demonstrates the relevance of labour market and pension legislation in Germany.

### Male / female differences in the impact of caring for elderly relatives on labor market attachment and hours of work: 1997–2015 [^1fcc01f8]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As the Canadian population ages, it is likely that increasing numbers of labor force participants will be engaged in informal care work for elderly relatives. Although men and women are engaged in informal care work to differing extents, few studies have examined male/female differences in the impact of informal caregiving on work outcomes, how gendered labor market roles impact these differences, and if these differences have narrowed or widened over time. The purpose of this study was to address these research gaps using large, representative samples of the Canadian labor market over a 19-year period. We observed the proportion of respondents who made a permanent change in employment (left the labor market or were working part-time due to informal care work) had increased over the study period, although this was still less than 0.2% of employed labor force participants aged 40 and older. Similarly, the proportion of the labor market who had missed work in the last week to provide informal care increased over the study period. Although the trends in increases over time were similar for permanently leaving the labor market, and working part-time to care for elderly relatives, we observed a difference in the time trend for temporary absences from work, with a steeper year over year increase between 1997 and 2005 (OR for each year change = 1.12, 95% CI 1.09–1.15), compared to 2006 to 2015 (OR for each year change = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.05).

Between the period 2005 to 2015, women were approximately twice as likely to miss work compared to men, with these differences between men and women remaining relatively stable between 2005 and 2015. Among individuals who missed work, women took marginally more time off, compared to men. Although adjustment for gendered differences in labor market participation among men and women attenuated these estimates to varying extents, women were still more likely than men to have each outcome, even when these factors were taken into account. Taken together, in the most recent time period (2015) almost 12,000 Canadians have permanently changed their employment due to informal care work, and just less than 10,000 other Canadians took time away from work each week due to informal care work. It was estimated that just more than 8.5 million hr are lost from paid employment annually in 2015 due to informal care work, with approximately two thirds of these hours being among female labor force participants, despite their weaker attachment to the labor market in general.

### Reconciling paid work and informal caregiving among older adults: implications for work interference with family [^2c0eec3b]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

The non-significant interaction effect between IVF work status preference and time off suggests that work–family balance involves a complex interplay of various factors. Although our findings suggest that time off may be beneficial for involuntary part-time caregivers, it might not have the same benefits for involuntary full-time caregivers. The greater work demands, and potential lack of control experienced by involuntary full-time caregivers, may make time off less effective in reducing WIF. Future research could investigate the specific challenges and needs of involuntary full-time caregivers and explore additional factors that could contribute to their work–family balance.

Further examination of the data reveals that more females experienced WIF compared with males. This finding is consistent with previous research showing that women often bear a higher burden of caregiving responsibilities, which can lead to increased WIF. Moreover, the significant effect of ELSI on WIF implies that economic factors associated with one's life, such as financial stability and job security, may play a crucial role in determining the level of work–family conflict experienced by older adult caregivers. Those with higher ELSI scores may have greater financial resources and support, which could help them better manage work and caregiving responsibilities, potentially reducing WIF.

The nonsignificant interaction effects for flexible schedule, flexible place, and flexibility in number of hours worked suggest that these arrangements may not significantly address WIF among older adult caregivers. Although flexible work arrangements are often considered potential resources for work–life balance, their effectiveness in reducing WIF might vary for different individuals and situations. The study findings align with previous research reporting inconsistent associations between flexible work arrangements and WIF. It is crucial to recognize that work–family balance is multifaceted, influenced by various factors, including the nature of caregiving responsibilities, work demands, and organizational support.

To better support older adult caregivers, a comprehensive approach that considers multiple dimensions, including policies, resources, and individual needs, is essential. Tailored interventions and a supportive work culture can contribute to a more effective work–family balance for caregivers. Social policies must continue to pursue attempts to improve the fit between people and their jobs. For instance, designing comprehensive policies to combat precarious work will reduce social inequalities that may lead to mismatches between an individual's preference and their present work. Further research can explore specific caregiver populations' needs and challenges to guide targeted support measures.

### Defining sex-and age-specific initial stay times for continuous heavy-intensity work in hot environments before heat-mitigation controls are implemented-part B [^3a618586]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

We provide the first estimates of the duration of safe work that can be performed before the implementation of industry‐guided work‐rest allocations during heavy‐intensity simulated work in very warm to hot environmental conditions. We propose these preliminary estimates for use in conjunction with work‐rest allocations to optimize worker productivity without compromising safety. The utility of these work estimates becomes apparent when considering the divergent safe work times, dependent on age, sex, and the environment that work is being undertaken within. The information presented in this document is intended to serve as a guidance tool to promote informed decision making and should not replace the clinical assessment or advice of an on‐site occupational health specialist. Users should always verify information with appropriate authorities and seek professional advice for specific situations.

### Gendered work-family trajectories and depression at older age [^f2322633]. Aging & Mental Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives: The paper identifies types of work-family trajectories of men and women and investigates their links with depression at older age. Method: We use data from the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study, with retrospective information on employment histories and parenthood between age 20 and 50 (1482 men and 1537 women, born between 1925 and 1955). We apply sequence analysis and group trajectories into six clusters for each gender. We test their association with two alternative measures of depression: self-reported depressive symptoms and intake of antidepressant medication. Multivariate models exclude participants with early life depression and adjust for age, marital status, education, and income. Results: We find clear differences of work-family trajectories between men and women, where women's trajectories are generally more diverse, and include family leaves and returns into full or part-time work. For men, work-family trajectories are neither related to depressive symptoms nor to medication intake. In contrast, women who returned into full-time work after family leave show more depression than those who return part-time, both in terms of depressive symptoms and intake of antidepressant medication. Conclusion: Our findings show gender differences in terms of work-family trajectories and their health-related consequences. In particular, findings suggest that mothers who return to full-time work are a vulnerable group for depression at older age and should be the focus of further research attention.

Combining the data from the 1988 and 1993 cohorts in general practice shows that principal status was attained by 99% of full time working men with children and by 100% of full time working women with children, by 90% of part time working men with children and 80% of part time working women with children, and by 87% of men with no children and 89% of part time working women with no children (table 3). Combining the data from the 1988 and 1993 cohorts in hospital practice shows that consultant status was attained by 76% of full time working men with children and 77% of full time working women with children, by 58% of part time working men with children and 52% of part time working women with children, and by 39% of part time working men with no children and 37% of part time working women with no children (table 3). These findings show that a group of doctors, both men and women, exists who have not always worked full time and who have not achieved consultant status for reasons other than looking after their children.

### Part-time pediatric radiology: the realities and perceptions of part-time employment in the academic setting [^18e05da3]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study is to evaluate the perceptions held by full- and part-time academic pediatric radiologists with regard to the value of part-time radiologists, as well as the value placed on the work of part-time colleagues by their departments and institutions.

Materials and Methods

Two online surveys were distributed to full- and part-time pediatric radiologists via the Society for Pediatric Radiology e-mail list serve. Survey questions evaluated demographic data of both full- and part-time radiologists, as well as the perceptions each group has of part-time employment.

Results

Part-time radiologists reported significantly greater work-life balance than did their full-time counterparts and were less likely to report job dissatisfaction. Full- and part-time faculty have comparable levels of perceived departmental contributions. Part-time faculty were more likely to be younger women, early in their careers, and older men nearing retirement.

Conclusion

Part-time employment provides perceived benefits of increased work-life balance and job satisfaction and is viewed favorably by both full- and part-time radiologists in academic settings.

### The attitude and perceptions of work-life balance: a comparison among women surgeons in Japan, USA, and Hong Kong China [^5ed1aa53]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of the present study was to explore how women surgeons manage their work-life balance in three environmental and cultural settings.

Method

Members of the Japan Association of Women Surgeons (JAWS), the United States of America (US) based Association of Women Surgeons (AWS), and the Women's Chapter of the College of Surgeons of Hong Kong (WCHK) were surveyed.

Results

Among 822 women surgeons contacted, 252 responded (response rate 31.8%; 55.5% JAWS, 28.2% AWS, and 25.3% WCHK). Japanese women surgeons think that work is the number one priority, whereas US and Hong Kong China (HK) respondents think the number one priority is home life. Work satisfaction level was generally high among women surgeons in all countries; however, 19% of US surgeons are somewhat dissatisfied with their work and 76.1% think that men are treated more favorably than women at work. Whereas 51.6% of Japanese women surgeons think that men are treated more favorably than women at home, at the same time they placed more importance on the role of women in the family. More than half of Japanese women surgeons are "uncertain" about their career path in the future, whereas 55.2/87.1% of US/HK respondents are optimistic. All surgeons recommended expanding support for child rearing or nursing care during work hours, promoting a flexible work schedule and changing some of the older conventional ideas about gender role.

Conclusions

It is essential to address women surgeons' concerns to enable them to have a clearer vision and a challenging career, and to be more certain about their personal and professional goals.

### Reconciling paid work and informal caregiving among older adults: implications for work interference with family [^dfda8553]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Literature Review

Work–Family Conflict

Work–family conflict is a common experience for many individuals, resulting from the inter-role the conflict of between the energy, time and behavioral demands of work and family roles, making it difficult to complete or meet demands in both roles. Conceptually, conflict between work and family is bi-directional. The two established directions of work–family conflict are family interference with work (FIW) and work interference with family (WIF;). WIF and FIW are two related but distinct constructs, justifying separate examinations. Extensive research consistently shows that WIF occurs more frequently than FIW. This supports the domain specificity hypothesis, indicating that work-related factors are closely linked to WIF rather than FIW. Thus, the present study will focus on studying work interference with family (WIF).

Work interference with family is associated with a range of negative health outcomes including stress, anxiety, and depression and is also linked to low levels of job satisfaction. In particular, informal caregivers who combine work and care may experience greater work–family conflict when satisfying the demands of each role becomes more challenging. To reduce work interference with family, researchers have explored various organizational practices, including flexible work arrangements and work–family policies.

Job demands, such as long work hours and high levels of job responsibilities, have been identified as important determinants of work interference with family. However, the relationship between employment status (i.e. full-time vs part-time) and work interference with family is complex and inconsistent. Some studies suggest that working part-time may reduce work interference with family by allowing individuals to balance work and family responsibilities. Other studies have reported no effect on part-time employment.

The inconsistencies in the literature may be due in part to differences in employee preferences for working full-time or part-time. The current study distinguishes between regular part-time and involuntary part-time workers who want to work full-time, as well as regular full-time workers and workers who want to work part-time. By taking into account employee preferences, this study aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between work hours and WIF.

### Professional practice guidelines for integrating the role of work and career into psychological practice [^dc2368d3]. APA (2017). Medium credibility.

Work and career in professional psychology — psychologists are encouraged to help clients approach career decision-making from within the clients' own cultural contexts, and early research focused on how gender shapes work decisions. Gender influences the interests that individuals express, the careers men and women consider, and the outcomes of those decisions, and the intersection of gender and parental status may contribute to increased difficulty among women returning to the workforce after a leave. Occupational representation includes engineering occupations continuing to be grossly underrepresented by women and speech and language pathologists continuing to be underrepresented by men. More recent work identifies additional contextual factors in work decisions, including social class, family, relationships, disability, and geographic location, and scholars have urged examining multiple dimensions (e.g., race and gender and social class) of context. Research in vocational psychology has increasingly emphasized contextual factors in work-related decision-making, attainment, achievement, maintenance, and transitions, and together these findings provide significant information about the potential for contextual factors to serve as both barriers to and facilitators of vocational development.

### Do different job demands interact as predictors of long-term sickness absence? A register-based follow-up on 55 467 Danish workers [^39808c90]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

These limitations, however, must be balanced against several strengths. This study adds to the literature by providing prospective evidence from a large study population (> 55 000 participants) on the potential interaction between job demands in predicting adverse health-related outcomes. Moreover, the outcome is measured using a register-based measure, which reduces reporting biases and the loss of participants during follow-up. Therefore, this study design allows for inference on the direction of the observed associations and reduces potential biases associated with common methods variance.

### Career progression and destinations, comparing men and women in the NHS: postal questionnaire surveys [^de2b784a]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To study the career progression of NHS doctors, comparing men and women.

Design

Postal questionnaire surveys. Participants and setting Graduates of 1977, 1988, and 1993 from all UK medical schools.

Results

The response rate was 68% (7012/10 344). Within general practice, 97% (1208/1243) of men, 99% (264/267) of women who had always worked full time throughout their career, and 87% (1083/1248) of all women were principals. Median times from qualification to principal status were 5.8 (95% confidence interval 5.6 to 6.0) years for men, 5.6 (5.4 to 5.8) years for women who had worked full time during training, and 6.8 (6.5 to 7.0) years for all women. Of the 1977 and 1988 graduates in hospital practice, 96% (1293/1347) of men were consultants, compared with 92% (276/299) of women who had always worked full time throughout their career and 67% (277/416) of women who had not. Median time to first consultant post was 11.7 (11.5 to 11.9) years for men, 11.3 (11.0 to 11.6) years for women who worked full time during training, and 12.3 (12.0 to 12.6) years for all women. Women who had not always worked full time throughout their career were over-represented in general practice and under-represented in most hospital specialties, substantially so in the surgical specialties and anaesthetics. Women who had always worked full time were under-represented not only in the surgical specialties but also in general practice.

Conclusions

Women not progressing as far and as fast as men was, generally, a reflection of not having always worked full time rather than their sex. The findings suggest that women do not generally encounter direct discrimination; however, the possibility that indirect discrimination, such as lack of opportunities for part time work, has influenced choice of specialty cannot be ruled out.

### A 15-year prospective study of shift work and disability pension [^53cb76a0]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

This study is based on a merger of work environment exposure information from the Danish Work Environment Cohort Study (DWECS) and information about granted disability pension from a national register of social transfer payment: the DREAM register.DWECShas a split panel design: in 1990 a simple random sample consisting of people aged 18–59 years on 1 October 1990 was drawn from the Danish centralised civil register. In 1995 and 2000 additional panels were drawn to adjust for immigration and for the ageing of the 1990 panel. The size of each panel reflects the proportion of the relevant groups of the total population.

In each wave, people who had been employees within two months prior to the interview were asked questions regarding work environment and health behaviour. The 1990 sample had 8664 participants (response rate 90%); 5701 were employees. The combined 1995 sample had 8583 participants (response rate 80%); 5369 were employees. The combined 2000 sample had 8583 participants (response rate 75%); 5366 were employees. In total 8475 employees — 4288 men and 4187 women — were included in this study.

### Who is engaged at work? a large-scale study in 30 European countries [^5f5da78c]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim was to investigate differences in the levels of work engagement across demographic and work- and organization-related factors, and their relative importance for work engagement.

Methods

The study was on the basis of a sample of 17,498 male and 17,897 female employees from the sixth European Working Conditions Survey collected in 2015. Linear regression models and dominance analysis were used.

Results

Several significant differences were observed between the levels of work engagement in different demographic and work- and organization-related groups. Employees working in human service occupations reported higher levels of work engagement than employees in other industries. Relatively, occupational group (68%) and industry (17%) contributed most to work engagement.

Conclusion

It is important to focus on enhancing work engagement, particularly among less educated employees, among those with nonpermanent contracts, and in certain occupations.

### Inequalities in retirement life span in the United States [^7933bffd]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

The association between education and retirement may vary over time. During the 2008–2009 Great Recession, the probability of being retired at age 65 increased for both men and women, as older workers were pushed out of the labor market, but the impact of the recession varied greatly by education, affecting those with less education disproportionately.

Labor force reentry after initial retirement is another key factor shaping retirement life span. Reentry is a common phenomenon in the United States.showed that work history predicted one's propensity to return to work. A 65-year-old man who was still active in the labor market was unlikely to reenter after the initial exit from the labor force, whereas a man who was inactive at age 65 was much more likely to reenter after his initial retirement. As gender and education are associated with work history, they may influence the probability of reentering the labor force. In general, women were less likely to engage in postretirement work than men.showed that, among all the retirees, lower-educated men were more likely to take part-time jobs after initial retirement than higher-educated men.

### Pregnant at work: time for prenatal care providers to act [^a1f114cd]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Fifty years ago, when a woman became pregnant, she was expected to stop working. Today, however, most women who work are the primary, sole, or co-breadwinner for their families, and their earnings during pregnancy are often essential to their families' economic well-being. Medical data about working during pregnancy are sparse but generally show that both low-risk and high-risk women can tolerate work-related duties well, although some work accommodations (eg, providing a chair for sitting, allowing snacks, or modifying the work schedule) may be necessary. However, some employers refuse to accommodate pregnant women who need adjustments. This can result in a woman being forced to make the choice between working without accommodations and losing her income and health insurance or even her job. Prenatal care providers can play an important role by implementing changes in their own practice, shaping public policy, and conducting research to increase protections for pregnant women and to ensure that they receive medically recommended accommodations while continuing to earn income for their growing families.

### Characteristics and outcomes for women physicians who work reduced hours [^a4c4b5b4]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To understand the characteristics of women physicians who work reduced hours in dual-earner couples and how such work schedules affect the quality of the marital role, parental role, and job role, as well as indicators of psychological distress, burnout, career satisfaction, and life satisfaction.

Methods

Survey of a random sample of female physicians between 25 and 50 years of age, working within 25 miles of Boston, whose names were obtained from the Registry of Board Certification in Medicine in Massachusetts. Interviewers conducted a 60-minute face-to-face close-ended interview after a 20-minute mailed questionnaire had been completed.

Results

Fifty-one full-time physicians and 47 reduced-hours physicians completed the study, for a completion rate of 49.5%. There was no difference in age, number of years as a physician, mean household income, number of children, or presence of an infant in the home between reduced-hours and full-time physicians. Reduced-hours physicians, however, were more likely to be in a generalist specialty (40% vs. 12%, p = 0.001) and to spend a greater portion of their time in patient care (64.5% vs. 50.1%, p = 0.003) and less time in research (4.9% vs. 18.0%, p = 0.002) than full-time physicians. In addition, there was no difference between the two groups in the perception of work interfering with family life (1.8 vs. 1.7, p = 0.17; scale 1–7 with 7 high) or family life interfering with work (1.4 vs. 1.5, p = 0.62). Physicians who worked their preferred number of hours (25% of full-time and 57% of reduced-hours physicians), regardless of full-time (self-reported hours 35–90 hours per week) or reduced-hours (20–60 hours per week) status, reported better job role quality (r = 0.35, p = 0.001), schedule fit (r = 0.41, p ≤ 0.001), lower burnout (r = -0.22, p = 0.03), better marital role quality (r = 0.28, p = 0.006), and higher life satisfaction (r = 0.29, p = 0.005).

Conclusions

Women physicians who work their preferred number of hours achieve the best balance of work and family outcomes.

### Reconciling paid work and informal caregiving among older adults: implications for work interference with family [^92c6015a]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The aim of the study was to explore the association between work status preferences and WIF among older adult caregivers and to examine whether flexible work arrangements moderated this relationship.

The first hypothesis received partial support. Specifically, participants who were employed involuntarily full-time reported higher levels of WIF than those in other groups, including voluntary part-timers, voluntary full-timers, and involuntary part-timers. Additionally, those in involuntary part-time work reported more WIF than voluntary part-time caregivers.

WIF arises from the challenges of balancing demands between work and family roles. Previous research has found that employees who work more hours than they prefer are likely to experience high levels of WIF. This is particularly relevant for caregivers who are overemployed, as they must navigate the demands of both caregiving and work roles simultaneously.

Involuntary part-time workers, who would prefer to work more hours, also experienced higher levels of WIF when compared with voluntary part-timers. This desire for more work hours is often driven by financial necessity, as caregivers who work fewer hours than they prefer may experience financial difficulties. Alternatively, the preference for more work hours may reflect the need for an activity that can counterbalance the stresses of caregiving and provide a break from that role. Overall, our findings suggest associations between work mismatches and WIF, making it more challenging for individuals to fulfill their caregiving responsibilities.

Hypothesis 2 received partial support. Among the four types of flexible work arrangements, flexitime off was consistently and negatively associated with WIF, indicating that higher use of this arrangement was linked to lower levels of WIF for working caregivers. This finding aligns with the demands–resources approach to WIF, where individuals use FWAs as resources to address the demands of work. It is plausible that in our study, caregivers proactively planned and managed their caregiving responsibilities by utilizing flexitime off, leading to reduced WIF associated with balancing work and family roles.

### 12-h or 8-h shifts? It depends [^e9253504]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Since 12-h shifts were first implemented, the question has been asked - are 'twelves' better than 'eights'? People trying to answer this question invariably refer to the limited literature at their disposal, often piecemeal, small-scale studies comparing 8-h versus 12-h shifts in isolated groups of workers in which many other factors vary concurrently. The narrow perspective and sometimes 'vested interests' of the organizations, researchers, publishers and individual workers can influence both the choice of measures, the analysis of results and their interpretation. The current review suggests that it is not sufficient to evaluate a shift pattern on the basis of a single dimension of a working time arrangement, such as shift length. Numerous factors associated with the work practice influence the outcome of a shift pattern including start times, pattern of shifts and amount of overtime. Moreover, the type of work being done and the demographics or characteristics of the workforce are additional mediating factors. Finally, and perhaps most critically, the relative importance assigned to different outcome measures is an important consideration. There are situations where total sleep time might increase following a change to 12-h shifts, whereas domestic life for some workers may deteriorate. Additionally, safety measures may show improvements on 8-h shifts but physical or psychological health outcomes may be worse. The myriad combinations of work pattern, work task, worker and outcome measure under investigation mean that the best way to take account of these complexities may be to use an approach that manages 'system' risk. Given the non-linearities in the system, and the fact that current approaches either ignore, or privilege a subset of outcomes, it is perhaps more appropriate to conceptualize working time arrangements as an 'ecosystem' and to address the risks in the overall system as opposed to a single dimension such as shift length.

### Reconciling paid work and informal caregiving among older adults: implications for work interference with family [^cf4cf12d]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

In the context of work, preferences can represent an individual's desired conditions or outcomes related to their work. Discrepancy theory suggests that positive work outcomes arise when there are fewer mismatches between an employee's desires and the job requirements, they are expected to fulfill. When workers' preferences are not met, it can create a sense of discrepancy or misalignment between their desired and actual work situation. This discrepancy can lead to additional psychological or emotional strain, which can be seen as a form of demand. This misalignment between preferences and actual work conditions can create additional stress and dissatisfaction among workers and may even increase their perceived strain as they try to cope with managing those work demands and providing care.

Similar to the work of, we differentiate between two types of work demands: time-based demands and strain-based demands. Time-based demands reflect the notion that time is a limited resource, and hence time spent on work reduces the amount of time available for family-related activities. For instance, an involuntary full-time work schedule could be a time-based demand. Strain-based demands, on the other hand, may produce negative experiences, such as feelings of job insecurity that can result from working fewer hours than desired (involuntary part-time work). This situation may threaten the economic well-being and stability of the family for some individuals. There is some evidence to suggest that using work resources such as flexible work arrangements may potentially alleviate the negative impact of work demands on well-being. For instance, employees with a preference for fewer working hours may experience higher levels of work interference with family when they are unable to meet their preferred work status. However, if they have access to FWAs such as paid time off or flexible scheduling, they may be able to adjust their work arrangements to better accommodate their family responsibilities. This, in turn, can reduce work interference with family, as they have greater control over managing their time and balancing their work and personal life.

### Diagnostic radiologists in 2000: basic characteristics, practices, and issues related to the radiologist shortage [^00e617af]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to describe radiologists and their practices, emphasizing trends in retirement age, practice size, and perceived workload burden.

Materials and Methods

In spring 2000, we surveyed 3,027 randomly selected radiologists by mail, of whom 74% responded. We weighted responses to make answers representative of all radiologists and compared findings with a similar 1995 survey.

Results

Thirty percent of radiologists age 65–69 were working full-time; 21% were working part-time. Overall, the full-time equivalency of radiologists age 55–74 was 67.6%, not significantly different from 1995. If current patterns of retirement and production of graduates continue, the workforce will grow at a rate of approximately 2% annually. Fifty-one percent of radiologists said that recognizing that income depends largely on work done, they had "much too much work" or "somewhat too much work"; 5% reported "somewhat too little work" or "much too little work". Six percent of posttraining professionally active radiologists were in solo practice, down from 8% in 1995; 15% were in two-to-four-radiologists groups, down from 17%; and 38% were in groups of 15 or more, up from 30%. Sixteen percent of posttraining professionally active radiologists were women. The percentage was highest (29%) for those younger than age 35 but was lower (22%) among trainees.

Conclusion

The findings of excess work are further evidence of a radiologist shortage. However, contrary to surveys of groups that are hiring, we found minimal evidence of earlier retirement. Nonetheless, workload currently is increasing faster than the workforce is likely to grow, so the shortage will probably intensify. The typical number of radiologists in a practice is increasing, but slowly.

### Finding success at work and at home [^d62bb126]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

The authors note that unconventional solutions and support mechanisms are needed to help women in the workforce. We wanted to share some of our experiences as a dual-physician couple with children. We have found that balance of family life and work life requires an intricate game of tag team. One of us goes into work early and comes home early, whereas the other goes in later and stays later. One of us prepares dinner, while the other plays with our son. We switch roles when it comes time for the dishes. We support each other when we need to work from home, at the same time trying to draw lessons to teach our son about helping others through our work.

Another solution to our household duties draws from the economic principle of comparative advantage theory. The essence of this principle is that even if a country is capable of producing all the goods that it needs, factoring all the opportunity costs involved, it is still beneficial to seek trade from others. The same applies at home: we have found that we should not try to accomplish all household tasks, even if we are physically capable of completing them. We buy home-cooked meals prepared by members of our community, so we can finish our work and still have time to spend as a family. We routinely have our home cleaned. On weekends, we take help from grandparents to care for our son. These services became more challenging to continue during the pandemic, and we are fortunate that they have now become more available.

As a dual-physician couple, we face a daily balancing act of work and family obligations. We stay grounded in our busy lives through frequent reflection on the purpose behind our lives at work and at home. We were drawn to pursue careers in medicine not to simply prescribe medications, perform interventions, or amass a long list of publications: we want our work to improve the health and well-being of those we care for. As Clayton Christensen writes, "Don't worry about the level of individual prominence you have achieved; worry about the individuals you have helped become better people… Think about the metric by which your life will be judged, and make a resolution to live every day so that in the end, your life will be judged a success."As physicians, we are privileged to guide our families, our patients, and all others around us to find happiness and health. This is the metric of success that we aspire to attain in everything that we do.

### Shift work and occupational medicine: an overview [^a0c0d01f]. Occupational Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In modern society, more and more people work during 'non-standard' working hours, including shift and night work, which are recognized risk factors for health, safety and social well-being. Suitable preventive and protective measures are required to mitigate the adverse effects and ensure that the worker can cope satisfactorily. These are based mainly on the organization of shift schedules according to ergonomic criteria and on specific medical surveillance. Occupational medicine has to consider very carefully the several factors (psycho-physiological, pathological and social) that can influence tolerance and/or maladaptation.

### Motivational drivers of temporal dynamics in postretirement work [^725617aa]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

While a growing body of literature highlights the diversity of pathways to retirement as well as the characteristics of those who engage in postretirement work, much less is known about the temporal dynamics of this process. In this study, we examined the extent to which retirees increase, decrease, and exit their work engagement in retirement. The results showed substantial variability in the level of engagement, but also in how it changes over time. Although the majority gradually reduced their work hours in retirement, a substantial proportion of the retirees increased their level of engagement over time, challenging the assumption of a one-directional gradual shift toward complete labor force withdrawal. We further investigated if the motives for taking up postretirement work account for individual variability in this process. Our findings suggest that financial, social, personal, and organizational (demand-driven) motives differ in how they relate to changes in work participation following retirement.

The present article adds to previous knowledge on postretirement employment by showing that work-related motivational drivers predict not only the preference for and participation in postretirement work, but also the extent to which retirees change their level of engagement over time. The finding that different motives have differential implications for changes in work extent improve our understanding of postretirement work in several important ways. First, an increase in work engagement in retirement was more likely among those who work for financial reasons, but this association was not shown when accounting for factors that may restrict agency in the opportunity for postretirement work. This finding might imply that among these workers part-time work does not necessarily constitute the preferred level of work engagement, and that retirees with poor pension income have restricted agency in the number of working hours. This fits well with research carried out in the United States suggesting that one in five older part-time workers would prefer to work more hours and can be categorized as involuntary part-time workers. The decrease in effect size when accounting for the degree of voluntariness over the retirement transition further suggests that the financial motive may be more relevant for those who retired involuntarily.

### Male / female differences in the impact of caring for elderly relatives on labor market attachment and hours of work: 1997–2015 [^045ef5a9]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Using representative samples of the Canadian labor market (N = 5,871,850), this study examined male/female differences in the impact of informal care on labor market attachment, and the extent to which differences in labor market participation and employment relationships explained these differences over a 19-year period.

Methods

We examined four outcomes related to labor market impacts associated with caring for elderly relatives: leaving the labor market, working part-time, taking time off work in the previous week, and the amount of time taken off from work. Regression models examined differences between men and women, and the extent to which gendered labor market roles accounted for these differences.

Results

We observed an increase in all labor market outcomes over the study period. Women were more likely than men to experience each outcome. Adjusting for labor market role variables did not change these estimates appreciably. After adjustment for differences in labor market roles women were 73% more likely to leave the labor market, more than 5 times more likely to work part-time, and twice as likely to take time off in the last week due to informal care. Further, for temporary absences to provide care, women took an average of 160 min more per week than men.

Discussion

Taken together, these results suggest an increasing impact of informal care on labor market participation in Canada between 1997 and 2005, and it remains gendered.

### Long working hours and alcohol use: systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies and unpublished individual participant data [^f6c49590]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

In line with previous evidence suggesting ≥ 55 hours of work a week to be harmful for health, and the European Union Directive of a recommended limit of 48 hours a week, we used the following categories of hours worked: < 35, 35–40 (reference), 41–48, 49–54, and ≥ 55 hours. In the Helsinki Health Study, weekly working hours were categorised as < 30, 30–40, 41–50, and > 50 in the response format. In our analyses, we used the > 50 working hours group in the Helsinki Health Study to represent the ≥ 55 hours group and the 30–40 hours group as the reference group.

In all individual participant data studies, information on alcohol use was based on survey responses. We defined risky alcohol use by standard categorisations. One drink was considered equivalent to one unit or one glass of alcoholic drink. Participants were classified as follows: non-use or moderate use (up to 14 drinks/week for women and up to 21 drinks/week for men), and risky alcohol use (> 14 drinks/week and > 21 drinks/week, respectively). According to public health guidelines, these limits define risky alcohol use among men and women in many countries. In the German Socioeconomic Panel Survey cohort, participants were asked how often they drank beer, wine, spirits, and mixed drinks (0 = never, 1 = seldom, 2 = once in a while, 3 = regularly); and risky alcohol use was defined as score of 7 or more on the summed score of these four questions. In the US National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort, risky alcohol use was defined as "binge drinking" — that is, having consumed six or more alcohol units in one evening at least twice during the past month. In the prospective cohort analyses of new onset risky alcohol use, we excluded cases of risky alcohol use at baseline.

Statistical analysis

We used a two stage meta-analysiswith study specific estimates obtained from published studies with aggregate data and studies with unpublished individual participant data at the first stage. The second stage was an analysis that pooled all the study specific estimates.

Other covariates

We included several other variables that may be differentially associated with male/female (our primary independent variable), and also might be associated with labor market changes due to informal care. These measures included the year and month of the survey, the age of the respondent, if they had dependent children, marital status and if their spouse worked, if they lived in a rural or urban location, and their province of residence.

Analyses

Initial descriptive analyses examined the percentage and number of respondents who had changed their labor market attachment due to caring for elderly relatives, and the percent and number of the employed labor force who had missed some time off work in the past week due to caring for elderly relatives. These estimates were provided by survey year, and where sample size permitted estimates were provided separately for men and women. Descriptive analyses also estimated the total number of hours lost due to temporary part and full absences from work in the LFS week, by survey year, separately for men and women.

To examine male/female differences in labor market disruption due to care work, and the extent to which these differences can be explained by the gendered nature of labor market roles, we ran a series of nested regression models both with and without these gendered covariates. The first model included an adjustment for age, marital status and if the respondent's spouse was working, presence of children, urban/rural living location, and the province of residence. A second model additionally included variables related to gendered labor market participation. For the outcome of permanently leaving the labor market these included occupational segregation and the hours of work (part-time vs full-time). For the outcome of working part-time as the result of caring this included occupational segregation, with additional adjustment for job tenure, membership in a union or collective bargaining agreement and workplace size. Work hours were not included in this model, as this measure is captured by the outcome. For the models examining temporary absence and the length of absences once taken, gendered labor market factors included hours of work, main income earner status and occupational segregation, with additional adjustment for the job tenure, union/Collective Bargaining Agreement membership, and workplace size.

### Reconciling paid work and informal caregiving among older adults: implications for work interference with family [^4f84b481]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

There is evidence that older adults who take up caregiving have work preferences that do not match their actual work status and that those in involuntary part-time work (preference for full-time work) are more likely to take up care. When preferences do not match actual work status/work hours individuals may experience work status incongruence. There is reason to believe that work status incongruence may lead to work interference with family (WIF). Studies have shown that individuals who experience a state of fit between desired and actual work hours have less conflict between work and life, although work hour mismatches can constrain the ability to reconcile family and work responsibilities. For instance, found that satisfaction with work–life balance decreased if employees worked more than their preferred hours, and misfits in preferred work schedules led to work-to-family conflict. Thus, for some working carers, WIF may arise not only from balancing work and family responsibilities but also from not having their work status preferences met.

Flexible work arrangements (FWAs) have been proposed as a way to help individuals manage work and family care commitments and have been a focus of government policy in recent years. However, empirical studies have produced inconsistent results when examining the relationships between FWAs and work interference with family with small effect sizes and associations dependent on the nature of the work–family conflict and the type of flexible work arrangements. Work status preferences may also play a role in this relationship. For example, workers who are in involuntary full-time work (prefer reduced hours) may benefit, in terms of WIF, from enhanced control over their start and finish times, or by having the option of compressing their work week. Similarly, for those who are in involuntary part-time work (prefer more hours), FWAs may offer opportunities for scheduling non-work activities such as caregiving responsibilities in order to reduce WIF.

### Preventing needless work disability by helping people stay employed [^20f30945]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

ACOEM guideline — stay-at-work/return-to-work (SAW/RTW) process — reports that approximately 10% of workers with health problems incur significant absences leading to prolonged or permanent withdrawal from the workforce and that the estimated total annual cost of disability benefits exceeds $100 billion, while stating that the fundamental reason for most medically-related lost workdays and lost jobs is not medical necessity but nonmedical decision making in the SAW/RTW process. The process determines whether a worker stays at work despite a medical condition or whether, when, and how a worker returns to work during or after recovery, and proceeds through steps: it is triggered when a medical condition or precipitating event raises whether the worker can or should do the usual job today; the worker's current ability is assessed on three important dimensions — functional capacity, functional impairments or limitations, and medically based restrictions; next, the demands of the usual job and/or available temporary alternative tasks are compared with current functional capacity, limitations, and medical restrictions; and finally, the actions necessary to resolve the situation and return the worker to work are identified.

### Work disability prevention and management [^9f95a140]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Work disability epidemiology and risk factors — disability is linked to excess mortality and reduced life expectancy: mortality risks for men are approximately 37% higher than for women, disability is associated with an approximately 50% increased risk of mortality, and a Netherlands-based study estimated a 10-year shorter lifespan with only 6 years explained by lifestyle, sociodemographic factors, and major chronic diseases. Risk for chronic/permanent disability is at least partially a function of time away from work, with only 50%, 20%, and 10% of workers still out of work at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after illness or injury, respectively, ever returning to their previous employment. U.S. risk factors noted include increasing age, female gender/sex, occupation (also, military service), Black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino race and ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and select state residence (eg, AL, AR, LA, ME, MS, NM, OK, OR, TN, WY); other risk factors for never returning to work include involvement in litigation, inadequate skills for competitive employment, and living in an economically poor area.

Years from qualifying as doctor to first appointment as NHS general practice principal or hospital consultant split by working pattern during training. Values are median; fastest quarter (number)

NC = median could not be calculated because 50% had not yet become consultants.

*All three cohorts for general practice principals; 1977 and 1988 cohorts for consultants.

†Significant differences (at 0.01 level, based on log rank tests) between men and women (for all doctors, for doctors who always worked full time during training, and for doctors who did not always work full time during training).

‡Significant differences between doctors who always worked full time during training and those who did not always work full time during training (for men and for women).

§Significant differences between women who always worked full time during training and all men.

We found few differences of any substance in the time to senior appointment when we compared women with and without children (table 5). In the 1993 cohort, many of whom had not reached consultant status, women without children in the fastest quarter achieved consultant status fractionally more quickly than did those with children (table 5). Considering the full timers during training (table 5, fig 4), both in general practice and in hospital practice (more significantly in the first), those with children progressed more quickly than those without children. The only significant differences between male and female full timers were in the progression to principal status for the 1988 cohort with no children and for the 1993 cohort with children.

### Workers' compensation elements in different jurisdictions in the United States [^6397d980]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Modified duty and return-to-work — It is well known that the longer an employee remains out of work, the likelihood that they will not return to work diminishes precipitously; therefore, a return-to-work specialist is a valuable option, a cooperative approach to accommodating a wide variety of work restrictions will have a better outcome, and the move toward providing alternative jobs or light duty is an important management strategy.

### Still too far to walk: literature review of the determinants of delivery service use [^cc1f1319]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

3. Economic accessibility

Economic accessibility refers to the relation between financial capability of the family and costs of a facility delivery including transportation costs. While directly affecting whether a woman can actually reach a facility for delivery (second delay), the anticipation of high costs will affect whether a decision for a facility delivery is made in the first place (first delay). We grouped mother's and husband's occupation and other measures of ability to pay in this group, including community-level poverty, although some obviously also measure other aspects.

16) Mother's occupation

Women who are working and earning money may be able to save and decide to spend it on a facility delivery. However, in many settings women either do not earn money for their work or do not control what they earn. An increased range of movement and better access to information are suggested as reasons why formal work may promote women's use of health facilities for childbirth. On the other hand, working may be poverty-induced and indicate resource constraints, which would make working women less likely to use health services for delivery.

Variables associated with occupation may include education, wealth and place of residence and these may act as confounders.

Relatively few studies include women's occupation. Several find that farming women are less likely to have skilled attendance at delivery than women in other occupations. This may stem from limited financial resources and health services in rural areas – wealth and place of residence were not always adjusted for. A number of studies do not find any effect of maternal working status or occupation, while others find that formally employed women are more likely to use delivery services. In two Southern Indian states and in Nepal, however, working women are less likely to use services than non-working women, which may signify that working is poverty-induced in that context. Another study in Bangladesh found an interesting interaction effect: There is a large differential in delivery service use favouring gainfully employed women among those living more than 1 hour travel time from a health centre, while employment status does not play a role among those within 1 hour travel time. This could be due to employed women being better equipped to overcome access barriers including transportation costs or female mobility limitations.
