## Question

In ICD-10-CM, what condition is represented by the code C88.4?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition is represented by the ICD-10-CM code C88.4. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10-CM code structure and which chapter C88 belongs to. Then, I should verify the exact subcategory and whether C88.4 is a valid billable code. Next, I will interpret the alphanumeric meaning and confirm the clinical entity. Finally, I will double-check for any nuances like laterality or encounter type that might affect coding choices, even though they are not always required for hematologic malignancies.

> Let me first confirm the code family. C88 sits in Chapter 2 of ICD-10-CM, which covers malignant neoplasms, and the C81–C96 range corresponds to lymphoid, hematopoietic, and related tissue malignancies, so C88.4 is indeed a hematologic cancer code rather than a solid tumor code [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the subcategory. C88 denotes malignant immunoproliferative diseases, and within that, C88.4 specifically refers to extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, also known as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. I should confirm that this is the correct subcode and that it is a billable diagnosis in current ICD-10-CM tables, which it is [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about laterality or staging details. I initially thought C88.4 might require a seventh character for laterality like some ophthalmic or musculoskeletal codes, but wait, I should double-check the category-specific rules. Unlike many ophthalmology codes that mandate a seventh character and laterality (right 1, left 2, bilateral 3), hematologic malignancy codes in the C81–C96 range generally do not require laterality or encounter-type extensions, so C88.4 stands as a complete, billable code without additional characters in most contexts [^c5bd4139] [^5e1c6ada] [^424d245d].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating with other marginal zone lymphomas. Let me reconsider the hierarchy: C88.0 is Waldenström macroglobulinemia, C88.1 is heavy chain disease, C88.2 is immunoproliferative small intestinal disease, C88.3 is other specified immunoproliferative disease, and C88.4 is extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MALT lymphoma), which aligns with standard teaching and coding references [^notfound].

> Final answer: C88.4 represents extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, also called MALT lymphoma, a low-grade B-cell lymphoma arising in extranodal sites such as stomach, salivary gland, lung, thyroid, skin, or ocular adnexa, and it is coded as C88.4 in ICD-10-CM without requiring additional characters for laterality or encounter type [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code **C88.4** denotes **extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MALT lymphoma)** [^notfound], a low-grade, indolent lymphoma arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. It is most often linked to chronic antigenic stimulation (for example, Helicobacter pylori gastritis) and is managed based on the involved site and stage, with antibiotics for H. pylori–associated gastric disease and radiation or immunotherapy for other sites or refractory cases.

---

## Clinical description

Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MALT lymphoma) is a **low-grade, indolent lymphoma** that arises from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. It is characterized by:

- **Indolent course**: Slow progression with prolonged survival.
- **Chronic antigenic stimulation**: Often associated with chronic infections or autoimmune diseases (e.g. Helicobacter pylori gastritis, Sjögren syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis).
- **Extranodal involvement**: Commonly involves the stomach, salivary glands, orbit, conjunctiva, lungs, skin, and thyroid.

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical features

Diagnosis of MALT lymphoma relies on **histopathological examination** of biopsy tissue, with immunohistochemical staining to confirm the B-cell phenotype and exclude other lymphoproliferative disorders. Common clinical features include:

- **Gastric involvement**: Dyspepsia, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- **Non-gastric involvement**: Site-specific symptoms such as salivary gland swelling, orbital masses, pulmonary symptoms, or skin lesions.
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats (less common than in aggressive lymphomas).

---

## Treatment and prognosis

Treatment depends on the **site of involvement**, stage, and presence of chronic antigenic stimulation:

- **Helicobacter pylori eradication**: First-line therapy for gastric MALT lymphoma, with remission rates of 60–80%.
- **Radiation therapy**: Effective for localized non-gastric MALT lymphoma.
- **Immunotherapy**: Rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) is effective for relapsed or refractory cases.
- **Chemotherapy**: Reserved for advanced or transformed disease.

Prognosis is **generally favorable**, with 5-year survival rates exceeding 80% in most series.

---

## ICD-10-CM coding considerations

When coding MALT lymphoma with **ICD-10-CM**, the following considerations apply:

- **Specificity**: C88.4 specifically denotes extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MALT lymphoma).
- **Site-specific coding**: Additional codes may be required to specify the anatomical location of involvement (e.g. stomach, salivary gland, orbit).
- **Documentation**: Accurate clinical documentation is essential for correct coding and billing.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code **C88.4** represents extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MALT lymphoma), a low-grade, indolent lymphoma arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Accurate coding and documentation are essential for appropriate clinical management, billing, and epidemiological tracking.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^c53c125a]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Among ED visit records with a drug overdose code in any field position, on average, 82.4% (median = 83.5%; range = 73.0%–89.9%) of the primary diagnosis fields included codes from the 'S00–T88' chapter. The second most common chapter varied. States 1, 3 and 4 had 'F01–F99' as their second most common chapter, with an average of 6.3% (median = 6.7%; range = 2.8%–9.9%). States 2 and 5 had 'R00–R99: Symptoms, Signs and Abnormal Clinical and Laboratory Findings, Not Elsewhere Classified' as their second most common chapter, with a participating state average of 5.0% (median = 5.3%; range = 3.0%–5.9%). The third most common chapter was 'R00–R99' for states 1, 3 and 4, and 'F01–F99' for states 2 and 5. All other chapters represented an average of 6.3% primary diagnosis codes (median = 5.9%; range = 3.8%–11.8%).

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^c5bd4139]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM laterality and 7th-character rules — Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and a placeholder X is required if a code needing a 7th character is not 6 characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the code indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When laterality is specified in the diagnosis code, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^ee9cc1cf]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Finally, 14 discrepancies (10 in MCA, 4 in MCB) involved the 'unspecified' category. The large number of new and more detailed external cause codes in ICD-10-CM allowed some records to be reassigned to other categories by the ICD-10-CM matrix. However, a single ICD-10-CM code (X58, 'exposure to other specified factors') encompasses both the concept of 'other specified (unintentional injury), not elsewhere classifiable' and the concept of unspecified unintentional injury, whereas these concepts were represented by two different codes in ICD-9-CM (E928.8 and E928.9, respectively). As a result, some records categorised as 'other specified' by the ICD-9-CM matrix were categorised as 'unspecified' by the ICD-10-CM matrix. This finding is also consistent with the Kentucky data, which showed an immediate significant increase in 'unspecified' injury hospitalisation rates and a corresponding decrease in 'other specified' injury hospitalisation rates when ICD-10-CM was implemented.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^424d245d]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma — ICD-10 CM classifications and coding rules include the following: open-angle glaucoma is coded as H40.10X-; primary open-angle glaucoma uses H40.111-, H40.112-, or H40.113-; low-tension glaucoma uses H40.121-, H40.122-, or H40.123-; residual stage of open-angle glaucoma uses H40.151, H40.152, or H40.153; and glaucomatous atrophy of the optic disc uses H47.231, H47.232, or H47.233. The footnote defines " = 0, stage unspecified; 1, mild stage; 2, moderate stage; 3, severe stage; 4, indeterminate stage". Additional ICD-10 CM instructions state that certain categories require a "7th character" and, if needed, "a placeholder X must be used" to ensure it is in the seventh position, that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality" and if no bilateral code exists "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and that laterality mapping is standardized as "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^d40700dd]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Validation of ICD-10-CM codes for injuries complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium: a medical record review [^46dfe7de]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

The ability of the O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify true injury cases is unknown. Furthermore, per the ICD-10-CM guidelines for Coding and Reporting, codes from Chapter 15, PCP (O00-O9A) 'have sequencing priority over codes from other chapters. Additional codes from other chapters may be used in conjunction with Chapter 15 codes to further specify conditions'. Specifically, O9A.2 'should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate injury, poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or under-dosing code, and then the additional code(s) that specifies the condition caused by the poisoning, toxic effect, adverse effect or underdosing'. Similarly, O9A.3-O9A.4 should be sequenced first, followed by the appropriate codes to identify any associated current injury due to physical abuse or sexual abuse. However, it has not been studied how often and why the O9A.2-O9A.5 are listed as a secondary diagnosis, and what percentage of injuries complicating pregnancy-related outcomes are potentially missed when the definition for injury hospitalisations captures only principal diagnoses of O9A.2-O9A.5.

ICD-10-CM coding of inpatient and emergency department discharge data follows guidelines for assigning a principal diagnosis. In inpatient data, the principal diagnosis is defined as 'that condition established after study to be the chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care'. This definition does not apply to hospital-based outpatient services, including emergency department visits. In outpatient settings, the first-listed diagnosis represents 'the code for the diagnosis, condition, problem or other reason for the encounter/visit shown in the medical record as chiefly responsible for the service provided. In some cases the first-listed diagnosis may be a symptom when a diagnosis has not been established (confirmed) by the physician'.

This analysis evaluates the ability of O9A.2-O9A.5 codes to identify injuries in inpatient and emergency department discharge claims from one healthcare facility in Kentucky, looking additionally at the codes' positive predictive value (PPV) when used as a principal diagnosis within inpatient data, as a secondary diagnosis within inpatient data, and in any position within emergency department data.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^43fdb678]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — classification codes include the primary International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes "M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabuli, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament". The corresponding ICD-9-CM codes and conditions are "719.45 Joint pain, 718.65 Unspecified intrapelvic protrusion of acetabulum, 718.15 Loose body in joint, and 718.5 Other derangement of joint pelvic region and thigh". Other ICD-10 codes that may be associated are "M21.0 Valgus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.1 Varus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.2 Flexion deformity", "M24.3 Pathological dislocation and subluxation of joint, not elsewhere classified", and "M24.4 Recurrent dislocation and subluxation of joint".

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^7e59b1dc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Since implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) in the US, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The widely used pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) system required a major update from version 2 (V2) to version 3 (V3) to capture the range of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

Objective

To update the CCC V3 system, creating V3, with new, missing, or retired codes; to reconceptualize the system's use of technology codes; and to compare CCC V3 with V2.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional study examined US hospitalization data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) and the Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019, for all patients aged 0 to 18 years. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2023, to April 1, 2024.

Exposures

The CCCs were identified in both data sources using the CCC V2 and V3 systems.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The (1) percentage of pediatric hospitalizations associated with a CCC, (2) numbers of CCC body-system categories per patient, and (3) explanatory power for hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality were compared over time for V3 vs V2.

Results

Among 7 186 019 hospitalizations within PHIS, 54.3% patients were male, the median age was 4 years (IQR, 1–11 years), and 51.2% were aged 0 to 4 years). The CCC V2 identified 2 878 476 (40.1%) patients as having any CCC compared with 2 753 412 (38.3%) identified by V3. In addition, V2 identified 100 065 (1.4%) patients with transplant status compared with 146 683 (2.0%) by V3, and V2 identified 914 835 (12.7%) as having technology codes compared with 805 585 (11.2%) by V3. The 2 systems were similar in accounting for the number of CCC body-system categories per patient and in explaining variation in hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality. For both V2 and V3, 10.0% of the variance in hospital length of stay and 12.0% of the variance in in-hospital mortality was explained by the presence of a CCC. Similar patterns were observed when analyzing the 2 999 420 Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases' hospitalizations (52.3% of patients were male, the median age was 1 year [IQR, 0–12 years], and 62.0% were 0 to 4 years old), except that the percentages of identified CCCs were all lower: V2 identified 758 110 hospitalizations (25.3%) with any CCC compared with 718 100 (23.9%) identified by V3.

Conclusions and Relevance

These results suggest that, moving forward, V3 should be used to identify CCCs, and ongoing, frequent updates to V3, using a transparent, structured process, will enable V3 to accurately reflect the evolving spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### A seamless navigation to ICD-10-CM for interventional pain physicians: is a rude awakening avoidable? [^d49ddced]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Since October 1, 2015, the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) was integrated into U.S. medical practices. This monumental transition seemingly occurred rather unceremoniously, despite significant opposition and reservations having been expressed by the provider community. In prior publications, we have described various survival strategies for interventional pain physicians. The regulators and beneficiaries of system-CMS, consultants, and health information technology industry are congratulating themselves for a job well done. Nonetheless, this transition comes at an immeasurable financial and psychological drain on providers. However, a rude awakening may be making its way with expiration of initial concessions from government and private payers. This manuscript provides a template for interventional pain management professionals with multiple steps for seamless navigation, including descriptions of the most commonly used codes, navigation through ICD-10-CM manual, steps for correct coding, and finally, detailed coding descriptions for various interventional techniques.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^2079c164]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

On October 1, 2015, the US transitioned to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for recording diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. It is unknown whether this transition was associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence based on diagnosis classification systems commonly used for payment and quality reporting.

Objective

To assess changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined level and trend changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition and clinically reviewed a subset of diagnostic categories with changes of 20% or more. Data included insurance claim diagnoses from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, for more than 18 million people aged 0 to 64 years with private insurance. Diagnoses were mapped using 3 common diagnostic classification systems: World Health Organization (WHO) disease chapters, Department of Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Exposures

US implementation of ICD-10-CM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly rates of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 eligible members.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. While diagnostic category prevalence changed minimally for WHO disease chapters, the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with level changes of 20% or more among 20 of 127 HHS-HCCs (15.7%) and 46 of 282 AHRQ-CCS categories (16.3%) and with trend changes of 20% or more among 12 of 127 of HHS-HCCs (9.4%) and 27 of 282 of AHRQ-CCS categories (9.6%). For HHS-HCCs, monthly rates of individuals with any acute myocardial infarction diagnosis increased 131.5% (95% CI, 124.1% to 138.8%), primarily because HHS added non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses to this category. The HHS-HCC for diabetes with chronic complications increased by 92.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 100.5%), primarily from including new diabetes-related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia codes, and the rate for completed pregnancy with complications decreased by 54.5% (95% CI, -58.7% to -50.2%) partly due to removing vaginal birth after cesarean delivery as a complication.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with large prevalence changes for many diagnostic categories. Diagnostic classification systems developed using ICD-9-CM may need to be refined using ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for disease surveillance, performance assessment, and risk-adjusted payments.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^e0159918]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^3a864023]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct", "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field", and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^a36ea6dd]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

Retinal vein occlusion ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM codes — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications include: central retinal vein occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.35; ICD-10 CM H34.811-, H34.812-, H34.813-; venous tributary (branch) occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.36; ICD-10 CM H34.831-, H34.832-, H34.833-; venous engorgement — ICD-9 CM 362.37; ICD-10 CM H34.821-, H34.822-, H34.823-. For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

Analysis 2: other chapters

Figure 2 and online supplemental table 2 show the most common chapters of ICD-10-CM codes that were in the primary diagnosis field when the drug overdose code was in any field position.

Figure 2
Analysis 2: top chapters of primary diagnosis for records with a drug overdose diagnosis code* in any field. (A) Discharge data from eight states' hospitalisation databases. Top four most common chapters are displayed. (B) Discharge data from five states' ED visit databases. Top three most common chapters are displayed. *Drug overdose diagnoses include ICD-10-CM code beginning with T36–T50 including unintentional, intentional harm, assault or undetermined intents, and initial, subsequent or missing encounter type. Avg. average; ED, emergency department; ICD-10-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification.

Among hospitalisation records with a drug overdose code in any field position, on average, 72.5% (median = 71.1%; range = 68.1%–79.2%) of the primary diagnosis fields included codes from the 'S00–T88: Injury, Poisoning, and Other Consequences of External Causes' chapter. The second most common chapter of primary diagnosis for all but one state was 'F01–F99: Mental, Behavioral, and Neurodevelopmental Disorders' chapter with an average of 12.0% (median = 12.7%; range = 3.8%–20.2%). State 5's second most common chapter was 'A00–B99: Certain Infectious and Parasitic Diseases' (4.1%). The third most common chapter varied: 'A00–B99' for states 1, 3 and 7; 'J00–J99: Diseases of the Respiratory System' for states 2, 6 and 8; 'F01–F99' for state 5 and 'I00–I99: Diseases of the Circulatory System' for state 4. All other chapters represented an average of 12.1% of primary diagnosis codes (median = 12.0%; range = 7.4%–17.1%).

### The complexity and challenges of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification to international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification transition in EDs [^9b81e000]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Beginning October 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require medical providers to use the vastly expanded International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) system. Despite wide availability of information and mapping tools for the next generation of the ICD classification system, some of the challenges associated with transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM are not well understood. To quantify the challenges faced by emergency physicians, we analyzed a subset of a 2010 Illinois Medicaid database of emergency department ICD-9-CM codes, seeking to determine the accuracy of existing mapping tools in order to better prepare emergency physicians for the change to the expanded ICD-10-CM system. We found that 27% of 1830 codes represented convoluted multidirectional mappings. We then analyzed the convoluted transitions and found that 8% of total visit encounters (23% of the convoluted transitions) were clinically incorrect. The ambiguity and inaccuracy of these mappings may impact the workflow associated with the translation process and affect the potential mapping between ICD codes and Current Procedural Codes, which determine physician reimbursement.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^ece69df2]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Analysis 2: other chapters

The ICD-10-CM codes are organised by major clinical conditions. To parsimoniously characterise possible broad co-occurring conditions among records with a drug overdose code in any field, the ICD-10-CM chapters of the coding manual (eg, 'A00–B99', 'C00–D99' and so on) of the primary diagnosis codes were examined. The primary diagnosis codes were categorised into ICD-10-CM coding chapters and quantified.

Analysis 3: encounter type

To examine the distribution of encounter types among drug overdose codes and their sequelae, records with a drug overdose code or sequelae to a drug overdose code were identified by searching all diagnosis fields, and the encounter type was categorised into initial (A), subsequent (D), sequela (S) or missing encounters based on the seventh character of the code.

Analysis 4: intent

To examine the distribution of intents among drug overdose, adverse effect and underdosing codes, records with a drug overdose, adverse effect or underdosing code were identified by searching all diagnosis fields, and the intent for the drug overdose code was categorised into unintentional, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined, adverse effect, underdosing or missing based on the fifth/sixth character of the code. All categories of intent were analysed for completeness, though adverse effect and underdose are by definition not considered drug overdoses in this manuscript.

State staff tabulated frequencies and percentages for code position categories, encounter types, intents and primary diagnosis chapters using SAS V.9.4. State-specific results and averages of all state results are presented.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^793b6597]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

According to a report of the Injury Surveillance Workgroup, a group of experts assembled by the Safe States Alliance to provide recommendations for injury surveillance and data analysis around the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition, changes in the injury counts by category can be explained by changes to coding guidelines, differences in the basic structure of the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices, differences in assignment of external cause codes to specific matrix cells, new or more detailed codes in ICD-10-CM, and other considerations. We found evidence supporting most of these explanations.

The most common reason for different classification of the same record by the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices was assigning an external cause to different mechanisms/causes. For example, 'MV non-traffic' is a new ICD-10-CM category that was created to support better surveillance of these injuries. As a result, some records assigned to the 'other transport' by the ICD-9-CM matrix (eg, E820-E825, fifth digits 0–4) were reassigned to the new 'MV non-traffic' category by the ICD-10-CM matrix. However, our finding that most of the MCA records reassigned to the new 'MV non-traffic' category were classified as MVT by the ICD-9-CM matrix suggests that some coders became more attentive to the distinction between traffic and non-traffic injuries while they were preparing for ICD-10-CM. 'Other land transport' is another new ICD-10-CM mechanism/cause that was separated out of the 'other transport' in the ICD-9-CM matrix; however, we observed no cases of differential classification involving this category.

### Coding update of the SMFM definition of low risk for cesarean delivery from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM [^9ece1f72]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine developed a low risk for cesarean delivery definition based on administrative claims-based diagnosis codes described by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition is a clinical enrichment of 2 available measures from the Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine measure excludes diagnosis codes that represent clinically relevant risk factors that are absolute or relative contraindications to vaginal birth while retaining diagnosis codes such as labor disorders that are discretionary risk factors for cesarean delivery. The introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification in October 2015 expanded the number of available diagnosis codes and enabled a greater depth and breadth of clinical description. These coding improvements further enhance the clinical validity of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition and its potential utility in tracking progress toward the goal of safely lowering the US cesarean delivery rate. This report updates the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition of low risk for cesarean delivery using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification coding.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — coding and documentation: Women who meet the criteria for rUTI should have this diagnosis added to their problem list to help alert other providers and ensure best practices, and the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is important for correct classification; the ICD-10 code of "positive urine culture" can be used instead of UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria when a urine culture is positive but the clinical criteria are not met for a UTI.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association COVID-19 data standards — scope and special considerations: This document provides data standards for cardiovascular and other complications related to COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the intent is to provide data elements consistent with current practice guidance and to include updated terminology and attributes in compliance with Task Force methodology and ACC/AHA policies for harmonization. The document is intended for use by researchers, registry developers, and clinicians and is proposed as a framework for ICD-10 code development of COVID-19–related cardiovascular conditions. In this document, data elements were not differentiated for specific encounters such as for inpatients versus outpatients, dates of encounter, number of encounters, baseline or repeated data elements, and databases can be built and customized according to users' needs to capture such information. The intent was not to provide recommendations regarding COVID-19 treatment, and the writing committee recommends that readers follow prevailing COVID-19 management guidelines.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Development and assessment of a new framework for disease surveillance, prediction, and risk adjustment: the diagnostic items classification system [^14f70448]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Health systems use diagnostic codes for individual patient care as well as to validate insurance claims, calculate risk-adjusted health plan payments, establish case-mix indices, track disease prevalence, and evaluate clinician performance. In October 2015, the US expanded the number and precision of diagnoses available for coding patient conditions by more than 5-fold when it transitioned from the ninth to the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). While the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR)incorporates certain features of the new ICD-10-CM codes, it largely still reflects its origin in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification structure and does not capture the full richness of the increased detail available in the ICD-10-CM system.

In this diagnostic modeling study, we developed novel diagnostic items (DXIs), a new classification system that leveraged the additional information in the ICD-10-CM system in 4 ways. First, many individual diagnoses were mapped into multiple DXIs, taking advantage of ICD-10-CM 's richer diagnosis-level information. Second, DXIs were ex ante designed to predict multiple outcomes, including spending, admissions, quality measures, and emergency department use. Third, DXIs were chosen to explain differences between realized outcomes and predicted values within subgroups defined by an existing base model — the AHRQ CCSR. Finally, DXIs were calibrated using very large sample sizes to enable robust estimation of the incremental influence of disease categories that are as rare as 1 in 100 000.

Several existing classification systems map diagnoses to categories. The World Health Organization has created and updates the international ICD-10 coding system, which contains 21 chapters and finer subchapters that are comprehensive but not organized to predict costs or utilization. The Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Category (HHS-HCC) systemwas developed for the Medicare Advantage program, revised for Medicare Part D, and further expanded for plan payment in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Our effort builds on the comprehensive and up-to-date AHRQ CCSR system that managed care plans, insurers, researchers, and surveillance programs use for myriad applications related to payment, quality assessment, and epidemiology.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^cb9e26bb]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) ICD coding — severe nonproliferative and diabetic macular edema mappings are listed as follows: ICD-9 CM 362.06 corresponds to ICD-10 CM codes "E10.341- Type 1 with macular edema", "E10.349- Type 1 without macular edema", "E11.341- Type 2 with macular edema", "E11.349- Type 2 without macular edema", "E13.341- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR with macular edema", and "E13.349- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR without macular edema". For diabetic macular edema, ICD-9 CM 362.07 corresponds to ICD-10 CM "E10.321 Type 1 mild nonproliferative DR", "E10.331 Type 1 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E10.341 Type 1 severe nonproliferative DR", "E10.351 Type 1 proliferative DR", "E11.321 Type 2 mild nonproliferative DR", "E11.331 Type 2 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E11.341 Type 2 severe nonproliferative DR", "E11.351 Type 2 proliferative DR", "E13.321 other specified diabetes mellitus with mild nonproliferative DR", and "E13.331 other specified diabetes mellitus with moderate nonproliferative DR". Additional information states: "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 6th characters. In the DR series, indicate 'with or without' macular edema. Laterality indicators are not required in this series", with "1 = with macular edema" and "9 = without macular edema". It further specifies, "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available".

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^7b265eb9]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

Classification codes — there have been no changes in ICD-10 codes that would impact the 2021 CPG update, so ICD-10 content was not updated or revised; there is a transition plan to ICD-11 codes which will include coding for primary chronic pain and secondary chronic pain conditions (eg, musculoskeletal); and changes to ICD-11 codes are likely in a future CPG update because directly coding chronic pain will noticeably impact clinical classification of low back pain (LBP).

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^f960c8ff]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Background

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), a coding system for all claims billing in the USA, went into effect on 1 October 2015, replacing the 9th Revision (ICD-9-CM). The coding transition brought with it benefits and challenges for drug overdose surveillance using hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge data. Increases in specificity of drug codes, the ability to distinguish initial encounters from subsequent encounters and sequelae, the inclusion of external cause information within drug overdose diagnosis codes and new concepts like 'underdosing' provide epidemiologists with richer data. However, these new features impact how injuries, including drug overdose, should be measured and interpreted using ICD-10-CM coded discharge data. Amid a continuing drug overdose epidemic in the USA, high-quality data and standardised surveillance methods are key for tracking and assessing drug overdose burden.

Several studies have characterised drug overdoses using ICD-10-CM coded discharge data, but have used varying selection criteria and indicator definitions to ascertain drug overdose cases. Specifically, these indicator definitions differ on the number of diagnosis fields searched, the encounter types included, the manner of injury/intent selected and the specific ICD-10-CM codes included. Some studies searched all diagnosis fields (ie, primary diagnosis field, secondary diagnosis and all other fields available)and others only included cases with a primary diagnosis of injury.

ICD-10-CM introduced the differentiation of encounter type, with codes for initial encounter, subsequent encounter and sequelae. Initial encounters represent active treatment of drug overdose, while subsequent encounters represent encounters taking place 'after the patient has completed active treatment of the condition and is receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery phase'. Sequelae are new medical conditions or complications, occurring at any point after the acute phase of the injury, which are residual effects of the original injury. Some studies have included all encounters, while others have limited inclusion to initial encounter type.

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^1107af4b]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Tracking socioeconomic risk in health care settings using ICD-10-CM — compared with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) provides a more robust classification system that enables clinicians to track socioeconomic factors in patient care that may be related to families' annual income level; by using the ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians can submit supplemental codes that include not only diagnosis, such as acute asthma exacerbation, but additional socioeconomic factors related to the asthma exacerbation and treatment, such as childhood poverty or the family's inability to afford the recommended medical regimen; it will be important to capture this additional socioeconomic information with the sole use of ICD-10-CM codes to enable investigators to examine the putative impact of expanded codes on children's health care.

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^505766f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0–17 years) and adults (aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35–61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21–200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Use of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and emergency department data for injury surveillance [^ee350889]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Injury surveillance, the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of injury data, provides critical information to support public health efforts to reduce injury-related morbidity, mortality and disability. For the past several decades, state and local health departments and national agencies in the USA have relied on the use of hospital discharge and emergency department (ED) data coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to conduct injury surveillance. Surveillance case definitions and analyses have been based on ICD-9-CM codes. However, a US mandate to code using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)has resulted in a need to update injury surveillance case definitions and analysis guidance based on ICD-10-CM.

Beginning in October 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services required all hospitals and healthcare providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to use the ICD-10-CM to report electronic healthcare transactions. The coding structure of ICD-10-CM is based on ICD-10 mortality coding and classification published by the WHO, however, the classification scheme has been greatly expanded to capture the diagnostic detail needed for medical diagnoses. ICD-10-CM contains nearly five times the number of codes found in ICD-9-CM (approximately 72 000 codes in ICD-10-CM compared with 15 000 codes in ICD-9-CM). Because ICD-10-CM captures greater detail than either ICD-9-CM or ICD-10, this classification system has the potential to provide enhanced understanding of the types and causes of non-fatal injury.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^dbb71c1c]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The drug overdose epidemic has worsened over the past decade; however, efforts have been made to better understand and track nonfatal overdoses using various data sources including emergency department and hospital admission data from billing and discharge files.

Methods and Findings

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed surveillance case definition guidance using standardised discharge diagnosis codes for public health practitioners and epidemiologists using lessons learnt from CDC's funded recipients and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) Drug Poisoning Indicators Workgroup and General Injury ICD-10-CM Workgroup. CDC's guidance was informed by health departments and CSTE's workgroups and included several key aspects for assessing drug overdose in emergency department and hospitalisation discharge data. These include: (1) searching all diagnosis fields to identify drug overdose cases; (2) estimating drug overdose incidence using visits for initial encounter but excluding subsequent encounters and sequelae; (3) excluding underdosing and adverse effects from drug overdose incidence indicators; and (4) using codes T36-T50 for overdose surveillance. CDC's guidance also suggests analysing intent separately for ICD-10-CM coding.

Conclusions

CDC's guidance provides health departments a key tool to better monitor drug overdoses in their community. The implementation and validation of this standardised guidance across all CDC-funded health departments will be key to ensuring consistent and accurate reporting across all entities.

3.2. Case coding

One of the prepared cases referred to a diagnosis (Chronic peripheral neuropathic pain) that had not yet been implemented in the ICD-11 at the time of the field trial, and therefore was excluded from evaluation, leaving 13 pain diagnoses for 11 cases to be rated per participant. Taken together, the participants rated 1342 cases, each case was rated by between 67% (119/177) and 75% (132/177) of participants. Participants assigned the correct code for the pain diagnosis in 83.9% of cases, and in 98.4% of cases, participants reported having no difficulty in assigning the diagnosis (Table 2). The aggregated clinical utility (the mean for the individual facets) was high across all cases (4.3 ± 0.90) on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful) and all single cases (Table 2).

Table 2

Text box 1.
Morbidity coding rules

Morbidity rule 1 (MB1): Several conditions recorded as the "main condition". Select the "main condition" for which the patient received care. Extension codes may be used to indicate different types of main condition (eg, reason for admission or main resource condition). In cases where the main condition cannot be determined based on documentation, select the condition that is mentioned first.
Morbidity rule 2 (MB2): Condition recorded as "main condition" is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition. If a symptom or sign (ICD-11 chapter 21) or a problem (ICD-11 chapter 24) is recorded as the "main condition", and this is obviously a sign, symptom, or problem of a diagnosed condition coded elsewhere, and care was given to the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the "main condition".
Morbidity rule 3 (MB3): Signs and symptoms. When a symptom or sign is documented as the "main condition", and it is documented that it could be caused by either one condition or another, select the symptom or sign as "main condition".

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

### General surgeon involvement in the care of patients designated with an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-endorsed ICD-10-CM emergency general surgery diagnosis code in Wisconsin [^5fcbf5f7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The current national burden of emergency general surgery (EGS) illnesses and the extent of surgeon involvement in the care of these patients remain largely unknown. To inform needs assessments, research, and education, we sought to: (1) translate previously developed International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes representing EGS conditions to ICD 10th Revision, CM (ICD-10-CM) codes and (2) determine the national burden of and assess surgeon involvement across EGS conditions.

Methods

We converted ICD-9-CM codes to candidate ICD-10-CM codes using General Equivalence Mappings then iteratively refined the code list. We used National Inpatient Sample 2016 to 2017 data to develop a national estimate of the burden of EGS disease. To evaluate surgeon involvement, using Wisconsin Hospital Association discharge data (January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018), we selected adult urgent/emergent encounters with an EGS condition as the principal diagnosis. Surgeon involvement was defined as a surgeon being either the attending provider or procedural physician.

Results

Four hundred and eighty-five ICD-9-CM codes mapped to 1,696 ICD-10-CM codes. The final list contained 985 ICD-10-CM codes. Nationally, there were 2,977,843 adult patient encounters with an ICD-10-CM EGS diagnosis. Of 94,903 EGS patients in the Wisconsin Hospital Association data set, most encounters were inpatient as compared with observation (75,878 [80.0%] vs. 19,025 [20.0%]). There were 57,780 patients (60.9%) that underwent any procedure. Among all Wisconsin EGS patients, most had no surgeon involvement (64.9% [n = 61,616]). Of the seven most common EGS diagnoses, surgeon involvement was highest for appendicitis (96.0%) and biliary tract disease (77.1%). For the other five most common conditions (skin/soft tissue infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction/ileus, pancreatitis, diverticular disease), surgeons were involved in roughly 20% of patient care episodes.

Conclusion

Surgeon involvement for EGS conditions ranges from highly likely (appendicitis) to relatively unlikely (skin/soft tissue infections). The wide range in surgeon involvement underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in the care of EGS patients.

### Idiopathic epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^b546b23f]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction are as follows: Epiretinal membrane — ICD-9 CM 362.56; ICD-10 CM H35.371, H35.372, H35.373. Vitreomacular traction, adhesion — ICD-9 CM 379.27; ICD-10 CM H43.821, H43.822, H43.823. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned; unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available.

### ICD-10-CM | Classification of diseases, functioning, and… [^20c2c21c]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know ICD-10-CM — the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification — is used to code and classify medical diagnoses. ICD-10-CM is based on ICD-10, the system used to code and classify mortality data from death certificates. Use our free tool to search for ICD-10-CM codes. Introduction ICD-10-CM is a standardized system used to code diseases and medical conditions data. Healthcare providers use ICD-10-CM codes when diagnosing patients. ICD-10-CM builds on ICD-10 — the system used to code causes of death on death certificates. CDC's National Center for Health Statistics is responsible for the clinical modification of ICD-10 for use in the United States. The World Health Organization, which owns and publishes ICD-10, authorized NCHS to develop ICD-10-CM.

All modifications to ICD-10 must conform to WHO's established ICD structure and conventions.

### Death certificate-based ICD-10 diagnosis codes for COVID-19 mortality surveillance-United States, January-December 2020 [^558158a2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18–84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.

### What drives outcomes in infants of mothers with congenital heart disease? A mediation analysis [^45c6de4d]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Covariates

For the analysis of pregnancy outcomes, MMS, MPS, pregnancy infection, and maternal CHF were identified a priori as potential mediators based on the existing literature. MMS was defined as the presence of one or more of the following conditions: preexisting maternal hypertension (ICD-9-CM 642.0, 642.1, 642.2, ICD-10-CM O10.x), dysmetabolic syndrome (ICD-9-CM: 277.7, ICD-10-CM: E 88.81), dyslipidemia (ICD-9-CM: 272.0, 272.1, 272.2, 727.4, 727.5, ICD-10-CM: E78.0, E78.1, E78.2, E78.4, E78.5), or type 2 diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM 250 specified as type 2, ICD-10-CM E11). MPS was defined as the presence of preeclampsia (ICD-9-CM 642.4, 642.5, 642.6, 642.7 ICD-10-CM: O11, O14.0, O14.9, O14.1, O14.2, O15), gestational hypertension (ICD-9-CM 642.3, ICD-10-CM O13), placental infarction (ICD-10-CM O43.81), or placental abruption (ICD-9-CM 641.2, 762.1 ICD-10-CM 045.0, 045.8, 045.9, P0.21). Pregnancy infection was defined as any infection complicating pregnancy (ICD-9-CM 646.5, 646.6, 647, ICD-10-C O23, O98), and chorioamnionitis (ICD-9-CM 762.7, ICD-10-CM O41.12). Maternal CHF was defined by the following ICD codes: ICD-9-CM 428, ICD-10-CM I50.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^c35d9c38]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In October 2015, discharge data coding in the USA shifted to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), necessitating new indicator definitions for drug overdose morbidity. Amid the drug overdose crisis, characterising discharge records that have ICD-10-CM drug overdose codes can inform the development of standardised drug overdose morbidity indicator definitions for epidemiological surveillance.

Methods

Eight states submitted aggregated data involving hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge records with ICD-10-CM codes starting with T36–T50, for visits occurring from October 2015 to December 2016. Frequencies were calculated for (1) the position within the diagnosis billing fields where the drug overdose code occurred; (2) primary diagnosis code grouped by ICD-10-CM chapter; (3) encounter types; and (4) intents, underdosing and adverse effects.

Results

Among all records with a drug overdose code, the primary diagnosis field captured 70.6% of hospitalisations (median = 69.5%, range = 66.2%–76.8%) and 79.9% of ED visits (median = 80.7%; range = 69.8%–88.0%) on average across participating states. The most frequent primary diagnosis chapters included injury and mental disorder chapters. Among visits with codes for drug overdose initial encounters, subsequent encounters and sequelae, on average 94.6% of hospitalisation records (median = 98.3%; range = 68.8%–98.8%) and 95.5% of ED records (median = 99.5%; range = 79.2%–99.8%), represented initial encounters. Among records with drug overdose of any intent, adverse effect and underdosing codes, adverse effects comprised an average of 74.9% of hospitalisation records (median = 76.3%; range = 57.6%–81.1%) and 50.8% of ED records (median = 48.9%; range = 42.3%–66.8%), while unintentional intent comprised an average of 11.1% of hospitalisation records (median = 11.0%; range = 8.3%–14.5%) and 28.2% of ED records (median = 25.6%; range = 20.8%–40.7%).

Conclusion

Results highlight considerations for adapting and standardising drug overdose indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM.

### Half century since SIDS: a reappraisal of terminology [^e49a0c92]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Sudden infant death diagnostic shift and ICD categorization — Inconsistent reporting and changes in understanding have led to a diagnostic shift away from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) toward undetermined cause and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, creating variability in attribution and difficulty differentiating explained versus unexplained causes. For mortality surveillance in the United States, sudden infant death causes are grouped into SIDS (ICD-10 code R95), unknown or unspecified causes (ICD-10 code R99), and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ICD-10 code W75), which are included under sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) to allow consistent monitoring of mortality trends that include both explained and unexplained causes. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) codes are applied to cause-of-death determinations but may not reflect the certifier's intent; the ICD-10-CM was adapted from the ICD-10 for morbidity reporting in US health care settings, and the ICD-10, not the ICD-10-CM, is used for official reporting of mortality statistics in the United States and other nations.

### Stigmatizing language in substance use-related international classification of diseases codes [^389f498f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This is a descriptive analysis of ICD-10-CM codes and textual descriptors. We obtained a list of codes and descriptions from the CDC website, updated October 1, 2024. In efforts to explore ways to destigmatize diseases of addiction, a list of stigmatizing terms was compiled from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) educational material "Words Matter". This list of terms has been used extensively to evaluate for stigmatizing language surrounding SUDs in different contexts, including clinical documentation (Table 1). –

TABLE 1
Stigmatizing Terms From the National Institute on Drug Abuse's "Words Matter"

We queried the list of ICD-10-CM codes for instances of each stigmatizing term. All ICD-10-CM codes with substance use-related stigmatizing terms were manually reviewed by 2 investigators to verify the presence of the term in the description and if the context was consistent with stigmatization of substance use consistent with prior recommendations. We subsequently determined the number of ICD-10-CM codes with any stigmatizing term and number of codes for each term. Analyses were performed using Python (version 3.10.12).

Denominator ARDS identification approach — to balance feasibility and sensitivity, an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code–only denominator akin to NQF 0500 was contemplated but rejected because many patients with ARDS are not recognized by clinicians and an ICD-10-CM–based PM would have low sensitivity and limited impact; an alternative higher-sensitivity definition including all mechanically ventilated acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was also rejected because LTVV may not benefit patients without ARDS and ATS PMs must remain evidence based; instead, to improve specificity, the committee opted for a strategy similar to NQF 3215 requiring electronic health record data extraction for Berlin Definition criteria, ventilator settings, ARDS risk factors, echocardiogram, and other evidence of cardiac dysfunction, despite added complexity judged necessary to support a meaningful PM.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^da217d43]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Standardized code sets — HIPAA mandate and ICD-10 governance in the United States — are described as follows: Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services mandates use of standardized code sets in support of electronic health care transactions, which include International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS); Current Procedural Terminology (CPT); National Drug Codes (NDCs); and Current Dental Terminology. The World Health Organization created the ICD-10 with adaptability for expansion and specificity for enhanced measurement, surveillance, research, and reporting across multiple domains, and it was clinically modified and initiated in the United States on October 1, 2015. The 4 cooperating parties that oversee and manage the ICD-10 in the United States are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the National Center for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Health Information Management Association, and the American Hospital Association.

### International classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification for the pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physician [^d06e16db]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

After a patient encounter, the physician uses two coding systems to bill for the service rendered to the patient. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is used to describe the encounter or procedure. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code is used to describe the diagnosis(es) of the patient. On October 1, 2015, ICD-9-CM coding will end, and all physicians will be required to use a new diagnostic coding system, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). This article describes the new diagnostic coding system and how it differs from the old system. There are resources and costs involved for physicians and physician practices to prepare properly for ICD-10-CM. Similar to other important events, the more thorough the preparation, the more likely a positive outcome will occur. Resource use is very important in preparation for the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Greater familiarity with ICD-10-CM plus a thorough, effective preparation will lead to reduced costs and a smooth transition. Coding descriptor changes and additional codes occur in ICD-10-CM for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, asthma, and respiratory failure. These changes will affect the coding of these diseases and disorders by physicians. Because the number of codes will increase more than fivefold, the complexity of documentation to support ICD-10-CM will increase substantially. The documentation in the patient's chart to support the ICD-10-CM codes used will need to be enhanced. The requirement for accurate and comprehensive documentation cannot be emphasized enough. All of the coding and documentation changes will be a challenge to pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physicians. They must be prepared fully when ICD-10-CM coding begins and ICD-9-CM coding stops abruptly on October 1, 2015.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^651aff5f]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Analysis 4: intent

The frequency of the intents captured among drug overdose, adverse effect, and underdosing records is shown in figure 4 and online supplemental table 4. Among hospitalisations, adverse effects codes were present across participating states in an average of 74.9% of records with drug overdose codes (median = 76.3%; range = 57.6%–81.1%). Among ED visits, adverse effects codes were present across participating states in an average of 50.8% of records with drug overdose codes (median = 48.9%; range = 42.3%–66.8%). Unintentional intent represented an average of 11.1% of hospitalisations (median = 11.0%; range = 8.3%–14.5%) and 28.2% of ED visits (median = 25.6%; range = 20.8%–40.7%), followed by self-harm with 9.6% of hospitalisations (median = 7.9%; range = 5.8%–23.0%) and 12.3% of ED visits (median = 11.6%; range = 8.3%–17.6%). On average, undetermined, assault and underdosing intents represent 4.3% (median = 3.8%; range = 3.1%–7.7%) of hospitalisations and 4.8% (median = 4.1%; range = 3.8%–7.8%) of ED visits, respectively. State 3 had a relatively large percentage of missing intents among hospitalisations and ED visits compared with other states.

### Positive predictive value of international classification of diseases, 10th revision, codes for cirrhosis and its related complications [^7a9e696f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Large administrative databases using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are useful for epidemiologic, health services, and outcomes research. 1,2 However, coding accuracy of disease conditions could be a limiting factor. Cirrhosis prevalence is increasing because of an aging hepatitis C cohort and an increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. 3 We previously examined the validity of ICD, 9th revision (ICD-9), codes for cirrhosis in US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databases. 4,5 This work has formed the basis for many clinical, epidemiologic, and health services research studies. However, with transition from the ICD-9 to ICD, 10th revision (ICD-10), coding system, it is important to determine the validity of these new cirrhosis codes in administrative databases. Although the greater number of codes in the ICD-10 system may be associated with greater specificity and coding accuracy than with the ICD-9 system, this hypothesis remains untested.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Stigmatizing language in substance use-related international classification of diseases codes [^1eb2812e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Stigma, which includes stereotyping, emotional reactions, and discriminatory behaviors, has a chilling effect on patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) accessing appropriate medical treatment. In 2017, policymakers and healthcare providers suggested changes in the language of addiction that reduce blame and emphasize SUDs as treatable illnesses. Despite efforts to promote change in terminology surrounding SUDs, stigmatizing language continues to be widely used in clinical notes in medicine, reflects implicit biases of clinicians, and perpetuates misconceptions about patients to other clinicians which negatively impacts quality of care. Efforts to reduce stigmatizing terms in clinical documentation are important but do not account for other areas where stigmatization can be perpetuated in the electronic health record outside of clinician control.

International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes are ubiquitous in medicine. ICD-10-CM codes are entered by clinicians engaged in patient care and used for purposes including billing, problem list generation, prescribing, and disease surveillance. These codes are derived from ICD codes developed and maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO authorizes clinical modifications by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics. Codes are linked to textual descriptions that clinicians use to query and provide documentation for patient encounters. Concerns about ICD-10-CM codes range from differences with established diagnostic criteria to their inability to capture the breadth of clinical medicine. The potential linkage between clinician use of stigmatizing terminology derived from disease codes to patient care raises important questions about the perpetuation of stigma in the healthcare system.

This study aimed to evaluate the presence of stigmatizing language in ICD-10-CM codes and identify the most commonly used stigmatizing terms.

### The impacts of ICD-10-CM on U.S. army injury surveillance [^03443bd9]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Injuries are the leading cause of medical encounters and lost work days in the U.S. Army, affecting more than half of active-duty soldiers annually. Historically, Army injury surveillance has captured both acute traumatic and cumulative microtraumatic overuse injuries. This article describes how the transition from the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM impacted U.S. military injury surveillance by comparing injury rates and distributions under both systems.

Methods

Mapping ICD-9-CM codes to the expanded ICD-10-CM codes is not a straightforward endeavor; therefore, the Army Public Health Center incorporated ICD-10-CM codes into a comprehensive, systematic approach to taxonomically categorize injuries. This taxonomic methodology was applied to Army injuries under ICD-10-CM (2016–2019) and compared with the ICD-9-CM Army injury surveillance definitions (2012–2015).

Results

Soldier injury rates appeared to increase when surveillance with ICD-10-CM began. Soldiers experienced 1,276 incident injury medical encounters per 1,000 person-years in 2015 (ICD-9-CM), compared with 1,804 injuries per 1,000 in 2016 (ICD-10-CM), a 41% increase. Importantly, the distribution of injuries also shifted, such that the average cumulative microtraumatic injury rate increased by 42% during 2016–2019 (ICD-10-CM) compared with the 2012–2015 average (ICD-9-CM), whereas acute traumatic injuries only increased by 17%.

Conclusions

The enhanced descriptions provided by ICD-10-CM codes and the applied taxonomic categorizations have improved precision in Army injury surveillance. Data unequivocally show that most injuries in this physically active population are cumulative microtraumatic injuries. The taxonomic methodology can be extended to injury surveillance in other populations and may allow a more efficient transition to ICD-11-CM.

### Assessing the validity of ICD-10 administrative data in coding comorbidities [^914dd30b]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

Results

Prevalence of comorbidities

The prevalence of 17 Charlson comorbidities over the years (2003, 2015 and 2022) is shown in table 1. The difference in prevalence identified by chart reviewers and ICD-10-CA in DAD was calculated within each cohort, as shown in figure 1. We highlighted six conditions (peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, cancer, depression, chronic pulmonary disease and renal disease) with the most significant changes in prevalence between ICD-10 coding and chart review, using solid lines. These six conditions were highlighted in other figures, allowing for easier tracking of changes in performance. The mean difference in prevalence between chart reviews and administrative data for these 17 conditions was 2.1% in 2003, 7.6% in 2015 and 6.3% in 2022. 15 conditions were consistently under-reported by ICD-10 over the years, and two conditions were slightly over-reported (renal disease in 2003 and paralysis in 2022). The coding of 5 comorbidities (dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatic disease, renal disease and hypertension) was increasingly under-reported. Three comorbidities had relatively consistent coding prevalence and difference, such as peripheral vascular disease (1.4%, 2.7% and 1.7%), diabetes (1.9%, 2.1% and 1.1%) and metastatic cancer (0.3%, 1.1% and 0.4%). Two conditions (peptic ulcer disease and cancer) had consistent ICD-coding prevalence but large differences in chart data.

### Burden of depression and anxiety disorders per disease codes in patients with lymphoma in Germany [^61b5d7f3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Study population

This study included patients who were coded for the first time with a diagnosis of Hodgkin (ICD-10: C81) or non-Hodgkin (ICD-10: C82-C88) lymphomas in one of 1274 general practices in Germany between January 2000 and December 2018 (index date). Included patients were aged ≥ 18 years at the index date and had never been diagnosed with cancer (ICD-10: C00-C97) prior to the index date. Patients with depression (ICD-10: F32, F33), bipolar disorder (ICD-10: F30), and anxiety disorder (ICD-10: F41) diagnoses prior to or on index date were excluded. After applying similar inclusion criteria, patients without cancer were matched (1:1) to those with lymphoma based on sex, age, index year, and yearly consultation frequency. The reasons for the matching criteria were as follows: higher age and female sex are known to be associated with depression and could therefore bias the results. The index year is correlating with follow-up time and was consequently included into the matching process to enable similar follow-up durations for both cohorts. Finally, we matched for consultation frequency, as patients with cancer usually have a much higher consultation frequency than patients without cancer and this may lead to a higher likelihood of coding a diagnosis (in our case depression/anxiety). For individuals without cancer, the index date corresponded to a randomly selected visit date between January 2000 and December 2018 (Figure 1).

### Stigmatizing language in substance use-related international classification of diseases codes [^b2733d29]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives:

Healthcare-associated stigma is a critical barrier for treatment engagement for patients with substance use disorders. Although there are efforts to combat stigmatizing language in clinical documentation, little is known about the presence of substance use-related stigmatizing language in structured diagnosis codes ubiquitous in clinical medicine.

Methods:

We examined the presence of substance use-related stigmatizing terms contained within the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code descriptions. Stigmatizing terms were compiled from guidelines authored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, while ICD-10-CM codes were obtained from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Results:

We evaluated 74,259 ICD-10-CM code descriptions and identified 173 substance use-related codes with stigmatizing language. The stigmatizing terms detected were "abuse" (157 code descriptions), "alcoholic" (16), and "drug abuser" (2). The term "abuse" was used in relation to multiple substances including alcohol, opioids, cannabis, sedatives, hypnotics and anxiolytics, cocaine, stimulants, hallucinogens, inhalants, other psychoactive substances, tobacco, and other medicinal products.

Conclusions:

Stigmatizing language is used in multiple ICD-10-CM code descriptions. Subsequent iterations should bring ICD-10-CM code descriptions in line with current recommendations for destigmatized descriptors to avoid the perpetuation of stigma in healthcare.

### Development of an electronic health record-based chronic kidney disease registry to promote population health management [^99faeadc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

CKD and 5D staging

Our CKD collaborative developed the algorithm for classifying patients in stages 1 through 5 (Fig. 2). Given that eGFR can fluctuate for a patient over the course of several years, there are multiple approaches to such classification, including 'average eGFR', 'lowest eGFR', and 'most recent eGFR'. We opted to base classification on the most recent eGFR to reduce confusion among front line clinicians, recognizing the limitation that this may sometimes capture acute kidney injury.

Fig. 2
Staging algorithm employed in PHS CKD Registry

Abbreviations: ESRD- End Stage Renal Disease; eGFR- estimated glomerular filtration rate. Definitions: eGFR 1 = The most recent eGFR value within the last 3 years, eGFR 2 = The second most recent eGFR value within the last 3 years, eGFR 2 ' = The most recent eGFR value within the last 3 years that occurred at least 90 days prior to eGFR 1

We classified patients as 5D (requiring dialysis) or ESRD based on the presence of active dialysis ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes (including such common codes as ICD-9 CM: V56.0, V56.1, 585.6, V45.11; and ICD-10 CM: N18.6, Z99.2) or recent outpatient dialysis treatments regardless of eGFR (see Additional file 1: Table S1). We classified patients as stage 5 if no criteria for active dialysis is met and the most recent eGFR is < 15. Patients are classified as 'no stage assigned' if there are no eGFR values in the last 3 years and no active dialysis criteria are met.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^199b938c]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2. Material

The field testing consisted of 2 parts (line coding and case coding) and an additional section in which the participants provided a general evaluation of the new ICD-11 classification compared with the current ICD-10 classification. To familiarize the participants with the novel pain classification, they could watch training slides on the IASP Web site and received a document with training material explaining the new diagnoses and the use of the different WHO platforms (ICD-11 Browser, ICD-FiT, and the ICD-11 Coding Tool). The training lasted approximately 15 minutes, and in the end, the participants were asked to complete a 10-item self-test in a multiple choice format. If a wrong answer was chosen, the participant received the information that the answer was incorrect and the correct answer was displayed. The material was also available for download in ISO-certified translations into Chinese, English, German, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish. The testing itself was conducted in English with the ICD-FiT online tool (version 2.7.1).

For all testing, the ICD-10 version of 2016and the ICD-11 Mortality and Morbidity Linearization was used in the frozen version of April 2, 2017 (version for quality control), to ensure a constant reference. The frozen version comprised 33 genuine chronic pain diagnoses (excluding the automatically generated categories of "other" and "unspecified"). The current 2020 frozen version ("for preparation of implementation") has evolved since then, now including further chronic pain entities and a coding tool with improved search functions.

The lines and cases were prepared with the help of feedback from the experts of the IASP taskforce for the respective pain diagnoses and in cooperation with the WHO requirements. For the line coding, 18 lines reflecting the names of individual pain diagnoses as they are used in clinical practice were prepared (see Supplementary Material S1 for the list of lines, available at). For the case coding, 12 case vignettes were formulated. In each vignette, 2 or more diagnoses were present to represent different combinations of diagnoses and morbidity rules, when determining the reasons for encounter with the health system (see below). The number of lines and cases was determined on theoretical grounds: The number of lines to reflect the main categories and subcategories of chronic pain implemented in the frozen version of the browser at the time. The cases also used the main categories of chronic pain and were created to allow for combinations of categories and morbidity rules.

### 2022 AHA / ACC key data elements and definitions for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complications of COVID-19: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards [^8bd30e5b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC COVID-19 data standards — purpose, scope, harmonization, and privacy are outlined, emphasizing consistent capture of clinical concepts and alignment with broader standards. The key data elements are intended "to facilitate the consistent, accurate, and reproducible capture of clinical concepts" and "standardize the terminology used to describe CVDs and procedures", with goals including "to facilitate further development of clinical registries, implementable clinical guidelines, quality and performance improvement programs, outcomes evaluations, public reporting, and clinical research, including the comparison of results within and across these initiatives" and "to ensure equity across all endeavors related to clinical data standards". The ACC/AHA Task Force "selects cardiovascular conditions, procedures, and other topics related to cardiovascular health and medicine that will benefit from the creation of a clinical data standard set", and expert groups "develop a comprehensive, yet not exhaustive, data standard set" where projects may use "only a subset" or add elements such as "Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes, or outcomes". The intent is "to standardize clinical concepts, focusing on the patient and clinical care and not on administrative billing or coding concepts", envisioning administrative codes "to follow the lead of the clinical data standards". Harmonization is emphasized as the ACC and AHA "recognize that there are other national efforts" and "every attempt is made to harmonize" by instructing writing committees "to consider adopting or adapting existing nationally recognized data standards". Privacy protections are highlighted: HIPAA "went into effect in April 2003" and specifies "protected health information" that "may not be disclosed to third parties… without the patient's permission", while PHI "may be included in databases used for health care operations under a data use agreement", and research using PHI "must be reviewed by an institutional review board"; identifying information is included in the standards "to facilitate uniform collection of these elements when appropriate". Harmonizing definitions "facilitates comparisons and enables the conduct of pooled analyses and meta-analyses", deepening understanding of study results.

### Updated estimates for the burden of chronic limb-threatening ischemia in the Medicare population [^327790fc]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Estimates of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) based on diagnosis codes of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) suggest a prevalence of 0.23%-0.32% and incidence of 0.20%-0.26% among Medicare patients. ICD-10-CM includes 144 CLTI diagnosis codes, allowing improved specificity in identifying affected patients. We sought to use ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes to determine the prevalence of CLTI among Medicare patients and describe the patient cohort affected by this condition.

Methods

Using two years of data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we identified all patients that had at least one CLTI diagnosis code to determine prevalence and incidence rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to compare our methodology to prior publications and quantify the extent of missed diagnoses. The number and type of vascular procedures that occurred after diagnosis were tabulated. A cohort of patients with two or more CLTI diagnosis codes were then identified for further descriptive analysis. Associations between patient demographics and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Over 65 million patients were enrolled in Medicare in 2017 to 2018. Of these, 480,227 had diagnosis of CLTI, with a corresponding to a 1-year incidence of 0.33% and a 2-year prevalence of 0.74%. Patients underwent an average of 43.6 vascular procedures per 100 person-years. Sensitivity analyses identified 89,805 additional patients that had a diagnosis code of peripheral arterial disease who underwent revascularization or amputation. Patients with CLTI were predominantly male (56.2%), white (76.4%), and qualified for Medicare due to age (64.0%). Thirty-seven percent were dual-eligible. One-year survival was 77.7%, significantly lower than estimated actuarial survival adjusted for age, sex, and race (95.1%; P < .001). Cox proportional hazards models demonstrate significantly increased mortality for men vs women (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.04–1.10; P < .001), but no association between race and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.01; P = 0.83).

Conclusions

Using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes, we demonstrated slightly higher incidence and prevalence of CLTI than in published literature, reflecting our more complete methodology. Sensitivity analyses suggest that increased complexity of the highly specific ICD-10-CM coding may diminish capture of CLTI. Inclusion of patients with non-CLTI peripheral arterial disease diagnoses produces moderate increases in incidence and prevalence at the cost of decreased specificity in identifying patients with CLTI. Medicare patients with CLTI are older, and more commonly male, black, and dual eligible compared with the general Medicare population. Observed mid-term survival for patients with CLTI is significantly lower than actuarial estimates, confirming the importance of focused efforts on identifying and aligning goals of care in this complex patient population.

### Large-scale long-tailed disease diagnosis on radiology images [^03fe217f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Afterwards, we map disorders to ICD-10-CM codes. Upon getting disorder classes, they may fall into varying hierarchical granularity levels, here, we hope to map them to internationally recognized standards. For this purpose, we utilize the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes, which is a customized version of the ICD-10 used for coding diagnoses in the U.S. healthcare system. The ICD was originally designed as a healthcare classification system, providing a system of diagnostic codes for classifying diseases, including nuanced classifications of a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. Specifically, we hire ten medical Ph.D. students to manually map the article titles into ICD-10-CM codes. After cross-checking by a ten-year clinician, we have mapped the 5,568 disorders into the corresponding ICD-10-CM codes. We unify various disorders into the first hierarchical level of ICD-10-CM code tree, resulting in 930 ICD-10-CM classes. For example, both "J12.0 Adenoviral pneumonia" and "J12 Viral pneumonia" are mapped to the code "J12 Viral pneumonia, not elsewhere classified", dismissing the ambiguities caused by diagnosis granularity. Note that, we will provide the ICD-10-CM codes along with the original 5,568 classes, each accompanied by its corresponding definition, thus, the dataset can be employed for training diagnosis or visual-language models.

At last, we supplement some normal cases. Despite there exist normal cases on, covering most anatomies and modalities, we additionally collect more normal cases from additional external datasets, including Brain-Tumor-17, CheXpert, Vertebrase-Xray, KneeMRI, and VinDr-Mammo, and, with images available for research under a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, i.e. simply adding the normal case part introduced in them. The expanded normal cases include 2503 cases.

In total, we get 40,936 cases containing 195,010 images labeled by 5568 disorder classes and 930 ICD-10-CM classes and will continually maintain the dataset, growing the case number.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^87068045]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — ICD classification codes identify the primary ICD-10 codes as M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabula, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament, with corresponding ICD-9-CM codes 719.45 Joint pain, 718.65 Unspecified intrapelvic protrusion of acetabulum, 718.15 Loose body in joint, and 718.5 Other derangement of joint pelvic region and thigh. Other ICD-10 codes that may be associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain include M21.0 Valgus deformity, not elsewhere classified, M21.1 Varus deformity, not elsewhere classified, M21.2 Flexion deformity, M24.3 Pathological dislocation and subluxation of joint, not elsewhere classified, M24.4 Recurrent dislocation and subluxation of joint, M24.5 Contracture of joint, M24.6 Ankylosis of joint, M24.9 Joint derangement, unspecified, M25.0 Hemarthrosis, M25.3 Other instability of joint, M25.4 Effusion of joint, M25.6 Stiffness of joint, not elsewhere classified, M25.7 Osteophyte, M25.8 Other specified joint disorders, M25.9 Joint disorder, unspecified, Q65.6 Unstable hip, R29.4 Clicking hip, and S73 Dislocation, sprain, and strain of joint ligaments of hip.

### Accuracy of ICD-10-CM coding for physical child abuse in a paediatric level I trauma centre [^38a6ef1f]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

This retrospective study examined the accuracy of the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) coding for physical child abuse among patients less than 18 years of age who were evaluated due to concern for physical abuse by a multidisciplinary child protection team (MCPT) during 2016–2017 (N = 312) in a paediatric level I trauma centre. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and diagnostic OR for ICD-10-CM coding were calculated and stratified by admission status, using as a reference standard the abuse determination of the MCPT recorded in a hospital registry. Among inpatients, child physical abuse coding sensitivity was 55.6% (95% CI 41.4% to 69.1%) and specificity was 78.6% (95% CI 59.0% to 91.7%), with diagnostic OR of 4.58 (95% CI 1.64 to 12.70). Among outpatients, sensitivity was 22.2% (95% CI 15.5% to 30.2%) and specificity was 86.3% (95% CI 77.7% to 92.5%), with diagnostic OR of 1.80 (95% CI 0.89 to 3.64). Use of ICD-10-CM coded data sets alone for surveillance may significantly underestimate the occurrence of physical child abuse.

Baseline Characteristics

A total of 18 418 patients with CLL/SLL were identified in the overall population (Fig. 1). The mean observation period was 2.4 years, the median age at index was 74 years, and 43% were female (Table 1). Most of the patients with CLL/SLL were insured under a Medicare Advantage plan (80%). The mean CCI score was 2.1, and the 5 most common comorbidities were another malignancy including lymphoma and leukemia (38%), chronic pulmonary disease (22%), peripheral vascular disease (19%), renal disease (19%), and mild-to-moderate diabetes (15%). At baseline, the mean rate of IP stays was 0.26 PPY and mean rate of OP visits was 16.7 PPY. Total baseline all-cause healthcare costs were on average $25 947, with IP ($10 142) and OP ($10 162) visit costs accounting for the largest proportion of the total.

### Identification of work-related injury emergency department visits using international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification (ICD-10-CM) codes [^832d2f59]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

As most of the work-related ED visits in this study were identified by the use of employment status and place of occurrence codes, it is important to note that these external cause of morbidity codes are not required for reimbursement by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or Kentucky statutes; ICD-10-CM coding mandates vary by state. The usefulness of external cause of morbidity codes is limited by the documentation of occupational information by healthcare practitioners. A sample of medical records from 12 EDs in one state reported 98% ICD-9-CM completion and cause of injury accuracy was 65% and 57% for work-related and non-work-related cases, respectively; only 30% of all cases had completed place of occurrence codes; medical record reviews are yet to be performed on work-related ICD-10-CM cases. Clinicians are encouraged to document adequate injury details (eg, mechanism, intent, location and preceding activity) in the medical record for accurate ICD-10-CM coding of the ED encounter by medical coders. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists is encouraged to work with medical and professional associations to develop and deliver continuing education and training to raise awareness about the important role that health practitioners serve in work-related injury surveillance and prevention. Suggested training topics range from injury documentation and data entry to quality and completeness of population-based surveillance. Healthcare providers are integral for the accurate assignment by medical coders of ICD-10-CM work-related injuries seen in the ED.

### Trends in severe maternal morbidity in the US across the transition to ICD-10-CM / PCS from 2012–2019 [^178b52ac]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Surveillance of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is critical for monitoring maternal health and evaluating clinical quality improvement efforts.

Objective

To evaluate national and state trends in SMM rates from 2012 to 2019 and potential disruptions associated with the transition to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification and Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-CM/PCS) in October 2015.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional analysis examined delivery hospitalizations from 2012 through 2019 in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Inpatient Sample and State Inpatient Databases, an all-payer compendium of hospital discharge records from community, nonrehabilitation hospitals. Trends were evaluated using segmented linear binomial regression models that allowed for discontinuities across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. Analyses were completed from April 2021 through March 2022.

Exposures

Time, ICD-10-CM/PCS coding system, and state.

Main Outcomes and Measures

SMM rates, excluding blood transfusion, per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations, overall and by indicator.

Results

From 2012 to 2019, there were 5 964 315 delivery hospitalizations in the national sample representing a weighted total of 29.8 million deliveries with a mean (SD) maternal age of 28.6 (5.9) years. SMM rates increased from 69.5 per 10 000 in 2012 to 79.7 per 10 000 in 2019 (rate difference [RD], 10.2; 95% CI, 5.8 to 14.6) without a significant change across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, -3.2; 95% CI, -6.9 to 0.6). Of 20 SMM indicators, rates for 10 indicators significantly increased while 3 significantly decreased; 5 of these changes were associated with ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. Acute kidney failure had the largest increase, from 6.4 to 15.3 per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations (RD, 8.9; 95% CI, 7.5 to 10.3) with no change associated with ICD transition (RD, -0.1; 95% CI, -1.2 to 1.1). Disseminated intravascular coagulation had the largest decrease from 31.3 to 21.2 per 10 000 (RD, 10.2; 95% CI, -12.8 to -7.5), with a significant drop associated with ICD transition (RD, -7.9; 95% CI, -10.2 to -5.6). State SMM rates significantly decreased for 1 state and significantly increased for 21 states from 2012 to 2019 and associations with ICD transition varied.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, overall US SMM rates increased from 2012 to 2019, which was not associated with the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition. However, data for certain indicators and states may not be comparable across coding systems; efforts are needed to understand SMM increases and state variation.
