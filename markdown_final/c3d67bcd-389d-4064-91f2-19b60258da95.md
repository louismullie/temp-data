## Question

What is significant hematuria?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the definition and clinical significance of "significant hematuria" and the recommended evaluation steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the quantitative definition of microscopic hematuria and how to confirm it. Then, I should verify the malignancy risk thresholds that make hematuria "significant" and how risk stratification changes management. Next, I will examine the initial workup elements and when to repeat testing. After that, I need to check the risk-based imaging and cystoscopy recommendations, including special populations. Finally, I should review follow-up after negative evaluations and synthesize a concise, actionable definition of "significant hematuria" with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the quantitative definition so I don't anchor on a vague concept. Microscopic hematuria is defined as three or more red blood cells per high-power field on microscopic urinalysis, ideally confirmed on repeat testing because hematuria can be intermittent and contamination is common; importantly, dipstick positivity alone is insufficient and must be verified microscopically to avoid false positives and unnecessary workups [^115sJyBv] [^114qfGMw] [^113VR3kr].

> Wait, let me verify the malignancy risk context that makes hematuria "significant". The AUA/SUFU 2025 risk stratification places patients into low/negligible, intermediate, or high risk for urologic malignancy based on age, sex, smoking exposure, degree of hematuria, and history of gross hematuria. Bladder cancer incidence ranges from about 0.4% in low-risk to 6.3% in high-risk cohorts, which directly informs the intensity of evaluation and justifies labeling higher-risk presentations as "significant" hematuria [^113h33Wc] [^112vyxyX].

> Hold on, I should verify the initial evaluation steps before jumping to imaging. All patients with confirmed microscopic hematuria should have a focused history and physical including blood pressure, a repeat urinalysis with microscopy to confirm persistence, serum creatinine to assess renal function, and urine culture if infection is suspected; dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, or proteinuria should prompt nephrology referral for glomerular disease evaluation, and any identified benign causes should be treated with repeat urinalysis to confirm resolution before proceeding to malignancy workup [^116SrBWt] [^1138LVGd] [^117Eoaeg].

> I need to ensure I'm applying the risk-based testing correctly. For low/negligible-risk patients, immediate cystoscopy or imaging is not recommended; instead, repeat urinalysis within 6 months is advised, with escalation only if hematuria persists or increases, aligning with the observed very low malignancy yield in this group and the potential harms of overtesting [^112njtLh] [^115LpRp2]. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy plus renal ultrasound is recommended; for high-risk patients, cystoscopy plus upper tract imaging with CT urography is advised, with MRI urography or retrograde pyelography considered when contrast is contraindicated [^112MZhiB] [^114p2FnW] [^114qfGMw].

> But wait, what if the patient is a woman under 50 without smoking history and has only mild microscopic hematuria? Does this still warrant full evaluation? I should double-check sex-specific guidance. ACOG/AUGS notes that in low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 with fewer than 25 RBC/hpf and no gross hematuria, the malignancy risk is extremely low, and avoiding immediate invasive workup may be reasonable; observational data suggest that applying a higher threshold in this subgroup can reduce unnecessary procedures without missing cancers, though this remains a nuanced, shared decision-making point rather than a blanket exemption from evaluation [^114ToD7A] [^112qLVFD].

> Next, I should review special populations and exceptions so I don't overgeneralize. In children, most hematuria is medical rather than malignant, so evaluation is tailored toward glomerular disease and ultrasound is preferred. In pregnancy, ultrasound is first-line and CT is avoided. In patients with suspected urotrauma, gross hematuria or microscopic hematuria with instability mandates imaging. And in patients with persistent hematuria after treatment of a documented UTI, a malignancy workup is indicated rather than attributing symptoms solely to infection [^112iqPgs] [^113KHNjV] [^117Eoaeg].

> I will now examine follow-up after a negative evaluation, because I need to ensure we don't overmonitor. After a negative risk-based evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making about repeating urinalysis; if subsequent urinalysis is negative, further evaluation can be discontinued, whereas persistent or recurrent microhematuria warrants reconsideration of additional testing, and new gross hematuria or a significant increase in RBCs should trigger renewed evaluation [^116tVVqC] [^111bup6H] [^111xBpaj].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically usable definition of "significant hematuria", but I should confirm it aligns with guideline thresholds. Significant hematuria, in practice, refers to confirmed microscopic hematuria of at least 3 RBC/hpf that persists on repeat testing or is accompanied by features placing the patient at intermediate to high malignancy risk, including older age, substantial smoking exposure, higher RBC counts, prior gross hematuria, or additional urothelial cancer risk factors; importantly, gross hematuria at any age is inherently significant and warrants full urologic evaluation, whereas isolated, low-count microscopic hematuria in clearly low-risk patients may be observed with repeat testing rather than immediately escalated [^113h33Wc] [^113VR3kr] [^112njtLh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the malignancy risk in microscopic hematuria was uniformly around 5%, but I should correct that. Contemporary data show that malignancy risk is highly stratified: approximately 0.4% in low-risk, 1.0% in intermediate-risk, and 6.3% in high-risk groups, which is why the intensity of cystoscopy and imaging varies by risk tier rather than being uniform for all patients with microscopic hematuria [^112vyxyX].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical steps are explicit and actionable. Confirm hematuria with microscopy, exclude transient causes and infection, risk-stratify using AUA/SUFU criteria, apply the corresponding testing pathway with repeat urinalysis for low-risk and cystoscopy plus appropriate imaging for intermediate/high-risk, consider sex-specific nuances in low-risk women, and arrange follow-up with shared decision-making after negative evaluations. Throughout, avoid routine urine cytology or biomarkers in the initial workup except in select high-risk scenarios with equivocal cystoscopy or persistent suspicious symptoms [^111aLfmk] [^114N69ay].

---

Significant hematuria is defined as **≥ 3 RBCs/hpf on microscopy** [^115sJyBv] from two of three properly collected specimens [^115sJyBv], or any gross hematuria. It is clinically important because it can signal serious disease, including malignancy [^112xH9Jc], and warrants a **risk-based evaluation** [^113h33Wc] with urinalysis, serum creatinine, and risk stratification to guide imaging and cystoscopy [^116SrBWt] [^112MZhiB]. Persistent or recurrent hematuria after a negative workup should prompt repeat urinalysis and shared decision-making about further evaluation [^116tVVqC] [^111bup6H].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Microscopic hematuria is **≥ 3 RBCs/hpf** [^115sJyBv] on microscopy from two of three properly collected specimens [^115sJyBv]; **gross hematuria** is visible blood in urine and is inherently significant [^113VR3kr].

---

## Clinical significance

Significant hematuria spans benign to life-threatening causes, including:

- **Malignancy**: Bladder, renal, and ureteral cancers [^112Er8r5].
- **Benign urologic**: Stones, infection, BPH, strictures [^114qfGMw].
- **Glomerular disease**: Proteinuria, dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts [^1138LVGd].

---

## Risk stratification

The AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines stratify patients into **low/negligible-, intermediate-, or high-risk** categories based on age, sex, smoking, RBC count, and risk factors [^113h33Wc] [^114cVMKz]:

| **Risk category** | **Criteria** |
|-|-|
| Low/negligible | - Age < 40 (men) or < 60 (women) <br/> - Never smoker or < 10 pack-years <br/> - 3–10 RBC/hpf <br/> - No urothelial cancer risk factors |
| Intermediate | - Age 40–59 (men) or ≥ 60 (women) <br/> - 10–30 pack-years <br/> - 11–25 RBC/hpf <br/> - Any urothelial cancer risk factor |
| High | - Age ≥ 60 (men) <br/> - > 30 pack-years <br/> - > 25 RBC/hpf <br/> - History of gross hematuria <br/> - High-risk features |

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Initial evaluation

- **History and physical**: Including BP and smoking history [^116SrBWt].
- **Urinalysis**: With microscopy; confirm dipstick positives [^113VR3kr].
- **Serum creatinine**: Assess renal function [^116SrBWt].

---

### Risk-based testing

- **Low/negligible risk**: Repeat urinalysis in 6 months [^112njtLh]; avoid immediate cystoscopy/imaging [^111QMmz7].
- **Intermediate risk**: Cystoscopy and renal ultrasound [^112MZhiB] [^114p2FnW].
- **High risk**: Cystoscopy and upper tract imaging (CT urography preferred) [^114qfGMw].

---

## Follow-up and management

After a negative evaluation, engage in **shared decision-making** about repeating urinalysis [^116tVVqC]; if hematuria persists or recurs, consider additional evaluation [^111bup6H]. Manage identified causes — such as stones, infection, or malignancy — according to standard care [^114qfGMw].

---

## Special considerations

In women, **gynecologic causes** (e.g. prolapse, atrophy) should be considered [^116S2aph] [^112PYwCc]. In children, most hematuria is medical; tailor evaluation and refer to pediatric nephrology when indicated [^112iqPgs] [^114bDi9D]. In anticoagulated patients, evaluate hematuria regardless of anticoagulation status [^113VR3kr].

---

Significant hematuria is defined as **≥ 3 RBCs/hpf** [^115sJyBv] or any gross hematuria and requires a **risk-based evaluation** [^115ivMum] to detect serious disease. Management is guided by risk stratification, with follow-up and shared decision-making after negative evaluations [^116tVVqC].

### The utility of urinalysis in determining the risk of renal relapse in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^113adxYD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The significance of persistent hematuria or proteinuria in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis who are otherwise in clinical remission is unclear.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

A post hoc analysis was conducted using participants enrolled in two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials who had active GN due to ANCA-associated vasculitis, had positive ANCA, and achieved remission by month 6. Dipstick and microscopic urinalyses were performed at each visit. Persistent hematuria or proteinuria for at least 6 months and the cumulative duration of hematuria were examined. Renal relapse was defined as new or worsening red blood cell casts and/or worsening kidney function according to the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis.

Results

There were 149 patients included in this study: 42% had persistent hematuria, and 43% had persistent proteinuria beyond 6 months. Persistent hematuria was associated with a significantly higher risk of relapse, even after adjusting for potential confounders (subdistribution hazard ratio, 3.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.20 to 13.25; P = 0.02); persistent proteinuria was not associated with renal relapse (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.47 to 4.42; P = 0.53). Furthermore, greater cumulative duration of hematuria was significantly associated with a higher risk of renal relapse (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.08 per each month; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.12; P < 0.01). The median time to renal relapse was 22 months.

Conclusions

In patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and kidney involvement who achieve remission after induction therapy, the presence of persistent hematuria, but not proteinuria, is a significant predictor of future renal relapse.

Key Points

Question

What is the long-term risk of cancer after a hospital-based diagnosis of hematuria?

Findings

In this cohort study of 134 173 Danish adults with a hospital-based hematuria diagnosis, a 2-fold increase in risk of bladder and kidney cancers was found 1 to 5 years after the first hematuria diagnosis but was confined to patients who did not undergo cystoscopy within 3 months of their initial hematuria diagnosis. After 1 year, patients had similar risks of both gynecologic and colorectal cancers as the background population, and the risk of hematologic malignant neoplasms remained slightly elevated.

Meaning

These findings may indicate that hospital-based hematuria diagnosis is a marker of greater cancer risk and may inform follow-up recommendations for hematuria.

### The approach to the patient with hematuria [^114r1D75]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is common; whether gross or microscopic, it is incumbent on emergency providers to consider life-threatening and benign processes when evaluating these patients. Most workup is driven by a focused history and physical, including laboratory studies and diagnostic imaging. The cause originates in the genitourinary tract and, as long as the patient remains stable, they can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. The importance of this cannot be stressed enough because hematuria, especially in the elderly, frequently signals the presence of urologic malignancy. In addition, the workup occasionally yields a nongenitourinary tract cause, and these patients often require emergent management.

### Evaluation of hematuria in children [^113qC96H]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The detection of blood in a child's urine is alarming and often prompts many laboratory studies. Hematuria is one of the most important signs of renal or bladder disease, but proteinuria often is a more important diagnostic and prognostic finding. The physician should ensure that serious conditions are not overlooked, avoid unnecessary laboratory studies, reassure the family, and provide guidelines for additional studies if there is a change in the child's course. This article provides an approach to the evaluation and management of hematuria in a child. Many tests have been recommended for the child with hematuria, but no consensus exists on a systematic evaluation.

### Hematuria as a marker of occult urinary tract cancer: advice for high-value care from the American College of Physicians [^113VR3kr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of blood in the urine, or hematuria, is a common finding in clinical practice and can sometimes be a sign of occult cancer. This article describes the clinical epidemiology of hematuria and the current state of practice and science in this context and provides suggestions for clinicians evaluating patients with hematuria.

Methods

A narrative review of available clinical guidelines and other relevant studies on the evaluation of hematuria was conducted, with particular emphasis on considerations for urologic referral.

High-Value Care Advice 1

Clinicians should include gross hematuria in their routine review of systems and specifically ask all patients with microscopic hematuria about any history of gross hematuria.

High-Value Care Advice 2

Clinicians should not use screening urinalysis for cancer detection in asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 3

Clinicians should confirm heme-positive results of dipstick testing with microscopic urinalysis that demonstrates 3 or more erythrocytes per high-powered field before initiating further evaluation in all asymptomatic adults.

High-Value Care Advice 4

Clinicians should refer for further urologic evaluation in all adults with gross hematuria, even if self-limited.

High-Value Care Advice 5

Clinicians should consider urology referral for cystoscopy and imaging in adults with microscopically confirmed hematuria in the absence of some demonstrable benign cause.

High-Value Care Advice 6

Clinicians should pursue evaluation of hematuria even if the patient is receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy.

High-Value Care Advice 7

Clinicians should not obtain urinary cytology or other urine-based molecular markers for bladder cancer detection in the initial evaluation of hematuria.

### Evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria in ambulatory setting [^111ZAZ8y]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Proteinuria and/or hematuria are common findings in ambulatory settings. Proteinuria can be glomerular and/or tubular in origin and it may be transient, orthostatic, or persistent. Persistent proteinuria may be indicative of a serious kidney pathology. Hematuria, which denotes the presence of an increased number of red blood cells in the urine, can be gross or microscopic. Hematuria can originate from the glomeruli or other sites of the urinary tract. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or mild proteinuria in an otherwise healthy child is less likely to be of clinical significance. However, the presence of both requires further workup and careful monitoring.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1166bBG5]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — interventions, comparators, and outcomes note that interventions include urinary cytology and urine-based tumor markers (UBTMs), patient engagement tools and decision aids, and follow-up schedules in patients with initial negative hematuria evaluation. Comparators are defined as any of the included interventions of interest when used as the control and compared to another intervention, and it was anticipated that most identified studies would be single arm. Critical outcomes include hematuria detection concordance (urinalysis [UA] versus dipstick), diagnostic yield incorporating prevalence of malignant and/or benign diagnoses, diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and false positive rate), risk stratification for urologic malignancy with system performance characteristics (predictive ability, prognostic ability, number needed to screen), and rate of adverse events and number needed to harm; important outcomes include disease specific survival rates, diagnostic grade/stage of malignancy, prevalence of risk factors in hematuria patients, patient satisfaction, and quality of life.

Microhematuria literature search scope — OVID was used to systematically search MEDLINE and EMBASE for hematuria studies meeting panel-defined criteria. For the 2020 guideline, 5 systematic reviews and 91 primary literature studies from January 2010 through December 2019 met the study selection criteria and formed the evidence base. Given the low volume of MH-only studies, combined MH and GH populations were included, and reference lists of systematic reviews and primary literature were screened for potentially useful studies.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1168oDQh]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — practice patterns and evaluation gaps — show low referral and procedure use, with a 2008 primary care study reporting less than 50% referred for urologic evaluation, contemporary evaluation rates under 10%, and among patients with risk factors only 23% receiving any imaging and 13% undergoing cystoscopy; underuse of cystoscopy is concerning given that most cancers in patients with hematuria are bladder cancers, optimally detected with cystoscopy.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^112njtLh]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — low/negligible-risk initial evaluation: In low/ negligible-risk patients with microhematuria, clinicians should obtain repeat urinalysis within six months rather than perform immediate cystoscopy or imaging (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Thus, given the low risk of malignancy and the potential harms of over-evaluation, the Panel recommends against routine cystoscopy and imaging for the initial evaluation of patients in the low-risk category and has renamed the category as low/negligible-risk to emphasize this point. The Panel acknowledges, however, that there may be scenarios in which cystoscopy in low/negligible-risk patients may be warranted based on symptoms, clinical suspicion or patient preference, and given the intermittent nature of hematuria, the Panel recommends a repeat UA with subsequent risk-based evaluation predicated on those results. Supporting validation studies found extremely low rates of malignancy among patients in the low-risk category (0%, 0.4% and 0%, respectively), and one study followed low-risk patients for a median of 26 months with no additional cancers identified.

### Hypofractionated radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: an ASTRO, ASCO, and AUA evidence-based guideline [^113PWBa1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Moderate hypofractionation for localized prostate cancer — late toxicity and urinary symptom signals compared with conventional fractionation are summarized as follows: Phase III trials "do not show a consistent increase in late toxicity for moderate hypofractionation regimens", although one report noted "late grade 2 GI toxicity (risk ratio [RR] 1.59) and GU toxicity (RR 1.31) with hypofractionation". In Italian randomized controlled trials, the hypofractionated arm had "a significant increase in all grade late hematuria (17% versus 4%), although the events were predominantly grade 1 and no difference in actuarial grade ≥ 2 hematuria was found". In HYPRO, item-level analysis associated hypofractionation with "significant nocturia (> 6 times per night – OR 4.94, 95% CI: 1.87–13.09) and incontinence (OR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03–2.24)", and HYPRO delivered "6460 cGy in 19 fractions of 340 cGy", a higher dose per fraction than other moderate hypofractionation RCTs.

### Sole dependence on urine testing strips and the ability to identify clinically significant disease: challenging the current paradigm for heme detection in general clinical situations [^114vxgmo]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The ability of health care professionals to provide patient care is potentially compromised when predicated on untested, although longstanding, perspectives. One such example is urinalysis testing, which has been currently simplified to use only urine testing strips for detection of microscopic hematuria.

Objective

To determine whether urine testing strips are sufficient for identification of clinically significant findings in urinalysis.

Methods

To determine the presence of microscopic hematuria, I examined a collection of urine specimens that had tested heme negative during the 3-month study period.

Results

Of the 342 patients from whom urine specimens were examined during this interval, 50 had microscopic hematuria, despite having tested negative for heme via urine testing strip. Also, 30% were not receiving any medication known to produce microscopic hematuria, and 18% had clinically significant pathology.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of significant clinical pathologic manifestations would have been compromised had microscopic examination not been performed on the urine specimens from the cohort individuals. Examination of the novel approach of including microscopic examination of specimens in a specific clinical situation challenges the dominant paradigm of reliance on assaying using urine testing strips only, revealing that the current method is not only unreliable for determining microscopic hematuria but also is less than optimal in general clinical practice. The findings of this study provide evidence of the importance of microscopic evaluation as a routine component of urinalysis.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to suspect RPGN when a patient with no obvious cause of progressive or non-resolving AKI has urine dipstick results showing hematuria and proteinuria, without UTI or trauma due to catheterization.

### Prevalence and associated factors for dipstick microscopic hematuria in men [^111M5miS]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

How would the identification of factors associated with MH help counselling the patient? The yield of finding malignancy in patients with MH is very low. AUA meta-analysis found that the incidence of malignancy upon workup of asymptomatic MH was 3.3% when based on one positive urine sample. According to current guidelines, MH prompts a workup of the lower and upper tracts with cystoscopy and abdominal imaging representing a significant cost to health care systems. Further prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether the identification of factors associated with increased risk of MH may help stratifying patients who can obviate investigations with invasive procedures.

Some limitations exist in our study. All past medical history was self-reported by patients and may thus induce a bias. The population presenting to this health fair may not be representative of the general population as patients with specific concerns or who do not have regular medical follow-up may have been overrepresented. However, the prevalence of smoking and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease was similar to rates in the general Canadian population. Furthermore, this was a single institution experience and this may limit generalizability of our findings. Another limitation is that the dipstick microhematuria was not confirmed with microscopy in this study. Several studies have confirmed that dipstick urinalysis has good specificity (65–95%) and sensitivity (91–100%) in detecting microhematuria but should still be confirmed with microscopy before ordering costly and invasive testing. Lastly and importantly, follow-up data was not available for our patient population to identify if these patients ultimately underwent full workup and their findings.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^117Eoaeg]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU microhematuria — Urinary tract infection (UTI)–attributed hematuria and follow-up: In patients with hematuria attributed to a urinary tract infection, clinicians should obtain a urinalysis with microscopic evaluation following treatment to ensure resolution of the hematuria (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C); patients suspected of having UTI should undergo urine culture and, if necessary, antibiotic treatment, those suspected to have a UTI as the etiology of MH should be treated for the UTI and then undergo repeat UA to confirm resolution, and if MH does not resolve following UTI treatment, a risk-based urologic evaluation should be performed.

### Assessment of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults [^111xfM7J]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Although routine screening for bladder cancer is not recommended, microscopic hematuria is often incidentally discovered by primary care physicians. The American Urological Association has published an updated guideline for the management of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is defined as the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field visible in a properly collected urine specimen without evidence of infection. The most common causes of microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and urinary calculi. However, up to 5% of patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria are found to have a urinary tract malignancy. The risk of urologic malignancy is increased in men, persons older than 35 years, and persons with a history of smoking. Microscopic hematuria in the setting of urinary tract infection should resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment; persistence of hematuria warrants a diagnostic workup. Dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine levels, or hypertension in the presence of microscopic hematuria should prompt concurrent nephrologic and urologic referral. The upper urinary tract is best evaluated with multiphasic computed tomography urography, which identifies hydronephrosis, urinary calculi, and renal and ureteral lesions. The lower urinary tract is best evaluated with cystoscopy for urethral stricture disease, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder masses. Voided urine cytology is no longer recommended as part of the routine evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, unless there are risk factors for malignancy.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1166PG9L]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria — prevalence and malignancy rates: Hematuria is estimated to account for over 20% of urology evaluations, and screening studies have noted a prevalence range of microhematuria among healthy volunteers of 2.4%-31.1%. A recent prospective observational study of over 3,500 patients referred for evaluation of hematuria noted a 10.0% rate of urinary tract cancer, with 13.2% for patients with gross hematuria (GH) and 3.1% among patients with microhematuria only. Aggregate data from 17 prior microhematuria screening studies published between 1980 to 2011 identified in the 2012 AUA Guideline reported a urinary tract malignancy rate of 2.6% (range 0% to 25.8%). Eleven more contemporary studies enrolling microhematuria patients dating from 2010 to 2019 reported an aggregate urinary tract malignancy rate of 1% (range 0.3% to 6.25%).

### The prognostic value of visible hematuria is only significant in T1a renal cell carcinoma: a single-center retrospective study [^114DdBus]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present study showed that visible hematuria was an independent risk factor for T1a RCC. The predictive value of visible hematuria for CSS was more significant in cases of RCC tumors ≤ 2 cm, but did not reach significance in cases of T1b RCC. Visible hematuria may increase the risk of T1a patients to be similar to those with T1b, but the risk was still much lower than that of T3a patients. T1a RCC patients with visible hematuria should be intensively monitored after surgery and during follow-up.

### An evidence-based microscopic hematuria care pathway optimizes decision-making among providers [^112PYwCc]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Microscopic hematuria (MH) has many etiologies in women and requires specific gynecologic evaluation. We created a standardized MH pathway to serve as an evidence-based decision aid for providers in our practice.

Methods

Using a modified Delphi process, a multidisciplinary team reviewed existing guidelines for MH diagnosis and treatment to reach consensus on care pathway components.

Results

Entry into the care pathway by an advanced practice provider is determined by the finding of ≥ 3 red blood cells per high-power field (RBC/HPF) on microscopic urinalysis. Initial evaluation includes history and physical exam. If there are signs of a gynecologic cause of MH, the conditions are treated and repeat urinalysis is performed in 6 months. If repeat urinalysis shows persistent MH or there are no other apparent causes for MH, we proceed with risk stratification. Through shared decision-making, low-risk patients may undergo repeat urinalysis in 6 months or cystoscopy with urinary tract ultrasound. For intermediate-risk patients, cystoscopy and urinary tract ultrasound are recommended. For high-risk patients, cystoscopy and axial upper urinary tract imaging are recommended. If evaluation is positive, urology referral is provided. If evaluation is negative, low-risk patients are released from care, but intermediate-risk or high-risk patients undergo repeat urinalysis in 12 months. If repeat urinalysis is positive, shared decision-making is used to determine a plan.

Conclusions

We developed an MH care pathway to standardize care of women with MH across a multidisciplinary group. This pathway serves as a component of value-based care and supports evidence-based care by providers.

### Hematuria: a problem-based imaging algorithm illustrating the recent Dutch guidelines on hematuria [^111psr2t]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a problem-based algorithm in the work-up of patients with Hematuria. Since the 2010 Dutch Guideline on Hematuria was problem-based, this served as an illustration for such an approach.

Conclusion

The work-up of hematuria should be individualized and risk-based. Given the a priori low likelihood of cancer in hematuria, risk categories should be established and imaging algorithms should be tailored to populations at low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk for developing urothelial cancer.

### Development and multicenter case-control validation of urinary comprehensive genomic profiling for urothelial carcinoma diagnosis, surveillance, and risk-prediction [^112LrpXN]. Clinical Cancer Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study constitutes the first blinded clinical validation of the UroAmp cancer diagnostic platform. Compared with published reports of currently available tests, we report superior performance metrics for the detection of urothelial carcinoma during initial diagnosis, with higher combined sensitivity and specificity and improved DLRs. This performance is paired with high-PPV grade prediction. In the urothelial carcinoma surveillance setting, UroAmp significantly prognosticated future recurrence.

Initial diagnosis

Clinical evidence makes it clear that better tools are needed to accurately risk-stratify patients with hematuria. Despite recommendations, patients with hematuria continue to be under-referred for evaluation, and urologists continue to underuse cystoscopy in intermediate- and high-risk patients. As a result, the prevalence of muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma has been stable for the last 30 years, despite significant advances in other types of cancer. Clearly, new approaches to early detection are needed to improve compliance with guidelines among primary care physicians and change the paradigm of diagnosis.

We know that detecting urothelial carcinoma in patients with microhematuria correlates with a lower stage of disease compared with those with gross hematuria. Therefore, increasing evaluation of microhematuria is likely to improve outcomes overall. However, due to the high prevalence of microhematuria, referring every case for cystoscopic evaluation would overwhelm urology practices. Instead, patient referral should be strategic and use of cystoscopy for evaluation should be selective. Clinical-risk factors, such as smoking history and hematuria severity, are helpful, and risk calculators developed to assign bladder cancer likelihood to patients with hematuria have demonstrated impressive performance. But the adoption of these calculators has been poor, as the necessary clinical risk factors are not routinely charted or accurately collected. Although these calculators are helpful at identifying extremes (very low-risk or very high-risk), they still rely on population averages rather than measuring individual biologic risk. UroAmp's high sensitivity and specificity (95%/90%) in initial diagnosis means it could be used to triage patients with microhematuria, reducing the burden of evaluation while identifying those most likely to have urothelial carcinoma. Furthermore, because UroAmp does not use clinical demographics or risk factors, it can complement clinical-risk stratification systems, as demonstrated in Table 3.

### A segregation index combining phenotypic (clinical characteristics) and genotypic (gene expression) biomarkers from a urine sample to triage out patients presenting with hematuria who have a low probability of urothelial carcinoma [^113i71oe]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Such hematuria-related referrals place a significant clinical burden on urologists, as all patients must undergo a full work-up to provide an often inconclusive diagnosis. Furthermore, the existing diagnostic tests – many of which are invasive or have high radiation loadings – can have a detrimental effect on patient quality of life (QoL), especially if the patient receives repeated cystoscopies as mandated in the current guidelines. It has been reported that for cystoscopies performed without prophylactic antibiotics, 22% of patients had asymptomatic bacteriuria and 1.9% of patients developed a febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) within 30 days. Other studies have also reported a high prevalence of macrohematuria, pain on voiding and transient erectile dysfunction in men following cystoscopy.

Healthcare systems also incur a significant financial burden as a result of patients with hematuria undergoing a full urological work up and it has been concluded that urine cytology adds costs without offering any significant diagnostic benefit. Consequently, integrating an accurate, non-invasive test into the primary clinical work-up of patients presenting with hematuria allows physicians to effectively triage patients with hematuria, thereby reducing the number of patients undergoing a full urological work-up and investigative cystoscopy for UC, and offers significant benefits to both patients and healthcare systems.

### Hematuria in children [^112iqPgs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Children with hematuria require a thorough history and physical examination. Not all children with hematuria require the same investigations. The only laboratory test uniformly required for children with the various presentations of hematuria is a complete urinalysis with a microscopic examination. The rest of the evaluation is tailored according to the pertinent history, physical examination, and other abnormalities on the urinalysis. This article has provided a brief summary of the more common causes of pediatric hematuria and suggestions for tailoring the patient's evaluation according to the presentation. Most causes of hematuria in pediatrics represent medical conditions that often require referral to a pediatric nephrologist. Indications for referral to a urologist are more limited and include stones that do not pass spontaneously or are more than 5 mm in diameter, renal injury from trauma, anatomic abnormalities, or gross hematuria that seems to originate from the urinary tract and is without an identified cause.

### Imaging of hematuria [^112Er8r5]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Hematuria may have a number of causes, of which the more common are urinary tract calculi, urinary tract infection, urinary tract neoplasms (including renal cell carcinoma and urothelial tumors), trauma to the urinary tract, and renal parenchymal disease. This article discusses the current status of imaging of patients suspected of having urologic causes of hematuria. The role of all modalities, including plain radiography, intravenous urography or excretory urography, retrograde pyelography, ultrasonography, and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in evaluation of these patients is discussed. The article highlights the current status of MDCT urography in imaging of patients with hematuria, and discusses various-often controversial-issues, such as optimal protocol design, accuracy of the technique in imaging of the urothelium, and the significant issue of radiation dose associated with MDCT urography.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^116YcPGC]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Current practice patterns for the evaluation of microscopic hematuria include assessing the lower and upper urinary tracts. Due to the low prevalence of bladder cancer and the low sensitivity of cytology detecting bladder cancer, the exact role of urinary cytology in the evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria may be minimal.

### Persistent hematuria in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis during clinical remission: chronic glomerular lesion or low-grade active renal vasculitis? [^114e9dFS]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Whether persistent hematuria in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) during clinical remission reflects active disease or chronic glomerular injury is uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the significance of persistent hematuria during clinical remission in a large cohort of AAV patients.

Methods

A cohort of 219 AAV patients in complete clinical remission after induction therapy at our center was retrospectively studied, and their clinical and laboratory data as well as long-term outcomes were analyzed.

Results

A total of 80 out of 219 patients had persistent hematuria during clinical remission of AAV. Compared with patients without hematuria during remission, the slope of eGFR decline in patients with persistent hematuria was significantly higher during the long-term follow-up [3.6 (IQR 1.2, 7.2) vs. 1.5 (IQR 0.2, 4.0) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year, P < 0.001]. Among the 80 patients with persistent hematuria during remission, there was little difference between those with fast and slow decline of eGFR, as divided by either median or interquartile range of the slope of eGFR decline. We also compared patients without hematuria who had a slope of eGFR decline that was lower than the median level of the slope of eGFR decline with those with persistent hematuria, and found that patients with hematuria had significantly lower levels of CRP and ESR at baseline and higher levels of ANCA at remission.

Conclusions

Among the AAV patients who achieved clinical remission after immunosuppressive therapy, those with persistent hematuria are not rare and may reflect either chronic renal damage or low-grade active renal disease.

### The prognostic value of visible hematuria is only significant in T1a renal cell carcinoma: a single-center retrospective study [^114CQF9R]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Predictive models for the clinical manifestations of RCC are not uncommon. The symptomatic presentation is correlated with aggressive histology and advanced disease, and incidental tumors may be frequently detected in female and elderly patients. Patard et al. reported that the symptom classification remains an independent prognostic marker together with the TNM stage and Furhman grade. Szendroi et al. demonstrated that weight loss and flank pain are frequently neglected and possible symptoms of renal cancer, and the presence of symptoms is independently correlated with intraoperative complications and survival in renal cancer patients. These studies focused primarily on the overall clinical predictive model of each stage of RCC, but no study has analyzed the clinical significance of visible hematuria in cases of T1 RCC. Thus, visible hematuria should be paid more attention. We conclude that visible hematuria is an independent risk factor for the prognosis (PFS and CSS) in patients with T1a RCC. The risk is more significant for CSS in ≤ 2 cm tumors with visible hematuria than in T1b RCC. In renal cell carcinoma, T1a represents an earlier stage within the T classification, whereas T1b denotes a relatively more advanced stage, with tumors of larger volume and higher malignancy. This may have been one of the reasons why gross hematuria did not confer a significant prognostic difference among T1b patients. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines define active surveillance as the initial monitoring of tumors using abdominal imaging techniques with delayed intervention when indicated. Elderly patients and those with small renal masses (≤ 2 cm) and other comorbidities often have low RCC-specific mortality. Our research suggested that patients presenting with small renal tumors (≤ 2 cm) and visible hematuria might be candidates for a more proactive treatment strategy.

### Evaluation of the patient with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria [^112zzZRS]. Academic Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) is relatively common in clinical practice but the etiology remains unclear in the majority of patients; it is rarely related to genitourinary malignancies. The 2012 guidelines of the American Urological Association recommend an evaluation after a single positive urinalysis with mandatory upper tract evaluation in all patients, preferably with CT urography (CTU). The likelihood of detecting significant upper track abnormalities, particularly malignancies is low with CTU, while incidental extraurinary abnormalities are often found, the majority of which are not clinically significant. The workup for these incidental findings has significant financial and clinical implications. Primary care physicians, who are most apt to encounter patients with AMH, have a low rate of adherence to the AUA guidelines, possibly as a result of the broadening of criteria for AMH evaluation by the AUA, with resultant uncertainty amongst primary care physicians about the appropriate candidates for such evaluation. Selection of subgroups of patients with risk factors for GU malignancies who may benefit from a complete evaluation is essential, as opposed to evaluation of all patients classified as having AMH.

For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Prevalence and associated factors for dipstick microscopic hematuria in men [^112kL3kt]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Many etiologies exist for microscopic hematuria such as infection, urolithiasis, benign prostate hyperplasia, malignancy, nephropathies or physiologic. About 3.6% of patients presenting with microscopic hematuria will present a urinary tract malignancy but positive predictive value of microhematuria for malignancy is low and thus population screening has not been recommended. The definition of microscopic hematuria is three or greater red-blood cells (RBC) per high power field on a properly collected microscopic urinalysis as per the American Urological Association guidelines whereas the Canadian Urological Association guidelines require confirmation with a second microscopic urinalysis. However, in clinical practice, microscopy is often not ordered or not performed by the laboratory. Several studies have confirmed that dipstick urinalysis has good specificity (65–95%) and sensitivity (91–100%) in detecting microhematuria; rates of false positives and negatives are low and can be due to hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, ascorbic acid or reducing agents such as povidone.

Routine screening dipstick urinalysis is currently not recommended by any organization, including the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care, as there is insufficient data to support this type of screening. However, up to 50% of general practitioners perform a routine urinalysis on all their patients as part of annual health screening visits. Microscopic hematuria (MH) is a common finding during routine urinalysis and leads to frequent referrals to urologists and nephrologists. According to current guidelines, MH often prompts a workup of the lower and upper tracts with cystoscopy and abdominal imaging representing a significant cost to health care systems.

Our primary objective was to identify and describe factors associated with microscopic hematuria. We also report on the prevalence of MH in the male population presenting to a men's health fair.

### The application of new complex indicators in the detection of urine [^111w9NYz]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In combination with clinical information, the accuracy of urine RBC counting could be improved, and the integrity of hematuria diagnosis could also be promoted simultaneously to achieve or approach the non-invasive diagnosis of CKD. This small sample size study might provide crucial support for the diagnosis and treatment of patients who are contraindicated for renal biopsy and likely guide and support clinical activities for primary health care institutes that do not qualify to perform renal biopsy.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults [^115UnMZX]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Microscopic hematuria, a common finding on routine urinalysis of adults, is clinically significant when three to five red blood cells per high-power field are visible. Etiologies of microscopic hematuria range from incidental causes to life-threatening urinary tract neoplasm. The lack of evidence-based imaging guidelines can complicate the family physician's decision about the best way to proceed. Patients with proteinuria, red cell casts, and elevated serum creatinine levels should be referred promptly to a nephrology subspecialist. Microscopic hematuria with signs of urinary tract infection should resolve with appropriate treatment of the underlying infection. Patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or with hematuria persisting after treatment of urinary tract infection also need to be evaluated. Because upper and lower urinary tract pathologies often coexist, patients should be evaluated using cytology plus intravenous urography, computed tomography, or ultrasonography. When urine cytology results are abnormal, cystoscopy should be performed to complete the investigation.

### Variation in the intensity of hematuria evaluation: a target for primary care quality improvement [^117Dbj3Q]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria is a common clinical finding and represents the most frequent presenting sign of bladder cancer. The American Urological Association recommends cystoscopy and abdomino-pelvic imaging for patients aged more than 35 years. Nonetheless, less than half of patients presenting with hematuria undergo proper evaluation. We sought to identify clinical and nonclinical factors associated with evaluation of persons with newly diagnosed hematuria.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study, using claims data and laboratory values. The primary exposure was practice site, as a surrogate for nonclinical, potentially modifiable sources of variation. Primary outcomes were cystoscopy or abdomino-pelvic imaging within 180 days after hematuria diagnosis. We modeled the association between clinical and nonclinical factors and appropriate hematuria evaluation.

Results

We identified 2455 primary care patients aged 40 years or more and diagnosed with hematuria between 2004 and 2012 in the absence of other explanatory diagnosis; 13.7% of patients underwent cystoscopy within 180 days. Multivariate logistic regression revealed significant variation between those who did and did not undergo evaluation in age, gender, and anticoagulant use (P < .001, P = 0.036, P = 0.028, respectively). Addition of practice site improved the predictive discrimination of each model (P < .001). Evaluation was associated with a higher rates of genitourinary neoplasia diagnosis.

Conclusions

Patients with hematuria rarely underwent complete evaluation. Although established risk factors for malignancy were associated with increasing use of diagnostic testing, factors unassociated with risk, such as practice site, also accounted for significant variation. Inconsistency across practice sites is undesirable and may be amenable to quality improvement interventions.

### Do patients with pelvic organ prolapse have an increased frequency of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria? [^116S2aph]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) in patients with pelvic organ prolapse.

Methods

The Urogynecology patient database was reviewed for patients presenting between July 2010 and April 2011 inclusive. We compared the prevalence of AMH in patients with no prolapse with those with prolapse. A post-hoc analysis was performed to evaluate if overall stage of prolapse was related to the presence of AMH. Pearson chi-square analysis was used for categorical variables, and P values < .05 were deemed statistically significant.

Results

Of the 230 women with evaluable AMH data, 29 (12.6%) had AMH. Baseline patient demographic data did not significantly differ between groups. Women with prolapse had a higher prevalence of AMH compared with women with no prolapse (18.3% vs 5.1%, P = 0.003). There was a significant difference in the distribution of AMH by stage of prolapse, with AMH more prevalent among women with higher stages of prolapse (P = 0.007).

Conclusion

Women with prolapse beyond the hymen have a significantly higher prevalence of AMH when compared with women with prolapse at or above the hymen. We suggest an overall rate of AMH in the Urogynecologic population of 12.6%.

### Radiologic evaluation of hematuria: guidelines from the American college of radiology's appropriateness criteria [^113GY6dd]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Hematuria, symptomatic and incidental, that involves more than three red blood cells per high-power field on two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens warrants some type of imaging to evaluate the upper tracts. Traditionally, excretory urography or the intravenous pyelogram has been the mainstay of the hematuria work-up, but computed tomography urography has more recently been recognized to have significant advantages. Multidetector computed tomography urography, a cross-sectional technique, is less susceptible to overlying bowel gas and more sensitive for detection of small tumors and calculi. Moreover, intravenous-pyelogram-like images can be obtained by using reconstruction techniques. In specific cases, ultrasound examination and magnetic resonance imaging can also be useful, and are particularly helpful in children and pregnant women. Neither modality has the sensitivity of computed tomography for calculi, but small tumors may be visible on magnetic resonance imaging. This article reviews the appropriateness criteria for the various radiologic imaging tests used in the evaluation of hematuria, as proposed by the American College of Radiology.

Microhematuria follow-up after a negative evaluation: in patients with a negative risk-based hematuria evaluation, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding whether to repeat urinalysis in the future (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation and subsequent negative urinalysis, clinicians may discontinue further evaluation for microhematuria (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who have persistent or recurrent microhematuria at the time of repeat urinalysis, clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding the need for additional evaluation (Expert Opinion). For patients with a prior negative hematuria evaluation who develop gross hematuria, significant increase in degree of microhematuria, or new urologic symptoms, clinicians should initiate further evaluation (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Most patients who have an appropriate risk-stratified negative hematuria evaluation do not require ongoing urologic monitoring and may be safely discharged from the urology clinic after shared decision-making and discussion of the best available evidence, and for these patients a future UA may be considered.

### Collectives of diagnostic biomarkers identify high-risk subpopulations of hematuria patients: exploiting heterogeneity in large-scale biomarker data [^1124uni1]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

If specificities and sensitivities for both biochips were > 90%, this would mean a high-risk cancer patient would have a 1:10 chance of being wrongly classified as low-risk and subsequently a 1:10 chance of being wrongly classified as a control. In this scenario, out of 1,000 high-risk cancer patients approximately 810 would be correctly classified as high-risk cancers, approximately 90 as high-risk controls, approximately 90 as low-risk cancers and approximately 10 as low-risk controls (Figure 4). Following biochip analyses, patients with scores ≤ 0.2 from both biochips and no clinical risk factors, that is, low-risk controls, could be monitored in primary care. This would lead to a reduction in the number of cystoscopies in these patients. In another scenario, a proportion of patients might be assigned as high-risk control patients following analyses of their samples using the biochips. These patients should be investigated further because they could have other diseases, for example, kidney disease which could then be managed appropriately. In this way, improved triage would result in expeditious diagnosis for a greater proportion of patients with hematuria who would then receive earlier and more effective therapeutic interventions. This would represent a significant healthcare improvement.

Single biomarkers have failed to be diagnostic for hematuria and many other complex diseases. Panels of biomarkers, in addition to clinical information, provide a large array of patient data that can be highly informative and have potential for diagnostic and prognostic decision making. However, the difficulties to date with large amounts of patient biomarker data are that they do not manage or group all patients in a clinically meaningful way. Systems biology is a developing technology that has evolved new and different ways to analyze very large and complex datasets, such as those relating to sequencing of the genome and those collected from complex diseases. We have described how patients with hematuria naturally cluster into risk groupings on the basis of their individual biomarker profiles. This challenges the current practice in hematuria clinics which prioritizes diagnosis of patients with bladder cancer. Patients in the 'high-risk' clusters included controls, that is, patients without bladder cancer. However these 'controls' may have other cancers or may have neoplasms at very early stages of carcinogenesis, that is, below the size threshold for detection. Because cystoscopy is not a perfect diagnostic tool and because there is an urgent need to identify all patients with serious disease at the hematuria clinic, the findings in this paper represent a significant advance in the approach to triage and diagnosis of hematuria patients.

### Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in adults: summary of the AUA best practice policy recommendations [^115sJyBv]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association (AUA) convened the Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microscopic Hematuria to formulate policy statements and recommendations for the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria in adults. The recommended definition of microscopic hematuria is three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. This definition accounts for some degree of hematuria in normal patients, as well as the intermittent nature of hematuria in patients with urologic malignancies. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has causes ranging from minor findings that do not require treatment to highly significant, life-threatening lesions. Therefore, the AUA recommends that an appropriate renal or urologic evaluation be performed in all patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria who are at risk for urologic disease or primary renal disease. At this time, there is no consensus on when to test for microscopic hematuria in the primary care setting, and screening is not addressed in this report. However, the AUA report suggests that the patient's history and physical examination should help the physician decide whether testing is appropriate.

### Commentary: the role of cytologic analysis of voided urine in the work-up of asymptomatic microhematuria [^111MvFsE]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Additionally, in the workup of hematuria, microscopic or otherwise, the urologist's job goes beyond ruling out the presence or absence of urinary tract malignancy. Stones, vascular malformations, inflammatory as well as infectious lesions detectable by cystoscopy, may all result in blood in the urine. Furthermore, bladder wash cytology, which has increased sensitivity compared to cytology on voided urine specimens, may be obtained during cystoscopy, serving to add diagnostic value over voided urine cytology even in the face of CIS missed cystoscopically or radiologically. In sum, voided urine cytology does not obviate the need for cystoscopy. For similar reasons, voided urine cytology cannot replace radiographic studies, which can detect not only benign lesions but neoplasms outside the collecting system, for example, in the renal parenchyma.

Voided urine cytology does not appear to have a primary role in the evaluation of asymptomatic microhematuria but may have a role as a supplement to cystoscopy and excretory urography in a minority of cases (for example when "invisible" diseases such as CIS are suspected.) However, hematuria is a "late" detector of bladder cancer and almost never is voided urine cytology the single test during a hematuria workup that detects urothelial cancer.

One may argue that in the above series by Hofland and Mariani, for the 4 patients in whom malignancy was solely detected by urine cytology that this test proved to be very valuable. But the question arises, "for a disease with a rather low prevalence (urothelial CIS), is a test with a very small unique diagnostic yield justified?" If one extrapolates the cost analysis by Hofland and Mariani to the general population, the magnitude of inefficiency becomes glaringly obvious. Asymptomatic microhematuria is prevalent in up to 21% of the US population or roughly 60 million Americans. If each individual was only tested once, cytology alone would cost over $3 billion. Furthermore, if a similar yield of diagnostically unique information of 0.6% was applied to this population, over $2.98 billion would be spent on a relatively insensitive and redundant test. In today's political environment where increased pressure is being placed on the health care system to reign in costs, the elimination of voided urinary cytology in the workup of asymptomatic microhematuria has the potential to effect significant savings.

### Microscopic hematuria in adults: updated recommendations from… [^114qfGMw]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Defining Microscopic Hematuria The AUA defines microscopic hematuria as three or more red blood cells per high-power field on urine microscopy. A threshold between three and 10 RBC/HPF has the highest sensitivity for detecting bladder cancer and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. A single urinalysis is sufficient because 95% of microscopic hematuria is detected in one sample. Because at least 20% of positive dipstick tests for blood have no red blood cells on subsequent urine microscopy, any positive dipstick should be confirmed. Initial Evaluation Initial evaluation for patients with microscopic hematuria involves searching for a likely cause to be addressed. Common causes include urinary tract infections, menstruation, external genital lesions, vaginal atrophy, pelvic organ prolapse, urolithiasis, benign prostatic enlargement, and urethral stricture. After addressing any of these issues, a repeat urinalysis should be performed.

With conditions such as prostatic hypertrophy, vaginal atrophy, and pelvic organ prolapse, microscopic hematuria may not completely resolve. In these cases, full evaluation may be warranted. Obtaining a catheter urine sample also may be helpful. Risk Stratification If the initial evaluation suggests no obvious source of microscopic hematuria, possible risk factors should be assessed. Smoking, higher numbers of RBC/HPF, persistent hematuria, and history of gross hematuria increase the risk of malignancy. HIGH RISK Patients at high risk have at least one high-risk factor, including age 60 years or older, more than a 30 pack-year smoking history, more than 25 RBC/HPF on microscopic urinalysis, and a history of gross hematuria. For these patients, the guideline recommends cystoscopy and computed tomography urography.

Magnetic resonance urography and retrograde pyelography with renal imaging are reasonable if contrast media is contraindicated because of kidney disease or allergy. The guideline does contain an important warning: the need to consider a microscopic hematuria evaluation in patients with recurrent UTI, especially with negative culture results. About one in 10 women and one in 20 men with bladder cancer receive more than three antibiotic courses for UTI before cancer is diagnosed. Published source: J Urol. October 2020; 204: 778–786.

### Collectives of diagnostic biomarkers identify high-risk subpopulations of hematuria patients: exploiting heterogeneity in large-scale biomarker data [^116ReiU7]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The number of patients presenting with hematuria is progressively increasing in our aging population and the diagnosis of serious diseases in some of these patients can be delayed when triage is ineffective. Therefore, novel alternative risk stratification approaches are needed.

Hematuria, that is, the presence of blood in urine, is a presenting symptom for a variety of diseases. The final diagnosis for hematuric patients ranges from no diagnosis, through benign conditions including urinary infection, stone disease, benign prostate enlargement (BPE) to renal diseases and malignant causes. Urothelial cancer (UC), the most common malignancy in hematuric patients, is the fourth most common cancer in men and was the estimated cause of death in 150,200 people worldwide in 2008. Bladder cancer is associated with many risk factors. Smoking increases the risk of UC fourfold and cessation of smoking is associated with a decreased risk.

The risk parameters that are currently used to tailor follow-up for patients diagnosed with UC, include pathological parameters, that is, grade, stage and associated carcinoma in situ (CIS), together with resistance to Bacille Calmette-Guerin treatment. At the time of diagnosis, approximately 70% of patients diagnosed with UC have tumors that are pathologically staged as pTa, pT1 or CIS, that is, non-muscle invasive (NMI) disease. The remaining patients present with muscle invasive UC (MI UC) which has a high-risk of progression to a more life threatening disease. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to predict correctly the outcome for patients. This is largely attributable to the molecular heterogeneity within tumors which means that a spectrum of outcomes, spanning from negligible risk to life threatening prognosis, exist within the same pathological classification. For this reason, all patients with NMI disease have frequent surveillance cystoscopies and those with MI UC have radiological surveillance for lymph node recurrence or distant metastasis.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113h33Wc]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU microhematuria risk stratification system 2025 — Patients are grouped by malignancy risk as Low/Negligible (0–0.4%), Intermediate (0.2–3.1%), or High (1.3–6.3%), with classification based on the number of criteria met (Low requires "All"; Intermediate and High require "One or more"). Degree of hematuria on a single urinalysis is 3–10 RBC/HPF* for Low, 11–25 RBC/HPF* for Intermediate, and > 25 RBC/HPF* for High; alternative criteria include "Previously low/negligible-risk patient with no prior evaluation and 3–25 RBC/HPF* on repeat urinalysis" for Intermediate and "History of gross hematuria" for High. Age criteria are: for women, < 60 years (Low) and ≥ 60 years (Intermediate), and "Women should not be categorized as high-risk solely based on age"; for men, < 40 years (Low), 40–59 years (Intermediate), and ≥ 60 years (High). Smoking history thresholds are Never smoker or < 10 pack years (Low), 10–30 pack years (Intermediate), and > 30 pack years (High). Presence of additional urothelial cancer risk factors is None (Low), Any (Intermediate), and One or more plus any high-risk feature (High). Footnote: *HPF: High-Power Field.

### Assessment of microscopic hematuria in adults… [^116dU27x]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY Microscopic hematuria associated with renal colic is best evaluated with CT in light of its high sensitivity for identifying renal calculi. 21, 23 Unenhanced helical CT is more accurate for evaluating patients with renal colic compared with ultrasonography, intravenous urography, or plain radiography and has replaced these imaging techniques as the test of choice in many institutions. 23 When compared with intravenous urography, unenhanced helical CT has the advantage of higher accuracy, decreased radiation dose, faster examination time, and improved sizing and localization of stones. Evaluation of the Lower Urinary Tract Identifying an abnormality in the upper urinary tract does not preclude evaluation of the lower urinary tract because a comorbid lesion may exist.

The etiology of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria remains unclear in 70 percent of patients after imaging of the upper urinary tract and assessment of urine for signs of glomerular disease. 2 Urine cytology studies and cystoscopy are used routinely to evaluate the lower urinary tract. URINE CYTOLOGY The AUA recommends that patients with microscopic hematuria have radiographic assessment of the upper urinary tract followed by urine cytology studies. 2 The sensitivity of urine cytology is highest for detection of high-grade lesions in the bladder and carcinoma in situ. 24 The primary advantage of urine cytology versus cystoscopy is that because it is noninvasive, it does not cause the patient any discomfort. Urine cytology is limited in its ability to detect low-grade lesions in the bladder as well as renal cell cancer.
24.

CYSTOSCOPY The AUA recommends that all patients older than 40 years and those who are younger but have risk factors for bladder cancer obtain cystoscopy to complete the evaluation of microscopic hematuria. 1 Abnormal urine cytology findings also would necessitate cystoscopy, which has 87 percent sensitivity for bladder cancer. 2 Cystoscopy is the only reliable method of detecting transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and the urethra. 8 The primary disadvantages of cystoscopy are patient discomfort with this invasive procedure and its limited ability to detect carcinoma in situ of the bladder. 24.

Risk factors for bladder cancer include smoking, occupational exposure to carcinogens, male sex, older age, white race, infections caused by certain bladder parasites, and family or personal history of bladder cancer. Screening tests for bladder cancer include microscopic urinalysis for hematuria, urine cytology, and urine biomarkers. The principal treatment for superficial disease is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, and radical cystectomy, often with adjuvant chemotherapy, is used for surgically resectable invasive bladder cancer. There is inadequate evidence that treatment of screen-detected bladder cancer leads to improved morbidity or overall mortality, and there is inadequate evidence on harms of screening for bladder cancer.

### Evaluation of asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria in children and adults [^111W429b]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic, atraumatic hematuria is a worrisome clinical sign for a patient that usually prompts a visit to a urologist. Hematuria is classified as microscopic versus gross; the evaluation for gross hematuria differs from that for microscopic hematuria, and the most important differentiating factor is the patient's age. The major causes of hematuria differ between children and adults, and the evaluation should reflect this. Renal disease is more common in children and malignancy more common in adults. The application and utility of laboratory tests, radiological studies, and cystoscopy are well established in adults but are more variable in children. Follow-up of hematuria after a negative evaluation is becoming more limited in adults but should be routine for children.

### Clinical relevance… [^117VZNTA]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

7 Nevertheless, formal evaluation is critical, because malignancies are detected in up to 5% of patients with microscopic hematuria and in up to 30% to 40% of patients with gross hematuria. 8 Studies have revealed that recommended diagnostic guidelines are rarely followed, resulting in inappropriate and costly referrals, and failure to detect many treatable causes of hematuria. Etiology Hundreds of diseases have been shown to cause hematuria. In the small percentage of patients for whom an etiology is identified, causes may include urinary tract infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia, medical renal disease, urinary calculi, urethral stricture disease, and urologic malignancy. At least 10 to 20 microscopic fields should be examined under 400× magnification. 16 According to the AUA, the presence of three or more red blood cells on a single, properly collected, noncontaminated urinalysis without evidence of infection is considered clinically significant microscopic hematuria.

6 If the specimen shows large amounts of squamous epithelial cells or if the patient is unable to provide an uncontaminated specimen secondary to anatomic constraints, catheterization should be used to obtain a specimen.
6. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF MEDICAL RENAL DISEASE The presence of microscopic hematuria and dysmorphic red blood cells, cellular casts, proteinuria, elevated creatinine level, or hypertension should raise suspicion for medical renal etiologies, such as immunoglobulin A nephropathy, Alport syndrome, benign familial hematuria, or other nephropathy. If any of these are suspected, concurrent nephrologic workup is warranted. 15, 21, 22 However, these findings do not exclude the potential for urologic processes, and evaluation for such causes should be conducted.
6.

CT urography is the imaging procedure of choice in the evaluation of microscopic hematuria because of its high sensitivity and specificity, and its ability to provide excellent diagnostic information in a single imaging session. 6, 24, 27, 28 A major concern with the use of CT urography is radiation exposure. The average effective dose of radiation with CT urography is more than double that of intravenous pyelography.

### Comparison of the harms, advantages, and costs associated with alternative guidelines for the evaluation of hematuria [^113RAdLf]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Existing recommendations for the diagnostic testing of hematuria range from uniform evaluation of varying intensity to patient-level risk stratification. Concerns have been raised about not only the costs and advantages of computed tomography (CT) scans but also the potential harms of CT radiation exposure.

Objective

To compare the advantages, harms, and costs associated with 5 guidelines for hematuria evaluation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A microsimulation model was developed to assess each of the following guidelines (listed in order of increasing intensity) for initial evaluation of hematuria: Dutch, Canadian Urological Association (CUA), Kaiser Permanente (KP), Hematuria Risk Index (HRI), and American Urological Association (AUA). Participants comprised a hypothetical cohort of patients (n = 100 000) with hematuria aged 35 years or older. This study was conducted from August 2017 through November 2018.

Exposures

Under the Dutch and CUA guidelines, patients received cystoscopy and ultrasonography if they were 50 years or older (Dutch) or 40 years or older (CUA). Under the KP and HRI guidelines, patients received different combinations of cystoscopy, ultrasonography, and CT urography or no evaluation on the basis of risk factors. Under the AUA guidelines, all patients 35 years or older received cystoscopy and CT urography.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Urinary tract cancer detection rates, radiation-induced secondary cancers (from CT radiation exposure), procedural complications, false-positive rates per 100 000 patients, and incremental cost per additional urinary tract cancer detected.

Results

The simulated cohort included 100 000 patients with hematuria, aged 35 years or older. A total of 3514 patients had urinary tract cancers (estimated prevalence, 3.5%; 95% CI, 3.0%-4.0%). The AUA guidelines missed detection for the fewest number of cancers (82 [2.3%]) compared with the detection rate of the HRI (116 [3.3%]) and KP (130 [3.7%]) guidelines. However, the simulation model projected 108 (95% CI, 34–201) radiation-induced cancers under the KP guidelines, 136 (95% CI, 62–229) under the HRI guidelines, and 575 (95% CI, 184–1069) under the AUA guidelines per 100 000 patients. The CUA and Dutch guidelines missed detection for a larger number of cancers (172 [4.9%] and 251 [7.1%]) but had 0 radiation-induced secondary cancers. The AUA guidelines cost approximately double the other 4 guidelines ($939/person vs $443/person for Dutch guidelines), with an incremental cost of $1 034 374 per urinary tract cancer detected compared with that of the HRI guidelines.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this simulation study, uniform CT imaging for patients with hematuria was associated with increased costs and harms of secondary cancers, procedural complications, and false positives, with only a marginal increase in cancer detection. Risk stratification may optimize the balance of advantages, harms, and costs of CT.

### Clinical utility of a non-invasive urine test for risk assessing patients with no obvious benign cause of hematuria: a physician-patient real world data analysis [^114K5iTu]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hematuria, or blood in the urine, is a common occurrence in clinical practice. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH; defined as > 3 red blood cells/high-powered field in a properly collected urine sample) is present in up to 24% of the general population and is the primary reason for more than 485,000 referrals to urologists in the US every year.

The current American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend a full urological work-up to diagnose or rule out UC in patients with AMH within 180 days, however several barriers to referral for a full urological work-up exist. For example, clinical diagnostic algorithms for patients with hematuria are complicated, difficult to follow and enable a degree of latitude in their interpretation. Many physicians are also conscious of the burden of invasive procedures and the potential for harm and there is a lack of compliance by patients when confronted with the prospect of many and varied invasive procedures. Invasive procedures, such as cystoscopy and contrast computed tomography (CT) scans, have the potential to impact their patients in terms of adverse events, financial cost and emotional impact. As such, guideline recommendations to administer full urological work-ups to all patients presenting with hematuria may only be selectively adhered to.

In particular, as few as 10% of women with hematuria are referred to urologists. Likewise, < 14% of patients with hematuria undergo cystoscopy or radiological investigation within 180 days and a recent Australian study reported delays of up to 1165 days between initial presentation of hematuria and subsequent treatment for UC. This is particularly concerning given that delayed diagnoses are known to negatively influence outcomes for patients with UC with every day increasing the risk of death for a patient with UC by 1%.

The high probability of delayed treatment is particularly evident for younger and female patients. Treatment for UC is more likely to be delayed for women than men, and although the incidence of UC is higher for men, women are less likely to undergo procedures after being referred and have a higher risk of presenting with UC at an advanced stage and have poorer survival outcomes. Therefore, a simple, rigorous and accurate segregation of patients using a non-invasive risk-assessment tool may reduce barriers to referral and focus the intensity and prioritisation of patients for workup.

### Incidence of significant findings of microhematuria workup in women-what guidelines work best? [^112qLVFD]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To apply the American Urogynecological Society (AUGS)/American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations of foregoing workup in patients under 50 years of age with less than 25 red cells per high-powered field, to a cohort of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria (AMH) patients, and assess diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value compared to the American Urologic Association (AUA) guidelines.

Methods

Retrospective review of female patients who underwent AMH evaluation from 2012 to 2015. The number of patients who would have avoided workup following the AUGS/ACOG recommendations was determined. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive value and accuracy of the AUGS/ACOG recommendations compared to AUA guidelines were determined.

Results

Six hundred twenty women underwent AMH workup with 265 women undergoing full workup as per the AUA guidelines. Applying the AUGS/ACOG recommendations to this cohort would not have resulted in missed malignant diagnoses. Two tumors were found, both in patients who had undergone complete workup, and for whom AUGS/ACOG recommends workup. Following the AUGS/ACOG recommendations would have avoided workup in 126/620 of all women and 44/265 women who underwent the full AUA workup. In looking at findings of malignancy, the AUGS/ACOG workup had a sensitivity of 100% and a negative predictive value of 100% as compared to the AUA guidelines.

Conclusion

AUA guidelines may over screen female low risk AMH patients. Extensive workup in a low risk group of female patients does not result in increased cancer diagnoses. Perhaps a more nuanced approach could result in fewer workups without compromising cancer detection.

### Tolvaptan and kidney pain in patients with autosomal dominant Polycystic kidney disease: secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial [^116eaukH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pain is a common complication in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). It is a symptom that is often reported early in the disease course and that sometimes can be severe and difficult to manage and adversely affect a patient's quality of life. – Acute pain in patients with ADPKD can be caused by cyst hemorrhage, infection, and kidney stones, which are often accompanied by hematuria. When pain is present longer than 4 to 6 weeks, it is typically classified as chronic pain, which has a reported prevalence as high as 60%.

The TEMPO (Tolvaptan Efficacy and Safety in Management of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease and Its Outcomes) 3:4 trial demonstrated the renoprotective effects of tolvaptan treatment in a randomized controlled clinical trial setting. During 3 years' follow-up, tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, reduced the annual rate of growth in total kidney volume (TKV) from 5.5% to 2.8% (P < 0.001) and the annual rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline from −3.70 to −2.72 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P < 0.001) compared to placebo. This trial also demonstrated a reduction in clinical progression as assessed by its key secondary composite end point through a reduction of ADPKD-related clinical events. This outcome was driven by 2 components of the composite: time to decline in kidney function and time to clinically significant kidney pain events.

In the present study, we explored this last finding more closely. We characterized what constituted a "clinically significant kidney pain event" by objectively examining the intensity of medical interventions used to define them. We also investigated the association of ADPKD clinical characteristics (such as history of kidney pain, infection, kidney stones, or hematuria at baseline) with the incidence of acute kidney pain events during the 3-year trial. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of tolvaptan use on incidence of kidney pain events and explored whether new pain events were associated with baseline patient characteristics and the possible mechanisms by which tolvaptan reduced their incidence.

### Hematuria [^116UCChT]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The emergency physician can expect to commonly evaluate patients with hematuria, and the differential diagnosis will include both benign and life-threatening causes. This differential is divided into the following categories: glomerular or nonglomerular, coagulopathy-related, traumatic, and factitious causes. Nonglomerular causes account for the majority of hematuria evaluated in the ED, with infection and stones being the most prevalent diagnoses. Glomerular causes will have associated red cell casts and proteinuria present on urinalysis. Painless atraumatic gross hematuria in the elderly is caused by a malignancy until proven otherwise. A focused history, physical exam, and appropriate diagnostic testing in the ED usually yields a diagnosis. If the patient is discharged home, proper follow-up with the primary care physician, urologist, or nephrologist is indicated, depending upon the diagnosis.

Gross hematuria in children is a common complaint that often leads patients to seek urgent care. The diagnostic evaluation can be chosen based on specific patient history and physical examination. When a patient is asymptomatic, hypercalciuria and mild forms of glomerulonephritis are common causes of gross hematuria. Although they are less common in children, special care should be taken to investigate for renal and bladder tumors.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hematuria [^1116eVP2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hematuria is a common reason for patients to be referred for imaging of the urinary tract. All patients diagnosed with hematuria should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, urinalysis, and serologic testing prior to any initial imaging. Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are the most common imaging modalities used to evaluate hematuria. This document discusses the following clinical scenarios for hematuria: initial imaging of microhematuria without risk factors or history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation; initial imaging of microhematuria in patients with known risk factors and no history of recent vigorous exercise, or presence of infection, or viral illness, or present or recent menstruation or renal parenchymal disease; initial imaging of microhematuria in the pregnant patient and initial imaging of gross hematuria. Follow-up of normal or abnormal findings is beyond the scope of this review. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria? [^113n7Gwo]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

is a cardinal clinical symptom with an associated risk of urinary tract cancer. The risk of malignancy in patients who present with macroscopic hematuria is 20.4% and in comparison the risk of malignancy is 5.2% in patients who present with microscopic hematuria. Bladder cancer is the most common cancer detected in microscopic hematuria cases, accounting for 4.8% of those investigated, while renal cancer and UTUC are less common with an incidence of 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively.

Recommendations on who should be investigated for microscopic hematuria differ across guideline bodies. While there is a resounding consensus that cystoscopy remains the investigation of choice to visualize the bladder, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal upper tract imaging. RBUS and CTU are the most commonly used imaging modalities. The AUA recommends performing CTU for macroscopic and microscopic hematuria while the United Kingdom NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and the ACP (American College of Physicians®) do not specify a recommended imaging modality. Similarly the role of upper tract imaging in patients newly diagnosed with bladder cancer also differs among guidelines.

CTU has the highest diagnostic performance for identifying upper tract disease. A meta-analysis suggested that CTU achieves 93% sensitivity and 99% specificity for UTUC. However, the diagnostic performance of CTU should be balanced against the risk due to intravenous contrast medium. Intravenous contrast administration is associated with a 3% risk of contrast induced nephropathy in patients at high risk, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 59 ml/minute/1.73 m 2. Prophylaxis hydration was shown to be ineffective. In addition, exposure to ionizing radiation is carcinogenic and there is a risk of anaphylactic reaction, although it is rare.

The DETECT I study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study prospectively recruiting patients referred from primary care physicians to urology departments for investigation following the presentation of hematuria. We report the incidence of upper tract disease and bladder cancer in patients with macroscopic and microscopic hematuria as well as the diagnostic ability of CTU and RBUS to identify upper tract cancer to determine whether CTU can be safely replaced by RBUS in patients who present with microscopic hematuria.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematuria-child [^114bDi9D]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematuria is the presence of red blood cells in the urine, either visible to the eye (macroscopic hematuria) or as viewed under the microscope (microscopic hematuria). The clinical evaluation of children and adolescents with any form of hematuria begins with a meticulous history and thorough evaluation of the urine. The need for imaging evaluation depends on the clinical scenario in which hematuria presents, including the suspected etiology. Ultrasound and CT are the most common imaging methods used to assess hematuria in children, although other imaging modalities may be appropriate in certain instances. This review focuses on the following clinical variations of childhood hematuria: isolated hematuria (nonpainful, nontraumatic, and microscopic versus macroscopic), painful hematuria (ie, suspected nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis), and renal trauma with hematuria (microscopic versus macroscopic). The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Evaluation of the new American Urological Association guidelines risk classification for hematuria [^112vyxyX]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Microhematuria is a prevalent condition and the American Urological Association has developed a new risk-stratified approach for the evaluation of patients with microhematuria. Our objective was to provide the first evaluation of this important guideline.

Materials and Methods

This multinational cohort study combines contemporary patients from 5 clinical trials and 2 prospective registries who underwent urological evaluation for hematuria. Patients were stratified into American Urological Association risk strata (low, intermediate or high risk) based on sex, age, degree of hematuria, and smoking history. The primary end point was the incidence of bladder cancer within each risk stratum.

Results

A total of 15,779 patients were included in the analysis. Overall, 727 patients (4.6%) were classified as low risk, 1,863 patients (11.8%) were classified as intermediate risk, and 13,189 patients (83.6%) were classified as high risk. The predominance of high risk patients was consistent across all cohorts. A total of 857 bladder cancers were diagnosed with a bladder cancer incidence of 5.4%. Bladder cancer was more prevalent in men, smokers, older patients and patients with gross hematuria. The cancer incidence for low, intermediate and high risk groups was 0.4% (3 patients), 1.0% (18 patients) and 6.3% (836 patients), respectively.

Conclusions

The new risk stratification system separates hematuria patients into clinically meaningful categories with differing likelihoods of bladder cancer that would justify evaluating the low, intermediate and high risk groups with incremental intensity. Furthermore, it provides the relative incidence of bladder cancer in each risk group which should facilitate patient counseling regarding the risks and benefits of evaluation for bladder cancer.

### Committee opinion no.703: asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in women [^111iUVwE]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is an important clinical sign of urinary tract malignancy. Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria has been variably defined over the years. In addition, the evidence primarily is based on data from male patients. However, whether the patient is a man or a woman influences the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, and the risk of urinary tract malignancy (bladder, ureter, and kidney) is significantly less in women than in men. Among women, being older than 60 years, having a history of smoking, and having gross hematuria are the strongest predictors of urologic cancer. In low-risk, never-smoking women younger than 50 years without gross hematuria and with fewer than 25 red blood cells per high-power field, the risk of urinary tract malignancy is less than or equal to 0.5%. Furthermore, the evaluation may result in more harm than benefit and is unlikely to be cost effective. Thus, data support changing current hematuria recommendations in this low-risk group. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society encourage organizations producing future guidelines on the evaluation of microscopic hematuria to perform sex-specific analysis of the data and produce practical sex-specific recommendations. In the meantime, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Urogynecologic Society recommend that asymptomatic, low-risk, never-smoking women aged 35–50 years undergo evaluation only if they have more than 25 red blood cells per high-power field.

### Evaluation of hospital-based hematuria diagnosis and subsequent cancer risk among adults in Denmark [^112dkNjk]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hematuria is a frequent finding and may be a presenting symptom of an underlying urologic malignant neoplasm. However, long-term data on cancer risk in selected populations with hematuria are sparse and based on small unrepresentative study populations. Several aspects of the association between hematuria and cancer risk remain poorly understood. These aspects include whether hematuria is a marker of long-term urologic cancer risk and whether it is associated with increased risk of nonurologic cancers. Colorectal cancer, gynecologic cancer, and hematologic malignant neoplasms all could be associated with hematuria through bladder involvement or bleeding from tumor-induced coagulation disturbances.,

Data are needed to improve understanding of both hematuria and cancer and to provide further insight into the clinical course of patients with hematuria, thereby potentially guiding the follow-up of these patients. Therefore, using data from Danish medical databases, we undertook a large population-based assessment of cancer risk in patients with a hospital-based hematuria diagnosis.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114qPfNG]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria: AUA/SUFU Guideline (2020, Amended 2025) — purpose and methodology are outlined as follows: The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis, evaluation, and follow-up of microhematuria (MH). OVID was used to systematically search MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for articles evaluating hematuria using criteria determined by the expert panel; the initial draft evidence report included evidence published from January 2010 through February 2019, and a second search included studies published up to December 2019. Five systematic reviews and 91 primary literature studies met the study selection criteria and were chosen to form the evidence base. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular modality was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low); and evidence-based statements of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendation were developed, with additional information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence exists. In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA update literature review (ULR) process, which identified 82 studies for full-text review that were published between December 2019 and June 7, 2024; of those 82 studies, 23 met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis, and the subsequent amendment is based on data released since the initial 2020 publication of this Guideline.

### Diagnosis and management of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease in ambulatory care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^1146XeYi]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Definition and screening

There was no disagreement on the definition of CKD by laboratory tests, but all guidelines fail to precise which structural abnormalities qualify for CKD. NICE and ACP guidelines as well as the USPSTF recommended explicitly against screening of asymptomatic individuals without known risk factors. Screening was recommended for high risk groups in most guidelines, but KHA-CARI used broad definitions for at risk populations like smoking, obesity, socioeconomic disadvantage or age. This can lead to screening situations where health benefits and therapeutic consequences of CKD diagnosis are lacking.

Diagnostic tests in newly diagnosed CKD

Main purpose of the initial diagnostic work-up is to establish CKD and rule out emergencies or specifically treatable kidney disorders, e.g. glomerulonephritis. Most guidelines agree on assessing kidney function by eGFR creatinine and proteinuria. Primarily KHA-CARI and HAS, recommend extensive additional diagnostic work-up, mainly to identify possible complications or comorbidities reflecting the epidemiology in specialized nephrology services but not in primary care. As the risk of developing complications like electrolyte disturbances, anemia or CKD-MBD is largely dependent on kidney function, a more differentiated approach according to CKD stage, could lower health service utilization and cost while maintaining quality of care. HAS explicitly stated that testing was aimed to obtain baseline values in some instances. It is debatable whether this set point information has therapeutic consequence.

Assessment of hematuria was inconsistently addressed. While NICE recommended against using urine microscopy, KHA-CARI recommended it. Most primary care providers do not have the skills and equipment to perform urine microscopy. However NICE and KDIGO did not specify when dipstick testing for hematuria is warranted, while most guideline did not address checking for hematuria at all.

### In search of a consensus: evaluation of the patient with hematuria in an era of cost containment [^114pn2BE]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the current consensus guidelines for nonimaging triage and ultimate preferred imaging approach for the patient with unexplained hematuria.

Conclusion

Numerous consensus guidelines from varying societies have outlined preferred imaging pathways for the patient with unexplained urologic causes of hematuria. Future guidelines will need to take into account disease prevalence, radiation considerations, and cost.

### Utility of serial urinary cytology in the initial evaluation of the patient with microscopic hematuria [^112qtvJM]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Gross or microscopic hematuria [≥ 3 red blood cells (RBC) per high power field (hpf)] may be caused by numerous factors - urinary calculi, hematologic abnormalities, infection, trauma, tuberculosis, and tumor. Some of these factors (e.g. tumor) may be life threatening. Thus prompt, thorough evaluation and treatment are needed. Currently, evaluation for the hematuric patient consists of inspecting the lower urinary tract by cystourethroscopy, inspecting the upper urinary tract with computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast, ultrasonography or intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and obtaining a urine sample for cytologic evaluation.

Urine for cytology can detect cancerous cells shed from any part of the entire urothelium (i.e. collecting system to urethra) in a voided urine specimen. Higher grade tumors or larger tumors (> 3 cm) are more likely to shed cells into the urine and thus the sample is more likely to be positive for cancer. Urinary cytology has a notoriously low sensitivity, but an extremely high specificity, thus making it a useful tool in following patients with high grade cancers. Furthermore, interpretation of urinary cytology may be difficult, especially in the face of such conditions as urinary tract infection. With these notable limitations, the question arises as to how effective is urinary cytology in diagnosing bladder cancer in a patient presenting with microscopic hematuria? Herein, we report the utility of urinary cytology of patients presenting to a urology clinic for evaluation of microscopic hematuria.

### Hematuria as a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease and death: findings from the chronic renal insufficiency cohort (CRIC) study [^113uqQcN]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we observed that hematuria was associated with a significantly greater risk of CKD progression and death within the first 2 years after hematuria ascertainment. Our findings should stimulate further investigation of the impact of hematuria with more specific and sensitive testing strategies. Understanding the pattern of hematuria over time and its relationship to clinical outcomes will be important for fully understanding its predictive value in the setting of CKD.

Due to the possibility that gross hematuria may indicate an invasion of the collecting system, we analyzed the relationship between gross hematuria and pathological grading. It was found that among patients without gross hematuria, 44.87% were pT1, and 55.13% were pT3. In contrast, among patients with gross hematuria, 35.26% were pT1, and 64.74% were pT3, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001) (Table 6). In the domain of survival analysis, the presence of gross hematuria in both pT1 and pT3 patient cohorts was significantly associated with inferior outcomes, with particularly pronounced effects observed in the pT3 cohort (Fig. 4). Specifically, within the pT1 cohort, gross hematuria was significantly correlated with diminished progression-free survival (PFS), whereas no significant associations were observed with overall survival (OS) or cancer-specific survival (CSS) (PFS, HR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.4–5.2, P = 0.003; OS, HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.9–2.9, P = 0.116; CSS, HR = 2.0, 95% CI = 0.9–4.2, P = 0.069). Conversely, within the pT3 cohort, gross hematuria was significantly associated with adverse outcomes across all considered endpoints, including PFS, OS, and CSS (PFS, HR = 4.5, 95% CI = 2.9–6.9, P < 0.001; OS, HR = 4.0, 95% CI = 2.6–6.2, P < 0.001; CSS, HR = 4.9, 95% CI = 3.0–8.1, P < 0.001).

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^114cVMKz]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for microhematuria, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, AUA/SUFU 2025 guidelines recommend to categorize patients presenting with microhematuria as low/negligible-, intermediate-, or high-risk for genitourinary malignancy following the initial evaluation:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Low/negligible (meeting all criteria)|- Age < 40 years for males, < 60 years for females <br/> - Never-smoker or < 10 pack-years <br/> - 3–10 RBC/hpf on a single urinalysis <br/> - No risk factors for urothelial cancer|
|Intermediate (meeting one or more criteria)|- Age 40–59 years for males, < 60 years for females <br/> - Smoking 10–30 pack-years <br/> - 11–25 RBC/hpf on a single urinalysis <br/> - Previously low/negligible-risk patient with no prior evaluation and 3–25 RBC/hpf on repeat urinalysis <br/> - Any additional risk factor for urothelial cancer (irritative LUTS, prior pelvic radiation therapy, prior cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide chemotherapy, family history of urothelial cancer or Lynch syndrome, occupational exposures to benzene chemicals or aromatic amines, such as rubber, petrochemicals, dyes, chronic indwelling foreign body in the urinary tract)|
|High (meeting one or more criteria)|- Age ≥ 60 years for males, females should not be categorized as high-risk solely based on age <br/> - > smoking > 30 pack-years <br/> - > 25 RBC/hpf on a single urinalysis <br/> - History of gross hematuria <br/> - One ore more risk factors for urothelial cancer plus any high-risk feature.|
