## Question

Fecal incontinence

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fecal incontinence management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining fecal incontinence and establishing its prevalence and impact. Then, I should verify the initial evaluation framework, including history, exam, and baseline severity/QoL tools. Next, I will review first-line conservative therapies and their evidence. After that, I need to check indications and evidence for second-line options like biofeedback, bulking agents, and sacral neuromodulation. Then, I will examine surgical options and their limitations. Finally, I should consider special populations, outcome measurement, and synthesize a practical algorithm with shared decision-making points, while continuously checking for internal consistency and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and burden so I don't gloss over fundamentals: fecal incontinence is the involuntary loss of solid or liquid stool, with substantial prevalence in community-dwelling adults and a marked negative impact on quality of life. I should double-check that estimates commonly cite around 7–15% in women and men, rising with age and institutionalization, which aligns with contemporary summaries and older foundational reviews [^114XZKDk] [^114qZtvC].

> Wait, let me verify the initial evaluation steps before jumping to treatment: a careful history should characterize frequency, severity, stool consistency, urgency, and risk factors such as obstetric trauma, anorectal surgery, diabetes, neurologic disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. The physical exam should include inspection, digital rectal exam, and assessment of pelvic floor function. Baseline severity and QoL should be quantified using validated tools like Wexner, Vaizey, or FISI, and a bowel diary helps track response. I need to ensure I note that invasive testing is not required to start therapy in straightforward cases, reserving anorectal manometry and endoanal ultrasound for refractory or complex presentations or when planning surgery [^111u5RoW] [^116SnxaJ] [^112VJiEY] [^115zRWzC].

> Hold on, I should verify first-line conservative management and its evidentiary footing: dietary modification to optimize stool consistency, fiber supplementation, scheduled toileting, and pharmacologic agents to normalize stool form are recommended as initial therapy. Loperamide and diphenoxylate/atropine reduce episodes in diarrhea-predominant FI, and fiber can be helpful, though comparative trials show similar overall effectiveness between higher and lower fiber when combined with loperamide, underscoring the need for individualized titration. I should confirm that guidelines from ASCRS, ACOG, and ACG converge on this stepwise, symptom-targeted approach [^113Ly1Ct] [^112iFCBH] [^112kM47W] [^116pyemD] [^113sLJJJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated the strength of evidence for pelvic floor muscle training alone. Let me reconsider and anchor to higher-quality data: supervised pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback shows superiority to attention control in a randomized trial, with about fivefold higher odds of patient-reported improvement and a modest reduction in Vaizey score. Cochrane reviews suggest potential benefit but emphasize heterogeneity and methodological limitations, so I should frame this as a conditional recommendation with moderate-quality evidence rather than a universal cure [^116Jjwbp] [^113e5jsZ] [^113doqP3].

> I need to check the role of biofeedback more precisely: guidelines suggest offering biofeedback after conservative measures, ideally with sensory and strength training components. Benefits are variable across studies, and durability can wane, so expectations should be calibrated. I should confirm that ACG and ASCRS align in recommending biofeedback as a reasonable option when available, with the caveat that access and standardization remain challenges [^112mN2rb] [^111oUZG3] [^115r4VVo].

> Next, I should review injectable bulking agents and be careful not to overpromise: dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (NASHA Dx) can reduce episodes by at least 50% in about half of patients at 6–12 months, but durability beyond 3 years is limited as material degrades and scores drift back toward baseline. Cost and repeated injections are considerations, so this is best positioned as a short-term or bridging option after conservative therapy, not first-line [^1179G6rZ] [^113LofCt].

> Let me verify sacral neuromodulation (SNS) indications and outcomes: SNS is generally recommended as the preferred surgical option for moderate-to-severe FI refractory to conservative and biofeedback therapies, with randomized crossover data showing substantial reductions in weekly episodes and high proportions achieving at least 50% improvement. Complications include pain, infection, and device issues, and a temporary trial helps select responders. I should confirm that ASCRS and ACG endorse SNS as first-line surgical therapy in appropriately selected patients [^114Cmnee] [^117ADDDe] [^1141Pg6K].

> I will now examine anal sphincter repair, and I should double-check the durability concern: overlapping sphincteroplasty is reasonable for women with a discrete external anal sphincter defect, particularly obstetric, who fail conservative therapy, but long-term continence often declines over 5–10 years. Thus, patient counseling should emphasize initial improvement with possible later deterioration and the need for ongoing pelvic floor support [^114EyCWL] [^1136dQYV].

> But wait, what about artificial bowel sphincter and dynamic graciloplasty? I need to ensure I don't understate morbidity: these reconstructive options have historically shown high complication and explantation rates and are generally reserved for severe, refractory cases in specialized centers. Evidence quality is limited and guidelines caution against routine use, reinforcing the notion that these are salvage strategies rather than mainstream options [^11677bY6] [^112hiiRm].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of fecal diversion: end colostomy or ileostomy is an effective, definitive solution for patients who have failed or are not candidates for other therapies. Shared decision-making is essential given to the impact on body image and lifestyle, and this should be framed as a valid, sometimes preferred option rather than a failure [^113A4S5p] [^1173KDiU].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't apply a one-size-fits-all approach: in older adults, emphasize conservative measures, skin care, and caregiver-supported strategies. In women with obstetric injury, prioritize pelvic floor rehabilitation and consider sphincter repair when a defect is documented. In neurogenic bowel or those with impaired rectal emptying, transanal irrigation can reduce seepage. In stroke rehabilitation, continence recovery is common, so early conservative management and toileting programs are key while acknowledging limited FI-specific evidence [^113bmbVq] [^1114MsHA] [^116y8ngt].

> I should double-check outcome measurement and thresholds because they guide shared decisions: standardized severity instruments (Wexner, Vaizey, FISI) and QoL scales should be used to quantify baseline and track response. A 50% reduction in weekly episodes is a commonly used trial endpoint, but patient-preferred success often corresponds to a 75% or greater reduction, so aligning goals with patient expectations improves satisfaction and adherence [^115zRWzC] [^111CsXSo].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and ensure internal consistency: start with education, stool-form optimization, scheduled toileting, and fiber. If inadequate, add supervised pelvic floor therapy with biofeedback. If still refractory, consider bulking agents as a bridge. For persistent moderate-to-severe FI, offer SNS after a trial. Reserve sphincter repair for discrete defects in younger patients. And consider diversion for severe, refractory disease or when other options are unsuitable. Throughout, reassess severity and QoL at each step and tailor to patient preferences and comorbidities [^113Ly1Ct] [^117ADDDe] [^114EyCWL] [^113A4S5p].

> Finally, I need to ensure the evidence gaps and research priorities are transparent: heterogeneity in outcome reporting limits comparability, so adopting a core outcome set that includes severity, frequency, urgency, stool consistency, QoL, daily activity impact, satisfaction, and adverse events will improve future evidence synthesis. Until then, individualized care and shared decision-making remain essential given the modest but meaningful benefits achievable across modalities [^112bx4PK] [^117GY3hN].

Fecal incontinence is the **involuntary loss of stool** [^114qZtvC] due to multifactorial causes, including obstetric trauma, aging, neurologic disease, and bowel disturbances [^115b4r51]. It is common and underreported, with significant quality-of-life impact [^113AbZmB] [^111EtYBv]. Management is **stepwise**: start with dietary changes, antidiarrheals, and pelvic floor training [^113Ly1Ct]; escalate to biofeedback [^113doqP3], bulking agents [^1179G6rZ], or sacral neuromodulation [^117ADDDe] if needed; reserve surgery (sphincteroplasty, artificial sphincter, or colostomy) for refractory cases [^114EyCWL] [^113A4S5p]. Prognosis varies: many improve with conservative care, but recurrence is common without ongoing therapy [^116Jjwbp].

---

## Definition and classification

Fecal incontinence is the **involuntary loss of solid or liquid stool** or gas [^112k77EH]. It is classified as passive (without awareness), urge (unable to delay), or mixed, and may involve seepage or complete loss [^112k77EH].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

Prevalence is **7–15% in community-dwelling adults**, rising with age and in women; risk factors include obstetric trauma, anorectal surgery, neurologic disease, diabetes, obesity, and bowel disturbances (diarrhea, constipation) [^114XZKDk] [^113AbZmB] [^112k77EH].

---

## Pathophysiology

FI reflects disruption of the **anorectal sensorimotor system**, including:

- **Internal anal sphincter (IAS)**: maintains resting tone; dysfunction causes passive leakage [^112k77EH].
- **External anal sphincter (EAS)**: provides voluntary control; dysfunction causes urge incontinence [^112k77EH].
- **Pelvic floor muscles**: support and coordinate sphincter function [^114P5cr4].
- **Rectal compliance and sensation**: critical for storage and timely evacuation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **History**: onset, duration, severity, stool consistency, obstetric/surgical history, neurologic symptoms [^112VJiEY].
- **Physical examination**: digital rectal exam, anoscopy, assessment of sphincter tone and pelvic floor function [^114i63qT].
- **Diagnostic tests**: anorectal manometry, endoanal ultrasound, MRI, and pudendal nerve testing as indicated [^111u5RoW].

---

## Management strategies

Management is **stepwise**, starting with conservative measures and escalating based on response:

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Effectiveness** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dietary modifications (fiber, stool consistency) | First-line | Moderate | Adherence, variability |
| Antidiarrheal agents (loperamide, diphenoxylate) | Diarrhea-predominant FI | Moderate | Constipation, side effects |
| Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) | First-line | Moderate | Access, adherence |
| Biofeedback therapy | Refractory cases | Moderate | Availability, variability |
| Injectable bulking agents | Conservative failure | Short-term | Diminishing effect, repeat injections |
| Sacral neuromodulation | Moderate-severe FI | High | Cost, complications |
| Surgical interventions (sphincteroplasty, artificial sphincter, colostomy) | Refractory cases | Variable | Morbidity, complications |

---

Conservative management is **first-line** [^113Ly1Ct], including dietary changes, antidiarrheals, and PFMT [^115uRoHs] [^112kM47W] [^113doqP3]. Biofeedback is considered for refractory cases [^113doqP3]. Sacral neuromodulation is effective for moderate-to-severe FI after conservative failure [^117ADDDe]. Surgery is reserved for severe, refractory cases [^1114MsHA].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

Prognosis varies: many improve with conservative therapy, but recurrence is common without ongoing management [^117W7mh9]. FI significantly impairs quality of life, causing embarrassment, social isolation, and psychological distress [^114qZtvC].

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Emerging therapies include **magnetic anal sphincter augmentation**, injectable stem cell therapies, and improved neuromodulation devices [^114jTVDb] [^115b4r51]. Research focuses on patient-reported outcomes, core outcome sets, and long-term durability of interventions [^112bx4PK] [^117GY3hN].

---

Fecal incontinence is a common, multifactorial condition with significant quality-of-life impact [^113AbZmB]. A **stepwise approach** — conservative measures first, then biofeedback, bulking agents, neuromodulation, and surgery — yields the best outcomes, with prognosis dependent on adherence and ongoing management [^114i63qT].

Background

Faecal incontinence is a debilitating problem with significant medical, social and economic implications. Treatment options include conservative, non-surgical interventions (e.g. pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback, drugs, sacral nerve stimulation) and surgical procedures. A surgical procedure may be aimed at correcting an obvious mechanical defect, or augmenting a functionally deficient but structurally intact sphincter complex or replace an absent/non-functioning sphincter.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical techniques for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults who do not have rectal prolapse. Our aim was firstly to compare surgical management with non-surgical management and secondly, to compare the various surgical techniques.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (31 January 2006), the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group trials register (31 January 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2006, Issue 1), PubMed (1 January 1950 to 31 January 2006) and EMBASE (1 January 1998 to 31 January 2006) were undertaken. The British Journal of Surgery (January 1995 to May 2006) Colorectal Diseases (January 2000-May 2006) and the Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (January 1995 to May 2006) were specifically handsearched. The proceedings of the Association of Coloproctology meeting held from 1999 to 2006 were perused. Reference lists of all relevant articles were searched for further trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of surgery in the management of adult faecal incontinence (other than surgery for rectal prolapse).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies from the literature searches, assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and extracted data. The three primary outcome measures were: change or deterioration in incontinence, failure to achieve full continence, and the presence of faecal urgency.

Main Results

Nine trials were included with a total sample size of 264 participants. Two trials included a group managed non-surgically. One trial compared levatorplasty with anal plug stimulation, one compared artificial bowel sphincter with best supportive care; numbers were small in both trials. The artificial bowel sphincter insertion was followed by significant improvements in at least one primary outcome but with high rates of significant morbidity. Seven studies compared different surgical interventions. These included anterior levatorplasty versus postanal repair, anterior levatorplasty versus total pelvic floor repair, total pelvic floor versus postanal repair, end to end versus overlap sphincter repair, overlap repair with or without a defunctioning stoma or with or without biofeedback, total pelvic floor repair versus repair plus internal sphincter plication and neosphincter formation versus total pelvic floor repair. Only one comparison had more that one trial (total pelvic floor versus postanal repair-44 participants) and no comparison showed any statistically significant difference in primary outcome measures, with wide confidence intervals.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite more studies being included in this update, the continued small number of relevant trials identified together with their small sample sizes and other methodological weaknesses continue to limit the usefulness of this review for guiding practice. It was impossible to identify or refute clinically important differences between the alternative surgical procedures. Larger rigorous trials are still needed. However, it should be recognised that the optimal treatment regime may be a complex combination of various surgical and non-surgical therapies.

### Current and emerging treatment options for fecal incontinence [^114P5cr4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical evaluation begins with a full medical history to determine the cause and severity of the FI and its impact on patients' quality of life. Various scoring scales have been developed, including Wexner's Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score, Vaizey's (St Mark's Incontinence Score), the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI), and the Rockwood Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQOL) Scale. Several methods are available to evaluate the underlying cause of FI, including anorectal manometry to assess sensation and compliance, and anal endosonography or magnetic resonance imaging to assess the thickness and integrity of the puborectalis and the IAS and EAS.

Evidence suggests that the puborectalis may play an important role in anal continence. Although not routinely performed in clinical practice, anal electromyography and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing may uncover neurological damage. Recently, translumbar and transsacral motor-evoked potentials have provided evidence of neuropathy in patients with spinal cord injury and FI. Although these tests may help elucidate contributing factors to FI, many patients have multiple abnormalities contributing to symptoms; therefore, FI should be recognized as a multifactorial disorder. This narrative review will focus on current and emerging treatment options for the management of FI.

### Management of fecal incontinence [^113AbZmB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nine percent of adult women experience episodes of fecal incontinence at least monthly. Fecal incontinence is more common in older women and those with chronic bowel disturbance, diabetes, obesity, prior anal sphincter injury, or urinary incontinence. Fecal incontinence negatively affects quality of life and mental health and is associated with increased risk of nursing home placement. Fewer than 30% of women with fecal incontinence seek care, and lack of information about effective solutions is an important barrier for both patients and health care professionals. Even among women with both urinary and fecal incontinence presenting for urogynecologic care, the rate of verbal disclosure of fecal incontinence symptoms remains low. This article provides an overview of the evaluation and management of fecal incontinence for the busy obstetrician-gynecologist, incorporating existing guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Gastroenterology, and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. The initial clinical evaluation of fecal incontinence requires a focused history and physical examination. Recording patient symptoms using a standard diary or questionnaire can help document symptoms and response to treatment. Invasive diagnostic testing and imaging generally are not needed to initiate treatment but may be considered in complex cases. Most women have mild symptoms that will improve with optimized stool consistency and medications. Additional treatment options include pelvic floor muscle strengthening with or without biofeedback, devices placed anally or vaginally, and surgery, including sacral neurostimulation, anal sphincteroplasty, and, for severely affected individuals for whom other interventions fail, colonic diversion.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^114XZKDk]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fecal incontinence — definition, prevalence, impact, and screening — states that fecal incontinence (FI) is the recurrent uncontrolled passage of liquid or solid stool and affects 7% to 15% of community-dwelling women and men, with a devastating impact on daily life. Because many patients may not disclose symptoms, physicians routinely should screen patients who may be at risk for symptoms of FI. After diagnosis, management is guided by the severity of FI, its impact on quality of life, and the risk factors for FI.

### Surgery for faecal incontinence in adults [^111HKMKq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Faecal incontinence is a debilitating problem with significant medical, social and economic implications. Treatment options include conservative, non-operative interventions (for example pelvic floor muscle training, biofeedback, drugs) and surgical procedures. A surgical procedure may be aimed at correcting an obvious mechanical defect, or augmenting a functionally deficient but structurally intact sphincter complex.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical techniques for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults who do not have rectal prolapse. Our aim was firstly to compare surgical management with non-surgical management and secondly, to compare the various surgical techniques.

Search Methods

Electronic searches of the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 6 March 2013), the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Specialised Register (searched 6 March 2013), CENTRAL (2013, issue 1) and EMBASE (1 January 1998 to 6 March 2013) were undertaken. The British Journal of Surgery (1 January 1995 to 6 March 2013), Colorectal Diseases (1 January 2000 to 6 March 2013) and the Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (1 January 1995 to 6 March 2013) were specifically handsearched. The proceedings of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland annual meetings held from 1999 to 2012 were perused. Reference lists of all relevant articles were searched for further trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of surgery in the management of adult faecal incontinence (other than surgery for rectal prolapse).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected studies from the literature, assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and extracted data. The three primary outcome measures were change or deterioration in incontinence, failure to achieve full continence, and the presence of faecal urgency.

Main Results

Nine trials were included with a total sample size of 264 participants. Two trials included a group managed non-surgically. One trial compared levatorplasty with anal plug electrostimulation and one compared an artificial bowel sphincter with best supportive care. The artificial bowel sphincter resulted in significant improvements in at least one primary outcome but the numbers were small. The other trial showed no difference in the primary outcome measures. Seven trials compared different surgical interventions. These included anterior levatorplasty versus postanal repair, anterior levatorplasty versus total pelvic floor repair, total pelvic floor versus postanal repair, end to end versus overlap sphincter repair, overlap repair with or without a defunctioning stoma or with or without biofeedback, and total pelvic floor repair versus repair plus internal sphincter plication and neosphincter formation versus total pelvic floor repair. Sacral nerve stimulation and injectables are considered in separate Cochrane reviews. Only one comparison had more than one trial (total pelvic floor versus postanal repair, 44 participants) and no trial showed any difference in primary outcome measures.

Authors' Conclusions

The review is striking for the lack of high quality randomised controlled trials on faecal incontinence surgery that have been carried out in the last 10 years. Those trials that have been carried out have focused on sacral neuromodulation and injectable bulking agents, both reported in separate reviews. The continued small number of relevant trials identified together with their small sample sizes and other methodological weaknesses limit the usefulness of this review for guiding practice. It was impossible to identify or refute clinically important differences between the alternative surgical procedures. Larger rigorous trials are still needed. However, it should be recognised that the optimal treatment regime may be a complex combination of various surgical and non-surgical therapies.

### Fecal incontinence in the elderly: FAQ [^113bmbVq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI) is a common gastrointestinal (GI) complaint in patients aged 65 years and older. This evidence-based review article discusses the epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of FI in the geriatric population. We emphasize aging-related changes leading to and impacting evaluation and treatment of this symptom while incorporating the core geriatric principles of functional status and management aligned with patient preference and goals of care.

### Management of fecal incontinence in adults [^112CddeH]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

This article summarises the findings from the Conservative Management of Faecal Incontinence in Adults Committee of the International Consultation on Incontinence. We conducted comprehensive literature searches using the following keywords combined with the relevant intervention: "anal, anorectal, bowel, faecal, fecal, rectal, stool" and "continent$ or incontinent$", Prevalence etimates for faecal or anal incontinence vary widely, from 2.2% to 2.5%. Expert opinion supports the use of general health education, patient teaching about bowel function and advice on lifestyle modification, but the evidence base is small. Unlike urinary incontinence, few "lifestyle" associations have been identified with FI and little is known about whether interventions designed to reduce potential risk factors might improve FI. The article summarises the evidence and recommendations from the committee for clinical practice and future research.

### Current and emerging treatment options for fecal incontinence [^114jTVDb]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

FI is a common and distressing problem with a significant negative impact on patients' QOL, and conservative measures, such as lifestyle modifications and antidiarrheal agents, are considered first-line therapy for the management of FI and are generally effective in < 25% of patients. Biofeedback therapy, in combination with pelvic floor exercises, may provide short-term symptom relief in ∼75% of patients, but biofeedback therapy is not widely available and lacks standardization. Although the minimally invasive surgical procedure SNS may be useful (eg, ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in weekly FI episodes in 54% to 86% of patients), it has been associated with complications and a failure rate of approximately 15%. Invasive surgical procedures, such as anal sphincteroplasty, are effective initially, but they may not provide long-term benefit. Success rates with surgical sphincter replacement methods, such as graciloplasty and ABS, may be limited by complication rates, including device explantation. MAS is promising and may be superior to ABS, but controlled, adequately powered studies with long-term follow-up are needed. Injectable bulking agents, such as NASHA Dx, may provide an alternative in patients for whom conservative therapies are ineffective.

### Fecal incontinence [^111qPn4h]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of fecal incontinence is particularly gratifying because the loss of fecal control has a devastating effect on a patients lifestyle. One must consider the myriad factors that influence bowel control to properly diagnose and treat each patient. Physiology testing, particularly the use of ultrasound, is essential when treatment extends beyond dietary and medical management. Recent reports suggest that the success of typical treatments may diminish with time. This may indicate a greater need in the future for innovative options such as the artificial bowel sphincter or sacral stimulation.

Fecal incontinence is a highly prevalent and distressing condition that has a negative impact on quality of life. The etiology is often multifactorial, and the evaluation and treatment of this condition can be hindered by a lack of understanding of the mechanisms and currently available treatment options.

Three reviewers independently selected studies from the literature, assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and extracted data. The three primary outcome measures were: change or deterioration in incontinence, failure to achieve full continence, and the presence of faecal urgency.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included with a total sample size of 440 participants. Two trials included a group managed non-surgically. One trial compared levator with anal plug electrostimulation and one compared artificial bowel sphincter with best supportive care. The artificial bowel sphincter resulted in significant improvements in at least one primary outcome but numbers were small. The other trial showed no difference in primary outcome measures. Eleven trials compared different surgical interventions. These included anterior levatorplasty versus postanal repair, anterior levatorplasty versus total pelvic floor repair, total pelvic floor versus postanal repair, end to end versus overlap sphincter repair, overlap repair with or without a defunctioning stoma or with or without biofeedback, injection of silicone, hydrogel, physiological saline, carbon beads or collagen bulking agents, total pelvic floor repair versus repair plus internal sphincter plication and neosphincter formation versus total pelvic floor repair. Sacral nerve stimulation and injectables are also considered in separate Cochrane reviews. Only one comparison had more than one trial (total pelvic floor versus postanal repair, 44 participants) and no trial showed any difference in primary outcome measures.

### Raising awareness about fecal incontinence [^117QGnsN]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

There is a lack of awareness about fecal incontinence despite its prevalence and adverse impact on quality of life. Inadequate knowledge about fecal incontinence deters help-seeking, therapeutic consultation, and clinical research about effective prevention and management strategies. A systematic, evidenced-based approach to raise awareness of fecal incontinence is essential to forward progress and overcome multiple barriers. In this manuscript, strategies of this approach are prioritized and focus on increasing continence literacy and communication, emphasizing prevention and screening, disseminating evidenced-based management interventions, and promoting larger scale impact through effective partnerships.

GRADE approach — interpretation of recommendation strength and certainty is summarized as follows: Under Strong, "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", whereas under Conditional, "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with their values and preferences. Use shared decision-making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". GRADE certainty rankings interpret "High" as "The authors are confident that the true effect is similar to the estimated effect", "Moderate" as "The authors believe that the true effect is probably close to the estimated effect", "Low" as "The true effect might be markedly different from the estimated effect", and "Very low" as "The true effect is probably markedly different from the estimated effect".

### Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults [^114xh8Sw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Faecal incontinence is a common symptom which causes significant distress and reduction in quality of life. Available treatment options for faecal incontinence include conservative treatments (biofeedback, pelvic floor muscle training, dietary manipulation or drug therapy) or surgical treatments (e.g. sphincter repair, post anal repair, neosphincter). Drug treatment is often given either alone or in combination with other treatment modalities.

Objectives

To assess the effects of drug therapy for the treatment of faecal incontinence. In particular, to assess the effects of individual drugs relative to placebo or other drugs, and to compare drug therapy with other treatment modalities.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register (January 2003) and the reference lists of relevant articles. Date of the most recent search: January 2003.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of the use of pharmacological agents for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Working independently, reviewers selected studies from the literature, assessed the methodological quality of each trial, and extracted data.

Main Results

Eleven trials were identified for inclusion in this review. Nine trials were of cross-over design. Seven trials included only people with faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea or following ileoanal pouch surgery). Three trials (total 58 participants) compared topical phenylephrine gel with placebo. Two trials (56 participants) compared loperamide with placebo. One trial (11 participants) compared loperamide oxide with placebo. One trial (15 participants) compared diphenoxylate plus atropine with placebo. One trial (17 participants) compared sodium valproate with placebo. One trial (30 participants) compared loperamide with codeine with diphenoxylate plus atropine. Two further trials (total 265 participants) assessed the use of lactulose in elderly people. No studies comparing drugs with other treatment modalities were identified. There was limited evidence that antidiarrhoeal drugs and drugs which enhance anal sphincter tone may reduce faecal incontinence in patients with liquid stools. However, the trials were small and of short duration.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The small number of trials identified for this review assessed several different drugs in a variety of patient populations. The focus of most of the included trials was on the treatment of diarrhoea, rather than faecal incontinence. There is little evidence to guide clinicians in the selection of drug therapies for faecal incontinence. Larger, well-designed controlled trials, which include clinically important outcome measures, are required.

### Current and emerging treatment options for fecal incontinence [^112k77EH]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI), defined as the involuntary loss of rectal contents (eg, liquid or solid stool or gas), is caused by disruptions in the interplay of components that help maintain fecal control. Loss of voluntary control of defecation imposes a considerable social and economic burden: patients report a severely impaired quality of life, and economic costs have been estimated at an average of $4110 per patient annually (2010 US dollars).

Community-based US prevalence data suggest that FI affects an estimated 8.3% of the population, or approximately 20 million adults. According to a US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, FI affects ∼8.4% of noninstitutionalized adults. It is likely that FI is underestimated in the clinic because of several barriers, including misconceptions that FI is a natural part of aging, patient embarrassment, and social stigma.FI prevalence increases with age and regardless of ethnicity, from 2.6% in people aged 20 to 29 years to 15.3% in people aged 70 years or older.FI has been identified in at least 30% of residents in nursing homes, and is a common reason for nursing home admissions in the elderly. Elderly individuals with bowel problems impose a large burden on health care resources, a burden that will likely increase as the population ages.

Several risk factors for FI have been identified, and include obstetric trauma, anal trauma or surgery,–pelvic radiotherapy for cancer,–smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain neurological conditions. There is a greater prevalence among females than males, which is attributed to maternal injuries sustained during childbirth; however, other factors may play a role in late-onset FI, such as menopause, changes in the pelvic floor due to aging, and pudendal neuropathy.–

FI is clinically subcategorized into 3 different types: (1) passive incontinence [loss of stool without the urge to defecate, mainly attributable to internal anal sphincter (IAS) dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy]; (2) urge incontinence [inability to postpone defecation urge, related mainly to external anal sphincter (EAS) dysfunction]; and (3) fecal seepage (involuntary loss of small amounts of stool), incomplete evacuation, and impaired rectal sensation).

Injectable bulking agents for fecal incontinence (FI) — effectiveness and durability are limited, and injectable bulking agents are not considered first-line treatment for FI. In the NASHA Dx group, 50% or more reduction in FI episodes occurred compared to 31% with placebo (p = 0.008); at 36 months, 57% still had 50% or more improvement, but median Wexner scores only decreased from 14 at baseline to 11 at 36 months (p < 0.001), and most patients whose function improved had 2 separate injections. A retrospective evaluation found less than 14% of injected substance present after 5 years with Wexner scores returning to pretreatment baseline, supporting the conclusion that, given limited improvement over placebo, diminishing long-term results, and cost, these agents are not considered first-line treatment for FI.

### Fecal incontinence: mechanisms and management [^116hzoeN]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fecal incontinence is a common condition, which leads to impaired quality of life and huge financial cost at an individual and societal level. Recent studies have identified novel and potentially modifiable risk factors. Newer diagnostic modalities are giving more detailed information about underlying disorders, helping to implement targeted treatment. Many therapeutic options exist, and newer treatments are changing outcomes. This article will review recent developments in mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment of fecal incontinence.

Recent Findings

Potentially modifiable risk factors have recently been identified, and should translate to changes in clinical practice and hopefully patient outcomes. These include diarrhea, smoking, and dietary fiber. Advances have been made in anatomical and physiological testing of the anorectum and this may assist in clarifying the diagnosis and guiding management. The long-term benefit of biofeedback has been questioned but patient selection may be key. Novel pharmacological therapies (e.g., clonidine) and minimally invasive surgical procedures are changing outcomes in well selected patients. The development of a magnetic anal sphincter may add a new management alternative in patients who are refractory to conservative management.

Summary

Fecal incontinence remains a clinical challenge. Only a minority of persons with fecal incontinence seek treatment, but for those who do, improved understanding of risk factors coupled with diagnostic techniques and treatments are improving outcomes.

Summary

FI has broad socio‐economic and personal effects which healthcare providers and policymakers should take into account when designing management strategies and allocating resources for treatment and support.
Underlying causes for unemployment among patients with FI should be investigated, making workplace accommodations to improve job accessibility where necessary.
Out‐of‐pocket costs and differences in health‐related quality of life between patients underscore the need for cost‐effective treatment strategies and more targeted interventions.

### Effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions delivered at home for urinary and faecal incontinence with homebound older people: systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^1169ygyN]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points

It may be possible to reduce urinary incontinence in older homebound adults using behavioural interventions.
Only one trial using a non-invasive technology delivered at home was identified. Other approaches with potential for delivery at home, but so far only tested in younger age-ranges or settings, warrant further research.
There have been no randomised controlled trials of interventions to support homebound older adults with faecal incontinence.
Older homebound adults, particularly men, are rarely included in research into new interventions for incontinence.

### Evolving therapy for fecal incontinence [^115HmZuy]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal incontinence is common and can be socially debilitating. Nonoperative management of fecal incontinence includes dietary modification, antidiarrheal medication, and biofeedback. The traditional surgical approach is sphincteroplasty if there is a defect of the external sphincter. Innovative treatment modalities have included sacral nerve stimulation, injectable implants, dynamic graciloplasty, and artificial bowel sphincter.

Discussion

This review was designed to assess the various surgical options available for fecal incontinence and critically evaluate the evidence behind these procedures. The algorithm in the surgical treatment of fecal incontinence is shifting. Injectable therapy and sacral nerve stimulation are likely to be the mainstay in future treatment of moderate and severe fecal incontinence, respectively. Sphincteroplasty is limited to a small group of patients with isolated defect of the external sphincter. A stoma, although effective, can be avoided in most cases.

### Pharmacotherapy for fecal incontinence: a review [^1131EyrM]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence is a common clinical problem that often is frustrating to the patient and treating physician. Nonsurgical management for fecal incontinence includes dietary manipulation, Kegel exercises, perianal skin care, and biofeedback therapy. Pharmacotherapies often are used to assist in management of fecal incontinence. A variety of pharmacotherapies have been utilized for the management of fecal incontinence; limited data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials are available. This is a review of the existing literature on clinical trials of several classes of drugs and other medical therapies that may be beneficial for patients with fecal incontinence. The information in this article was obtained by a MEDLINE search for all clinical trials of drug therapy for fecal incontinence. These treatments and the existing data on their use are summarized. Treatments reviewed include stool bulking agents, with an emphasis on the most promising effect obtained with calcium polycarbophil, constipating agents, including loperamide, codeine, amitriptyline, atropine, and diphenoxylate agents injected into the anal sphincter, drugs to enhance anal sphincter function, including topical phenylepherine and oral sodium valproate, and trials of fecal disimpaction. A new classification to easily remember the treatment categories for this condition, based on the "ABCs of treatment for fecal incontinence", has been introduced into the structure of this review.

### Physical therapies for prevention of urinary and faecal incontinence in adults [^11266MsH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Physical therapies, particularly pelvic floor muscle training, have been recommended for prevention of incontinence associated with childbearing, and prostate surgery.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of physical therapies in preventing incontinence in adults.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Incontinence Group trials register was searched to September 2001. Trials were also sought from the Reference Lists of relevant articles and from experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in adults without incontinence symptoms that compared a physical therapy with no treatment, or any other treatment to prevent incontinence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.

Main Results

Two trials in men (155 men) and 13 trials in women (4661 women) were included. As most trials recruited regardless of continence status, and there was much heterogeneity, only a qualitative synthesis was undertaken. Three of seven trials in childbearing women reported less urinary incontinence after pelvic floor muscle training compared to control treatment three months postpartum. Two trials selected women at higher risk of postnatal incontinence. The third used an intensive training programme. Four trials did not find any difference between the groups at the primary endpoint. Two trials compared pre-prostate surgery pelvic floor muscle training with control treatment, and no difference in the occurrence of postoperative urinary incontinence was reported between the groups.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether physical therapies can prevent incontinence in childbearing women, or men following prostate surgery. Further, better quality research is needed.

### Etiology and management of fecal incontinence [^115SWpra]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (1993). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Wexner/Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS)" for fecal incontinence.

The Wexner/Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS) is a clinical calculator used in the assessment of patients suffering from fecal incontinence. This scoring system is designed to quantify the severity of fecal incontinence, which can be a debilitating condition affecting quality of life. The CCFIS takes into account factors such as frequency of incontinence to gas, liquid or solid stool, and the ability to engage in daily activities. The score ranges from 0 (complete continence) to 20 (complete incontinence). The higher the score, the more severe the incontinence. This calculator is particularly useful in monitoring the progress of treatment and in comparing the efficacy of different therapeutic interventions. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it is most applicable to patients who have fecal incontinence.

The Wexner/Cleveland Clinic Fecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS) calculator evaluates a person's level of fecal incontinence by gathering input data from five categories: incontinence to solid stool, incontinence to liquid stool, incontinence to gas, pads use, and impact on lifestyle. Each category is assessed through a choice of five descriptive options, which are converted into numerical scores ranging from 0 to 4.

The possible responses and their corresponding scores are as follows:

- **Never**: 0
- **Rarely (< 1/month)**: 1
- **Sometimes (< 1/week, ≥ 1/month)**: 2
- **Usually (< 1/day, ≥ 1/week)**: 3
- **Always (≥ 1/day)**: 4

Steps for computation:

1. For each input category, determine the user's response and assign the associated score based on the predefined scale.
2. Sum the scores from all five categories to produce a total score, which can range from 0 to 20.

Interpretation of the total score is provided on a scale that measures the severity of fecal incontinence:

- A score of 0 indicates "Perfect continence".
- A score from 1 to 7 represents "Mild incontinence".
- A score from 8 to 14 reflects "Moderate incontinence".
- A score from 15 to 19 signifies "Severe incontinence".
- A score of 20 indicates "Complete incontinence".

The calculator returns both the total score and its interpretation, offering a clear understanding of the user's level of fecal incontinence severity.

### Measuring fecal incontinence [^1147qVm3]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

The measurement of fecal incontinence is challenging. Because fecal incontinence is a symptom, the subjective perception of the patient must be the foundation of any evaluation of incontinence or the impact of incontinence. The lack of a criterion standard makes testing measures for reliability and validity more difficult. Despite this, many measures are available and can be divided into three broad categories: descriptive measures that do not provide summary scores; severity measures that assess the frequency and type of incontinence; and impact measures that assess the effect of incontinence on quality of life. The strengths and weaknesses of currently available measures are presented in this review.

### Fecal incontinence and biofeedback therapy [^1158gziU]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Biofeedback as delivered in most clinical settings in Western medicine has been consistently reported to improve symptoms of fecal incontinence. Closer scrutiny of the elements of the intervention and controlled studies, however, have consistently failed to find any benefit of the biofeedback element of this complex package of care; nor has any superiority been found for one modality over another. There is a need for further well-designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trials. Meanwhile, there can be little doubt that conservative interventions improve many patients with fecal incontinence to the point where most report satisfaction with treatment and do not wish to consider more invasive options, such as surgery.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116y8ngt]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment of bowel and bladder incontinence — Urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence are common after stroke; approximately 40% to 60% of stroke patients have urinary incontinence during their acute admission for stroke, falling to 25% by hospital discharge, and at 1 year, 15% will remain incontinent of urine. Fecal incontinence prevalence is ≈40% acutely but diminishes to 20% by discharge from rehabilitation. Age, cognition, and motor impairments are risk factors for bladder incontinence, and age and functional impairment are risk factors for fecal incontinence on admission for stroke. Impaired awareness of urinary incontinence is correlated with mortality and the need for nursing home care 3 months after stroke. Many patients recover continence after stroke, and because of the associated risks and burden, management of bowel and bladder continence is an essential part of the rehabilitation process. The recommendation to remove indwelling urinary catheters within 24 hours is based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for all hospitalized patients and is not specific to stroke. We were unable to identify any high-quality studies of treatment for fecal incontinence after stroke, and recommendations are based on the general population of adults.

### Current and emerging treatment options for fecal incontinence [^113aKpp4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI) is a multifactorial disorder that imposes considerable social and economic burdens. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of current and emerging treatment options for FI. A MEDLINE search was conducted for English-language articles related to FI prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment published from January 1, 1990 through June 1, 2013. The search was extended to unpublished trials on ClinicalTrials.gov and relevant publications cited in included articles. Conservative approaches, including dietary modifications, medications, muscle-strengthening exercises, and biofeedback, have been shown to provide short-term benefits. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation was considered ineffective in a randomized clinical trial. Unlike initial studies, sacral nerve stimulation has shown reasonable short-term effectiveness and some complications. Dynamic graciloplasty and artificial sphincter and bowel devices lack randomized controlled trials and have shown inconsistent results and high rates of explantation. Of injectable bulking agents, dextranomer microspheres in non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid (NASHA Dx) has shown significant improvement in incontinence scores and frequency of incontinence episodes, with generally mild adverse effects. For the treatment of FI, conservative measures and biofeedback therapy are modestly effective. When conservative therapies are ineffective, invasive procedures, including sacral nerve stimulation, may be considered, but they are associated with complications and lack randomized, controlled trials. Bulking agents may be an appropriate alternative therapy to consider before more aggressive therapies in patients who fail conservative therapies.

### Physiologic variables that predict the outcome of treatment for fecal incontinence [^1171wPvJ]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Identification of physiologic factors that predict response to fecal incontinence therapy would be helpful in choosing the optimal treatment and advising patients on the likelihood of a successful outcome. However, few physiologic parameters have been consistently identified as important in predicting response to either biofeedback or surgery. The process of isolating these factors has been hampered by heterogeneity in the definition of fecal incontinence, lack of consensus on what constitutes a successful outcome, lack of follow-up data, variations in the way "standard" treatments are implemented, and lack of properly powered randomized controlled trials. Among the physiologic variables that studies have generally found to be predictive of successful outcomes in biofeedback treatment are the threshold for external anal sphincter contraction after treatment, the inclusion of sensory training in treatment, and a reduction in volume for the first sensation after treatment. Factors that have not been found to be important in predicting outcome following biofeedback retraining include the duration of fecal incontinence, pudendal nerve damage, patient age, symptom severity, pretreatment anal canal pressures, and results of anal ultrasonography. The presence of some degree of anorectal sensation is the only preoperative assessment that has been found to be predictive of response to surgical therapy. It is recommended that outcome measures for fecal incontinence be more clearly defined, that future biofeedback studies elaborate the predictive value of pretreatment anorectal sensation and the response to sensory retraining, and that postsurgical measurements such as anal squeeze pressure and sphincter length be taken into account.

Biofeedback — Pelvic floor rehabilitation may be considered for patients with fecal incontinence (FI) who have not responded adequately to conservative measures, with case series showing substantial but variable improvement. Biofeedback may be considered for patients with FI. Biofeedback training, also called pelvic floor rehabilitation, is a noninvasive treatment option for patients with FI who have not responded adequately to dietary modification, medications, counseling, and other supportive measures. The goals of a comprehensive biofeedback program are to improve sensation, coordination, and strength and to provide supportive counseling and practical advice regarding diet, bowel habits, behavior modification, and skin care, and nonrandomized, prospective, and retrospective case series reported 64% to 89% improvement in FI related to biofeedback.

### Rapid priority setting exercise on faecal incontinence for cochrane incontinence [^113TjruM]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Faecal incontinence (FI) is the involuntary passage of faecal material through the anal canal. The prevalence of FI is estimated to range from 2% to 17% among community-dwelling individuals, rising to 40% among people aged over 65 years living in a care home. Incontinence has a severe negative impact on quality of life and can profoundly affect an individual's health, family and sexual relationships, lifestyle choices, employment and finance.

While FI associated with specific diseases has received some attention, there has been a paucity of priority setting exercises (PSEs) for FI research. Those that have been undertaken highlight the need for randomised controlled trials to assess effectiveness and safety of FI treatments, particularly comparative effectiveness trials. The need to focus on continence literacy and communication, and the dissemination of evidence-based management interventions, has also been highlighted in commentaries. Given the paucity of PSEs on FI, there is a need for an up-to-date assessment of the research landscape, collation of stakeholder topic uncertainties, and the prioritisation and exploration of these.

Over the last decade, there has been an increased emphasis on the adoption of structured approaches for priority setting, particularly the effective use of end user feedback to increase the likelihood of producing studies that have a positive effect on health outcomes. Cochrane Incontinence (CI) commissioned this rapid PSE on FI, as there is a need for a comprehensive review of the evidence base, and stakeholder engagement to ensure priority areas are true 'gaps' and these topics are deemed important for patients/carers and healthcare professionals (HCPs). This rapid PSE will act as the first step in a project to identify future systematic review questions. As such, the aim of this PSE was to rapidly identify existing reviews and trial evidence on FI in partnership with stakeholders as a first step towards informing priority CI Reviews.

### Biofeedback treatment of fecal incontinence: a critical review [^115qShQn]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aims of this review are 1) to critically evaluate the literature on the efficacy of biofeedback treatment for fecal incontinence, 2) to compare different types of biofeedback, and 3) to identify patient characteristics which predict a successful outcome.

Methods

The MEDLINE database was searched for articles published between 1973 and 1999 which included the terms "biofeedback" and "fecal incontinence". Pediatric and adult articles in any language were screened. Inclusion for review required that the study be prospective, have five or more subjects, and have a description of the treatment protocol.

Results

Thirty-five studies were reviewed. Only six studies used a parallel treatment design and just three of those randomized subjects to treatment groups. A meta-analysis (weighted by subjects) was performed to compare the results of two treatment protocols that dominate the literature. The mean success rate of studies using Coordination training (i.e., coordinating pelvic floor muscle contraction with the sensation of rectal filling) was 67 percent, while the mean success rate for studies using Strength training (i.e., pelvic floor muscle contraction) was 70 percent. Furthermore, the mean success rate for those Strength training studies using electromyographic biofeedback was 74 percent, while the mean success rate for studies using anal canal pressure biofeedback Strength training was 64 percent. However, these conclusions are limited by the absence of clearly identified criteria for determining success. There are also inconsistencies in the literature regarding the patient selection criteria, severity and cause of symptoms, amount of treatment, as well as the type of biofeedback protocols and instrumentation used. Finally, no patient characteristics were identified that would assist in predicting successful outcome.

Conclusion

Although most studies report positive results using biofeedback to treat fecal incontinence, quality research is lacking. Recommendations are made for future investigations to 1) improve experimental design, 2) include long term follow-up data, and 3) to use an adequate sample size that allows for meaningful analysis.

### Survey of anal sphincter dysfunction using anal manometry in patients with fecal incontinence: a possible guide to therapy [^113yfmc6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Summary Box

What is already known:

The burden of fecal incontinence (FI) is prevalent worldwide
There is a lack of data regarding the frequency of specific type of sphincter involvement in FI
According to the majority of practical guidelines FI is characterized only clinically; i.e. passive incontinence, urge incontinence and fecal soilage
A recent National Institute of Health consensus meeting for guiding future research in FI to overcome the barriers in diagnosis and treatment of FI, mentioned the need to further develop this classification
There is a lack of research in development of pharmacological agents that augment internal anal sphincter tone as there is a scarcity of data about the prevalence of internal anal sphincter dysfunction in patients with FI

What the new findings are:

In patients with FI, internal anal sphincter dysfunction is the most common finding, alone or in combination with external anal sphincter dysfunction
A novel classification of FI based on the precise characterization of sphincteric involvement or lack of this involvement is critical in selecting targeted therapy for FI with long-term outcomes that are free of side effects
Future studies using pharmacological agents to target internal anal sphincter dysfunction by increasing the tone will be of clinical importance

### Treatment options for fecal incontinence [^112oHehB]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Fecal incontinence is a socially devastating disorder which affects at least 2.2 percent of community dwelling adults and 45 percent of nursing home residents. Most incontinent patients can be helped, but physicians are poorly informed about treatment options. The aim of this study was to develop a consensus on treatment options by convening a conference of surgeons, gastroenterologists, nurses, psychologists, and patient advocates.

Method

A 1–1/2 day conference was held in April, 1999. Experts from different disciplines gave overviews, followed by extended discussions. Consensus statements were developed at the end of the conference. This summary statement was drafted, circulated to all participants, and revised based on their input.

Conclusions

1) Diarrhea is the most common aggravating factor for fecal incontinence, and antidiarrheal medications such as loperamide and diphenoxylate or bile acid binders may help. Fecal impaction, a common cause of fecal incontinence in children and elderly patients, responds to combinations of laxatives, education, and habit training in approximately 60 percent. These causes of fecal incontinence can usually be identified by history and physical examination alone. 2) In patients who fail medical management or have evidence of sphincter weakness, anorectal manometry and endoanal ultrasound are recommended as helpful in differentiating simple morphologic defects from afferent and efferent nerve injuries and from combined structural and neurologic injuries. 3) Biofeedback is a harmless and inexpensive treatment which benefits approximately 75 percent of patients but cures only about 50 percent. It may be most appropriate when there is neurologic injury (i.e., partial denervation), but it has been reported to also benefit incontinent patients with minor structural defects. 4) External anal sphincter plication with or without pelvic floor repair is indicated when there is a known, repairable structural defect without significant neurologic injury. It is effective in approximately 68 percent. 5) Salvage operations are reserved for patients who can not benefit from biofeedback or levator-sphincteroplasty. These include electrically stimulated gracilis muscle transpositions and colostomy. 6) Antegrade enemas delivered through stomas in the cecum or descending colon reduce or eliminate soiling in approximately 78 percent of children with myelomeningocele; this operation may come to be more widely applied. 7) Investigational treatments include implanted nerve stimulators, artificial sphincters, and anal plugs. 8) Patient characteristics which influence choice of treatment include mental status, mobility impairment, and typical bowel habits. 9) Additional research is needed to better define the mechanisms responsible for fecal incontinence, to assess the efficacy of these treatments, to develop better treatments for nursing home residents, and to identify predictors of outcome.

Fecal incontinence (FI) — evaluation and assessment (GRADE): A history should be obtained to help determine the cause of incontinence and should include specific risk factors for incontinence and characterize the duration and severity of symptoms (Strong Expert opinion). Measures that assess the nature and severity of incontinence and the impact of incontinence on quality of life should be used as a part of the assessment of FI (Conditional Low). A physical examination is an essential component of the evaluation of patients with FI (Strong Expert opinion). Anorectal physiology testing (manometry, anorectal sensation, volume tolerance, and compliance) can be considered to help define the elements of dysfunction and guide management (Conditional Very low). Endoanal ultrasound may be useful to evaluate sphincter anatomy when planning a sphincter repair (Conditional Very low). Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing is not routinely recommended. Endoscopy should be performed according to established screening guidelines and in patients presenting with symptoms that warrant further evaluation (ie, changes in bowel habits; bleeding).

### Diagnosis and treatment of faecal incontinence: consensus statement of the Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery and the Italian association of hospital gastroenterologists [^117Y5hij]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Faecal incontinence is a common and disturbing condition, which leads to impaired quality of life and huge social and economic costs. Although recent studies have identified novel diagnostic modalities and therapeutic options, the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach is not yet completely known and shared among experts in this field. The Italian Society of Colorectal Surgery and the Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists selected a pool of experts to constitute a joint committee on the basis of their experience in treating pelvic floor disorders. The aim was to develop a position paper on the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of faecal incontinence, to provide practical recommendations for a cost-effective diagnostic work-up and a tailored treatment strategy. The recommendations were defined and graded on the basis of levels of evidence in accordance with the criteria of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, and were based on currently published scientific evidence. Each statement was drafted through constant communication and evaluation conducted both online and during face-to-face working meetings. A brief recommendation at the end of each paragraph allows clinicians to find concise responses to each diagnostic and therapeutic issue.

Fecal incontinence — severity and quality-of-life assessment tools should be incorporated into evaluation: "Measures That Assess the Nature and Severity of Incontinence and the Impact of Incontinence on Quality of Life Should Be Used as a Part of the Assessment of FI". Common instruments include the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, the St. Marks Fecal Incontinence Score (Vaizey Score), and the Cleveland Clinic Florida Fecal Incontinence Score (Wexner Score). Using objective measures can help establish baseline scores, track treatment response, and compare groups; a Wexner score of 9 or higher indicates significant impairment of quality of life and is a threshold at which patients commonly seek medical care. The ASCRS Pelvic Floor Disorders Consortium recommended the routine use of the "IMPACT" tool that combines the Wexner and Vaizey scores while limiting patient burden. A bowel diary documenting the daily number and severity of episodes may help quantify disease severity, and "A cutoff of 50% or more reduction in the number of episodes per week" has been used as an objective measure of clinical improvement after an intervention, although it has not been validated against other measures.

### Biofeedback and / or sphincter exercises for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults [^113e5jsZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Faecal incontinence is a particularly embarrassing and distressing condition with significant medical, social and economic implications. Anal sphincter exercises (pelvic floor muscle training) and biofeedback therapy have been used to treat the symptoms of people with faecal incontinence. However, standards of treatment are still lacking and the magnitude of alleged benefits has yet to be established.

Objectives

To determine the effects of biofeedback and/or anal sphincter exercises/pelvic floor muscle training for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 24 January 2012) which contains trials from searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE and handsearching of conference proceedings; and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating biofeedback and/or anal sphincter exercises in adults with faecal incontinence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed the risk of bias of eligible trials and two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials. A wide range of outcome measures were considered.

Main Results

Twenty one eligible studies were identified with a total of 1525 participants. About half of the trials had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment. One small trial showed that biofeedback plus exercises was better than exercises alone (RR for failing to achieve full continence 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94). One small trial showed that adding biofeedback to electrical stimulation was better than electrical stimulation alone (RR for failing to achieve full continence 0.47, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.65). The combined data of two trials showed that the number of people failing to achieve full continence was significantly lower when electrical stimulation was added to biofeedback compared against biofeedback alone (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78). Sacral nerve stimulation was better than conservative management which included biofeedback and PFMT (at 12 months the incontinence episodes were significantly fewer with sacral nerve stimulation (MD 6.30, 95% CI 2.26 to 10.34). There was not enough evidence as to whether there was a difference in outcome between any method of biofeedback or exercises. There are suggestions that rectal volume discrimination training improves continence more than sham training. Further conclusions are not warranted from the available data.

Authors' Conclusions

The limited number of identified trials together with methodological weaknesses of many do not allow a definitive assessment of the role of anal sphincter exercises and biofeedback therapy in the management of people with faecal incontinence. We found some evidence that biofeedback and electrical stimulation may enhance the outcome of treatment compared to electrical stimulation alone or exercises alone. Exercises appear to be less effective than an implanted sacral nerve stimulator. While there is a suggestion that some elements of biofeedback therapy and sphincter exercises may have a therapeutic effect, this is not certain. Larger well-designed trials are needed to enable safe conclusions.

### Fecal incontinence in adults: new therapies [^115b4r51]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI) is the involuntary and recurrent loss of stool. FI significantly affects both physical and social well-being, while imposing a substantial economic burden. The global prevalence of FI is approximately 8%. Risk factors include advanced age, diarrhea, anal sphincter damage from obstetric trauma or anorectal surgery, pelvic floor abnormalities (such as rectal prolapse), inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological conditions. Despite greater understanding of the impact of FI and advances in diagnostic techniques and treatment options, management remains inconsistent, likely because of limited awareness of available therapies. Patients often benefit from conservative treatments, including dietary modifications, fiber supplementation, antidiarrheal agents, and physical therapy, especially when these are tailored to specific symptoms and rigorously applied. Next level options include anorectal biofeedback therapy, the perianal injectable bulking agent dextranomer, or anal/vaginal barrier devices, which can be effective for patients if tolerated. Transanal irrigation may be considered for patients with neurogenic bowel and fecal retention to aid in rectal cleansing and prevent FI. Sacral neuromodulation is the preferred surgical treatment of FI. Noninvasive anal electrical and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation are not superior to placebo in controlled trials. Translumbosacral magnetic stimulation was beneficial in an uncontrolled trial; sham-controlled trials are necessary. Owing to limited long-term efficacy, anal sphincteroplasty is typically reserved for younger patients with obstetric anal sphincter defects. Colostomy is considered a last resort. Injection of autologous muscle cells into the external anal sphincter has shown promise in small uncontrolled trials, although it has not yielded significant results in most controlled trials.

### Priorities for treatment research from different professional perspectives [^1127K36R]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The consensus conference "Advancing the Treatment of Fecal and Urinary Incontinence Through Research" had as one of its goals the development of a comprehensive list of research priorities. Experts from all disciplines that treat incontinence-gastroenterology, pediatric gastroenterology, urology, urogynecology, colorectal surgery, geriatrics, neurology, nursing, and psychology-and patient advocates were asked to identify their highest priorities for treatment-related research. Meeting participants were shown the aggregated list and invited to propose additional priorities. Treatments for fecal incontinence (biofeedback, sphincteroplasty, antidiarrheal and laxative medications, and sacral nerve stimulation) require validation by randomized, controlled trials. For urinary incontinence, the greatest need is to compare pharmacological, behavioral, and surgical treatments. Trials assessing combined treatments (e.g., biofeedback plus surgery vs. surgery alone or biofeedback alone) are also needed. New drugs are needed that target anal canal resting pressure in fecal incontinence and hypersensitivity to distention in urge urinary incontinence. It may be possible to substantially reduce the incidence of incontinence through modification of obstetric practices (e.g., avoiding episiotomies or offering elective cesarean delivery to high-risk patients), providing pelvic floor exercises before childbirth, and educating patients to avoid straining during defecation. For the elderly, practical behavioral and pharmacological treatments are needed that can postpone or avoid institutionalization. Social science research may identify ways to counteract the social stigma of fecal incontinence and assist physicians in providing patients with more comprehensive and understandable information on the risks associated with different treatment options.

### Fecal incontinence: evaluation and treatment [^111Uv6KS]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence affects men and women of all ages, leading to personal disability and high financial costs. The evaluation of the patient should clarify the pathophysiology of the symptoms and provide guidance in choosing the appropriate treatment. A comprehensive history and physical examination including endoscopic assessment is able to identify the cause of most cases of fecal incontinence. If necessary, functional methods can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Patient selection for suitable treatment is most important and should be based on clinical and physiologic findings. Conservative dietary or medical treatment is often effective, when the symptoms are mild. Biofeedback therapy is effective in most patients. It has no side effects and is well tolerated. Structural damage to the anus may be repaired by surgery, like sphincter repair, the best treatment of selective sphincter defects. Neoanal sphincters and artificial sphincters are the last possibility after failed surgery and before colostomy. They are less attractive because of technical difficulties and low success rate. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment has the potential to improve the outcome for patients with fecal incontinence.

### Faecal incontinence in adults [^114qZtvC]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Faecal incontinence can affect individuals of all ages and in many cases greatly impairs quality of life, but incontinent patients should not accept their debility as either inevitable or untreatable. Education of the general public and of health-care providers alike is important, because most cases are readily treatable. Many cases of mild incontinence respond to simple medical therapy, whereas patients with more advanced incontinence are best cared for after complete physiological assessment. Recent advances in therapy have led to promising results, even for patients with refractory incontinence. Health-care providers must make every effort to communicate fully with incontinent patients and to help restore their self-esteem, eliminate their self-imposed isolation, and allow them to resume an active and productive lifestyle.

### Efficacy of supervised pelvic floor muscle training and biofeedback vs attention-control treatment in adults with fecal incontinence [^116Jjwbp]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in combination with conservative treatment is recommended as first-line treatment for patients with fecal incontinence, although its efficacy is unclear. We investigated whether supervised PFMT in combination with conservative treatment is superior to attention-control massage treatment and conservative treatment in adults with fecal incontinence.

Methods

We performed a randomized, controlled, superiority trial of patients with fecal incontinence at a tertiary care center at a public hospital in Denmark. Ninety-eight adults with fecal incontinence were randomly assigned to groups that received supervised PFMT and biofeedback plus conservative treatment or attention-control treatment plus conservative treatment. The primary outcome was rating of symptom changes, after 16 weeks, based on scores from the Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale. Secondary outcomes were changes in the Vaizey incontinence score (Vaizey Score), Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, and Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Scale.

Results

In the intention-to-treat analysis, participants in the PFMT group were significantly more likely to report improvement in incontinence symptoms based on Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale scores (unadjusted odds ratio, 5.16; 95% CI, 2.18–12.19; p = 0.0002). The PFMT group had a larger reduction in the mean Vaizey Score (reduction, -1.83 points; 95% CI, -3.57 to -0.08; p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in condition-specific quality of life. In the per-protocol analyses, the superiority of PFMT was increased. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

This randomized controlled trial of adults with fecal incontinence provides support for a superior effect of supervised PFMT in combination with conservative treatment compared with attention-control massage treatment and conservative treatment. We found that participants who received supervised PFMT had 5-fold higher odds of reporting improvements in fecal incontinence symptoms and had a larger mean reduction of incontinence severity based on the Vaizey Score compared with attention control massage treatment. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT01705535.

### Effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions delivered at home for urinary and faecal incontinence with homebound older people: systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^1158fRXR]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Problems with continence, which manifest as different subtypes of urinary and/or faecal incontinence, are distressing yet common conditions that increase in prevalence with ageing and impact on both individuals and those living with them. Incontinence is often poorly assessed, diagnosed and managed, with older adults least likely to be offered evidence-based treatments. Incontinence is more prevalent among people with multiple co-morbidities, including obesity, depression, mobility impairment and dementia, and is associated with loneliness and social isolation, poor quality of life, caregiver stresses and moving into care.

Frequently under-reported due to embarrassment, seeing continence problems as normal ageing and being unaware of treatment possibilities, many people struggle to cope at home without seeking help. Prevalence estimates vary across different populations and settings, with urinary incontinence (UI) consistently more commonly reported than faecal, affecting not only the frailest but also fitter community-living older people. As the older age groups, and particularly the 'oldest old', are now the fastest-growing section of the population, and not only in the developed world, the prevalence of incontinence is rising and understanding the needs of the older people affected is a global issue. Pharmacological solutions can play a helpful role in managing some types of incontinence, for instance, prostate problems, nocturia or over-active bladder. However, given the risks of polypharmacy in older people, particularly for the oldest and frailest who are most likely to be housebound, and the uncertainty about the long-term side-effects of anti-cholinergic medications, alternative approaches to supporting continence in this population are necessary.

Evidence suggests that incontinence is remediable for many people using simple lifestyle and behavioural approaches. To date, the bulk of research on incontinence in older people has focused on people in hospital or in care homes settings, where prevalence is more easily estimated than in community settings, and intervention effects are more readily quantified in a more clearly defined target group. Yet only 2.3% of people aged 65 years and older live in care homes (even among those aged ≥ 85 years, this proportion is only 10.2%), and acute hospital stays are usually so short that any meaningful intervention requires continuation into community settings after discharge home.

Group interventions delivered in clinic settings for people living with incontinence have been reported; however, these often have relatively high attrition rates. Reasons include the severity of incontinence, inconvenient location or time and dislike of groups. Stigma associated with services for incontinence may also be a factor.

### Drug treatment for faecal incontinence in adults [^112735sJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Faecal incontinence (leakage of bowel motions or stool) is a common symptom which causes significant distress and reduces quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the effects of drug therapy for the treatment of faecal incontinence. In particular, to assess the effects of individual drugs relative to placebo or other drugs, and to compare drug therapy with other treatment modalities.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register of Trials, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 June 2012) and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials were included in this systematic review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included trials.

Main Results

Sixteen trials were identified, including 558 participants. Eleven trials were of cross-over design. Eleven trials included only people with faecal incontinence related to liquid stool (either chronic diarrhoea, following ileoanal pouch or rectal surgery, or due to use of a weight-reducing drug). Two trials were amongst people with weak anal sphincters, one in participants with faecal impaction and bypass leakage, and one in geriatric patients. In one trial there was no specific cause for faecal incontinence. Seven trials tested anti-diarrhoeal drugs to reduce faecal incontinence and other bowel symptoms (loperamide, diphenoxylate plus atropine, and codeine). Six trials tested drugs that enhance anal sphincter function (phenylepinephrine gel and sodium valproate). Two trials evaluated osmotic laxatives (lactulose) for the treatment of faecal incontinence associated with constipation in geriatric patients. One trial assessed the use of zinc-aluminium ointment for faecal incontinence. No studies comparing drugs with other treatment modalities were identified. There was limited evidence that antidiarrhoeal drugs and drugs that enhance anal sphincter tone may reduce faecal incontinence in patients with liquid stools. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects (such as constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, headache and nausea) than placebo. However, the dose may be titrated to the patient's symptoms to minimise side effects while achieving continence. The drugs acting on the sphincter sometimes resulted in local dermatitis, abdominal pain or nausea. Laxative use in geriatric patients reduced faecal soiling and the need for help from nurses. Zinc-aluminium ointment was associated with improved quality of life, with no reported adverse effects. However, the observed improvement in quality of life was seen in the placebo group as well as the treatment group. It should be noted that all the included trials in this review had small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. 'Risk of bias' assessment was unclear for most of the domains as there was insufficient information. There were no data suitable for meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The small number of trials identified for this review assessed several different drugs in a variety of patient populations. The focus of most of the included trials was on the treatment of diarrhoea, rather than faecal incontinence. There is little evidence to guide clinicians in the selection of drug therapies for faecal incontinence. Larger, well-designed controlled trials, which use the recommendations and principles set out in the CONSORT statement, and include clinically important outcome measures, are required.

### Systematic review of surgical treatments for fecal incontinence [^11677bY6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). Low credibility.

Background

No systematic review has examined the collective randomized and nonrandomized evidence for fecal incontinence treatment effectiveness across the range of surgical treatments.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and harms of surgical treatments for fecal incontinence in adults.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, as well as hand searches of systematic reviews, were used as data sources.

Study Selection

Two investigators screened abstracts for eligibility (surgical treatment of fecal incontinence in adults, published 1980–2015, randomized controlled trial or observational study with comparator; case series were included for adverse effects). Full-text articles were reviewed for patient-reported outcomes. We extracted data, assessed study risk of bias, and evaluated strength of evidence for each treatment-outcome combination.

Interventions

Surgical treatments for fecal incontinence were included interventions.

Main Outcome Measures

Fecal incontinence episodes/severity, quality of life, urgency, and pain were measured.

Results

Twenty-two studies met inclusion criteria (13 randomized trials and 9 observational trials); 53 case series were included for harms. Most patients were middle-aged women with mixed FI etiologies. Intervention and outcome heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Evidence was insufficient for all of the surgical comparisons. Few studies examined the same comparisons; no studies were high quality. Functional improvements varied; some authors excluded those patients with complications or lost to follow-up from analyses. Complications ranged from minor to major (infection, bowel obstruction, perforation, and fistula) and were most frequent after the artificial bowel sphincter (22%-100%). Major surgical complications often required reoperation; few required permanent colostomy.

Limitations

Most evidence is intermediate term, with small patient samples and substantial methodologic limitations.

Conclusions

Evidence was insufficient to support clinical or policy decisions for any surgical treatments for fecal incontinence in adults. More invasive surgical procedures had substantial complications. The lack of compliance with study reporting standards is a modifiable impediment in the field. Future studies should focus on longer-term outcomes and attempt to identify subgroups of adults who might benefit from specific procedures.

### Fibre supplementation in addition to loperamide for faecal incontinence in adults: a randomized trial [^113sLJJJ]. Colorectal Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Many patients with faecal incontinence (FI) are prescribed a constipating agent concurrently with either fibre supplementation or a low-residue diet. Clinician opinion varies as to which initial approach is best. This study compared these treatments in routine clinical practice.

Design

Double-blind randomized cross-over trial.

Participants

Patients referred for FI.

Intervention

Six weeks of low-residue diet, placebo fibre supplement and loperamide followed by 6 weeks of fibre supplement, neutral diet and loperamide or the reverse order.

Results

Sixty-three patients were randomized. At baseline the mean Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) was 31. After low-residue diet, placebo fibre supplement and loperamide the FISI was 18.4 (standard deviation, SD 13.2). After fibre supplementation and loperamide the FISI was 18.8 (SD 14.1). The mean difference between the treatment arms was not significant (-0.8; 95% CI: -4.9 to 3.3). There was also no difference between the treatments for the SF-36 and the Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life scale. There was marked variability in individual responses, some favouring more fibre and some less.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence that treatment with more or less fibre in addition to loperamide has similar clinical effectiveness overall, however individual tailoring of treatment seems important to achieve the best outcome.

### Sacral nerve stimulation for fecal incontinence and constipation in adults: a short version cochrane review [^1141Pg6K]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal incontinence and constipation are disabling conditions that reduce quality of life. If conservative treatment fails, one option is sacral nerve stimulation (SNS), a minimally invasive technique allowing modulation of the nerves and muscles of the pelvic floor and hindgut.

Objectives

To assess the effects of SNS for fecal incontinence and constipation in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialized Trials Register (searched 24 April 2007) and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomized or quasi-randomized trials assessing the effects of SNS for fecal incontinence or constipation in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed the methodological quality of the included studies, and undertook data extraction.

Main Results

Three crossover studies were included. Two, enrolling 34 (Leroi) and two participants (Vaizey), assessed the effects of SNS for fecal incontinence, and one (Kenefick), enrolling two participants, assessed SNS for constipation. In the study by Leroi, following the crossover period, participants, while still blinded, chose the period of stimulation they had preferred. Outcomes at different time points were reported separately for 19 participants who preferred the "on" and five who preferred the "off" period. For the group of 19, the median (range) episodes of fecal incontinence per week fell from 1.7 (0–9) during the "off" period to 0.7 (0–5) during the "on" period; for the group of five, however, the median (range) rose from 1.7 (0–11) during the "off" period compared with 3.7 (0–11) during the "on" period. Vaizey reported an average of six, and one, episodes of fecal incontinence per week during the "off" and "on" periods, respectively. Leroi reported that four of 27 participants experienced an adverse event resulting in removal of the stimulator; Vaizey did not report adverse events. For SNS for constipation, during the "off" crossover period the participants experienced an average of two bowel movements per week, compared with five during the "on" period. Abdominal pain and bloating occurred 79% of the time during the "off" period compared with 33% during the "on" period. No adverse events occurred.

Authors' Conclusions

The very limited evidence from the included studies suggests that SNS can improve continence in selected people with fecal incontinence, and reduce symptoms in selected people with constipation. However, temporary, percutaneous stimulation for a 2–3-week period does not always successfully identify those for whom a permanent implant will be beneficial. Larger, good quality randomized crossover trials are needed to allow the effects of SNS for these conditions to be assessed with more certainty.

### Fecal incontinence: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and updated treatment strategies [^1175GSZf]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Fecal incontinence (FI) is defined as the involuntary loss or passage of solid or liquid stool in patients. FI is a common and debilitating condition in men and women. The incidence increases with age and also often goes unreported to health care providers. It is crucial that providers ask at-risk patients about possible symptoms. Evaluation and management is tailored to specific symptoms and characteristics of the incontinence. If conservative methods fail to improve symptoms, then other surgical options are considered, such as sacral nerve stimulation and anal sphincter augmentation. This review provides an update on current and future therapies.

ACG Guidelines — fecal incontinence — Pelvic floor rehabilitative techniques are effective and should be offered to patients with FI (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Patients can be taught to contract pelvic floor muscles without feedback or with manometric or EMG-assisted biofeedback therapy, which requires a rectal balloon and anal manometry or a surface EMG device. In an RCT of 171 patients, symptoms improved in 55% and resolved in 5% with comparable effects among standard care, exercises, and biofeedback options, with improvement sustained at 1 year; in another RCT in 108 patients, 22% reported adequate relief after 8 weeks of conservative therapy. In nonresponders to education, 6 biweekly manometric biofeedback sessions were superior to exercises alone, with 77% reporting adequate relief and 66% completely continent versus 41% and 48% with exercises, and effects on anal squeeze pressures are variable across studies.

### The perspective of the patient [^115Lshir]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD) is a nonprofit education and research group. Founded in 1991, the IFFGD provides information and advice to patients around the world with fecal incontinence and other gastrointestinal disorders, educates physicians through medical symposia and other activities, funds and undertakes research, and provides testimony to Congress about the necessity of furthering research activities related to fecal incontinence through the National Institutes of Health. The IFFGD advocates research directed toward more comprehensive identification of quality-of-life issues associated with fecal incontinence and improved assessment and communication of treatment outcomes related to quality of life, standardization of scales to measure incontinence severity and quality of life, assessment of the utility of diagnostic tests for affecting management strategies and treatment outcomes, development of new drug compounds offering new treatment approaches to fecal incontinence, development and testing of strategies for primary prevention of fecal incontinence associated with childbirth, and further understanding of the process of stigmatization as it applies to the experience of individuals with fecal incontinence.

### Biofeedback and / or sphincter exercises for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults [^1139ESqm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Faecal incontinence is a particularly embarrassing and distressing condition with significant medical, social and economic implications. Anal sphincter exercises and biofeedback therapy have been used to treat the symptoms of people with faecal incontinence. However, standards of treatment are still lacking and the magnitude of alleged benefits has yet to be established.

Objectives

To determine the effects of biofeedback and/or anal sphincter exercises/pelvic floor muscle training for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 27 February 2006) and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating biofeedback and/or anal sphincter exercises in adults with faecal incontinence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and two reviewers independently extracted data from included trials. A wide range of outcome measures were considered.

Main Results

Eleven eligible studies were identified with a total of 564 participants. In all but three trials methodological quality was poor or uncertain. No study reported a major difference in outcome between any method of biofeedback or exercises and any other method, or compared to other conservative management. There are suggestions that rectal volume discrimination training improves continence more than sham training and that anal biofeedback combined with exercises and electrical stimulation provides more short-term benefits than vaginal biofeedback and exercises for women with obstetric-related faecal incontinence. Further conclusions are not warranted from the available data.

Authors' Conclusions

The limited number of identified trials together with their methodological weaknesses do not allow a definitive assessment of the possible role of anal sphincter exercises and biofeedback therapy in the management of people with faecal incontinence. We found no evidence of biofeedback or exercises enhancing the outcome of treatment compared to other conservative management methods. While there is a suggestion that some elements of biofeedback therapy and sphincter exercises may have a therapeutic effect, this is not certain. Larger well-designed trials are needed to enable safe conclusions.

### Patient preferences for endpoints in fecal incontinence treatment studies [^111CsXSo]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials of treatments for fecal incontinence (FI) are difficult to compare because case definitions and study endpoints vary. Our aims were to assess patient perspectives on the case definition for FI and how treatment success should be measured.

Methods

In Phase 1, 28 FI patients participated in anonymous on-line focus groups, and in Phase 2, 186 people with FI, stratified by gender, race, and age completed an online survey.

Key Results

Focus group participants described frequency and urgency as the most important characteristics for defining FI. Most (80%) thought staining of underwear constitutes FI, but only 33% thought gas leakage was FI. When asked how the success of treatment should be defined, 77% said by a reduction in frequency or complete cure, but less than half thought a 50% reduction in frequency was enough. When asked how much reduction would be needed, responses averaged 80%. The Phase 2 survey confirmed that frequency, urgency, and intestinal discomfort are the most important characteristics for case definition, and that success should be defined by at least a 75% decrease in frequency. A 50% reduction was an acceptable endpoint for 58% overall but only 26% for those aged ≥ 65. "Adequate relief" was acceptable to 78%.

Conclusions and Inferences

Inclusion criteria for trials should specify a minimum frequency of FI. Most patients would require a ≥ 75% reduction in FI frequency to call a treatment successful but young adults and those with more severe FI would accept a ≥ 50% reduction as meaningful.

### Loperamide versus psyllium fiber for treatment of fecal incontinence: the fecal incontinence prescription (Rx) management (FIRM) randomized clinical trial [^116pyemD]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal incontinence is a devastating condition with few US Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic treatment options. Loperamide and psyllium, both first-line treatments, have different mechanisms of action without any comparative data.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness and tolerability of loperamide compared with psyllium for reducing fecal incontinence. We hypothesized that psyllium fiber supplementation would be more effective than loperamide for reducing fecal incontinence episodes and have fewer adverse effects.

Design

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial comparing loperamide (followed by psyllium) with psyllium (followed by loperamide).

Settings

Our sites included outpatient clinics within a Veterans Affairs medical center and university affiliate.

Patients

Participants included community-dwelling adults (n = 80) with at least 1 fecal incontinent episode on a 7-day bowel diary.

Intervention

Participants received either daily loperamide (plus placebo psyllium powder) or psyllium powder (plus loperamide placebo) for 4 weeks. After a 2-week washout, participants crossed over to 4 weeks of alternate treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the number of fecal incontinence episodes from 7-day bowel diaries. Secondary outcomes included symptom severity, quality of life, and tolerability.

Results

Mean age was 60.7 ± 10.1 years; 68% were men. After determining nonsignificant carryover effects, combined analyses showed no differences between the loperamide and psyllium groups for reducing fecal incontinent episodes, symptom severity, or quality of life. Within each group, both loperamide and psyllium reduced fecal incontinent episodes and improved symptom severity and quality of life. Constipation occurred in 29% of participants for loperamide vs 10% for psyllium.

Limitations

Limitations include the washout period length and dropout rate after crossing over to the second intervention.

Conclusions

Both loperamide and psyllium improve fecal incontinence. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects, especially constipation.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^1114MsHA]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Medical management of fecal incontinence prioritizes conservative therapy before surgery or devices: all patients must be managed with conservative therapies tailored to symptoms and implemented for an adequate duration, including dietary modification, fiber supplements, fluids, scheduled toileting, a bowel training program, pelvic floor exercises, and medications for diarrhea and constipation. The next step is pelvic floor retraining with biofeedback therapy. For diarrhea, we recommend starting with loperamide (2 mg), generally starting with 1 tablet taken 30 minutes before breakfast and titrated as necessary up to 16 mg/d; fiber supplementation can be used to improve stool consistency and reduced diarrhea-associated FI, and cholestyramine or colesevelam may be helpful. Anticholinergic agents and clonidine are alternative options for patients with diarrhea and FI. For constipation, laxatives and anorectal testing to identify evacuation disorders are recommended, and rectal cleansing with a small enema or tap water reduces the likelihood of stool leakage. Patients who are truly refractory to conservative measures should undergo anorectal testing, starting with anorectal manometry and, if necessary, anorectal imaging, and these patients are eligible for surgical therapy or devices.

### Toward a core outcome set for faecal incontinence – A systematic review of outcomes reported in the literature [^117GY3hN]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Faecal incontinence (FI) is a prevalent issue which can have a detrimental impact on the patient's quality of life. Current international guidelines lack strong treatment recommendations due to few studies in the field, in combination with the heterogeneity in outcome reporting. To address this, a core outcome set (COS) is proposed to standardize outcome reporting in FI studies, facilitating meta-analyses and enhancing therapeutic recommendations. Through several steps outlined by COMET 'what' to measure will be determined prior to determining 'how' to measure these outcomes. This systematic review aims to identify 'what' outcomes have been used in FI intervention studies so far in adult patients as a starting phase for the development of a future COS for FI.

Method

Medline, Embase and the Cochrane library were searched to identify all outcomes reported in comparative effectiveness trials assessing one or more treatment option in adult patients suffering from FI. The outcomes were categorized according to the Core Outcome Measurement in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) taxonomy to standardize outcome terminology, assess completeness, and inform subsequent steps in COS development.

Results

A total of 109 studies were included, which revealed 51 unique outcomes classified into 38 domains within four core areas. On average four outcomes were reported per study (range 1–11). The most commonly reported outcomes were "severity of FI" (83%), "quality of life" (64%), "number of FI episodes" (40%), "anorectal motor function" (39%), and "frequency of bowel movements" (16%).

Conclusion

This systematic review offers an overview of outcomes reported in FI studies, highlighting the heterogeneity between studies. This heterogeneity emphasizes the need for standardizing outcome reporting which can be established through the creation of a COS.

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^112ZviKN]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Symptom severity and quality of life in fecal incontinence are assessed primarily by frequency using daily diaries; a 50% reduction in the number of episodes or days with FI is considered the primary end point in clinical trials. Severity can be evaluated with questionnaire instruments such as the Wexner and Modified Manchester Health Questionnaires, the Fecal Incontinence Severity Score, and the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index. All of the available instruments incorporate the frequency and type of leakage, some also incorporate the volume of leakage and rectal urgency, and severity is correlated strongly with its impact on quality of life.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 210: fecal incontinence [^116bRjuh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for fecal incontinence, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery, ACOG 2019 guidelines recommend to avoid performing surgery as the initial management in patients with fecal incontinence (except in patients with fistulas or rectal prolapse) because surgical treatments provide only short-term improvement and are associated with more frequent and more severe complications compared with non-surgical interventions.

### Faecal incontinence core outcome set: an international Delphi consensus exercise among patients, health-care professionals, and researchers [^112bx4PK]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Faecal incontinence is a debilitating anorectal disorder that can severely affect a person's quality of life. The variability in reported outcomes in studies on treatments for faecal incontinence complicates the synthesis of evidence, thereby weakening treatment recommendations. Furthermore, the emphasis on clinical outcomes often neglects outcomes that are crucial to patients' daily lives. Incorporating diverse stakeholder perspectives, we aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS)-a minimum set of outcomes that should be measured in future studies evaluating the efficacy of a treatment in adults with faecal incontinence. Following guidelines from the COMET initiative, this study proceeded through three steps: identifying outcomes via patient interviews and a systematic literature review; ranking and refining outcomes through two rounds of Delphi surveys involving patients, health-care professionals, and researchers; and finalising the COS through a consensus meeting with relevant stakeholders. Round 1 of the Delphi survey included 109 participants (73 health-care professionals and researchers and 36 patients) and round 2 involved 74 participants (54 and 20, respectively). In both rounds, participants ranked the importance of potential outcomes on a 9-point Likert scale. Of the 58 outcomes that entered round 1 and the three that were later added, 27 outcomes were voted out and the remaining 34 were discussed during a consensus meeting to finalise the COS. The final COS encompasses 13 outcomes: seven quality of life-related outcomes (quality of life, influence on daily activities, social functioning, treatment satisfaction, enjoyment in life, embarrassment, and peace of mind) and six clinical outcomes (severity of faecal incontinence, number of faecal incontinence episodes, urgency, stool consistency, adverse events, and adherence to therapy). This study establishes what outcomes should be included in a COS for use in faecal incontinence research, but future research is needed to identify the appropriate measurement instruments for each outcome and to establish appropriate timing for their assessment, which will further refine outcome definitions before this COS can be implemented. Once these aspects are clarified, the COS can be adopted into faecal incontinence research, which we hope will ultimately improve clinical care.
