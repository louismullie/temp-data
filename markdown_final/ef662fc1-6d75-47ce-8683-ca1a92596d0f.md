## Question

annual wellness visit 68 years old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to conduct a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit for a 68-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about eligibility, billing, and the distinction between AWV and a routine physical. Then, I should verify the required components and how to operationalize them efficiently. Next, I will consider cognitive screening strategy and follow-up pathways. After that, I need to check medication review, fall risk, and functional assessment. I will then review immunizations, cancer screening, and advance care planning. Finally, I should address disparities, low-value testing, and close with a concise, actionable plan and documentation requirements, making sure each step aligns with CMS and evidence-based guidance.

> Let me first confirm eligibility and billing basics so I don't miss a coverage issue. For a 68-year-old with Medicare Part B beyond 12 months, the AWV is covered once every 12 months with no patient cost-sharing if the provider accepts assignment, and I should use G0439 for a subsequent AWV; wait, I initially thought G0438 might apply again, but that code is reserved for the initial AWV only, so I need to correct that and use G0439 for this visit [^116k3uqR]. I should also clarify that the AWV is not a head-to-toe physical exam; it is a preventive planning visit, and if a problem-focused exam is performed, it should be billed separately as an E/M service with appropriate modifiers and patient cost-sharing, which I need to explain upfront to avoid confusion [^116k3uqR].

> Next, I should review the core AWV elements to ensure I don't omit required components. The visit must include a Health Risk Assessment, updating medical and family history, current providers and medications, measurement of height, weight, BMI or waist circumference, and blood pressure, detection of cognitive impairment, establishment or update of a personalized prevention plan and screening schedule for the next 5–10 years, and provision of personalized health advice and referrals; hold on, I should verify that CMS explicitly requires cognitive assessment and that the prevention plan be individualized, which it does, even though no single cognitive tool is mandated [^1162PQ4a] [^112HsUAL] [^116k3uqR].

> I will now examine the Health Risk Assessment logistics because workflow affects completion rates. Let me consider pre-visit completion via the patient portal to save in-clinic time; studies show portal-based HRA completion is feasible and can be integrated into the EMR, which I should leverage to streamline the visit and ensure we capture PROMIS-aligned mental and physical health domains efficiently [^114P2nCa]. But wait, what if digital access is limited? I need to ensure alternatives are available, including paper forms or staff-assisted completion, to avoid widening disparities in uptake [^112QN74H].

> Now, cognitive screening — this is often the most misunderstood piece, so I should double-check the regulatory stance and practical approach. CMS requires assessment for cognitive impairment using direct observation plus information from patients and informants, and if appropriate, a brief validated tool; however, the USPSTF found insufficient evidence for routine universal screening of asymptomatic adults, so I should frame this as risk-based assessment rather than mandatory population screening, and I must be transparent about that nuance with patients [^112HsUAL] [^1162PQ4a]. Let me think about tools: Mini-Cog and GPCOG are reasonable, brief options with minimal education bias; if an informant is present, adding an informant tool like the AD8 or Short IQCODE improves accuracy, and I should plan a two-step pathway where a positive screen triggers a fuller evaluation rather than diagnosing on the spot [^112CiFUo] [^1177DXRM] [^114RPbjz]. Hold on, I should verify that structured screening outperforms unstructured observation; yes, structured tools detect more impairment than informal questioning, which supports using them when concerns arise or when baseline cognition is unknown [^116h8tKY].

> Next, I should review medication reconciliation and safety screening because polypharmacy is common at 68. I need to check for high-risk medications using Beers and STOPP/START, screen for anticholinergic burden, and reconcile across pharmacies and specialists; if I find duplications or agents that increase fall risk, I should deprescribe or substitute and arrange follow-up to monitor effects, documenting rationale and shared decision-making [^112QN74H]. Wait, let me verify that medication review is indeed a required element; while not a standalone billable component, it is embedded within the AWV's medication list update and safety review, so I should ensure it is explicitly addressed and tied to the prevention plan [^116k3uqR].

> I will now assess fall risk and functional status, since these directly affect safety and independence. I should ask about falls in the past year, screen for balance impairment, and review gait, vision, footwear, and home hazards; if there have been two or more falls or one fall with injury, I should implement a multifactorial intervention including exercise with balance/strength training, vitamin D when deficient, medication optimization, and home modifications, and I should confirm that these are evidence-based strategies supported by AGS/BGS and CDC [^1134Bz2K]. Let me reconsider whether functional assessment is required; while not a discrete billing element, functional status informs the personalized prevention plan and should be documented, including ADLs and IADLs, to align with geriatric best practices [^112QN74H].

> Next, I should review immunizations and cancer screening so I don't miss time-sensitive prevention. I need to ensure influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19, and shingles vaccines are up to date per ACIP and ACC guidance, and I should plan catch-up if needed; for adults 65+, RSV vaccination is now recommended as a one-time dose, which I should offer if not previously given [^11472dq5] [^11472dq5]. For cancer screening, I should align with USPSTF: colorectal screening through age 75, breast screening through 74, and importantly, I should recommend against prostate cancer screening in men 70 and older because harms outweigh benefits, documenting shared decision-making if the patient requests it despite this recommendation [^112L5qku] [^115Wg9hn]. Hold on, I should verify that these align with preventive care indices used in quality measurement; yes, these are standard components tracked in preventive care metrics and AWV-linked care gaps [^115Wg9hn].

> I need to ensure advance care planning is addressed, as it is both a required element and a key geriatric intervention. I should confirm or update the healthcare proxy, discuss goals of care, and document code 99497 for the first 30 minutes of ACP discussion; if the patient is not ready, I should plant the seed and schedule a dedicated ACP visit, integrating this into the prevention plan so it is revisited annually [^113NNmTM] [^116k3uqR]. Let me verify that ACP is emphasized in healthy aging frameworks; yes, AGS highlights ACP as a core component of high-quality geriatric care and wellness encounters [^113NNmTM].

> But wait, what about equity and disparities in AWV uptake and delivery? I should proactively address barriers: lower uptake among Black and Hispanic beneficiaries, those with lower education or income, and those with social needs; using portal prompts, plain-language education, and offering telehealth AWVs when appropriate can mitigate access issues, and I should monitor whether my interventions narrow disparities over time [^114ELPtR] [^115t733E]. Hold on, I should verify telehealth AWV trends; Medicare allowed telehealth AWVs during COVID-19, utilization peaked early and declined, but feasibility remains, so I can offer hybrid models for patients with transportation or mobility barriers [^113QmTCM].

> I should double-check the risk of low-value testing during AWVs, because unnecessary ECGs, urinalyses, and thyrotropin tests can trigger cascades. National data show about 19% of healthy beneficiaries receive at least one such test during AWVs, with modest but real downstream events and costs; therefore, I should avoid routine ECGs and urinalyses in asymptomatic patients and reserve thyroid testing for those with symptoms or risk factors, documenting the rationale to reduce cascades and patient harm [^111GdnGW] [^111waLxH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost reflexively ordered a "baseline ECG" out of habit; I need to stop that and adhere to Choosing Wisely principles within AWVs [^113LGcXQ].

> Let me synthesize a concrete, visit-flow plan and verify it aligns with requirements. Pre-visit: send the HRA via portal or paper, request medication bottles, and ask the patient to invite an informant if possible; in-visit: update history, vitals, and medications, perform brief cognitive screening with Mini-Cog or GPCOG, assess falls and function, review immunizations and cancer screening, conduct ACP, and close with a written personalized prevention plan and referrals; post-visit: schedule follow-up for abnormal screens, deprescribing, or ACP completion, and ensure billing with G0439 plus any separately billable E/M if a problem-focused exam was performed, documenting time and medical necessity [^116k3uqR] [^1162PQ4a]. I should confirm that this approach leverages team-based care; yes, nurse care managers and MAs can handle much of the HRA, screening, and education, freeing clinician time for complex decisions and counseling [^111ox9na].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation captures all required elements to support billing and quality reporting. I should record the HRA summary, cognitive assessment method and results, medication reconciliation actions, fall and functional risk mitigation, immunizations given or planned, cancer screening status and rationale for stopping or continuing, and the personalized prevention plan with a 5–10 year schedule; if ACP occurred, I should bill 99497 and note duration and content, and if a problem-oriented exam was done, I should bill the appropriate E/M with modifier 25 when justified [^116k3uqR]. Hold on, I should verify that quality measures tied to AWVs, such as preventive service completion and cognitive health assessment, are accurately captured; this ensures the visit contributes to both patient outcomes and system performance metrics [^111AxY1C].

The Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) for a 68-year-old is a **preventive, no-copay visit** [^116k3uqR] that focuses on health risk assessment, personalized prevention planning, and early detection of cognitive impairment, functional decline, and fall risk [^1162PQ4a] [^116JjM7x]. It is **not a physical exam** but includes vitals, medication review, immunization updates, and advance care planning [^116k3uqR] [^113NNmTM]. The AWV increases uptake of preventive services [^116qixCm], may reduce falls and fractures [^113FEGVw], and supports early cognitive identification [^1155GKgy]; however, disparities persist by race, income, and geography [^114ELPtR] [^115t733E], and low-value testing can trigger cascades [^111GdnGW]. Use brief, validated tools (Mini-Cog, GPCOG) for cognition [^112CiFUo], screen for falls, depression, and functional status, and tailor the prevention plan to patient goals and comorbidities [^114bzvbi] [^116JjM7x].

---

## Core components of the AWV

The AWV includes the following **core elements**:

- **Health risk assessment (HRA)**: A questionnaire covering demographics, activity, nutrition, tobacco/alcohol use, and psychosocial risks [^115yFn6h] [^116JjM7x].

- **Vital signs and anthropometrics**: Height, weight, BMI, blood pressure, and pulse [^1162PQ4a].

- **Medical and family history**: Update chronic conditions, surgeries, and family history [^1162PQ4a].

- **Medication review**: Reconcile and review for interactions and adherence [^112QN74H].

- **Cognitive assessment**: Screen for impairment using brief tools (Mini-Cog, GPCOG) [^112CiFUo] [^112HsUAL].

- **Functional assessment**: Evaluate ADLs, IADLs, fall risk, and mood [^112QN74H].

- **Immunization review**: Update influenza, pneumococcal, shingles, and COVID-19 vaccines per ACIP [^1153fkRa] [^11472dq5].

- **Advance care planning**: Discuss and document goals, proxies, and directives [^113NNmTM].

- **Personalized prevention plan**: A written 5–10 year plan for screenings and counseling [^1162PQ4a].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several organizations provide **guidelines for AWV implementation**:

| **Organization** | **Key recommendations** |
|-|-|
| American Geriatrics Society (AGS) | - Emphasize functional status, fall risk, cognitive screening, and advance care planning [^1134Bz2K] [^113NNmTM] <br/> - Promote patient-centered, culturally competent care [^112zPKBq] |
| Alzheimer's Association | - Use brief, validated cognitive tools (**Mini-Cog**, **GPCOG**) [^112CiFUo] <br/> - Combine patient and informant input [^1177DXRM] <br/> - Refer for **further evaluation** if indicated [^114RPbjz] |
| U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) | - Routine cognitive screening is not recommended due to insufficient evidence [^112HsUAL] <br/> - Emphasize individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making [^notfound] |
| Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) | - Requires cognitive assessment and personalized prevention plan [^1162PQ4a] <br/> - Covers AWV at 100% with no copay [^116k3uqR] |

---

## Benefits of the AWV

The AWV provides **several patient- and system-level benefits**:

- **Increased preventive service uptake**: Higher rates of cancer screening, immunizations, and counseling [^116qixCm] [^1116vaBu].

- **Early detection of cognitive impairment**: Timelier MCI and dementia diagnoses, enabling earlier intervention [^1155GKgy] [^113585rH].

- **Reduced falls and fractures**: Associated with modest reductions in falls and fractures, especially in high-risk groups [^113FEGVw].

- **Improved patient engagement**: Structured prevention planning enhances patient-provider communication and adherence [^116k3uqR].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite benefits, the AWV faces **important limitations**:

- **Low uptake**: Only ~24% of eligible beneficiaries completed AWVs in 2017 [^1143djRT].

- **Disparities**: Lower uptake among Black, Hispanic, rural, and low-income beneficiaries [^111AtQPi] [^115t733E].

- **Low-value testing**: Routine ECGs and urinalyses can trigger cascades of unnecessary care and costs [^111GdnGW] [^111waLxH].

- **Provider burden**: Time, documentation, and billing complexity limit adoption [^115Se33Q].

---

## Clinical considerations for a 68-year-old patient

For a typical 68-year-old, the AWV should **prioritize**:

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Assess blood pressure, lipids, and lifestyle factors; consider ASCVD risk [^116JjM7x].

- **Cancer screening**: Colorectal, breast, cervical, and prostate screening per guidelines and patient preference [^115Wg9hn].

- **Immunizations**: Ensure up-to-date influenza, pneumococcal, shingles, and COVID-19 vaccines [^11472dq5].

- **Cognitive and functional screening**: Use Mini-Cog or GPCOG; assess falls, mood, and daily function [^112CiFUo] [^112QN74H].

- **Advance care planning**: Discuss goals, proxies, and directives early [^113NNmTM].

---

## Documentation and billing requirements

Proper documentation and billing are essential: use **CPT codes **G0438 for the initial AWV and G0439 for subsequent annual visits, and ensure documentation includes the HRA, cognitive assessment, prevention plan, and advance care planning discussions to support billing and quality reporting [^116k3uqR].

---

## Strategies to improve AWV utilization

To increase uptake, **implement**:

- **Patient education**: Explain benefits and schedule proactively [^111ox9na].

- **Provider training**: Standardize workflows and reduce administrative burden [^115Se33Q].

- **Team-based care**: Use nurses and care managers to conduct parts of the AWV [^111ox9na].

- **Telehealth**: Offer virtual AWVs where appropriate [^113QmTCM].

- **Quality improvement**: Track uptake and address disparities systematically [^114ELPtR].

---

The AWV is a **preventive, patient-centered visit** that improves preventive care, detects early decline, and supports aging in place; optimizing uptake and quality requires addressing disparities, avoiding low-value testing, and aligning care with patient goals [^114bzvbi] [^1116vaBu].

### Medicare's annual wellness visit: 10 years of opportunities gained and lost [^114bzvbi]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Medicare annual wellness visits (AWV) were initiated 10years ago. Though AWVs emphasize on disease prevention and health promotion for older adults was a huge step forward, the current "one size fits all" approach does not adequately meet the wellness needs of a diverse population of older adults. Current AWVs do not sufficiently take into consideration the medical, psychological, functional, racial, cultural and socio-economic diversity of older adults. Updated AWVs should be tailored to meet the needs and priorities of older adults receiving them. Several geriatrics approaches to care, including geriatrics Glidepaths and the 4Ms of an Age-Friendly Health System, could help develop and guide a more patient-specific geriatrics focused approach to AWVs. Medicare's IPPE is an ideal time to advise new Medicare beneficiaries regarding what they should and should not do to maximize their ability to be healthy and functionally independent into their 80s, 90s, and 100s.

### Disparities in Medicare annual wellness visits after a systemwide quality improvement initiative: a serial cross-sectional analysis [^114ELPtR]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Medicare Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs) offer potential benefits for older adults. Little is known about recent racial/ethnic disparities in populations with high AWV completion.

Objective

To calculate racial/ethnic disparities before and after a health system initiative to increase AWV completion, and investigate factors associated with post-initiative AWV completion.

Design

Repeated cross-sectional evaluation over 3 years, ending August 2023.

Patients

Medicare beneficiaries age ≥ 65 in a large Midwestern U.S. health system. Race/ethnicity was categorized as White non-Hispanic, Black/African American non-Hispanic, Latino/Hispanic, Asian non-Hispanic, and Other non-Hispanic.

Main Measures

Annual AWV completion during the pre-initiative year (year 0) and two subsequent initiative years. Regression models tested for unadjusted and covariate-adjusted disparities in AWV completion.

Key Results

The health system's overall rate of AWV completion increased from 47.5% in year 0 to 68.9% in year 2. All racial/ethnic groups experienced similar proportional increases in AWV completion, including 21.5% among White, 21.6% among Black, and 22.5% among Latino/Hispanic patients. In unadjusted regression for year 2 (N = 92,634) results, the probability of AWV completion was 15% lower among both Black (relative risk, [RR], 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.89) and Latino/Hispanic (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82–0.87) patients, compared to Whites. However, the adjusted probability of AWV completion was only 4% lower in Black (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93–1.00) and 5% lower in Latino/Hispanic (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91–0.99) patients than in Whites. AWV completion was positively associated with age ≥ 70, using the patient portal for appointment scheduling, and prior year AWV completion, and negatively associated with Medicaid coverage, positive screening for any social need, and dementia.

Conclusions

A 2-year health system initiative led to substantially increased AWV completion, but pre-existing disparities persisted. To reduce disparities, future efforts should explicitly focus on enhancing equity and addressing barriers in subgroups with particularly low AWV completion.

### Assessment of prevalence and cost of care cascades after routine testing during the Medicare annual wellness visit [^111GdnGW]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the prevalence of low-value testing during Medicare annual wellness visits and of cascades of medical services and new diagnoses that might follow?

Findings

In this cohort study of 75 275 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 and older who received an annual wellness visit, 19% of beneficiaries received at least 1 routine electrocardiogram, urinalysis, or thyrotropin test during their visit, more often those who were younger and lived in urban, high-income areas. An estimated 6 cascade-attributable events per 100 electrocardiogram recipients and 5 events per 100 urinalysis recipients occurred in the subsequent 90 days.

Meaning

In this study, a minority of healthy Medicare beneficiaries received routine tests during their annual wellness visits, and low-value electrocardiograms and urinalyses were associated with cascades of care.

### Annual wellness visits and early dementia diagnosis among Medicare beneficiaries [^1155GKgy]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Early recognition of cognitive impairment is key to optimal dementia care. No previous research has examined the probability of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) at 5-year follow-up among older adult Medicare beneficiaries by receipt of an annual wellness visit (AWV).

Objective

To assess the association of incident AWV with the first ADRD or MCI diagnosis among older adults with Medicare fee-for-service benefits.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective population-based cohort study used 100% Texas fee-for-service Medicare data from 2015 to 2022. Participants comprised 549 516 community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 68 years or older in 2018, with complete Medicare fee-for-service Parts A and B and no Medicare Advantage plan enrollment for 2015 to 2018.

Exposure

Medicare AWVs.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The first MCI or ADRD diagnosis (reported as MCI or ADRD diagnosis, MCI diagnosis, and ADRD diagnosis) from the AWV index date in 2018 through December 31, 2022.

Results

In this cohort study of 549 516 Medicare beneficiaries with no diagnosis of MCI or ADRD in 2015 to 2017 (mean [SD] age, 76.7 [6.6] years; 289 932 women [52.8%]), 66 433 (12.1%) had an incident AWV in 2018. Annual wellness visit recipients were more likely than those who did not receive an AWV to be female, to be non-Hispanic White (followed by Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and other), to have more education, to reside in a metropolitan area, to have more comorbidities, and to have a primary care professional in the 12 months before the AWV index date. After propensity score matching, AWV receipt was associated with a 21% increase in MCI diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.16–1.27]) and a 4% increase in ADRD diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02–1.06]). The increase in MCI diagnosis associated with AWV was larger when the AWV was censored or treated as a time-dependent covariate in the follow-up period.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings indicate that AWV recipients had a timelier first MCI diagnosis than those who did not receive an AWV, but first ADRD diagnosis differed little. This study suggests that the Medicare AWV health policy may increase MCI identification, prompting more specialized care.

### Closing the gap: improving the percentage of annual wellness visits among Medicare patients [^112VzHSF]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) provides an opportunity for providers to acquire critical information pertaining to patients' health through a review of vitals, environmental risks, and medical and family history. These visits are free to those enrolled in Medicare, a federal health insurance for those 65 years old and older, and prioritize patient–provider relationship building and preventative care. Diminished mortality rates, reductions in hospital admissions and increased recommended screenings are correlated to patients who have relationships with their primary care providers. In our internal medicine practice, patient and provider AWV completion was noted as suboptimal though the cause of low AWV rates was not entirely clear. AWVs are often overlooked or dismissed by patients, especially if they have recently undergone a physical exam and assume AWV appointments do not add value to their health. Provider-level barriers to AWV completion include limited understanding of benefits, confusion about documentation/billing details and insufficient time. We sought to increase Medicare AWV completion to promote preventative medicine, address and control risk factors, improve health outcomes, and save overall healthcare costs. Using the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control framework, we aimed to increase the percentage of AWVs among Medicare patients in our internal medicine practice from a 1.7% baseline completion to 2.7% in 3 months from January to April 2023.

### Healthy aging: American Geriatrics Society white paper executive summary [^115mYL7W]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). High credibility.

Welcome to Medicare and Medicare Part B Annual Wellness Visit — covered services for Medicare beneficiaries — are both designed to promote development of a personalized prevention plan based on an individualized health risk assessment, yet these services are substantially underused by Medicare beneficiaries; Healthy People 2020 includes an objective to 'Increase the proportion of older adults who use the Welcome to Medicare benefit' from a 6.4% baseline in 2008 to 7% by 2020 and is concordant with the goal to 'Increase the proportion of older adults who are up to date on a core set of clinical preventive services'; Geriatricians should promote the use of these services to their patients and colleagues; build them into their workflow; and familiarize themselves with the required elements of these services, the covered benefits, and the codes used for billing purposes.

### The effect of Medicare's annual wellness visit on preventive care for the elderly [^116qixCm]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The study aim was to assess the effect of receiving an Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) between 2011 and 2013 on the annual rate of eight preventive services recommended for the Medicare population following the AWV. We used retrospective Medicare claims from 2009 to 2014 for a 5% national sample of fee-for-service beneficiaries in the United States. Propensity score-adjusted logistic regressions were performed to estimate the log odds of the probability of receiving the preventive services between beneficiaries who received AWVs during 2011–13 and those who did not during the same period. The average marginal effect was also reported. Among 845,318 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 23% had an AWV in 2011–2013. In a propensity-matched sample of 381,934 patients, AWV participants are more likely to undergo subsequent preventive services within a year (adjusted odds ratio ranges from 1.46 (95% CI, 1.44, 1.49) to 2.43 (95% CI, 2.38, 2.49). The findings are consistent using secondary outcomes or with subgroups defined by baseline primary care provider visits or baseline preventive services. These analyses showed that AWV is associated with a significant increase in all the preventive services examined. As Healthy People 2020 has established a target goal to increase the proportion of older adults who receive a core set of clinical preventive services by 10%, AWV represents a promising opportunity to facilitate the delivery of preventive care for the elderly and to advance our knowledge about effective strategies for healthy aging.

### Alzheimer's association recommendations for operationalizing the detection of cognitive impairment during the Medicare annual wellness visit in a primary care setting [^114RPbjz]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2013). Medium credibility.

Full dementia evaluation following positive AWV screening — timing, scope, and components: Patients with assessments that indicate cognitive impairment during the AWV should be further evaluated to determine appropriate diagnosis or to identify other causes, and initiation of a full dementia evaluation is outside the scope of the AWV but can occur in a separate visit on the same day, during a newly scheduled visit, or through referral to a specialist, including geriatricians, geriatric psychiatrists, neurologists, and neuropsychologists; clinicians are encouraged to counsel patients to include an informant, and a two-visit approach is cited as time-effective and consistent with the two-step approach used in epidemiologic research. Components of a full dementia evaluation include a complete medical history; assessment of multiple cognitive domains; neurologic exam; ADL and IADL functioning; assessment for depression; review for medications that may adversely affect cognition; standard laboratory tests (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), complete blood count (CBC), serum B12, folate, complete metabolic panel, and, if at risk, testing for sexually transmitted diseases); and structural brain imaging (MRI or CT) as a supplemental aid, with MRI or CT especially informative for recent onset and rapidly progressing dementia, younger onset dementia (< 65 years of age), history of head trauma, or neurologic symptoms suggesting focal disease.

### Alzheimer's association recommendations for operationalizing the detection of cognitive impairment during the Medicare annual wellness visit in a primary care setting [^115DqRat]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2013). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's Association Medicare Annual Wellness Visit Algorithm for Assessment of Cognition — scope and components are described for use during the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV), effective January 1, 2011; the AWV requires an assessment to detect cognitive impairment, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) elected not to recommend a specific assessment tool because there is no single, universally accepted screen. To provide primary care physicians with guidance on cognitive assessment during the AWV, and when referral or further testing is needed, the Alzheimer's Association convened a group of experts to develop recommendations, and the resulting algorithm includes review of patient Health Risk Assessment (HRA) information, patient observation, unstructured queries during the AWV, and use of structured cognitive assessment tools for both patients and informants. Widespread implementation of this algorithm could be the first step in reducing the prevalence of missed or delayed dementia diagnosis, and the AWV also includes routine measurements such as height, weight, and blood pressure, a review of medical and family history, and establishment of a list of current medical providers, medications, and schedule for future preventive services.

Primary care workflow during the AWV — assessment without an informant and communication to patients: According to the algorithm, any patient who does not have an informant present should be assessed with a structured tool, and for such patients completion of this structured assessment can be administered by trained medical staff as the first step for cognitive impairment detection. To increase acceptance, the reason can be normalized with a statement such as, "This is something I do for all of my older patients as part of their annual visit", and when the initial assessment prompts further evaluation, explanation of results should be deferred until a more comprehensive evaluation has been completed; an example statement is, "There are many reasons for not getting every answer correct. More evaluation will help us determine that".

Principles specific to the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV): The AWV requires the completion of a Health Risk Assessment (HRA) by the patient either before or during the visit, and the HRA should be reviewed for any reported signs and symptoms indicative of possible dementia. In primary care, tools for initial cognitive assessments should be brief (< 5 min), appropriately validated, easily administered by non-physician clinical staff, and available free of charge for use in a clinical setting. If further evaluation is indicated based on the results of the AWV, a more detailed evaluation of cognition should be scheduled for a follow-up visit in primary care or through referral to a specialist.

Method

Study Sample

This study draws on patient-level health and demographic characteristics from the EMR for a sample of adults aged 65 years and older who were established primary care patients at a large academic health system. Eligibility criteria included 2 or more primary care visits within a 2-year period between 2017 and 2022, having incurred at least one encounter during the observation period (October 3, 2021–October 2, 2022), and being enrolled in Medicare and eligible for the AWV based on being 66 years or older (beneficiaries are ineligible during the first 12 months of enrollment) as previously described. A billed AWV was based on current procedural terminology codes G0438 or G0439. Our final analytic sample comprises older adults who answered ≥ 1 health risk assessment question to distinguish AWV billed visits, which ensured incorporation of at least one component of the health risk assessment into visit practice in alignment with our study objectives. This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.

Annual Wellness Visit Health Risk Assessment

The AWV health risk assessment at our health system includes more than 30 items (see Supplementary Table 1). At our health system, health risk assessment items are most often administered by medical assistants and are recorded within an EPIC flowsheet by question. As the specific item wording changed during our observation period, we harmonized items into 28 health risk assessment categories. These categories were grouped into 2 domains following the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS), 17 were categorized as mental health risk categories and 11 were categorized as physical health risk categories. Health risk assessments were linked to billed AWV encounters when within 30 days of the billed AWV, when they were outside 330 days of another billed AWV, and when one or more health risk category was complete. An assessment was defined as completed if a response for all 28 categories was recorded. We note affirmative responses (yes/no) for each health risk category and the time stamp of the assessment entry in the EMR.

Limitations and evidence gaps for brief cognitive assessment — There are limitations to these recommendations because they are based on an assessment of recommendations from review articles and on expert opinion, not on a comprehensive new review; sensitivity and specificity will vary depending on the study population's dementia prevalence, the tool(s) used, and the cut score selected; published research on screening tools is uneven in quantity and quality, and the literature is lacking in comparative validity in low-education or illiterate populations.

Informant-based assessment during the AWV — Cognitive assessment combined with informant-reported data improves the accuracy of assessment; if an informant is present during the AWV, use of a structured informant tool is recommended, with brief tools including the Short IQCODE, the AD8 (which can be administered in-person or by telephone), and the GPCOG, which has both patient and informant components.

Alzheimer's Association Medicare Detection of Cognitive Impairment Workgroup — general principles for cognitive assessment: Detection of cognitive impairment is a stepwise, iterative process. Informal observation alone by a physician is not sufficient. Detection can be enhanced by specifically asking about changes in memory, language, and the ability to complete routine tasks. Although no single tool is recognized as the "gold standard" for detection of cognitive impairment, an initial structured assessment should provide either a baseline for cognitive surveillance or a trigger for further evaluation. Clinical staff can offer valuable observations of cognitive and functional changes in patients who are seen over time. Counseling before and after cognitive assessment is an essential component of any cognitive evaluation. Informants (family member, caregiver, etc.) can provide valuable information about the presence of a change in cognition.

### Geriatric assessment: an office-based approach [^112QN74H]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Family physicians should be proficient in geriatric assessment because, as society ages, older adults will constitute an increasing proportion of patients. Geriatric assessment evaluates medical, social, and environmental factors that influence overall well-being, and addresses functional status, fall risk, medication review, nutrition, vision, hearing, cognition, mood, and toileting. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit includes the key elements of geriatric assessment performed by family physicians. Comprehensive geriatric assessment can lead to early recognition of problems that impair quality of life by identifying areas for focused intervention, but a rolling geriatric assessment over several visits can also effectively identify subtle or hidden problems. Assessment should be tailored to patient goals of care and life expectancy. By asking patients and families to self-assess risks using precompleted forms, and by using trained office staff to complete validated assessment tools, family physicians can maximize efficiency by focusing on identified problems. Fall risk can be assessed with a single screening question: "Have you fallen in the past year?" The Beers, STOPP (screening tool of older persons' prescriptions), and START (screening tool to alert doctors to right treatment) criteria are helpful resources for reviewing the appropriateness of medications in older adults. Screening for depression is recommended when depression care supports are available; this can be performed with a brief two-item screen, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Older adults should be screened for unintentional weight loss and malnutrition. Although rates of hearing loss and vision loss increase with age, there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening in asymptomatic individuals. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises clinicians to assess cognition when there is suspicion of impairment. Urinary incontinence can impair patients' quality of life, and it can be assessed with a two-question screening tool. Immunizations and advance care planning are also important components of the geriatric assessment.

### Annual wellness visits and early dementia diagnosis among Medicare beneficiaries [^111AtQPi]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Optimal dementia care depends on early recognition of cognitive impairment and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD). Optimal dementia care should reflect what matters most to patients and adhere to evidence-informed ADRD stage-specific health care. Early recognition of cognitive impairment could prompt clinicians to initiate conversations about advance care planning and assess patients for potentially treatable factors associated with cognitive impairment (eg, hypothyroidism, poor hearing, and sleep apnea). Early diagnosis of cognitive impairment can reduce exposure to potentially inappropriate medications, reduce acute care use, decrease falls, and increase adoption of advance care planning. Only 8% of Medicare beneficiaries with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) receive an MCI diagnosis in primary care clinics. Patient access to dementia assessment often limits timely diagnosis of cognitive impairment.

One way to improve early cognitive impairment recognitionis through annual wellness visits (AWVs), which typically include cognition and fall risk assessment, medication reconciliation, advance care planning consultation, and personalized prevention plans. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services began reimbursing for AWVs in 2011 without cost to Medicare enrollees aged 65 years or older. Annual wellness visit rates increased from 7.9% in 2011 to 21.9% in 2015. In 2017, 32.2% of all Texas fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries received AWVs. Disparities in AWV use include fewer visits for men, non-White beneficiaries, and rural beneficiaries.

In 2020, the US Preventive Services Task Forcerecommended against routine cognitive screening, a major component of the AWV program. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 chronic heart failure studies (mean age, 75.6 years) and 14 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease studies (mean age, 66.3 years) found an overall prevalence of any cognitive impairment of 32% in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 31% in those with chronic heart failure. Another study found a 46% prevalence of MCI in older adults attending an ophthalmology clinic. Tailoring therapy to cognitive impairment status may reduce treatment nonadherence, medication errors, emergency department or hospital visits, and missed appointments, preventable events in patients with chronic conditions and unrecognized cognitive impairment.

Methods

Data Source

This retrospective cohort study used enrollment and claims data from 100% of Texas Medicare administrative data from 2015 to 2022, including Medicare Beneficiary Summary files, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files, outpatient claims, and carrier files. The University of Texas Medical Branch institutional review board approved this study. Consent was waived because the data were deidentified. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Cohort

The study population was community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged 68 years or older in 2018. We restricted analysis to fee-for-service beneficiaries with complete Medicare Parts A and B and no Medicare Advantage plan enrollment for all of 2015 to 2018. We excluded beneficiaries with a previous diagnosis of ADRD or MCI or an AWV based on 2015–2017 claims (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

For beneficiaries with an AWV visit in 2018, the first AWV date in 2018 was the index date. For beneficiaries with no AWV visit in 2018, we randomly assigned each an index month in 2018, matching the frequency of index months of the AWV cohort, and the 15th of the month as their index day. After assigning the AWV index date, we excluded any beneficiaries with AWV, ADRD, or MCI, as well as those in long-term nursing homes before the 2018 AWV index date. We kept the cohort with complete data in our analysis (Table 1).

Table 1.
Cohort Derivation Steps

Measures

Our primary exposure was an AWV in 2018. Medicare allows 1 AWV every 12 months for beneficiaries with Medicare Part B medical insurance for more than 12 months and with no initial preventive physical examination or AWV providing a personalized prevention plan within the preceding 12 months. Beneficiaries have no copayment for an AWV (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

### CDC grand rounds: promoting well-being and independence in older adults [^115PL84o]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Medicare, the primary health care payer for Americans aged ≥ 65 years, has incorporated prevention and screening services into two types of visits: the Welcome to Medicare visit and the Annual Wellness Visit. During the Welcome to Medicare visit, providers conduct a prevention-focused physical examination and review beneficiaries' medical and social history, risk for depression and mood disorders, functional ability, diet and physical activities, and their history of tobacco use. A written plan, similar to a checklist, is created to promote ongoing use of clinical preventive services and the discussion of important health topics, such as advance directives. Annual Wellness Visits encompass personalized prevention plan services including a comprehensive health risk assessment, assessments to detect cognitive impairment, diabetes, hypertension, and missed vaccinations. However, these Medicare prevention and wellness benefits are not as widely used by older Americans as they could be; in 2013, only 6.8% of new Medicare enrollees took advantage of the Welcome to Medicare visit, and in 2014, approximately 16% of Medicare recipients had an Annual Wellness Visit; only an estimated 7% of Medicare beneficiaries receive all recommended preventive services. Annual Wellness Visit barriers include the relatively long duration of the visit (1 hour), low reimbursement rate for providers, and patient confusion about what is included in the visit. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services established improving the rates of the Welcome to Medicare visits as an important Healthy People 2020 objective.

2.2 Nested case‐control population selection

The study population included patients ≥ 68 years with a new diagnosis of MCI or ADRD from 2017 to 2020. ADRD diagnosis was based on the CMS Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) algorithmand MCI diagnosis was based the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code 311.83 and ICD, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code G31.84. 17 To identify newly diagnosed patients in 2017, we applied a 3‐year look‐back to exclude those with pre‐existing MCI or ADRD in 2014 to 2016. The first MCI or ADRD diagnosis date/year was the index date/year. We restricted our study population to patients with complete Medicare Parts A and B and no Medicare Advantage enrollment for 3 years before the index date/year. We repeated the same process to identify the newly diagnosed patients in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. Finally, we limited our study population to those residing in 3089 counties with at least 11 patients, resulting in 2,298,013 Medicare beneficiaries with a new diagnosis of MCI or ADRD in the final study cohort (Table 1). We selected MCI as the cases and used ADRD as the controls for the first nested case–control study. A previous study showed that a frailty index score at cut‐off of 0.28 reached sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 63% for identifying moderate‐to‐severe dementia among older adults with dementia. Then, among the ADRD populations, we calculated the frailty score for each patient and used the frailty score as a proxy to define patients with moderate/severe ADRD. In this second nested case–control study, we selected those without moderate/severe ADRD (mild dementia, frailty score ≤ 0.28) as the cases and those with moderate/severe ADRD (frailty score > 0.28) as the controls.

### Preventing falls in older persons [^1134Bz2K]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

The American Geriatrics Society and British Geriatrics Society recommend that all adults older than 65 years be screened annually for a history of falls or balance impairment. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Family Physicians recommend exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults who are at increased risk of falls. Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Academy of Family Physicians do not recommend routine multifactorial intervention to prevent falls in all community-dwelling older adults, they state that it may be appropriate in individual cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed an algorithm to aid in the implementation of the American Geriatrics Society/British Geriatrics Society guideline. The algorithm suggests assessment and multifactorial intervention for those who have had two or more falls or one fall-related injury. Multifactorial interventions should include exercise, particularly balance, strength, and gait training; vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium; management of medications, especially psychoactive medications; home environment modification; and management of postural hypotension, vision problems, foot problems, and footwear. These interventions effectively decrease falls in the community, hospital, and nursing home settings. Fall prevention is reimbursed as part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit.

### Disparities in Medicare annual wellness visits after a systemwide quality improvement initiative: a serial cross-sectional analysis [^115t733E]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Checkup visits — also known as general health checks, preventive visits, and wellness visits, among other terms — can increase preventive service completion – and improve a variety of patient-reported outcomes,– such as self-rated health, which is predictive of mortality. Additionally, though checkups have not been shown to consistently decrease mortality in all adults, the two randomized trials where checkups reduced mortality were conducted in older adults. Given the substantial potential benefits of these visits, there is clear justification for efforts to maximize checkup uptake in older populations such as patients insured through Medicare.

Among older Americans, the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) is the most common type of checkup; since 2011, Medicare beneficiaries have been eligible for an AWV each year at zero copay. However, despite the potential wide-ranging benefits of these visits, their uptake has proceeded unevenly and unequally. In 2014, only 16% of Medicare beneficiaries completed AWVs, and 23% did so in 2016. AWV completion was also more likely among non-Hispanic White and relatively affluent patients, with Black/African American Medicare beneficiaries consistently completing AWVs less often than Whites in both unadjusted – and adjusted, analyses. Similarly, Latino/Hispanic beneficiaries had lower unadjusted rates of AWV completion than non-Hispanic Whites, but differences did not persist after covariate adjustment. Additionally, beneficiaries with lower education or income (at both the patientand zip codelevel) completed AWVs at lower rates.

### The role of Medicare insurance coverage type in annual wellness visits: a comparison between traditional medicare and medicare advantage plan [^116FJCLd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWVs) was introduced in 2011 as a preventive services visit. AWV uptake has been increasing but remains disproportionately low among vulnerable populations in Traditional Medicare (TM). However, less is known about the differential uptake of the AWV by Medicare insurance coverage type-a consequence of the increasing beneficiary enrollment shifts from TM to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans.

Objective

This study aims to quantify the differential effects of Medicare insurance coverage type (MA versus TM) on AWV uptake for key subpopulations.

Design

We used 20% nationally representative Medicare insurance claims data from 2018 to 2019. Probit models assessed the likelihood of AWV uptake, with subgroup analyses by age, race/ethnicity, dual eligibility, chronic conditions, and ADRD status.

Participants

We included 8,799,206 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older, among whom 41.2% were enrolled in MA, and 58.8% were enrolled in TM.

Main Measures

The outcome is whether to have an AWV; the independent variable is the Medicare insurance coverage type.

Key Results

Over 1/3 (37.3%) of beneficiaries received an AWV in 2019. MA enrollees were 4.3 percentage points more likely to receive an AWV than TM enrollees (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed higher AWV uptake in MA across all key subgroups of interest (all p < 0.001), with the largest differences among the oldest-old adults aged above 85+(5.6 percentage points), dual eligibles (11.5 percentage points), Black beneficiaries (8.9 percentage points), and those with ADRD (6.6 percentage points).

Conclusion

Enrollment in an MA plan is associated with a higher probability of AWV uptake, particularly among vulnerable populations from racial and ethnic minorities, dual eligibility, and those diagnosed with ADRD. These findings highlight MA's potential role in promoting preventive care and health equity. Future studies need to examine whether higher AWV uptake leads to improved patient outcomes in MA plans.

### Closing the gap: improving the percentage of annual wellness visits among Medicare patients [^115Se33Q]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Baseline data

Only 1.7% of Mayo Clinic internal medicine, Rochester, Minnesota, USA, patients eligible for an AWV had one performed in the last year. Cause-and-effect analysis revealed an inadequate process for identifying AWV eligible patients, a need for a standardized processes for ordering AWVs, insufficient patient communication, and confusion about eligibility and covered services. Further analysis found provider ambivalence to the promotion of AWVs, inadequate training on how to order, perform, document and bill an AWV and nursing shortages also compounded this issue.

At baseline, 10,575 Medicare patients were identified as eligible for an AWV. Using the electronic medical record (EMR), the patient population was narrowed to 3,422 who were considered most in need. Criteria to determine the population most in need were that they (1) had not been seen in internal medicine since before 2020, (2) were between 65 and 85 years old and (3) were covered by Medicare or Medicare Advantage. By using this narrowed criteria, we could first reach out to those patients most in need of healthcare in whom preventative screening was lacking.

Using a Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers plus Requirement — a tool used to organize the process methodology, stakeholders were identified, and information gathering included internal medicine leadership, schedulers, nursing and providers. Stakeholder feedback was organized using an Ishikawa cause-and-effect diagram (fishbone tool) to determine possible interventions. Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) 2.0 guidelines were used to report findings.

### Preventive visit among older adults with Medicare's introduction of annual wellness visit: closing gaps in underutilization [^1156HPDb]. Preventive Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Preventive visit rates are low among older adults in the United States. We evaluated changes in preventive visit utilization with Medicare's introduction of Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs) in 2011. We further assessed how coverage expansion differentially affected older adults who were previously underutilizing the service. The study included Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 85 from a mixed-payer multispecialty outpatient healthcare organization in northern California between 2007 and 2016. Data from the electronic health records were used, and the unit of analysis was patient-year (N = 456,281). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess determinants of "any preventive visit" use. Prior to the AWV coverage (2007–2010), Medicare beneficiaries who were older, with serious chronic conditions, and with a fee-for-services (FFS) plan underutilized preventive visits such that odds ratio (OR) for age groups (vs. age 65–69) ranges from 0.826 (age 70–74) to 0.522 (age 80–85); for Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (vs. 0 CCI) ranges from 0.77 (1 CCI) to 0.65 (≥ 2 CCI); and for FFS (vs. HMO) is 0.236. With the Medicare coverage (2011–2016), the age-based gap reduced substantially, but the difference persisted, e.g. OR for age 80–85 (vs. 65–69) is 0.628, and FFS (vs. HMO) beneficiaries still have far lower odds of using a preventive visit (OR = 0.278). The gap based on comorbidity was not reduced. Medicare's coverage expansion facilitated the use of preventive visit particularly for older adults with more advanced age or with FFS, thereby reducing disparities in preventive visit use.

### Assessment of prevalence and cost of care cascades after routine testing during the Medicare annual wellness visit [^111waLxH]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

For healthy adults, routine testing during annual check-ups is considered low value and may trigger cascades of medical services of unclear benefit. It is unknown how often routine tests are performed during Medicare annual wellness visits (AWVs) or whether they are associated with cascades of care.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of routine electrocardiograms (ECGs), urinalyses, and thyrotropin tests and of cascades (further tests, procedures, visits, hospitalizations, and new diagnoses) that might follow among healthy adults receiving AWVs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Observational cohort study using fee-for-service Medicare claims data from beneficiaries aged 66 years and older who were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare between January 1, 2013, and March 31, 2015; received an AWV in 2014; had no test-relevant prior conditions; did not receive 1 of the 3 tests in the 6 months before the AWV; and had no test-relevant symptoms or conditions in the AWV testing period. Data were analyzed from February 13, 2019, to June 8, 2020.

Exposure

Receipt of a given test within 1 week before or after the AWV.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence of routine tests during AWVs and cascade-attributable event rates and associated spending in the 90 days following the AWV test period. Patient, clinician, and area-level characteristics associated with receiving routine tests were also assessed.

Results

Among 75 275 AWV recipients (mean [SD] age, 72.6 [6.1] years; 48 107 [63.9%] women), 18.6% (14 017) received at least 1 low-value test including an ECG (7.2% [5421]), urinalysis (10.0% [7515]), or thyrotropin test (8.7%[6534]). Patients were more likely to receive a low-value test if they were younger (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.69 for ages 66–74 years vs ages ≥ 85 years [95% CI, 1.53–1.86]), White (aOR, 1.32 compared with Black [95% CI, 1.16–1.49]), lived in urban areas (aOR, 1.29 vs rural [95% CI, 1.15–1.46]), and lived in high-income areas (aOR, 1.26 for > 400% of the federal poverty level vs < 200% of the federal poverty level [95% CI, 1.16–1.37]). A total of 6.1 (95% CI, 4.8–7.5) cascade-attributable events per 100 beneficiaries occurred in the 90 days following routine ECGs and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.2–6.5) following urinalyses, with cascade-attributable cost per beneficiary of $9.62 (95% CI, $6.43-$12.80) and $7.46 (95% CI, $5.11-$9.81), respectively. No cascade-attributable events or costs were found to be associated with thyrotropin tests.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, 19% of healthy Medicare beneficiaries received routine low-value ECGs, urinalyses, or thyrotropin tests during their AWVs, more often those who were younger, White, and lived in urban, high-income areas. ECGs and urinalyses were associated with cascades of modest but notable cost.

### Association between Medicare annual wellness visits and prevention of falls and fractures in older adults in Texas, USA [^113FEGVw]. Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Fall-related injuries contribute to increased frailty, disability, and premature death in older adults (≥ 65 years). The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began reimbursing annual wellness visits (AWVs) in 2011. In the present study, we assessed the effect of AWV receipt in 2017 on fall and fracture prevention through December 31, 2018. Using Texas Medicare data for 2014–2018, we identified cohorts of Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 68 years, matched for the presence/absence of an AWV in 2017 by propensity score, and observed two outcomes: fracture as a primary diagnosis, and fall occurrences. Rates of each outcome were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the 2017 beneficiaries, 32.2% received an AWV. For the 742,494 beneficiaries in the matched cohort, conditional Cox proportional hazards models revealed that receiving an AWV in 2017 was associated with reduced risks for future falls (3.9%) and fractures (4%). The effect of the AWV was stronger on fall reduction in rural residents (HR: 0.799; 95% CI: 0.679 to 0.941) and on fracture reduction in beneficiaries with ≥ 4 morbidities (HR: 0.918; 95% CI: 0.867 to 0.972). Receipt of an AWV in three consecutive years (2015–2017) further lowered the risk of future falls. We conclude that the risks for future falls/fractures are lower in older adults receiving AWVs. Our study underscores the need for expanded public education programs that raise awareness about AWVs and the potential for AWV data to inform fall prevention interventions and other health promotion practices.

### Patient-provider communication about cognition and the role of memory concerns: a descriptive study [^113jw2Dx]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Maximizing cognitive health in aging is a national priority well-aligned with individual goals. In a meta-synthesis of qualitative evidence, van Leeuwen and colleagues identified preservation of cognitive health as key quality of life element in 41 of 48 studies reviewed. As evidence builds regarding early intervention targeting modifiable health and lifestyle factors to support cognitive health (e.g. hypertension, social connectedness), the importance of early detection of cognitive changes is consistently supported. Indeed, it is estimated that 40% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases could be prevented or delayed with early intervention. However, early detection of cognitive impairment is a continued challenge: up to 90% of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases go undetected in the U.S. and less than 20% of older adults with cognitive concerns discuss them with their healthcare provider. Identification of early cognitive changes, such as MCI, as well as implementation of interventions supporting cognitive health, depend on patient-provider communication, yet few studies have examined older adults' perspectives on such pivotal conversations.

Several national efforts encourage cognitive screening in primary care as a tool to improve early communication about cognitive health. Most notably, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend cognitive screening as a component of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. All U.S. adults aged 65 or older who have Medicare coverage are eligible for this yearly visit, and multiple organizations such as the Alzheimer's Association have highlighted its potential for improving the detection of cognitive impairment in primary care. However, routine cognitive screening for all older adults is not universally recommended due to insufficient evidence regarding the benefits and limitations. In addition to the lack of consensus regarding screening, healthcare providers are limited in scope and time allocated to see patients in primary and community-based settings. Unless an older patient presents with a cognitive complaint, assessment may focus on other aspects of health, such as management of chronic conditions. Therefore, detecting the first signs of cognitive impairment relies largely on the patient, their family members, or other care partners to actively share cognitive issues or concerns with a healthcare provider.

Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) structured cognitive assessment — initial tools and informant options: The second step in detection of cognitive impairment during the AWV requires cognitive assessment using a structured tool, with patient tools suitable for the initial structured assessment identified as the GPCOG, Mini-Cog, and MIS. Recognizing that there is no single optimal tool to detect cognitive impairment for all patient populations and settings, clinicians may select other brief tools (the 15 brief tools listed were evaluated in multiple review articles or are used in the VA), and the listed tools do not represent the entire listing of the > 100 brief cognitive assessment tools that may be suitable for primary care practices. If an informant is present during the AWV, it is suitable to use the AD8, the informant component of the GPCOG, or the Short IQCODE.

### Disparities in Medicare annual wellness visits after a systemwide quality improvement initiative: a serial cross-sectional analysis [^113pTPdb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design and Setting

This study was a serial cross-sectional evaluation of three annual waves of data from Northwestern Medicine (NM), a large academic health system in Illinois. Study protocols were approved by Northwestern University's institutional review board, with a waiver of informed consent (study #219825).

NM's system-level initiative to promote AWV completion began in September 2021. Several workflow changes targeted older adults who were due or overdue for a yearly Medicare AWV, such as electronic reminders sent to registered patient portal users, and opportunistic AWV scheduling at the point of care (e.g. during checkout at the end of in-person visits, clinic staff asked eligible patients if they wanted to schedule a future AWV). Patients were defined as achieving AWV completion if they completed an Initial Preventive Physical Exam (i.e. the "Welcome to Medicare" visit), an initial AWV, or subsequent AWV. The initiative is described in greater detail in Appendix Table 3.

Data was collected for each of three 1-year periods between September 2020 and August 2023. The pre-initiative baseline year (year 0) began on September 1, 2020, and ended August 31, 2021. Data from subsequent 12-month periods represented the two respective years of the initiative (year 1; year 2).

Patients

Patients were included in each year they met inclusion criteria. Patients were required to be Medicare or Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, and age 65 years or greater on the first day of year 2. Annual inclusion was determined by whether each patient made one or more in-person primary care visits during the prior 18 months (e.g. for the year 2 period between September 2022 and August 2023, patients were required to have at least one primary care encounter between March 2021 and August 2022). Patients were excluded from any years they were age 64 or lower.

### Outcomes of a virtual practice-tailored Medicare annual wellness visit intervention [^111jYgXz]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Interventions are needed to promote utilization of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV), an underused opportunity to perform screenings and plan individualized preventive health services.

Method

Using remote practice redesign and electronic health record (EHR) support, we implemented the Practice-Tailored AWV intervention in 2021 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) in 3 small community-based practices. The intervention combines EHR-based tools with practice redesign approaches and resources. Outcomes included completion of AWV and fulfillment of recommended preventive services.

Results

At baseline the 3 practices had 1,513 Medicare patients with at least 1 visit in the past 12months. AWV utilization went from 7% at baseline to 54% 8 months postintervention implementation; advance care planning increased 10.7% (from 7.9% to 18.6%); depression screening increased 16.3% (from 51.7% to 68.0%); and alcohol misuse screening increased 17.3% (from 42.6% to 59.9%). Every individual preventive health service was received more often by patients with an AWV than those without. At the patient level, fulfillment of all eligible preventive services (of a maximum of 12 evaluated) went from 47.5% to 53.8% (P < .001). Subgroup analyses showed that patients with AWVs completed a greater percentage of their total recommended preventive health services than those without an AWV.

Conclusion

Virtual implementation of an intervention that combined EHR-based tools with practice redesign approaches increased AWV and preventive services utilization in Medicare patients. Given the success of this intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic (when practices had many competing demands), greater consideration should be given to delivering future interventions virtually.

### Annual wellness visits and early dementia diagnosis among Medicare beneficiaries [^113585rH]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study revealed that AWV recipients had a higher rate of first MCI diagnosis (21%) than those who did not receive an AWV, but little difference in first ADRD diagnosis (4%). Our study is the first showing the association of AWVs with early recognition of MCI in older adults. Annual wellness visits represent 1 strategy to address the family care burden of older adults with cognitive impairment by providing timely dementia care, to maximize independent living for older adults with cognitive impairment. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should publicize the benefits of AWVs, including the potential to preserve independent living and aging in place of community-dwelling older adults through timely screening, dementia care, and treatment.

Brief cognitive assessment tools — key advantages, limitations, and administration times evaluated in multiple reviews and/or for use in the VA — are detailed as follows: General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG) lists Patient 2–5 and Informant 1–3 and is "Developed for and validated in primary care" with "Little or no education bias" and "Multiple languages accessible at www.gpcog.com.au", while limitations include "Patient component scoring has an indeterminate range that requires an informant score to assess as pass or fail" and "Informant component alone has low specificity". Mini-Cog requires 2–4 and is "Developed for and validated in primary care and multiple languages/cultures", has "Little or no education/language/race bias", and "Short administration time", but "Use of different word lists may affect failure rates", "Some study results [are] based on longer tests with the Mini-Cog elements reviewed independently", and it "Does not test executive function or visuospatial skills". Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) takes 7–10, is "Most widely used and studied worldwide" and "Often used as reference for comparative evaluations of other assessments", but has "Education/age/language/culture bias", a "Ceiling effect (highly educated impaired subjects pass)", is "Proprietary — unless used from memory, test needs to be purchased at www.parinc.com", and has "Best performance for at least moderate cognitive impairment". Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) takes 10–15, is "Designed to test for mild cognitive impairment", offers "Multiple languages accessible at www.mocatest.org" and "Tests many separate domains (7)", but "Lacks studies in general practice settings", has "Education bias (< 12 years)", and "Limited use and evidence due to published data relatively new (2005)".

### Hospital utilization and expenditures among a nationally representative sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 2 years after receipt of an annual wellness visit [^1143djRT]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Medicare's Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) provides an opportunity to link beneficiaries to cancer screenings and immunizations, however, research has not examined its effectiveness. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of receiving an AWV on outcomes while accounting for the healthy user effect. This study used 2013–2017 Medicare claims data to compare hospital utilization and total expenditures among a 5% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries with and without AWV use in 2014 (228,053 AWV users were propensity-score matched to 228,053 nonusers). Linear fixed effects regression models examined differences in study outcomes 12 and 24 months after AWV use, controlling for baseline differences in sociodemographics, health status, utilization, and accountable care organization attribution. The proportion of Medicare FFS beneficiaries that used the AWV increased from 13% in 2013 to 24% in 2017. Users of the AWV had a marginally significant reduction in Medicare spending 12 months (-$122, 95% CI -$256, $11, p = 0.073) and significant reductions (-$162, 95% CI, -$310, -$14, p = 0.032) 24 months after the visit, relative to non-users. However it remains unclear what is driving these savings as there was no change in hospital-related utilization and results may still be biased due to inherent differences between users and non-users. The AWV provides an opportunity for providers to focus on prevention and geriatric needs not covered in typical office visits. Practices adopting AWVs have noted increased revenue, more stable patient populations, and stronger provider-patient relationships. While utilization remains low, it is steadily increasing over time.

### How Do accountable care organizations deliver preventive care services? A mixed-methods study [^1145pUXo]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Annual Wellness Visits

Nine ACOs highlighted the use of AWVs to provide preventive care services. The AWV is a yearly checkup offered by Medicare — with no patient co-pay — to screen for modifiable health risks and provide preventive disease services. It is separate and in addition to an annual physical examination. We identified five motivations of ACOs to conduct AWVs, listed in Table 4.

ACOs were in part motivated by doing what they felt was best for their patient. For example, one ACO leader told us that the AWV is a valuable opportunity to identify their patients' overall care needs for the coming year, to have a conversation "where it's not just a sick visit".

As well as addressing patients' preventive care needs, interviews highlighted four other motivations for delivering AWVs. Firstly, the AWV is used to fill care gaps for preventive care services included within CMS quality outcomes measures, thereby improving quality scores and the proportion of shared savings earned. Secondly, AWV billing codes are recognized as a primary care service by CMS when assigning beneficiaries to a Medicare ACO making the AWV a vehicle for increasing or maintaining patient attribution. An ACO care coordination manager summarized both of these motivations:

And so you don't want your attributions to drop and by getting [patients] in for their annual wellness visits, that helps keep them attributed to the practice as well as it gives you that opportunity to address any of the quality measures that CMS is gonna be looking at when they audit to see if, okay, maybe [patient x] is due for a mammogram, well this is the time that we can address those and let's get her set up for that.

Thirdly, AWVs present an opportunity for accurately coding patients' clinical conditions (using Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk scores) that are then used to risk-adjust the ACO's benchmark against which CMS calculates savings or losses at the end each year. As one ACO director told us:

### Assessment of prevalence and cost of care cascades after routine testing during the Medicare annual wellness visit [^113LGcXQ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

For healthy adults, routine testing during annual check-ups is considered to be of low value. Organizations such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the Choosing Wisely campaignadvise against routine electrocardiograms (ECGs), urinalyses, and thyrotropin tests(eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). While US studies from the 1990s and 2000s suggest that these tests were commonly performed, and favored by physicians, we do not have more recent estimates. In addition, we do not know how often these tests are performed during the Medicare yearly check-up, known as the annual wellness visit (AWV) and introduced in 2011 through the Affordable Care Act.

Routine medical tests during these visits may also trigger cascades of further medical services that are of uncertain value and may cause substantial harms to patients and clinicians. Understanding the prevalence of these tests and their potential cascades would allow payers, policy makers, and clinicians to prioritize and target efforts to mitigate low-value care and its consequences. We used national Medicare claims data to estimate the prevalence of routine ECG, urinalysis, and thyrotropin testing performed during AWVs, to identify patient, area-level, and visit characteristics associated with receiving these tests, and to measure the prevalence and cost of cascade-attributable laboratory tests, imaging tests, procedures, visits, hospitalizations, and new diagnoses that may follow.

### Can annual wellness visits reduce disparity in early dementia diagnosis? [^115RCYhJ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Exposure: Medicare AWVs

Medicare allows one AWV every 12 months for beneficiaries having Medicare Part B medical insurance for > 12 months and with no initial preventive physical examination or AWV providing a personalized prevention plan within the preceding 12 months. Beneficiaries have no copayment if a health‐care provider accepts the assignment. Health‐care providers can bill G0438 (for an initial AWV) or G0439 (a subsequent AWV) for a beneficiary once each year. We calculated the number of AWVs for each patient for the 3 years before the index date/year.

2.4 Covariates

Demographic characteristics included age, sex, race/ethnicity (non‐Hispanic White, Hispanic, Black, and other), urbanization of residential area, original Medicare entitlement, and dual eligibility. Based on previous studies, we extracted two county‐level covariates (with quartile 1 the lowest and 4 the highest): physical inactivity and social opportunities, and one zip code–level covariate: high school graduation rate. We included four medical service use characteristics in the 12 months before CI diagnosis: (1) number of hospitalizations (0, 1, 2, 3, and ≥ 4), (2) number of neurologist visits, (3) number of psychiatrist visits, and (4) having a primary care provider (PCP).

### General health checks in adult primary care: a review [^1116vaBu]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

General health checks, also known as general medical examinations, periodic health evaluations, checkups, routine visits, or wellness visits, are commonly performed in adult primary care to identify and prevent disease. Although general health checks are often expected and advocated by patients, clinicians, insurers, and health systems, others question their value.

Observations

Randomized trials and observational studies with control groups reported in prior systematic reviews and an updated literature review through March 2021 were included. Among 19 randomized trials (906 to 59 616 participants; follow-up, 1 to 30 years), 5 evaluated a single general health check, 7 evaluated annual health checks, 1 evaluated biannual checks, and 6 evaluated health checks delivered at other frequencies. Twelve of 13 observational studies (240 to 471 415 participants; follow-up, cross-sectional to 5 years) evaluated a single general health check. General health checks were generally not associated with decreased mortality, cardiovascular events, or cardiovascular disease incidence. For example, in the South-East London Screening Study (n = 7229), adults aged 40 to 64 years who were invited to 2 health checks over 2 years, compared with adults not invited to screening, experienced no 8-year mortality benefit (6% vs 5%). General health checks were associated with increased detection of chronic diseases, such as depression and hypertension; moderate improvements in controlling risk factors, such as blood pressure and cholesterol; increased clinical preventive service uptake, such as colorectal and cervical cancer screening; and improvements in patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life and self-rated health. In the Danish Check-In Study (n = 1104), more patients randomized to receive to a single health check, compared with those randomized to receive usual care, received a new antidepressant prescription over 1 year (5% vs 2%; p = 0.007). In a propensity score-matched analysis (n = 8917), a higher percentage of patients who attended a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, compared with those who did not, underwent colorectal cancer screening (69% vs 60%; P < .01). General health checks were sometimes associated with modest improvements in health behaviors such as physical activity and diet. In the OXCHECK trial (n = 4121), fewer patients randomized to receive annual health checks, compared with those not randomized to receive health checks, exercised less than once per month (68% vs 71%; difference, 3.3% [95% CI, 0.5%-6.1%]). Potential adverse effects in individual studies included an increased risk of stroke and increased mortality attributed to increased completion of advance directives.

Conclusions and Relevance

General health checks were not associated with reduced mortality or cardiovascular events, but were associated with increased chronic disease recognition and treatment, risk factor control, preventive service uptake, and improved patient-reported outcomes. Primary care teams may reasonably offer general health checks, especially for groups at high risk of overdue preventive services, uncontrolled risk factors, low self-rated health, or poor connection or inadequate access to primary care.

### Exploring the future adult vaccine landscape-crowded schedules and new dynamics [^11497MiD]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Consumers were also presented with the future vaccine schedule to gauge their willingness to adhere to future recommendations (Fig. 4D). Consumers (33%) still indicated a willingness to receive multiple vaccines per visit; however, 28% stated a strong preference to schedule more vaccination appointments rather than have more than 1 vaccine per visit. When asked if they would be able to attend more than one vaccination appointment per year in order to receive all recommended vaccines, 51% of patients strongly agreed. However, if the vaccination behavior observed in 2018 continues over the next decade, patients will need to be willing to receive vaccines at 'non-wellness' visits in order to receive the recommended number of vaccines.

The number of vaccination opportunities, however, is on the decline and the timeline within which to administer vaccines may become compressed. COVID-19 has increased the prevalence of telemedicine — acquiring medical care digitally - which may reduce face-to-face encounters between consumers and HCPs. HCPs also must contend with forced seasonality, where nonseasonal vaccines are aligned or coadministered with flu vaccines. At this time, limited vaccination opportunities and forced seasonality do not represent significant barriers to immunization due to the manageable number of currently available vaccine products. Most of these products are also not seasonal and have primary series that do not have to be administered annually. However, as the number of vaccine products, particularly seasonal vaccine products, increase over the next couple of decades, HCPs will be faced with more immunizations, but still only one shot per arm per patient. This limited arm space will force the adult vaccine market to become embroiled in the 'battle of the arm'.
To date, the limited variety of adult vaccines — just seven recommended by the CDC — has made managing vaccination schedules relatively straightforward (Supplementary Fig. 2). This has fostered a 'there's always next year' attitude among patients. However, the increasing number of vaccines threatens to disrupt this status quo. Currently, adults aged 50 and 65 years old could be advised to receive a maximum of 2.8 and 3.5 of recommended vaccines, respectively, in a single visit depending on risk factors. These estimates were based on 50- or 65-year-old Americans (assuming average lifespan) who require all adult vaccinations, and who only received vaccines at annual appointments. In 10 years, we estimate that the number of recommended doses for adults aged 50 and 65 years is expected to increase to 5.6 and 6.4 per year, respectively.

### An ultrasound screening exam during Medicare wellness visits may Be beneficial [^115yG71u]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The physical exam component of a periodic health visit in the elderly has not been considered useful. Standard Medicare Wellness visits require no physical exam beyond blood pressure and most physicians perform limited exams during these visits. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility, potential benefit, and costs of performing a screening ultrasound (US) exam during Medicare Wellness visits.

Methods

A physician examiner at an academic internal medicine primary care clinic performed a screening US exam targeting important abnormalities of patients 65–85years old during a Medicare Wellness visit. The primary care physician (PCP) recorded the follow-up items for each abnormality identified by the US examiner and assessed the benefit of each abnormality for the participant. Abnormality benefit, net exam benefit per participant, follow-up items and costs, participant survey results, and exam duration were assessed.

Results

Participants numbered 108. Total abnormalities numbered 283 and new diagnoses were 172. Positive benefit scores were assigned to 38.8%, neutral (zero) scores to 59.4%, and negative benefit scores to 1.8% of abnormalities. Net benefit scores per participant were positive in 63.9%, 0 in 34.3%, and negative in 1.8%. Follow-up items were infrequent resulting in 76% of participants without follow-up cost. Participant survey showed excellent acceptance of the exam.

Conclusions

The US screening exam identified frequent abnormalities in Medicare Wellness patients. The assessed benefits were rarely negative and often mild to moderately positive, with important new chronic conditions identified. Follow-up costs were low when the PCPs were also US experts.

### Population health solutions for assessing cognitive impairment in geriatric patients [^1162PQ4a]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

How to Detect Cognitive Impairment

The importance of identifying cognitive impairment is underscored by the inclusion, beginning in 2011, of assessment of cognitive function as part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) benefit, as authorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. Medicare is statutorily prohibited from paying for routine physical checkups with certain exceptions, the "Welcome to Medicare" exam, and the "Annual Wellness Visit" (AWV), which became available in 2011. The AWV includes and/or takes into account a health risk assessment and creates a personalized prevention plan that includes establishment of, or update to, the individual's medical and family history, a list of the individual's current providers and suppliers and medications prescribed; measurement of height, weight, body-mass index or waist circumference, and blood pressure; detection of any cognitive impairment; establishment or update of an appropriate screening schedule for the next 5–10 years; establishment or update of a list of risk factors and conditions (including any mental health conditions) for which interventions are recommended or underway; and furnishing of personalized health advice and referral, as appropriate, to health education or preventive counseling services or programs. The regulation implementing AWV states that in order to detect individuals at risk for cognitive impairment, the health professional should use direct observation in combination with information reported by the patient and/or concerns expressed by family and friends. In regard to cognitive screening, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has noted that evidence to date is not sufficient enough to support screening of asymptomatic populations, nor is evidence sufficient to require the use of a specific tool. While no nationally recognized screening tool for detection of cognitive impairments exists at the present time, continuing efforts to identify a standardized screening methodology is needed. Still, relying simply on interview to detect cognitive impairment is insufficient given that cognitive deficits may go undetected by health care professionals using interview alone.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 755: well-woman visit [^112rZNcr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

A well-woman visit provides an excellent opportunity to counsel patients about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing health risks. Given the shifting and complex landscape of care, in which many women may not receive all the recommended preventive services, obstetrician-gynecologists have an opportunity to contribute to the overall health and well-being of women throughout the lifespan by providing recommended preventive services and counseling. Taking a comprehensive history (specifically obtaining detailed information on symptoms and past medical and gynecologic history) will inform if certain components of the physical examination, including breast or pelvic examination, are indicated at that visit and will inform shared decision making for these examinations. Family history should be used as a risk assessment tool and should be completed and updated regularly to ensure the most comprehensive assessment of a woman's personal risk factors. Another key component of a well-woman visit for a reproductive-aged woman is the development and discussion of her reproductive life plan to ensure that medical testing and treatments provided are aligned with her current and future plans. Obstetrician-gynecologists provide care for women across the lifespan, and periodic well-woman visits are appropriate and necessary for perimenopausal women and postmenopausal women as well. This Committee Opinion has been revised to reflect updated guidance on components of the physical examination and new sources for well-woman preventive services.

### Disparities in Medicare annual wellness visits after a systemwide quality improvement initiative: a serial cross-sectional analysis [^114L3o86]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Variables

Beginning in February 2024, study data were collected from the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW), an institutional repository containing data on insurance, clinical encounters and diagnoses, demographic characteristics, screenings, and MyChart patient portal (Epic Systems Corporation; Verona, WI) data. Each patient's primary care physician was identified as the physician seen most frequently during the 18 months preceding each year (in the case of a tie, the physician seen most recently was selected).

The primary outcome was a binary measure (0/1) of Medicare AWV completion during each year. Each patient was defined as completing a Medicare AWV if, during the year, any of three Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for Medicare preventive visits were documented (G0402, Initial Preventive Physical Examination; G0438, initial Medicare AWV; G0439, subsequent Medicare AWV).

### Well-woman task force: components of the well-woman visit [^115MCB4g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 includes strong well-woman health care provisions as a means of optimizing preventive health care across a woman's lifetime. In 2013, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists convened a task force of leading professional associations representing women's health clinicians to develop age-specific well-woman health care guidelines with a goal of improving health outcomes. The charge of the Well-Woman Task Force was to provide guidance to women and clinicians with age-appropriate recommendations for a well-woman visit. Evidence-based guidelines, evidence-informed guidelines, and uniform expert agreement formed the foundation for the final recommendations. The resulting list of recommendations, "Components of the Well-Woman Visit", identifies needs across a woman's lifespan and is intended for use by any provider who cares for adolescents or women.

### Association of neurocognitive disorders with morbidity and mortality in older adults undergoing major surgery in the United States: a retrospective, population-based, cohort study [^115MGk3a]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2023). High credibility.

An unexpected finding was the lower adjusted risk for some complications (eg, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and superficial site infections) in patients with neurocognitive disorder compared with patients without neurocognitive disorder, which we hypothesise might reflect an epiphenomenon in which symptomatic reporting and clinical detection of these complications in perioperative patients with neurocognitive disorder is hindered. Whether this lower rate of observed complications could potentially be a source of increased mortality because of unrealised treatment for unrecognised conditions is unknown, and further investigation in this topic seems warranted.

In this study, 14.59% of Medicare beneficiaries who had a major surgical procedure had one or more neurocognitive disorder diagnoses. These rates of neurocognitive disorder almost certainly represent an underdiagnosis of these conditions. Only 156 154 (2.97%) of the more than 5.2 million patients included in this study had a diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Previous estimates have indicated that the prevalence of cognitive impairment is several times higher in surgical patients older than 65 years than what we observed in this study. CMS has implemented a recommendation that older patients be assessed for cognitive impairment as part of an annual wellness visit. Regrettably, this potential benefit remains underused: only 20% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries received a screening examination in 2016, suggesting that older adults who are eligible for cognitive testing via this mechanism continue to be missed. Beyond issues of accessibility, the effectiveness of the Medicare annual wellness visit in detecting cognitive impairment has been scrutinised.CMS recommends that providers detect cognitive impairment during the annual wellness visit on the basis of direct observation or any concerns expressed by patients or their family or friends. However, CMS does not endorse the use of a specific screening tool. Furthermore, in 2020 the US Preventive Services Task Force reiterated its previous finding that the evidence to justify routine cognitive screening in older patients is insufficient. Their conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to justify routine cognitive screening remains a subject of debate, as the American Academy of Neurology and the Alzheimer's Association both advocate for the use of a screening tool to assess for cognitive impairment. Uncertainty regarding the relative benefits and harms of cognitive screening arises from the insufficient data describing impact on outcomes that are meaningful to patients, caregivers, and society.

### Annual wellness visits and care management before and after dialysis initiation [^111LiJ8q]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Provision of annual Wellness Visits

In the year after dialysis initiation, 24% of MA enrollees had an AWV (Fig. 2). Visit rates varied markedly by race and ethnicity (Fig. 2), with Hispanic enrollees being least likely (16%) to have a visit and Asian enrollees most likely (32%). There was little variability by urban geography (metropolitan) but some variation by the types of providers seen in the year prior to dialysis initiation. Enrollees who saw a nephrologist but not a PCP were least likely (19%) to have an AWV, while enrollees who saw a PCP but not a nephrologist (25%) or both a PCP and a nephrologist (25%) were more likely to have an AWV in the year after dialysis initiation.

Fig. 2
Unadjusted proportion of beneficiaries with an annual wellness visit in year of dialysis initiation, by race/ethnicity, geography and care management

In the logistic regression (Table 3), Hispanic MA enrollees were less likely (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39–0.84) to have an AWV than White enrollees, but Black and Asian enrollees were as likely to receive an AWV. Enrollees were more likely to have an AWV in the year after dialysis initiation if they initiated peritoneal dialysis (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.07–2.23), initiated dialysis later in the study period (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.05–1.38) or had an AWV in the year before dialysis initiation (OR = 4.96, 95% CI: 3.88–6.34).

### Racial and ethnic disparities in preventive and chronic disease care in Medicare advantage vs. traditional medicare [^1151krTb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Over half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA), with Black and Hispanic beneficiaries disproportionately in MA versus traditional Medicare (TM).

Objective

To examine Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities in preventive and chronic disease care by MA vs. TM.

Design

Cross-sectional propensity-score-weighted difference-in-disparities analyses compared Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities in MA and TM using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (2015–2020).

Participants

Medicare beneficiaries with cardiovascular disease or risk factors (N = 68,788 person-years).

Main Measures

Influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine, blood pressure check, cholesterol test, colorectal cancer screening, preventive care index (count of above; 0–5), mammogram, annual wellness visit; hemoglobin A1C and eye exam.

Key Results

Black and Hispanic, compared to white, beneficiaries were less likely to receive annual wellness visits, influenza vaccines, pneumococcal vaccines, and colorectal cancer screening. Black beneficiaries in MA vs. TM had higher overall preventive care use (preventive care index, 3.67 vs. 3.44) and higher rates of all preventive services examined. Hispanic beneficiaries in MA vs. TM had higher preventive care use (index, 3.67 vs. 3.56), including annual wellness visit, blood pressure check, colorectal cancer screening, and breast cancer screening. Preventive care use was higher among White beneficiaries in MA than TM (index, 3.88 and 3.79). Black-White disparities were smaller in MA than TM for preventive care use (difference-in-disparities: +0.13 index points, 95% CI 0.04–0.22), blood pressure check (+2.2 percentage points [p.p.], 95% CI 0.1–4.4), cholesterol check (+2.2 p.p., 95% CI 0.2–4.2), and eye exam (+5.0 p.p., 95% CI 1.4–8.7). Hispanic-White disparities were not statistically different in MA vs. TM.

Conclusions

Although MA was associated with smaller Black-White disparities in preventive care compared to TM, these differences were modest, and MA was not associated with smaller Hispanic-White disparities.

### National alliance of sickle cell centers consensus recommendations on sickle cell disease health maintenance: a consensus statement [^1152uvGY]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) routine health maintenance — annual comprehensive visit emphasizes that the annual comprehensive SCD visit will be a longer, 1-hour visit that should occur with an SCD specialist and be consistent throughout the person's life, and this visit should be conducted at baseline (when they are well, without an acute care visit in the preceding 2 weeks or during an acute pain crisis). These visits include a review of the acute care visits over the prior year, accounting of episodic transfusions, and identification of new complications; the visit is also to make adjustments to current SCD modifying therapies, ensure preventative screenings are up to date, and address new concerns. This visit should always include the SCD social worker. The medical history should include pain assessment (frequency, severity, duration, location, treatments including efficacy or adverse effects) and opioid use in morphine equivalents, and a full review of systems is needed including organ-system symptom screening as well as assessing physical activity. A complete physical examination must include a focused neurologic examination, gait assessment, and musculoskeletal examination, and vital signs including blood pressure and oxygen saturation should be measured, as well as height and weight.

### Accountable care organization leader perspectives on the Medicare shared savings program: a qualitative study [^117BxKBQ]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In interviews with 49 ACOs of varying sizes and structures across the US, we identified 5 major themes about the initiatives, challenges, and engagement strategies of ACOs participating in MSSP in 2022. Many leaders reported a growing focus on activities such as increasing annual wellness visits, enhancing coding practices, and improving transitions in care. Leaders described the use of quality dashboards and interpersonal relationships to engage clinicians in ACO programming, and most organizations distributed at least 50% of their shared savings to participants, usually at the practice level. In recent years, growing Medicare Advantage penetration, as well as private equity– and health system–based consolidation, presented difficulties for some ACOs in recruiting clinicians and retaining patients. Leaders of hospital-associated ACOs reported additional challenges related to conflicting incentives for reducing acute care utilization.

Our results suggest that greater research and policy attention is warranted in several areas. For example, most ACOs distributed shared savings at the practice level, not the individual clinician level, and future research could examine the outcomes of various distribution strategies with regard to clinician engagement and the quality of care at ACOs. In addition, our findings renew questions about whether aggressive coding practices, pursued by some ACOs, are an effort to heighten the risk profile of their attributed beneficiaries to secure favorable benchmarks and extract greater savings, as opposed to improving care quality or patient outcomes. Lawmakers have expressed ongoing concerns about the potential for upcoding in new ACO programs.

Researchers should also continue to study the benefits and drawbacks of annual wellness visits for Medicare beneficiaries, which have increased substantially over time. Although some work suggests that these visits are associated with greater use of preventive services, they may also increase receipt of low-value care and their long-term implications remain uncertain. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has raised concerns that wellness visits may allow for favorable selection in ACOs, especially those with retrospective patient attribution; a recent report found that Medicare beneficiaries in ACOs were more likely to receive these visits compared with non-ACO beneficiaries, and that ACOs provided a disproportionate share of the visits in the last quarter of the year, possibly in an effort to assign beneficiaries with low spending relative to claims-based risk scores. To mitigate this concern, MedPAC has recommended that all ACOs be required to adopt prospective beneficiary assignment.

### National trends of telehealth use in Medicare annual wellness visits [^113QmTCM]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In response to COVID-19, Medicare began reimbursing for Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs) via telehealth in March 2020. Little is known about nationwide utilization of telehealth AWVs as a preventive care service among Medicare beneficiaries.

Methods

We used 100% Medicare data on payment for physician services between 2020 and 2022 to calculate total and telehealth AWVs stratified by specialty.

Results

Between 2020 and 2022, physicians performed a total of 24.7 million AWVs corresponding to $3.2 billion in payments from Medicare. Over this period, AWV utilization increased from 7.8 million services in 2020 to 8.6 million services in 2022. Telehealth AWVs accounted for 6.7% of all AWVs in 2020 and 2.1% of all AWVs in 2022. Primary care physicians provided the most telehealth AWVs (96.8%), compared to medical subspecialists (1.6%) and other specialists (1.6%) (p = .042). Family medicine physicians provided approximately half of all telehealth AWVs in 2020 (46.3%) and 2022 (51.6%).

Discussion

Despite increasing utilization of AWVs overall, telehealth AWV utilization decreased during our study period. Telehealth AWVs were most frequently conducted by primary care physicians, with a majority by family medicine physicians in the study period's final year. Our findings highlight potential challenges of providing AWVs via telehealth at broader scale, but also underscore the feasibility of providing telehealth AWVs. As they consider long-term telehealth reimbursement policy, leaders can prioritize how telehealth complements in-person care to promote broader adoption of preventive services.

U.S. older-adult demographics and multimorbidity — With the eldest of the nation's 77 million baby boomers already 65 and the youngest reaching that milestone in 2019, older adults will make up a growing share for the next 4 decades; now roughly 40 million, U.S. residents age 65 and older will reach an estimated 78.9 million in 2050, and currently 80% of adults age 65 and older have at least one chronic health condition. The evidence base supporting the use of many common tests and treatments for older adults is described as inadequate, in part because older adults are significantly underrepresented in clinical trials.

### A slow start: use of preventive services among seniors following the affordable care act's enhancement of Medicare benefits in the U.S [^114tnCFC]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Beginning January 1st, 2011 in the United States the Affordable Care Act enhanced Medicare coverage for preventive services by eliminating patient cost-sharing under Part B and by introducing an "Annual Wellness Visit", also free-of-charge. We evaluated the early effects of these reforms on utilization of preventive services.

Method

We analyzed nationally representative data on 15,044 Medicare seniors from the 2008–2010, and 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, and examined self-reported cholesterol test, blood pressure check, flu vaccination, endoscopy, fecal occult blood test, prostate specific antigen test, breast examination, and mammography.

Results

Enhanced Medicare benefits had no effects on preventive service utilization among Medicare seniors in 2012, including those with traditional Medicare and no other supplemental insurance, who stood to benefit the most from Part B enhancements.

Conclusion

The muted overall response can be partly attributed to the fact that most seniors already held insurance that fully covered preventive services. While insurance enhancements can sometimes raise utilization, in the case of preventive services there are other fundamental barriers that require attention. Educating and incentivizing physicians about the need to refer/recommend screenings, and enhancing knowledge among seniors about the importance of preventive care are two steps that would likely go a long way towards increasing utilization.

### Trends in well-child visits with out-of-pocket costs in the US before and after the affordable care act [^115NDrH4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was deemed exempt from review, and the requirement for patient written informed consent was waived by the Boston University Institutional Review Board because deidentified data were used. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. We used health insurance claims from 2006 through 2018 from children aged 0 to 17 years with full-year coverage each year; claims were obtained from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database.

We focused on 2 outcomes: the proportion of children who had an office or outpatient visit without a wellness visit and the proportion of wellness visits resulting in an out-of-pocket cost, which were calculated annually during the study period. We stratified the sample by 2 age groups (0 to 5 years and 6 to 17 years) because these groups have a different recommended frequency of visits for wellness and other preventive services. Diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (visits before October 2015) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (visits in October 2015 and after) and Current Procedural Terminology and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes used to identify preventive services were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were supplemented with coding guidelines from major insurers.

We examined trends in visit volumes to ensure that compositional changes did not explain the findings and assessed the delivery of preventive services during non-wellness visits. We plotted the trends over time and tested for significance using linear regression. P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant, all P values were 2-sided. Data were analyzed from June 10, 2020, to January 15, 2021, using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc) and Stata, version 16 (StataCorp).

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^116m7nja]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Obesity screening and referral — primary care and public health recommendations — state that following comprehensive systematic reviews, the USPSTF issued a Grade B recommendation that pediatricians and other PHCPs screen children and adolescents aged 6 years or older annually for obesity — defined by BMI percentile — and offer, or refer children and adolescents, to a comprehensive, intensive, family-based behavioral treatment to improve weight status; a "comprehensive, intensive behavioral treatment" was defined as a treatment of 26 hours or more over a period of 2 to 12 months. All 3 sources recommend annual screening for excess weight using BMI, with the USPSTF beginning at 6 years old and both Bright Futures and this CPG beginning at age 2 years. For children or adolescents with BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex, the USPSTF provides recommendations for primary care providers to offer, or refer them to, a comprehensive, family-based weight management intervention; Bright Futures recommends that primary care providers screen for excess weight and provide dietary nutrition and physical activity counseling for all children and adolescents with either overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 85th and < 95th percentile for age and sex), and this CPG recommends referral to evidence-based weight management interventions for all children 2 years and older who have a BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex. The practice of annual BMI measurement at well-child visits is recommended and central to the management and tracking of overweight and obesity in children, although limitations to this approach include missed opportunities to track and manage weight changes that occur in less than a 12-month period; other visit opportunities can be used to assess BMI outside the well-child visit.

### Changes in health care access and preventive health screenings by race and ethnicity [^115Wg9hn]. JAMA Health Forum (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes

We examined measures of health care access and preventive health screenings. Measures of health care access included the proportion of adults having a usual place of care, having a wellness visit within the past year (including physical examinations and general-purpose checkups), delaying medical care due to cost, and not receiving medical care due to cost during the past year. Preventive health screening measures included the proportion of eligible adults receiving a blood pressure, cholesterol, or blood glucose screening (inclusive of screenings performed outside of a traditional wellness visit) as well as colorectal, cervical, breast, and prostate cancer screenings within the past year.

All adults were considered eligible for blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, while adults without a diagnosis of diabetes were considered eligible for blood glucose screening. We used the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines to determine eligibility for cancer screenings as of 2019, which included all adults aged 50 to 75 years for colorectal cancer screening (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy), female adults aged 21 to 65 years for cervical cancer screening (Papanicolaou smear or human papillomavirus test), female adults aged 50 to 74 years for breast cancer screening (mammography), and male adults aged 55 to 69 years for prostate cancer screening (prostate-specific antigen test).

### Long-term retention of older adults in the cardiovascular health study: implications for studies of the oldest old [^113JStcp]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe retention according to age and visit type (clinic, home, telephone) and to determine characteristics associated with visit types for a longitudinal epidemiological study in older adults.

Design

Longitudinal cohort study.

Setting

Four U.S. clinical sites.

Participants

Five thousand eight hundred eighty-eight Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants aged 65 to 100 at 1989/90 or 1992/93 enrollment (58.6% female; 15.7% black). CHS participants were contacted every 6 months, with annual assessments through 1999 and in 2005/06 for the All Stars Study visit of the CHS cohort (aged 77–102; 66.5% female; 16.6% black).

Measurements

All annual contacts through 1999 (n = 43,772) and for the 2005/06 visit (n = 1,942).

Results

CHS had 43,772 total participant contacts from 1989 to 1999: 34,582 clinic visits (79.0%), 2,238 refusals (5.1%), 4,401 telephone visits (10.1%), 1,811 home visits (4.1%), and 740 other types (1.7%). In 2005/06, the All Stars participants of the CHS cohort had 36.6% clinic, 22.3% home, and 41.1% telephone visits. Compared with participants aged 65 to 69, odds ratios of not attending a CHS clinic visit were 1.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.54–2.13), 2.94 (95% CI = 2.45–3.57), 4.55 (95% CI = 3.70–5.56), and 9.09 (95% CI = 7.69–11.11) for those aged 70 to 74, 75 to 79, 80 to 84, and 85 and older, respectively, in sex-adjusted regression. In multivariable regression, participants with a 2005/06 clinic visit were younger, more likely to be male and in good health, and had had better cognitive and physical function 7 years earlier than participants with other visit types. Participants with home, telephone, and missing visits were similar on characteristics measured 7 years earlier.

Conclusion

Offering home, telephone, and proxy visits are essential to optimizing follow-up of aging cohorts. Home visits increased in-person retention from 36.5% to 58.8% and diversified the cohort with respect to age, health, and physical functioning.

### Assessing the environmental and downstream human health impacts of decentralizing cancer care [^112Je1ez]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from health care are substantial and disproportionately harm persons with cancer. Emissions from a central component of oncology care, outpatient clinician visits, are not well described, nor are the reductions in emissions and human harms that could be obtained through decentralizing this aspect of cancer care (ie, telemedicine and local clinician care when possible).

Objective

To assess potential reductions in GHG emissions and downstream health harms associated with telemedicine and fully decentralized cancer care.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study and counterfactual analyses using life cycle assessment methods analyzed persons receiving cancer care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between May 2015 and December 2020 as well as persons diagnosed with cancer over the same period from the Cancer in North America (CiNA) public dataset. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to April 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The adjusted per-visit day difference in GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents between 2 periods: an in-person care model period (May 2015 to February 2020; preperiod) and a telemedicine period (March to December 2020; postperiod), and the annual decrease in disability-adjusted life-years in a counterfactual model where care during the preperiod was maximally decentralized nationwide.

Results

Of 123 890 included patients, 73 988 (59.7%) were female, and the median (IQR) age at first diagnosis was 59 (48–68) years. Patients were seen over 1.6 million visit days. In mixed-effects log-linear regression, the mean absolute reduction in per-visit day CO2 equivalent emissions between the preperiod and postperiod was 36.4 kg (95% CI, 36.2–36.6), a reduction of 81.3% (95% CI, 80.8–81.7) compared with the baseline model. In a counterfactual decentralized care model of the preperiod, there was a relative emissions reduction of 33.1% (95% CI, 32.9–33.3). When demographically matched to 10.3 million persons in the CiNA dataset, decentralized care would have reduced national emissions by 75.3 million kg of CO2 equivalents annually; this corresponded to an estimated annual reduction of 15.0 to 47.7 disability-adjusted life-years.

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that using decentralization through telemedicine and local care may substantially reduce cancer care's GHG emissions; this corresponds to small reductions in human mortality.

### Diabetes in older adults [^111gUUuy]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

What current guidelines exist for treating diabetes in older adults?

Several organizations have developed diabetes guidelines specific to, or including, older adults. The ADA includes a section on older adults in its annual Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes. The section discusses the heterogeneity of persons aged ≥ 65 years and the lack of high-level evidence. The overall recommendations, all based on expert opinion, include the following:
Older adults who are functional, are cognitively intact, and have significant life expectancy should receive diabetes care using goals developed for younger adults.
Glycemic goals for older adults not meeting the above criteria may be relaxed using individualized criteria, but hyperglycemia leading to symptoms or risk of acute hyperglycemic complications should be avoided in all patients.
Other cardiovascular risk factors should be treated in older adults with consideration of the timeframe of benefit and the individual patient. Treatment of hypertension is indicated in virtually all older adults, and lipid and aspirin therapy may benefit those with life expectancy at least equal to the timeframe of primary or secondary prevention trials.
Screening for diabetes complications should be individualized in older adults, but particular attention should be paid to complications that would lead to functional impairment.

The ADA goals for glycemic control do not specifically mention age. The recommendation for many adults is an A1C < 7%, but less stringent goals are recommended for those with limited life expectancy, advanced diabetes complications, or extensive comorbid conditions.

In collaboration with the ADA and other medical organizations, the California HealthCare Foundation/American Geriatrics Society panel published guidelines for improving the care of older adults with diabetes in 2003. A significant proportion of the recommendations concerns geriatric syndromes. Highlights of diabetes-specific recommendations include A1C targets of ≤ 7.0% in "relatively healthy adults", while for those who are frail or with life expectancy less than 5 years, a less stringent target, such as 8%, was considered appropriate. The guidelines also suggested that the timeline of benefits was estimated to be at least 8 years for glycemic control and 2–3 years for blood pressure and lipid control.

### Effect of individualized preventive care recommendations vs usual care on patient interest and use of recommendations: a pilot randomized clinical trial [^1174qjYK]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Preventable risk factors contributed to an estimated 61% of US deaths in 2019, and health risks increase with age. Prior work suggests that optimal preventive care use could add over 2 million healthy life-years nationwide. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends 25 preventive services for middle-aged adults aged 50 to 64 years, but in 2015 only 8% of adults 35 years or older received all high-priority services. A recent study found that adherence to hypertension control, a highly effective intervention, declined over the past decade.

National prevention guidelines present several challenges. First, they scarcely account for individuals' unique characteristics, such as comorbid conditions, which affect 70% of middle-aged adults. This standardized approach hinders physicians' ability to identify which preventive services provide maximum benefit for a specific patient. Second, few guidelines consider patient preferences, including views about side effects, convenience, lifestyle, and cost. This generic approach may contribute to low attainment of prevention targets. Third, clinical time is limited, forcing physicians to prioritize among recommended guidelines without having tools to do so. For example, a physician may know that both mammograms and colonoscopies are "life-saving", but not understand their relative benefits.

In this pilot study, we evaluated the potential of an individualized decision tool to help patients and physicians better understand the net benefits of all major, USPSTF-recommended preventive services and improve preventive care delivery.

### Patient blood management: a 68-year-old woman contemplating autologous blood donation before elective surgery [^1134WQ9j]. JAMA (2011). Excellent credibility.

Globally, more than 81 million units of red blood cells are transfused annually. Of the 15 million red blood cell components transfused annually in the United States, approximately 40% are transfused to patients undergoing elective surgical procedures. Because of concerns about limited blood availability as well as risks of transfusion-related adverse events, blood products should be used judiciously. Using the case of Ms C, a 68-year-old woman considering autologous blood donation prior to knee replacement surgery, the concept of patient blood management is discussed. This approach entails a complete evaluation of the patient in the preoperative period to assess for bleeding risks and anemia, with a goal to optimize a patient's condition prior to surgery; use of various strategies in the operative period to mitigate the need for allogeneic blood transfusion; and meticulous postoperative care to again avoid the need for blood transfusion.

### Pet ownership and maintenance of physical function in older adults-evidence from the Baltimore longitudinal study of aging (BLSA) [^116xS3NW]. Innovation in Aging (2023). Medium credibility.

Annual pet ownership data were obtained retrospectively during the survey visit for the preceding 10 years. These pet ownership data were mapped onto the BLSA physical assessment visits over that same period. The earliest occasion when pet ownership data could be associated with a BLSA assessment was used to produce the index visit data. Pet ownership data were associated with each BLSA physical assessment within the last 10 years as well as the 3 years of the study after the survey visit.

The characteristics of the participants at the index visit are included in Supplementary Table 1. These data are baseline data for all further analyses. Average age at index visit was 68.25 years (SD = 9.64). The participants were generally in good health; participants' mean number of comorbidities was 0.95 (SD = 1.17). Only 20.88% of the participants were obese.

Blood pressure (BP) measurement frequency in children and adolescents — Key Action Statements: BP should be measured annually in children and adolescents ≥ 3 years of age (grade C, moderate recommendation); for otherwise healthy children, however, BP need only be measured annually rather than during every health care encounter. BP should be checked in all children and adolescents ≥ 3 years of age at every health care encounter if they have obesity (BMI ≥ 95 percentile), are taking medications known to increase BP, have renal disease, a history of aortic arch obstruction or coarctation, or diabetes (grade C, moderate recommendation). Children younger than 3 years should have BP measurements taken at well-child care visits if they are at increased risk for developing hypertension (HTN).

### Medical care for the final years of life: "When you' re 83, it's not going to be 20 years" [^111iSvfg]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

The case of an 83-year-old man who has had a fall-related injury and continues to be the sole caregiver for his wife who has dementia exemplifies a common situation that clinicians face — planning for the final years of an elderly individual's life. To appropriately focus on the patient's most pressing issues, the approach should begin with an assessment of life expectancy and incorporation of evidence-based care whenever possible. Short-term issues are focused on efforts to restore the patient to his previous state of health. Mid-range issues address providing preventive care, identifying geriatric syndromes, and helping him cope with the psychosocial needs of being a caregiver. Long-term issues relate to planning for his eventual decline and meeting his goals for the end of life. Unfortunately, the workload and inefficiencies of primary care practice present barriers to providing optimal care for older patients. Systematic approaches, including team care, are needed to adequately manage chronic diseases and coordinate care.

### What is the Medicare annual wellness visit (AWV)?… [^116k3uqR]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Medicare's Annual Wellness Visit is a way for your practice to keep patients as healthy as possible. As health care moves from volume- to value-based models, the AWV addresses gaps in care and enhances the quality of care you deliver. A personalized prevention plan created for the Medicare beneficiary is a way to improve patient engagement and promote preventive health care. The Annual Wellness Visit allows practices to gain information about the patient, including medical and family history, health risks, and specific vitals. Not to be confused with a complete physical examination, the purpose of the AWV is to review the patient's wellness and develop a personalized prevention plan. The services provided during the AWV are different from a typical preventive care visit and expand to include emotional and psychological well-being, in addition to the patient's physical well-being.

The AWV provides an opportunity for physicians to improve the quality of care, assist in patient engagement, and optimize payment opportunities. The CPT codes for Annual Wellness Visits are G0438 for the initial visit and G0439 for subsequent visits. These codes are used to bill Medicare for comprehensive wellness assessments and personalized prevention plans. It is important to remember that code G0438 is for the first AWV only. The submission of G0438 for a beneficiary for which a claim code of G0438 has already been paid will result in a denial. This benefit is covered at 100% for the beneficiary. Better patient care starts with preventive wellness visits. Download the AAFP's patient flier and use it to talk with your Medicare patients about the importance of scheduling a free, personalized prevention visit with you. The AWV is covered 100% by Medicare. There is no deductible or coinsurance owed by the patient.

Medicare pays 100% for the AWV and focuses on health promotion and prevention. A problem-oriented visit is not part of this benefit and is subject to deductibles or coinsurance. The yearly physical exam is not a covered benefit for the beneficiary and would need to be billed to the patient. However, Medicare pays 100% for the AWV. After the first 12 months of Medicare Part B enrollment, the beneficiary is eligible for the initial AWV and subsequent AWVs. This allows AWVs to become an ongoing source of revenue.

### Medicare annual wellness visits: how to get patients and… [^111ox9na]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Most family physicians would agree that Medicare annual wellness visits are a good idea. They let physicians develop personalized preventive care plans, review and update medical histories, reconcile medication lists, identify other providers involved in the patient's care, and summarize the patient's acute care. 1 As a longer visit – often an hour – the AWV lets clinicians escape the "tyranny of the urgent" and develop a proactive, coordinated care plan, which is rarely possible during short, illness-focused office visits.
2. Our solution Following the survey, we decided in April 2016 to begin leveraging physician recommendation of the AWV with personalized recruitment of patients. A nurse care manager at one of our practices reviewed the daily schedule to identify Medicare patients eligible for a wellness visit.

She would then remind the physicians to recommend that their patients get an AWV and ask the medical assistants or other nurses to introduce her to these patients so she could speak to them first-hand. She explained to patients that, for an AWV, they would not see their physician for a physical exam but, at the physician's request, would instead sit down with the care manager for a discussion of wellness and other related topics. As a result, the care manager in the first month recruited 24 patients who completed AWVs with her. This was far ahead of the usual AWV completion rate of about a dozen per month. During the nine months we conducted the AWV recruitment project, we completed 344 AWVs at our two practices, compared with 153 AWVs in all of 2015. Assuming that trend continues, we would complete 458 AWVs during a full year, or a 300 percent annual increase.

This would increase the completion rate among our eligible population to 21 percent. Although there is clearly room for further improvement, this percentage approaches the "best" rates reported elsewhere. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ANNUAL WELLNESS VISIT "Medicare Annual Wellness Visit: Getting Paid for What We Do Best" On-demand webinar sponsored by the American Academy of Family Physicians As a result, our practice culture has changed so that we discuss AWVs more often and make them easier to schedule and complete. This translated to a vastly improved completion rate among eligible Medicare patients in the first year.

### What is the best approach to annual wellness visits for… [^114WWZHJ]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The Medicare annual wellness visit is surprisingly underused. In this issue, Daniel Bluestein, MD, and his colleagues present an interesting model for encouraging more of these exams by using nurse care managers. Whether or not you are a fan of the AWV, this raises some interesting questions. Is an AWV performed by a registered nurse care manager likely to be as effective in screening and satisfying the patient as one performed by a physician, a nurse practitioner, or a physician assistant. Should an AWV be the only annual "comprehensive" visit for seniors. Why do a number of physicians feel disdain for the AWV. First, a little history. The annual "physical" is a beloved 20th century invention that took hold in the 1940s. Yet by the 1980s many prestigious medical organizations recommended scaling back the physical exam and focusing instead on preventive screening and counseling. 1 At present, the U. S.

Preventive Services Task Force recommends against most routine physical examination screening of asymptomatic adults 65 and older.
2. But much of the public still considers an annual physical to be good medical care, and many physicians appear to agree. I know physicians who won't do an AWV because they feel it is inferior to the traditional preventive health visit that includes an exam. Evidence-based guidelines appear to fall short of public and professional sentiment here. Perhaps the ritual of a physical exam, conveying the comfort of touch and reassuring thoroughness, helps solidify the doctor-patient relationship. The benefits of these sorts of interactions are hard to measure, but they seem pretty compelling to us clinicians as well. I strongly support doing AWVs with all of my senior patients.

A number of the components, including updating immunizations, screening for depression, hypertension, and obesity, and counseling for tobacco and alcohol use, have good evidence to support them. Doing a functional status review, screening for fall risk and cognitive abilities, and discussing advance directives also make sense to me. Almost every senior in my practice has at least one chronic problem and takes medication for it, so I include a chronic problem review and problem-focused physical exam and explore new patient concerns with almost every AWV I do. I document and bill both an AWV and a regular evaluation and management visit, which can take up to 45 minutes each. Patients really appear to appreciate these comprehensive visits, and they pay well. But doing more than two per four-hour session can be grueling.
