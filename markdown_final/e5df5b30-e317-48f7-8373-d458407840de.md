## Question

How xenograft turns into bone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how xenograft bone substitutes become integrated and turn into bone after implantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what xenografts are and how they are processed. Then, I should verify the core bone-healing mechanisms they rely on. Next, I will examine the inflammatory and cellular cascade that leads to incorporation. After that, I need to check the remodeling dynamics and the fate of the xenograft material. Finally, I should review clinical timelines, influencing factors, and limitations that affect outcomes and success rates.

> Let me first confirm the definition and processing, because the starting material dictates behavior. Xenografts are bone-derived materials from nonhuman species, typically bovine, that undergo extensive processing to remove organic antigens while preserving a mineralized scaffold; methods include deproteinization, demineralization, sintering, and sterilization, and these steps strongly influence resorption and incorporation profiles in vivo [^117MXvTR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about what the graft does; I should verify the fundamental mechanisms it must leverage. Unlike autograft, xenografts lack viable osteogenic cells and have limited or no intrinsic osteoinduction, so their primary role is osteoconduction — providing a scaffold that guides host cell infiltration and new bone deposition — while host-derived osteoinduction and osteogenesis drive the rest of the repair cascade [^116DjhhG].

> I will now examine the early biologic response, because incorporation begins with inflammation and revascularization. After implantation, the processed xenograft elicits a controlled inflammatory response that recruits macrophages, mesenchymal stromal cells, and endothelial progenitors; this inflammatory milieu is necessary for angiogenesis and for MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts, though the intensity of inflammation can vary with processing and composite formulation, and in some models adding xenograft particles increased inflammatory activity while enhancing incorporation of adjacent materials [^111JBnci] [^113W5fm9].

> Wait, let me verify the cellular cascade on the scaffold. MSCs adhere to the xenograft surface, proliferate, and differentiate into osteoblasts that deposit osteoid. Concurrently, osteoclasts begin remodeling the graft-host interface and the scaffold itself, a process that mirrors normal bone turnover but proceeds more slowly in xenografts due to their preserved mineral content and crystallinity [^1134Wo2c].

> Next, I should review the remodeling dynamics and the fate of the xenograft material. Over weeks to months, creeping substitution occurs: host bone gradually replaces the xenograft scaffold through coordinated osteoclastic resorption and osteoblastic deposition. However, many xenografts, especially sintered hydroxyapatite products, resorb very slowly and can persist for years, which may delay complete transformation and can leave residual material unless the graft is designed for more rapid bioresorption [^1134Wo2c] [^116oFVbj].

> Let me consider the timeline, because expectations should match biology. Early woven bone appears within weeks, but maturation to lamellar bone and full integration often takes many months. In foot and ankle series, bovine-based structural xenografts showed markedly delayed incorporation compared with allograft or autograft, with median incorporation approaching a year and a high proportion never fully incorporating radiographically, whereas dental sinus augmentation studies often show favorable early bone formation with limited resorption over time, underscoring site- and material-specific performance [^111XHEnm] [^116oFVbj].

> I need to check the key factors that modulate success, since outcomes are context dependent. Material properties such as porosity, crystallinity, and processing temperature alter cell infiltration, vascularization, and resorption kinetics. Host bed vascularity and mechanical stability are critical, with revascularization preceding meaningful remodeling. Surgical technique and graft-to-host contact influence integration. And patient factors like smoking and systemic disease impair healing, all of which can widen the variability in incorporation times and rates [^1134Wo2c] [^112GDBsA] [^113W5fm9].

> But wait, what if we try to accelerate incorporation with biologics or composites; does that change the game. Combining xenograft with autologous bone marrow, platelet concentrates, or exosomes can enhance osteoinduction and cell delivery, improving new bone formation and graft performance in preclinical and early clinical contexts, though these are adjunctive strategies that still rely on the scaffold's osteoconductive foundation and the host's remodeling capacity [^114zsc2U] [^1152AaNF] [^113S8782].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and trade-offs so we do not overstate benefits. Xenografts lack osteogenic cells and have limited or no intrinsic osteoinduction, may provoke inflammatory responses that can impede integration in some settings, and often resorb slowly with residual material that may persist or act as a stress riser; clinical evidence is heterogeneous, with some series showing delayed or incomplete incorporation compared with autograft or allograft, so material selection should be individualized to defect type, mechanical demands, and patient factors [^116DjhhG] [^111JBnci] [^111XHEnm] [^116bXBJu].

> In summary, I should confirm the throughline: xenograft bone substitutes do not truly "turn into bone" in the sense of viable graft bone persisting. Rather, they serve as mineralized scaffolds that guide host cells to form new bone via creeping substitution, with eventual replacement of much of the graft material over time, albeit more slowly and sometimes incompletely than with autologous bone, which explains the variability in clinical incorporation and the need for careful case selection and technique [^116oFVbj] [^1134Wo2c] [^111XHEnm].

Xenograft bone transforms into host bone through a **multistep process** [^113W5fm9] that begins with inflammation and revascularization, followed by osteoconduction, osteoinduction, and remodeling. Host mesenchymal cells infiltrate the scaffold, differentiate into osteoblasts, and lay down new bone, while osteoclasts gradually resorb the xenograft. The final bone is **primarily host-derived**, with residual xenograft fragments persisting until fully resorbed [^117MXvTR]. Transformation is influenced by graft processing, host biology, and mechanical environment, and typically takes months to years [^116yJ2wN] [^111XHEnm].

---

## Biological mechanisms of xenograft transformation

### Inflammatory response and revascularization

Inflammation initiates healing by recruiting macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes that clear debris and release cytokines and growth factors (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, VEGF, BMPs) [^notfound]. Revascularization follows, with new vessels delivering oxygen, nutrients, and osteoprogenitor cells to support subsequent bone formation [^112GDBsA].

---

### Osteoconduction

Osteoconduction is the scaffold function of xenograft that **guides host cell infiltration and new bone deposition** [^116oFVbj]. Its porous structure facilitates cell migration, attachment, and proliferation, enabling new bone to form along the scaffold surface [^113niA16].

---

### Osteoinduction

Osteoinduction is the **differentiation of host mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts** driven by growth factors such as BMPs and TGF-β released from the graft or host tissues [^113niA16]. Although xenografts lack viable cells, processed materials (e.g. demineralized bone matrix) can retain osteoinductive proteins that stimulate osteogenesis [^117XLRcu].

---

### Remodeling and replacement

Remodeling is the **balanced resorption of xenograft material by osteoclasts and deposition of new host bone by osteoblasts** [^113Xttc8]. Over time, xenograft fragments are gradually replaced by lamellar bone, restoring normal architecture and function [^116oFVbj].

## Factors influencing xenograft transformation

### Graft material properties

Processing methods (e.g. deproteinization, demineralization, sintering) alter **immunogenicity**, osteoinductivity, and resorption kinetics [^117MXvTR]. Porosity and surface topography determine cell infiltration, **vascularization**, and integration with host bone [^116DjhhG]. Composition — mineral content and crystallinity — affects mechanical properties and **degradation rate** [^1134Wo2c].

---

### Host biological factors

Age and sex influence **bone turnover** and regeneration capacity. Comorbidities such as osteoporosis, diabetes, and **immunosuppression** impair healing. Genetic factors, including variations in **BMP signaling** and osteoclast activity, modulate graft integration.

---

### Mechanical environment

Mechanical stability is essential for proper graft integration and remodeling; **instability can cause nonunion or graft failure** [^116yJ2wN]. Load-bearing sites may require longer remodeling due to higher mechanical demands [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence and outcomes

Clinical studies show that xenografts are effective for ridge preservation, sinus augmentation, and periodontal regeneration, with **histological evidence of new bone formation and gradual graft resorption** [^116oFVbj] [^114zsc2U]. However, incorporation is generally slower than autograft, with higher nonunion rates reported in some series, particularly in foot and ankle surgery [^111XHEnm] [^116bXBJu].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Immunogenicity**: Despite processing, residual antigens may trigger immune responses, potentially impairing integration [^111JBnci].
- **Slow resorption**: Persistent xenograft fragments may delay complete transformation and remodeling [^116oFVbj].
- **Limited osteoinductivity**: Xenografts lack viable cells and may have reduced osteoinductive capacity compared to autograft [^116DjhhG].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **enhancing osteoinductivity** by incorporating growth factors (e.g. BMPs) or bioactive molecules into xenografts [^113RsQ2B]. Efforts also target optimizing scaffold architecture and porosity to improve cell infiltration and vascularization [^116DjhhG]. Strategies to modulate immune responses aim to reduce rejection and improve integration [^117DkCBa].

---

Xenograft bone transforms into host bone through a coordinated sequence of inflammation, osteoconduction, osteoinduction, and remodeling, culminating in **host-derived bone** that restores function. The process is shaped by graft properties, host biology, and mechanics, and typically unfolds over months to years [^111XHEnm].

### Allograft bone matrix versus synthetic bone graft substitutes [^114wqnNr]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Autologous bone is used very often in the treatment of fresh fractures, delayed unions and non-unions. Alternatives have included allografts and in recent years also demineralized bone matrix. The growing availability of good synthetic bone grafts and their advantages in safety and avoiding donor-site morbidity are the reasons that these products are being used more and more. There are on the market a wide variety of substitutes with different capabilities. Nevertheless autologous bone graft is still considered as the gold standard and will be discussed here in that context. Osteoconductive, osteogenic and osteoinductive products will also be classified and their advantages and disadvantages described.

### Tasquinimod inhibits prostate cancer growth in bone through alterations in the bone microenvironment [^111AdbGg]. The Prostate (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Tasquinimod (ABR-215050) is an orally active quinoline-3-carboxamide analog that inhibits occurrence of experimental metastasis and delays disease progression of castration resistant prostate cancer in humans. Its mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, but previous studies show immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the tumor inhibiting effect of tasquinimod in bone of castrated mice as well as to elucidate its working mechanism related to bone microenvironment.

Methods

Effects of tasquinimod on prostate cancer metastasis to bone was studied in an intratibial xenograft model. Animals were treated with tasquinimod and tumor establishment and growth, immunological status, as well as markers for bone remodeling were analyzed. Direct effects of tasquinimod on osteoblasts were studied in vitro.

Results

Establishment and growth of tumors in the bone after intratibial implantation in castrated mice was suppressed by tasquinimod treatment. The treatment effect was linked to decreased potential for immunosuppression in the pre-metastatic niche in bone (lower levels of CD206 and Arg1 expression in combination with increased iNOS expression) as well as in the tumor microenvironment (less Gr1 and CD206 staining). The shift to a pro-inflammatory, anti-tumorigenic milieu was also reflected in serum by increased levels of IFN-γ, CCL4, IL-5, LIX, IP-10, and MCP-1 as well as decreased TGF-β. Tasquinimod treatment also affected expression of factors involved in the pre-metastatic niche in the bone microenvironment (Lox, Cdh2, Cdh11, and Cxcl12). In addition, tasquinimod treatment caused a decreased osteogenic response indicated by decreased expression of Ocn, Runx2, and Col1a2 and increased expression of osteoclast stimulating CSF2. In vitro studies on mouse osteoblasts showed impaired osteoblast mineralization upon tasquinimod treatment.

Conclusions

The present study shows that tasquinimod reduces establishment and progression of tumor growth in bone likely through a combination of effects on the pre-metastatic niche, homing, immunological status, and osteogenesis. It was concluded that tasquinimod interferes with the metastatic process, presumably by inhibition of tumor establishment. Hence, our data suggest that tasquinimod might be most effective in inhibiting the occurrence of new metastatic lesions.

### Bone health management after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an expert panel opinion from the American society for transplantation and cellular therapy [^111nGGdG]. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Monitoring and treatment targets after transplantation — some panel members endorse a "treat-to-target" strategy with periodic bone density assessment, but others question its effectiveness in high-risk scenarios; biomarkers are not routinely used to guide therapy. "Some expert panel members propose a 'treat-to-target' approach", and "Patients are monitored with lumbar and hip (or femoral neck) DXA every 1 to 2 years". "If a patient's BMD is improving toward the target with initial therapy, that therapy is continued. Conversely, if it appears that the target will not be reached, initial therapy is changed to an agent more likely to achieve the goal", whereas "Other panel members believe that the 'treat-to-target' approach is unlikely to be effective… particularly when the initial T score is < -3.0 or in patients with ongoing medical complications and contraindications to alternative agents". Additionally, "Bone turnover markers (BTMs) are not routinely recommended to guide treatment", and "Attempts should be made to improve BMD and decrease fracture risk while avoiding medication-specific toxicities".

### Lost in translation: the lack of agreement between surgeons and scientists regarding biomaterials research and innovation for treating bone defects [^112EqmGi]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Bone defects following trauma, (bony) infection or tumour resection still pose relevant challenges for patients, surgeons, and scientists in the twenty-first century. Globally, 2 million bone transplants are performed every year (half a million of them in the United States of America, USA), which makes it the gold standard treatment for bone defects. This makes bone the second most frequently transplanted tissue after blood transfusions. However, there is relevant morbidity associated with autologous bone graft harvesting, such as iatrogenic fractures and perioperative blood loss. Additionally, some patients have limited quantity or quality of autologous bone material. The stand-alone use of autologous bone grafts for reconstructing larger bone defects is associated with an increased risk of graft resorption and results in structurally and functionally compromised regenerated bone in the reconstructed bone area (segment). These limitations necessitate the development of alternative bone substitutes. In response to these challenges, there has been growing interest in the use of natural and/or synthetic bone substitutes. Nowadays, in addition to autologous bone grafts, various bone replacement products (allografts, synthetic bone replacement materials, growth factors and bioactive molecules) along with artificial 3D-printed scaffolds, known as bone scaffolds, are used for bone defect regeneration.

### SIRT7: a novel molecular target for personalized cancer treatment? [^114sTdYC]. Oncogene (2024). Medium credibility.

SIRT7 in sarcoma

Sarcomas, tumors presumed to emerge from mesenchymal origins, account for approximately 21% of pediatric and less than 1% of adult solid malignant cancers. They can be broadly categorized into two main groups: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas. Soft tissue sarcomas generally take shape within muscles, joints, fat, nerves and blood vessels. On the contrary, bone sarcomas primarily encompass osteosarcomas and Ewing's sarcomas. These malignancies are frequently associated with unfavorable prognoses, largely attributed to their tendency for diagnosis at advanced stages.

In fibrosarcoma cells, SIRT7 assumes a critical function in sustaining tumor growth through epigenetic repression of pivotal tumor suppressors including RPs via H3K18 deacetylation (Fig. 7B and Table 1). Moreover, SIRT7 stimulates the expression of pro-metastatic factors, such as MMP16 and VEGF-A, consequently fostering cell migration and facilitating the formation of metastases (Fig. 7C and Table 1).

SIRT7 also demonstrates pro-tumorigenic attributes within osteosarcoma cells. Levels of SIRT7 show an elevation within these tumors when compared to healthy tissues and exhibit an inverse correlation with patient survival. The depletion of SIRT7 in these cells diminishes proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro, and it restricts tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Mechanistically, SIRT7 represses the expression of the tumor suppressor CDC4 through deacetylation of H3K18 (Fig. 7D and Table 1).

Role of SIRT7 in breast cancer

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and stands as the most prevalent malignancy among women. In its initial stages, the prognosis for breast cancer is favorable. However, the scenario takes a bleak turn when the disease is identified at a metastatic stage. SIRT7 levels increase in different stages of breast cancer but decline in metastasis derived from this malignancy. This pattern implies that SIRT7 might wield distinct functions across various stages of breast cancer progression. However, conflicting findings have arisen regarding the influence of SIRT7 in breast cancer. Studies demonstrated that depletion of SIRT7 within breast cancer cell lines yields significant reductions in both proliferation and migration rates in vitro and in vivo, an effect at least partially attributed to the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling cascade (Fig. 8A and Table 1). In stark contradiction to these results, another study demonstrated that depletion of SIRT7 promotes breast cancer cells growth in mouse xenografts models. Considering that these studies have utilized consistent cellular models, additional investigation is warranted to comprehensively elucidate the underlying conditions that have contributed to the emergence of these disparate outcomes.

### The processing of xenografts will result in different clinical responses [^117MXvTR]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clinicians might decide to use a xenograft to reconstruct an osseous defect. Xenografts are processed differently depending on the manufacturer. The purpose of this article is to review the processing methods and clinical ramifications of these processing methods on the behavior of xenografts.

Materials and Methods

Differences in surface morphology of xenografts based on processing, xenografts used for sinus augmentation, onlay grafting using particulate xenografts, and available clinical trials are reviewed.

Results

When used for grafting the extraction socket or preserving or reconstructing the ridge contour, xenografts can result in different resorption rates over time.

Conclusion

Based on the available information gleaned from the literature, clinical recommendations are included for specific clinical applications.

### Tissue engineering of bone: material and matrix considerations [^113n3bug]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

When the normal physiologic reaction to fracture does not occur, such as in fracture nonunions or large-scale traumatic bone injury, surgical intervention is warranted. Autografts and allografts represent current strategies for surgical intervention and subsequent bone repair, but each possesses limitations, such as donor-site morbidity with the use of autograft and the risk of disease transmission with the use of allograft. Synthetic bone-graft substitutes, developed in an effort to overcome the inherent limitations of autograft and allograft, represent an alternative strategy. These synthetic graft substitutes, or matrices, are formed from a variety of materials, including natural and synthetic polymers, ceramics, and composites, that are designed to mimic the three-dimensional characteristics of autograft tissue while maintaining viable cell populations. Matrices also act as delivery vehicles for factors, antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic agents, depending on the nature of the injury to be repaired. This intersection of matrices, cells, and therapeutic molecules has collectively been termed tissue engineering. Depending on the specific application of the matrix, certain materials may be more or less well suited to the final structure; these include polymers, ceramics, and composites of the two. Each category is represented by matrices that can form either solid preformed structures or injectable forms that harden in situ. This article discusses the myriad design considerations that are relevant to successful bone repair with tissue-engineered matrices and provides an overview of several manufacturing techniques that allow for the actualization of critical design parameters.

### Cell-free and cell-based approaches for bone regeneration [^1153Lub8]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

The clinical augmentation of bone currently involves the use of autogenous or allogeneic bone grafts and synthetic materials, all of which are associated with limitations. Research on the safe enhancement of bone formation concerns the potential value of scaffolds, stem cells, gene therapy, and chemical and mechanical signals. Optimal scaffolds are engineered to provide mechanical stability while supporting osteogenesis, osteoconduction and/or osteoinduction. Scaffold materials include natural or synthetic polymers, ceramics, and composites. The resorption, mechanical strength and efficacy of these materials can be manipulated through structural and chemical design parameters. Cell-seeded scaffolds contain stem cells or progenitor cells, such as culture-expanded marrow stromal cells and multipotent skeletal progenitor cells sourced from other tissues. Despite extensive evidence from proof-of-principle studies, bone tissue engineering has not translated to clinical practice. Much of the research involves in vitro and animal models that do not replicate potential clinical applications. Problem areas include cell sources and numbers, over-reliance on existing scaffold materials, optimum delivery of factors, control of transgene expression, vascularization, integration with host bone, and the capacity to form bone and marrow structures in vivo. Current thinking re-emphasizes the potential of biomimetic materials to stimulate, enhance, or control bone's innate regenerative capacity at the implantation site.

### Lost in translation: the lack of agreement between surgeons and scientists regarding biomaterials research and innovation for treating bone defects [^114rwRvM]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Scientists were significantly more inclined to express the opinion that autologous bone grafts can be superseded by bone graft substitutes in the future, expressing optimism about the promising development of these substitutes. This sentiment may stem from the extensive preclinical and experimental (in vitro and in vivo) research on bone substitutes, including allografts and synthetic bone substitutes, for treating bone defects. However, of the countless studies that have aimed in this direction, only a handful have made the leap from bench to bedside, while most have not succeeded in routine clinical implementation. Please note, the results of our study might suggest that surgeons use fewer bone graft substitutes than autologous bone grafts, but this is not what we investigated. Rather, we asked whether bone graft substitutes will replace autologous bone grafts in the future or whether their further development is considered promising. One explanation why surgeons are more reserved in their assessment of bone graft substitutes could be that there is no international consensus on definitions, reliable diagnostic principles, and best practices for the surgical treatment of larger (segmental) bone defects. Noteworthy, from 2008 to 2018, for example, the total number of procedures in Germany in which autografts, allografts, and bone substitutes were used to reconstruct bone defects in the extremities and pelvis increased (2008: 86,294 procedures; 2018: 99,863 procedures, + 15.7%). The same study also described an increase in the prevalence of the use of bone graft substitutes over the 11-year period, while the absolute numbers of autologous bone grafts decreased (2008: n = 63,929, 2018: n = 54,784, − 14.3%). Due to the homogeneous distribution of participants (e.g. 74.5% from Germany), with high numbers from a few countries of origin, conducting a subgroup analysis based on individual countries is not meaningful for the present study. In conclusion, as described above for the German context and thus reflecting the majority of participants in this study, the relative use of bone graft substitutes is increasing compared to autologous bone grafts. However, in order to achieve a more cost-efficient and productive path forward for translation in the future and to support the industry-academia collaborations in their research developments knowingly, a multimodal interdisciplinary international consensus on definitions, reliable diagnostic principles, and best practices for the surgical treatment of larger (segmental) bone defects is particularly needed.

### Inhibition of STAT3 prevents bone metastatic progression of prostate cancer in vivo [^116ccaZ1]. The Prostate (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate cancer (PC) metastasizes to the skeleton forming predominantly sclerotic lesions, and there is currently no cure for bone metastatic disease. The transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is implicated as a metastatic driver, but its potential as therapeutic target in bone metastasis has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluated for the first time a STAT3 inhibitor, Napabucasin, as a therapeutic option for bone metastatic PC.

Methods

Effects of STAT3 inhibitors, Stattic and Napabucasin, on metastatic potential in PC cells were studied in vitro by assessment of migration capacity, self-renewal potential, and tumorsphere formation. For evaluation of the role of STAT3 in initial skeletal establishment of PC cells as well as in progressed castration-resistant PC (CRPC) in bone, human VCaP prostate cancer cells were inoculated in the tibia of mice which subsequently were treated with the STAT3 inhibitor Napabucasin. Bone specimens were analyzed using computed tomography (CT), immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Results

The small molecule STAT3 inhibitors Stattic and Napabucasin both effectively impaired metastatic potential of PC cells in vitro. Furthermore, treatment with Napabucasin prevented metastatic establishment in tibial bones in vivo and thereby also the tumor-induced sclerotic bone response seen in vehicle-treated VCaP xenografts. In addition, treatment with Napabucasin of established bone CRPC significantly decreased both tumor burden and tumor-induced trabecular bone volume compared with effects seen in vehicle-treated animals. Anti-mitotic effects were confirmed by decreased Ki67 staining in Napabucasin-treated xenografts compared with vehicle-treated xenografts. Alterations of gene expression in the femoral bone marrow (BM) niche toward the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and the myeloid lineage were demonstrated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and were further reflected by a substantial increase in the number of erythrocytes in BM of Napabucasin-treated mice. Furthermore, a unique pattern of STAT3 phosphorylation in osteoblasts/stromal cells surrounding the areas of tumor cells was demonstrated immunohistochemically in bone xenograft models using several different PC cell lines.

Conclusion

Inhibition of STAT3 activity disrupts the bone metastatic niche and targets both the skeletal establishment of PC and advanced bone metastatic CRPC in mice, suggesting STAT3 as a candidate for molecular targeted therapies of skeletal metastatic disease.

### Imaging the effects of castration on bone turnover and hormone-independent prostate cancer colonization of bone [^112uQNdq]. The Prostate (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tumor populations may selectively colonize bone that is being actively remodeled. In prostate cancer patients, androgen deprivation directly inhibits tumor growth initially, whilst induced bone loss may facilitate tumor colonization of bone by androgen-insensitive cells. We have tested this hypothesis using a xenograft model of early growth of prostate cancer in bone.

Methods

PC3 cells transfected with Green fluorescent protein (GFP) were injected into castrated and non-castrated athymic mice via intrabial and intracardiac routes. In vivo tumor growth was monitored daily and animals sacrificed 6–9 days following initial GFP-based detection of tumors. Tumor bearing and contra-lateral non-tumor bearing tibias were analyzed extensively by micro-CT and histology/immunohistochemistry for the presence of tumor cells and the effects of tumor and/or castration on bone cells and bone structure evaluated.

Results

GFP-positive tumors in bone were visible from 12 days post-injection following intratibial injection, allowing tumors < 1 mm diameter to be monitored in live animals. Castration did not affect tumor frequency, tumor volume, or time to initial appearance of tumors injected via intratibial or intracardiac routes. Castration decreased trabecular bone volume in all mice. Significant tumor-induced suppression of numbers of osteoblasts, coupled with increased numbers of activated osteoclasts, was evident in both intact animals and castrated animals.

Conclusions

In vivo GFP imaging allows the detection of early tumor growth at intra-osseous sites. Castration induces bone loss, but PC3-GFP cells are also capable of inducing bone remodeling in intact animals at early time points, independently of pre-existing castration-induced alterations to bone.

### Lost in translation: the lack of agreement between surgeons and scientists regarding biomaterials research and innovation for treating bone defects [^112uEj3d]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In 1965, Urist described an osteoinductive biomaterial for the first time in the preparation of soluble extracts of demineralized bone (demineralized bone matrix, DBM) derived from allograft. Since this groundbreaking work, numerous preclinical animal studies have confirmed the efficacy of DBM in human medicine. While the utilization of allografts is on the rise, owing to their immediate structural support and osteoconductivity, natural bone substitutes, including allografts, exhibit highly variable bone regenerative (osteoinductive) properties, increased rates of non-union, and the potential for disease transmission. In addition, fractures of allografts in major bone defects and their high cost have further encouraged the development of other strategies, including the use of synthetic bone substitutes. Synthetic bone substitutes such as hydroxyapatite (HA) and/or tricalcium phosphate (TCP) can only be used in combination with autologous bone grafts in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to 1:3, as they have a high rate of non-unions when used alone as a bone substitute. Therefore (as with allografts), the clinical applicability of synthetic bone substitutes for bone defects is limited. Three-dimensional printing (3D printing) is a form of additive manufacturing wherein objects are produced in successive layers from digital models. Patient-specific 3D-printed bone scaffolds can be made from macroporous (biodegradable) bioceramics (e.g. HA), non-resorbable porous titanium (e.g. Ti6Al4V), and biodegradable composite materials such as medical-grade polycaprolactone and tricalcium phosphate (mPCL-TCP). Surgical strategies applying patient-specific scaffold-guided bone regeneration (SGBR) offer the capacity to regenerate bony defects.

### PTHrP increases transcriptional activity of the integrin subunit alpha5 [^115r28qu]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Not only is the present study the first to show that PTHrP plays a role in integrin transcription, but it also demonstrates that the NLS is required. This dependence on the NLS is also consistent with other results described here where the increase in adhesion and integrin expression were reversed in cells overexpressing NLS-mutated PTHrP.

During preparation of this manuscript, another study by Shen and Falzon was published examining the effect of PTHrP upregulation on α 6 β 4 expression and Akt activation in breast cancer cells. Subsequent to demonstrating modulation of α 6 β 4 expression at the mRNA level (consistent with the results shown here), they suggested that this indicated a 'transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional mechanism of action for PTHrP' and also proposed that the integrin promoter regions were necessary for PTHrP to regulate α 6 β 4. The results described in the present study provide evidence that PTHrP does indeed act upon the integrin promoter region (in this case α 5) and thereby has a transcriptional mechanism of action.

PTHrP has previously been identified as a therapeutic target with a number of studies attempting to block PTHrP to inhibit breast cancer metastasis to bone. For example, a recent study used a monoclonal antibody against PTHrP to significantly reduce osteolytic bone metastasis in a human xenograft model. The results presented here suggest that inhibiting PTHrP could help to reduce metastasis to other organs, not just bone. Furthermore, the recent success of the RNAi-based drug Cand5 in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration highlights the vast potential for RNAi-based drugs in the treatment of a variety of diseases and the current study suggests that a PTHrP-specific siRNA could be similarly effective.

It is unlikely that the effects of PTHrP on integrin transcription is limited to one subunit and additional studies will be required to assess whether the effects of PTHrP on integrin transcription is limited to one subunit (α 5) or whether it extends to all or a select integrin subunits. It will also be of interest to determine the precise mechanism whereby PTHrP modulates integrin expression. For instance, it is unknown whether there is a direct interaction between PTHrP and the integrin promoter sequence or whether there is upregulation of other transcription factors, which in turn act on the integrin promoter, that is does PTHrP upregulate integrin transcription in a direct or indirect manner?

### Selection of bone grafts for revision total hip arthroplasty [^116yJ2wN]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2000). Low credibility.

The selection of bone grafts to reconstruct deficient bone for revision hip replacement requires an understanding of specific bone graft functions and the critical steps of the biologic incorporation of the graft into the host. Bone grafts provide functions of osteogenesis, either graft derived or by osteoinduction, osteoconduction, or both, and mechanical support. Autologous cancellous bone provides excellent osteogenesis and osteoconduction without structural support. Nonvascularized cortical autografts provide mechanical support and are somewhat osteogenic. Allogeneic cancellous bone is osteoconductive and minimally osteoinductive, whereas cortical allografts provide structural support, if not freeze-dried, and are somewhat osteoconductive. Allogeneic demineralization bone matrix is highly osteoinductive. The selection of the appropriate bone graft depends on the classification of the bone deficiency. Cavitary (contained) defects can be reconstructed with cancellous morselized autograft, frozen or freeze-dried allograft, or allogeneic demineralized bone matrix. Segmental defects require bulk corticocancellous and/or cortical autografts or allografts. The ultimate incorporation of the bone graft depends on the interaction of the graft and the host's mechanical and biologic environment, and host-bone graft contact and stability. Optimum bone graft selection will enhance the clinical outcomes in revision total hip arthroplasty.

### A review of bone substitutes [^1124FyJn]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The use of bone grafts in the repair of defects has a long history of success, primarily with the use of autologous bone. With increasing technologic advances, researchers have been able to broaden the spectrum of grafting materials to allografts, xenografts, and synthetic materials, which provide the surgeon and patient with options, each with unique advantages. It is with the knowledge of each material that the clinician can present and suggest the best material and tailor treatment plans to fit each individual. In this article, we present an overview of the principles of bone grafting, the types of graft materials available, and an outlook to what the future holds in this area of medicine and dentistry.

### Bone material comparison in maxillary sinus augmentation… [^116oFVbj]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Scaffolding materials such as xenografts or synthetics substitutes have been proven to be a viable alternative. Xenografts are obtained from nonhuman species and serve as a scaffold for the formation of new bone. Histologic evaluation of maxillary sinuses grafted with xenografts revealed newly formed bone to be mostly woven bone with some remodeling to lamellar bone. These histologic findings reaffirm the osteoconductive ability of xenografts when used as the sole grafting material in maxillary sinus augmentation. Xenografts appear to be an effective method for maxillary sinus grafting and demonstrate limited resorption over time. Sinuses augmented with synthetic bone substitute also appear to successfully integrate based on recent histomorphometric studies. Vascularization and trabecular bone formation in sinuses grafted with SBS has been previously demonstrated.

One type of SBS includes porous granules of bioactive and resorbable silica-calcium phosphate nanocomposite. ShefaBone grafts offer a novel alternative that can potentially unite the 3 salient bone-forming properties. ShefaBone has unique properties including: 1) bioactivity 2) bioresorbablility, and 3) allowing for the uptake of calcium ions from the physiological solution and releasing phosphate and silicate ions which aid in bone formation. A material with such properties will substitute bone in a more controlled and effective combination that can be obtained in many clinical situations, without the disadvantages found with autograft. ShefaBone has demonstrated successful regenerative properties for bony defects. To our knowledge, there is no reported clinical studies on the use of SCPC material to graft a pneumatized maxillary sinus.

This aim of this current study is to compare SCPC to commonly used xenograft material in an augmented maxillary sinus.
- To assess the quality and quantity of the maxillary sinus bone prior to the placement of dental implants and subsequent restorations, approximately 20 patients will be randomly assigned to receive an augmentation of the maxillary sinus region using either Shefabone or Bio-Oss.
- With the use of pre-operative and post-operative limited view CBCT radiography, the maxillary sinus bone density will be assessed and compared between the individuals receiving Shefabone and the individuals receiving xenograft material.

### Targeting AXL inhibits the growth and metastasis of prostate cancer in bone [^1122TU5f]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

After failing primary and secondary hormonal therapy, castration-resistant and neuroendocrine prostate cancer metastatic to the bone is invariably lethal, although treatment with docetaxel and carboplatin can modestly improve survival. Therefore, agents targeting biologically relevant pathways in prostate cancer and potentially synergizing with docetaxel and carboplatin in inhibiting bone metastasis growth are urgently needed.

Experimental Design

Phosphorylated (activated) AXL expression in human prostate cancer bone metastases was assessed by IHC staining. We evaluated the effects of a novel soluble AXL signaling inhibitor, sAXL (batiraxcept or AVB-S6–500), on tumor growth and lung metastases in prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft models that were implanted intratibially. After injection of LuCaP cells into the tibiae, tumors were treated with batiraxcept and docetaxel or carboplatin alone or in combination, and tumor growth was monitored by serum prostate-specific antigen or bioluminescence. Tumor burden was quantified by human-specific Ku70 staining, and metastasis to the lungs was determined using qPCR. Transcriptomic profiling, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to identify treatment-regulated gene and protein profile changes.

Results

High AXL phosphorylation in human prostate cancer bone metastases correlated with shortened survival. Batiraxcept alone or in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin significantly suppressed intratibial tumor growth and suppressed metastasis to the lungs through multiple mechanisms, including repression of cancer stemness genes (CD44, ALDH1A1, TACSTD2, and ATXN1) and the PI3K, JAK, MAPK, and E2F1/NUSAP1 signaling pathways.

Conclusions

Our study provides a robust preclinical rationale and mechanisms of action for using batiraxcept as a single agent or in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin to treat lethal metastatic prostate cancer.

### Rapid fabrication of vascularized and innervated cell-laden bone models with biomimetic intrafibrillar collagen mineralization [^1168Sm1R]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Lastly, to demonstrate the efficacy of our engineered construct as a disease model system, the mineralized 3D constructs were implanted into the subcutaneous pockets of immunocompromised mice to create ectopic bone-like microenvironments. It is known that the paracrine signals exerted by the cells in the native bone, as well as matrix molecules released by the actively remodeling mineralized tissue, act as crucial players in providing a conducive environment for the proliferation of disseminated prostate cancer cells. To replicate this phenomenon, 24 h post implantation of the cell-laden tissue constructs, a suspension of luciferase-expressing prostate cancer cells (PC3) was injected directly at the ectopic site, so as to determine the ability of our mineralized bone model to condition the growth and colonization of tumor cells. In vivo bioluminescence imaging was performed over a period of 3 weeks to track the outgrowth of PC3 cells. Tumor growth kinetics was significantly higher in mineralized samples than in non-mineralized controls at all time points (Fig. 6f, g). Of note, the target site implanted with the mineralized construct emitted almost threefold higher bioluminescence signal than the non-mineralized counterparts at the end of 3 weeks. Overall, the results implied that the vascularized and mineralized bone-like tissue constructs emulate the grafting and growth of prostate cancer cells in relation to their proximity to the bone. These results illustrate the ability of the proposed model system to study bone-targeting diseases, such as various cancers, with greater experimental control, which should allow for improved screening of therapeutic interventions targeting the interaction between cancers and bone.

### Hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 targets hypoxic bone marrow niches in preclinical leukemia models [^1127dJh4]. Clinical Cancer Research (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To characterize the prevalence of hypoxia in the leukemic bone marrow, its association with metabolic and transcriptional changes in the leukemic blasts and the utility of hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 in leukemia models.

Experimental Design

Hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy was utilized to interrogate the pyruvate metabolism of the bone marrow in the murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model. Nanostring technology was used to evaluate a gene set defining a hypoxia signature in leukemic blasts and normal donors. The efficacy of the hypoxia-activated prodrug TH-302 was examined in the in vitro and in vivo leukemia models.

Results

Metabolic imaging has demonstrated increased glycolysis in the femur of leukemic mice compared with healthy control mice, suggesting metabolic reprogramming of hypoxic bone marrow niches. Primary leukemic blasts in samples from AML patients overexpressed genes defining a "hypoxia index" compared with samples from normal donors. TH-302 depleted hypoxic cells, prolonged survival of xenograft leukemia models, and reduced the leukemia stem cell pool in vivo In the aggressive FLT3/ITD MOLM-13 model, combination of TH-302 with tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib had greater antileukemia effects than either drug alone. Importantly, residual leukemic bone marrow cells in a syngeneic AML model remain hypoxic after chemotherapy. In turn, administration of TH-302 following chemotherapy treatment to mice with residual disease prolonged survival, suggesting that this approach may be suitable for eliminating chemotherapy-resistant leukemia cells.

Conclusions

These findings implicate a pathogenic role of hypoxia in leukemia maintenance and chemoresistance and demonstrate the feasibility of targeting hypoxic cells by hypoxia cytotoxins.

### Osteopontin and bone sialoprotein distribution at the bone graft recipient site… [^112GDBsA]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Ground areas were fairly intact superficially, with new bone trabeculae reaching toward the interface region, while more resorptive activity, appearing like vacuoles, was found deeper in the recipient bone. Graft integration was markedly more pronounced in this group. Submuscular grafts were more integrated than the subperiosteal ones, but otherwise disclosed the same histologic pattern. The ground areas below submuscular grafts showed excellent bony union to the graft. Rich new bone production from the recipient bed and remodeling at the graft's contact surface were evident. At 20 weeks, the recipient site was very thin after subperiosteal placement of the grafts. The inner cortical layer was reduced in height, and moderate remodeling and, occasionally, corticalization of the remaining diploic space were observed. The grafts demonstrated restricted thinning with ongoing remodeling. Graft integration was moderate.

In contrast, ground specimens showed complete integration. Their recipient site disclosed marked progressive thinning, and the remaining bone layer often was lamellar. The graft's contact surface to the interface showed marked local remodeling and resorptive activity. This remodeling was more pronounced after submuscular placement of the graft, a finding that was apparent for both intervals. Maturation was slow for the bicortical grafts irrespective of placement. Surprisingly, full bone maturation was not observed in any group, but after 20 weeks reduced labeling was observed for both proteins investigated. This indicates that maturation of the recipient bone with decreased bone turnover was approaching. The spectrum of successful graft incorporation ranged from the subperiosteally placed graft, which obtained improved integration after the recipient bed was ground, to the submuscular graft, with further improvement after grinding.

This pattern was applicable for both intervals tested. Also, the early dramatic gain in bone production obtained after grinding was only temporary, as this bone was resorbed later. This conclusion agrees with Albrektsson's37 observation that neither osteogenesis nor resorption occurs before a bone is revascularized. Consequently, recipient site failure rather than graft volumetric changes may be a logical explanation in many cases of loss of skeletal contour after bone transplantation. Furthermore, the positive impact on graft integration that was observed after grinding secondarily facilitated graft revitalization and, in turn, resorption, which induces doubts as to its long-term benefits.

### Tissue engineering for bone defect healing: an update on a multi-component approach [^1176uaT3]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Summary

The need for an interdisciplinary approach in order to establish new therapeutic strategies for the therapy of bone defects has been acknowledged by the scientific community for many years. This awareness makes itself felt when looking at the multitude of approaches — ranging from cell-based to scaffold-based strategies and also including the use of osteogenic growth factors and genetic engineering — that are currently being combined to assess their potential to develop effective concepts for the treatment of extensive loss of osseous tissue. With a strong focus on the preclinical research in this field, the goal of this review is to give an update on the multi-component approaches that are currently being investigated in tissue engineering of bone.

### Bone regeneration: current concepts and future directions [^114puPk9]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

An alternative is allogeneic bone grafting, obtained from human cadavers or living donors, which bypasses the problems associated with harvesting and quantity of graft material. Allogeneic bone is available in many preparations, including demineralised bone matrix (DBM), morcellised and cancellous chips, corticocancellous and cortical grafts, and osteochondral and whole-bone segments, depending on the recipient site requirements. Their biological properties vary, but overall, they possess reduced osteoinductive properties and no cellular component, because donor grafts are devitalised via irradiation or freeze-drying processing. There are issues of immunogenicity and rejection reactions, possibility of infection transmission, and cost.

Bone-graft substitutes have also been developed as alternatives to autologous or allogeneic bone grafts. They consist of scaffolds made of synthetic or natural biomaterials that promote the migration, proliferation and differentiation of bone cells for bone regeneration. A wide range of biomaterials and synthetic bone substitutes are currently used as scaffolds, including collagen, hydroxyapatite (HA), β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and calcium-phosphate cements, and glass ceramics, and the research into this field is ongoing. Especially for reconstruction of large bone defects, for which there is a need for a substantial structural scaffold, an alternative to massive cortical auto- or allografts is the use of cylindrical metallic or titanium mesh cages as a scaffold combined with cancellous bone allograft, DBM or autologous bone.

### A perspective: engineering periosteum for structural bone graft healing [^115iSFbe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2008). Low credibility.

Autograft is superior to both allograft and synthetic bone graft in repair of large structural bone defect largely due to the presence of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells in periosteum. Recent studies have provided further evidence that activation, expansion and differentiation of the donor periosteal progenitor cells are essential for the initiation of osteogenesis and angiogenesis of donor bone graft healing. The formation of donor cell-derived periosteal callus enables efficient host-dependent graft repair and remodeling at the later stage of healing. Removal of periosteum from bone autograft markedly impairs healing whereas engraftment of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells on bone allograft improves healing and graft incorporation. These studies provide rationale for fabrication of a biomimetic periosteum substitute that could fit bone of any size and shape for enhanced allograft healing and repair. The success of such an approach will depend on further understanding of the molecular signals that control inflammation, cellular recruitment as well as mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and expansion during the early phase of the repair process. It will also depend on multidisciplinary collaborations between biologists, material scientists and bioengineers to address issues of material selection and modification, biological and biomechanical parameters for functional evaluation of bone allograft healing.

### Make no bones about it: cells could soon be reprogrammed to grow replacement bones? [^116fFNJh]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Recent developments in nuclear reprogramming allow the generation of patient-matched stem cells with broad potential for applications in cell therapies, disease modeling and drug discovery. An increasing body of work is reporting the derivation of lineage-specific progenitors from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which could in the near future be used to engineer personalized tissue substitutes, including those for reconstructive therapies of bone. Although the potential clinical impact of such technology is not arguable, significant challenges remain to be addressed before hiPSC-derived progenitors can be employed to engineer bone substitutes of clinical relevance. The most important challenge is indeed the construction of personalized multicellular bone substitutes for the treatment of complex skeletal defects that integrate fast, are immune tolerated and display biofunctionality and long-term safety. As recent studies suggest, the merging of iPSC technology with advanced biomaterials and bioreactor technologies offers a way to generate bone substitutes in a controllable, automated manner with potential to meet the needs for scale-up and requirements for translation into clinical practice. It is only via the use of state-of-the-art cell culture technologies, process automation under GMP-compliant conditions, application of appropriate engineering strategies and compliance with regulatory policies that personalized lab-made bone grafts can start being used to treat human patients.

### Y-box binding protein-1 regulates cell proliferation and is associated with clinical outcomes of osteosarcoma [^116YQKLH]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Small interfering RNA has been used widely as an experimental tool to analyse the molecular mechanisms leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation in malignant tumours. To develop siRNAs for malignant tumour therapy, a reliable and efficient delivery system is essential for effective treatment. Atelocollagen is already used clinically for a wide range of purposes, such as a bone cartilage substitute and a haemostatic agent, indicating that atelocollagen is innocuous in vivo. Furthermore, it is known that atelocollagen complexed with siRNA is resistant to nucleases and is efficiently transduced into cells, thereby extending the half-life of siRNAs in vivo. Remarkably, siRNA with atelocollagen in xenograft tumours in mice remains intact for at least a week. In this study, we injected si-YB-1 into the xenograft of OS cells once a week, and found that si-YB-1 inhibited YB-1 expression and dramatically suppressed tumour proliferation. Bone and soft tissue tumours, including OS, tend to present on the limbs; thus, local administration of siRNA with atelocollagen will be easy to apply. We believe that targeting YB-1 with siRNA and atelocollagen could be a novel and effective treatment against OS. However, local administration of siRNA into bone tumours, including OS, is not feasible. Interestingly, an atelocollagen complex can be delivered intravenously as nanoparticles, making systemic delivery of siRNA possible. A recent report showed the potential for atelocollagen-mediated systemic antisense therapeutics in a mouse model of bone metastasis without any side effects. Therefore, we believe that targeting YB-1 with siRNA and atelocollagen could be a novel and effective treatment for OS.

### Lost in translation: the lack of agreement between surgeons and scientists regarding biomaterials research and innovation for treating bone defects [^112QcDBg]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Integrating an independent legal component into the implementation process at an early stage is crucial. The surgeons and scientists emphasized the significant uncertainty and lack of clarity regarding legal requirements. Consistent with our observations, some stakeholders often cite the "perceived" lack of or inadequate regulation as an obstacle to the widespread adoption of bone graft substitutes and 3D-printed medical devices in clinical use. For example, medical devices successfully transferred into clinical practice not only due to a precise understanding of the mechanism of action of their various components but, above all, to compliance with the regulatory framework. The legal uncertainty was clearly reflected in the survey study results, in which more medico-legal clarity is seen as necessary before 3D-printed medical devices are used for standardized bone defect treatment.

Furthermore, over a third of the participants needed to be made aware of the relevant legislation and laws in these cases. It should be emphasized that Regulation (EU) 2017/745, commonly referred to as the "Medical Devices Regulation" (MDR) came into full force for the medical device sector on May 26, 2021, and will soon achieve more standardization at the EU level. Nonetheless, the survey study results indicate a greater need to communicate the new legal regulations within the community of surgeons and scientists and to discuss their consequences for everyday practice. Learning from real-world experiences, such as witnessing the use of the new technology online or via video link, is consistent with the findings from the literature that peer group learning ("clinical champions") is most effective compared to traditional methods like reading about procedures. It is important to note that no biomaterial can completely replace the body's bone, making it difficult to choose the best replacement. When selecting a material, factors such as tissue survival, size of the bone defect, shape of the graft, biomechanical properties, ease of use, cost, ethical considerations, and potential complications must be taken into account, which may negatively impact the opinion of clinicians on the value and promise of bone graft substitutes. Furthermore, when addressing the controversy surrounding bone graft substitutes, it is vital to consider the challenges associated with the growth factors bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which have contributed to relevant uncertainty regarding the use of synthetic products for bone healing over the last two decades; please refer to further in-depth literature. Notably, the biological and mechanical properties of the bone graft substitute required to achieve bone regeneration successfully should be evaluated in each clinical case, which, in turn, because of its high complexity, it is essential to take an interdisciplinary approach.

### Lost in translation: the lack of agreement between surgeons and scientists regarding biomaterials research and innovation for treating bone defects [^1153ZKKj]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgeons expressed slightly less urgency than scientists on the need for large animal studies. This can also be confirmed in the current literature, which makes it clear that surgeons must demonstrate safety and clinical added value, especially in preparation for human studies. In line with the relevant specialist literature, this survey study found that clinical studies play an increasingly central role in the age of evidence-based medicine. Indeed, it is appropriate that diagnostic procedures and non-pharmacological therapies, including therapies with bone substitutes and bone scaffolds, also undergo a needs and risk assessment according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine, similar to the randomized controlled phase III trials required to approve new drugs. The future of clinical research — and, therefore, the future of medical decision-making — will rely heavily on prospective clinical trials. In conjunction with scientists experienced in bone scaffolds, specialist groups active in clinical practice recognize the necessity for 3D printing biodegradable implants such as scaffolds in the future. This recognition is fuelled by promising initial clinical experiences, prompting the initiation of prospective clinical studies.

### Monomethyl auristatin E phosphate inhibits human prostate cancer growth [^111Q8a4P]. The Prostate (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bone metastasis from primary prostate cancer leads to markedly diminished quality of life with poor long-term survival. Bone seeking treatment options are limited with adverse consequences on rapidly proliferating tissues such as bone marrow. In the present study, we seek to determine the bone-enriching capabilities of monomethyl auristatin E phosphate (MMAEp), a derivative of the potent antimitotic monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE).

Methods

The in vitro actions and mechanisms of cytotoxicity were assessed using cell viability, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis. In vivo efficacy was determined using an intratibial xenograft mouse model of human prostate cancer and live animal imaging.

Results

The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of MMAE and MMAEp was determined to be approximately 2 and 48nM, respectively, in PC-3 and C4–2B cell lines. MMAEp retained the mechanism of action of MMAE in reducing microtubule polymerization and stalling cell cycle progression at the G2/M transition. MMAEp was able to bind hydroxyapatite in in vitro assays. MMAEp significantly reduced intratibial tumor growth compared to the vehicle control treatment.

Conclusions

MMAEp is an antimitotic compound that binds to calcium ions in the bone and inhibits prostate tumor growth in the bone. Prostate 76:1420–1430, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Demineralized bone matrix for fracture healing: fact or fiction? [^112gY4xW]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2010). Low credibility.

Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) has been touted as an excellent grafting material; however, there are no Level I studies that use DBM alone in humans to back up this claim. DBM functions best in a healthy tissue bed but should be expected to have little impact in an anoxic or avascular tissue bed, a situation often encountered in traumatic orthopaedic pathologies. Moreover, there is some evidence of differential potencies of DBM preparations based on donor variability and the manufacturing process. DBM efficacy may also be related to its formulation and the various carriers used. The fact that DBM is an allogeneic material opens up the potential for disease transmission. In addition, DBM activity may be altered by the hormonal status or nicotine use of a patient. In summary, although DBM has proven effective for bone induction in lower form animals, the translation to human clinical use for fracture healing, and the burden of proof, remains.

### New investigational drugs with single-agent activity in multiple myeloma [^112ppBd7]. Blood Cancer Journal (2016). Low credibility.

LGH447 (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland)

Mechanism of action

The final new drug in the arsenal of myeloma drugs that is being sought after and tested is still unnamed, and is simply known as LGH447. It is a pan PIM kinase inhibitor. Pims make up a group of serine/threonine kinases that act to regulate and express cell cycle progression and survival. Elevated levels of Pim1 and 2 have been found across all hematological malignancies, specifically in MM with the highest level of Pim-2 expression, making it an ideal target for anticancer therapy. Pim kinases can affect cytokines and growth factor signaling pathways downstream as well, therefore having an indirect role in cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis in many hematologic malignancies. They are felt to mediate myeloma cell proliferation and survival while also having a role in the frequent bone destruction seen in this disease. Pim kinases also typically act to promote oncogenic signaling in the hypoxic bone marrow environment, allowing resistance to therapy to develop. LGH447 is an oral drug whose mechanism of action is via inhibition of pan-Pim protein kinases (Pim-1, Pim-2 and Pim-3). By interfering with the interactions and activities of Pim kinases, LGH447 can interrupt crucial phases (G1/S) in the cell cycle and affect expression of various pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2.

LGH447 has been tested in MM and AML models and has shown significant activity as a pan-PIM kinase inhibitor according to a study by Garcia et al. At first, mutations were identified in murine T-cell lines showing expression of PIM1, 2 and 3 kinases belonging to the larger PIM kinase family. Preclinical studies showed evidence that LGH447 was active in PIM2-dependent MM cell lines by inhibiting proliferation, mTOR-C1 signaling and inhibiting tumor growth in mouse and subcutaneous xenograft models. LGH447 was also observed to have appreciably reduce the bone tumor burden in a orthotopic human xenograft model of MM, thereby necessitating the need for further clinical trials in patients with MM both as a single agent and in combination therapy.

### Lost in translation: the lack of agreement between surgeons and scientists regarding biomaterials research and innovation for treating bone defects [^116Jw8yc]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The latest advancements in automation, speed, reproducibility, and flexibility with small batches, coupled with the potential for reduced manufacturing costs, make the areas of bone replacement products and 3D printing technologies for orthopaedic trauma surgery very attractive in principle. These innovations lay a strong foundation for the successful transition from laboratory research to clinical practice. Over the past two decades, bioengineering and biotechnology have witnessed an exponential increase in publications. Yet, this surge in scientific knowledge has not been matched by a corresponding increase in clinical implementation that directly benefit patient care. Consequently, many discoveries fail to translate into U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved devices and are even less frequently adopted by the medical community. Government bodies and regulatory authorities have begun to address the entrepreneurial challenges — previously identified as critical components of the "valley of death" some 15 years ago — that impede the translation of bone graft substitutes and 3D-printed bone scaffolds into clinical applications. These efforts are aimed at bolstering the research and industrial landscapes: (1) regulatory approval in many countries has been negotiated and patient-oriented solutions have been found, and (2) increased allocation of third-party funding for the financing of confirmatory large animal studies and clinical studies has become more common. Despite overcoming the stony path of research, development, and regulatory approval, there is no guarantee that a product will achieve clinical success or become widely adopted for routine clinical use. Key influencing factors, such as the decision-making processes of surgeons and scientists, must be thoroughly understood before widespread clinical integration can be achieved.

### A comparative study of incorporation rates between non-xenograft and bovine-based structural bone graft in foot and ankle surgery [^111XHEnm]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Several types of structural bone grafts are available, each with different characteristics. Our previous study showed poor performance with the bovine-based xenograft in foot and ankle applications. In the present study, we compared the incorporation rates of non-xenografts, including allografts and autografts, with the bovine-based xenograft to determine whether the poor result was unique to the graft type and not institutional. The proportion of incorporated grafts at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks was compared between the nonxenograft and xenograft groups. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the factors associated with nonunion. A total of 61 patients (23 women and 38 men) with a median age of 24.0 years were enrolled. The factors associated with slower incorporation included side of operation (p = .033), tobacco use (p = .010), and graft type (p = .001). At 48 weeks, 5% of the nonxenografts and 58% of the xenografts were not incorporated. The median incorporation time for the non-xenograft and xenograft group was 16 and 57 weeks, respectively. We have concluded that it is not advisable to use a bovine-based bone xenograft in foot and ankle surgery.

### Bone graft substitutes: current concepts and future expectations [^112KTonM]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Owing to its osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties and the presence of osteogenic cells, freshly harvested autologous bone graft is the gold standard for skeletal reconstruction where there is inadequate native bone. Whereas these characteristics are difficult to replicate, engineered, commercially available bone graft substitutes aim to achieve a comparable osseoregenerative profile. This work furnishes the reader with an understanding of the predominant classes of bone graft substitutes available for reconstruction of upper extremity bone defects following trauma or oncological surgery. We review bone graft substitutes with respect to their mechanisms of action, their advantages and disadvantages, and their indications and contraindications. We provide examples of bone graft substitutes in clinical use and outline comparative costs. We also describe the future directions for this specific aspect of reconstructive surgery with a focus on the role of bioactive glass.

### Vascularized periosteal flaps accelerate osteointegration and revascularization of allografts in rats [^111mAGKZ]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical reconstruction of large bone defects with structural bone allografts can restore bone stock but is associated with complications such as nonunion, fracture, and infection. Vascularized reconstructive techniques may provide an alternative in the repair of critical bone defects; however, no studies specifically addressing the role of vascularized periosteal flaps in stimulating bone allograft revascularization and osseointegration have been reported.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Does a vascularized periosteal flap increase the likelihood of union at the allograft-host junction in a critical-size defect femoral model in rats? (2) Does a vascularized periosteal flap promote revascularization of a critical-size defect structural bone allograft in a rat model? (3) What type of ossification occurs in connection with a vascularized periosteal flap?

Methods

Sixty-four rats were assigned to two equal groups. In both the control and experimental groups, a 5-cm critical size femoral defect was created in the left femur and then reconstructed with a cryopreserved structural bone allograft and intramedullary nail. In the experimental group, a vascularized periosteal flap from the medial femoral condyle, with a pedicle based on the descending genicular vessels, was associated with the allograft. The 32 rats of each group were divided into subgroups of 4-week (eight rats), 6-week (eight rats), and 10-week (16 rats) followup. At the end of their assigned followup periods, the animals were euthanized and their femurs were harvested for semiquantitative and quantitative analysis using micro-CT (all followup groups), quantitative biomechanical evaluation (eight rats from each 10-week followup group), qualitative confocal microscopic, backscattered electron microscopic, and histology analysis (4-week and 6-week groups and eight rats from each 10-week followup group). When making their analyses, all the examiners were blinded to the treatment groups from which the samples came.

Results

There was an improvement in allograft-host bone union in the 10-week experimental group (odds ratio [OR], 19.29 [3.63–184.50], p < 0.05). In contrast to control specimens, greater bone neoformation in the allograft segment was observed in the experimental group (OR [4-week] 63.3 [39.6–87.0], p < 0.05; OR [6-week] 43.4 [20.5–66.3], p < 0.05; OR [10-week] 62.9 [40.1–85.7], p < 0.05). In our biomechanical testing, control samples were not evaluable as a result of premature breakage during the embedding and assembly processes. Therefore, experimental samples were compared with untreated contralateral femurs. No difference in torsion resistance pattern was observed between both groups. Both backscattered electron microscopy and histology showed newly formed bone tissue and osteoclast lacunae, indicating a regulated process of bone regeneration of the initial allograft in evaluated samples from the experimental group. They also showed intramembranous ossification produced by the vascularized periosteal flap in evaluated samples from the experimental group, whereas samples from the control group showed an attempted endochondral ossification in the allograft-host bone junctions.

Conclusions

A vascularized periosteal flap promotes and accelerates allograft-host bone union and revascularization of cryopreserved structural bone allografts through intramembranous ossification in a preclinical rat model.

Clinical Relevance

If large-animal models substantiate the findings made here, this approach might be used in allograft reconstructions for critical defects using fibular or tibial periosteal flaps as previously described.

### An update on recent advances in bone regeneration [^116qQt5P]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Summary

Bone loss from trauma, neoplasia, reconstructive surgery and congenital defects remains a major health problem, making the development of effective bone regeneration therapies a primary priority. The long-term clinical goal is to reconstruct bony tissue in an anatomically functional three-dimensional morphology. Today, the science of bone regeneration is in its infancy with current and emerging therapies still having significant limitations. In addition to bone grafting, current bone regeneration strategies include the application of different bioactive factors, cell types, biologic or artificial scaffolds, alone or in various combinations. Recently, efforts are focused more on understanding the normal bone regenerative process where multiple factors interact in a defined temporal and spatial cascade of events. Bone biology has benefited over the last decade from an explosion of information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying bone formation and resorption, as well as the feedback signals controlling these complex homeostatic mechanisms. New insights in the complexity of the homeostatic mechanisms regulating bone remodeling have uncovered potential therapeutic strategies for bone repair.

### Comparison of the osteogenic potential of osteoSelect demineralized bone matrix putty to novaBone calcium-phosphosilicate synthetic putty in a cranial defect model [^113niA16]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical repair of defects in the skeletal system has proven to be one of the most fruitful endeavors in the field of regenerative medicine. Bony defects originating from trauma, infection, oncologic resections, developmental anomalies, and pathological deterioration are treated with bone grafts in more than 1.5 million Americans every year. The clinical success of these bone grafts is made possible, in part, by the intrinsic capacity of bone to regenerate across a void if an appropriate scaffold is present to support bone ingrowth. These scaffolds include autografts (host-derived bone), allografts (cadaver-derived bone), and various materials of purely synthetic origin or combined with a xenogeneic collagen.

Autogenic bone is currently considered the criterion standard in bone grafting procedures because it contains the 3 elements critical to bone remodeling and repair: osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, and osteogenetic properties. Osteoconductivity is inherent to all types of bone grafts and is best described as a scaffold for cellular attachment and proliferation. Osteoinduction describes the signaling required for cellular differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells into osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a member of the transforming growth factor β family, are signaling proteins present in bone known to be responsible for osteoinductive cellular differentiation. Osteogenesis refers to cellular formation and development of bone through the action of differentiated bone-forming cells. Despite a high degree of efficacy associated with the use of autograft, this approach is subject to important limitations due to supply constraints, donor-site morbidity, increased operating and patient recovery time, incidence of complications, cost associated with harvesting and preparing the material, and, in some applications, anatomical shape of the harvested bone. These limitations have led to the development and increased clinical use of allograft and synthetically derived bone graft substitutes.

### An update on bone substitutes for spinal fusion [^111qJWYM]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

With the current advances in spinal surgery, an understanding of the precise biological mechanism of each bone substitute is necessary for inducing successful spinal fusion. In this review, the categories of bone substitutes include allografts, ceramics, demineralized bone matrix, osteoinductive factors, autogenous platelet concentrate, mesenchymal stem cells, and gene therapy. Further, clinical studies have been evaluated by their levels of evidence in order to elucidate the precise effect of the bone substitute employed and to establish clinical guidance. This article will review both clinical studies based on evidence and basic research in current advances in order to avoid as far as possible any chances of failure in the future and to understand cellular biology in novel technologies.

### Lost in translation: the lack of agreement between surgeons and scientists regarding biomaterials research and innovation for treating bone defects [^114qtW6c]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Regulatory and medico-legal challenges for 3D-printed medical devices for bone defect treatment

On a scale of 0% (disagree) to 100% (strongly agree), participants indicated how much they agreed with the statement that more large animal studies, and in a subsequent question, that more randomized trials are needed before 3D-printed bone scaffolds become routine, standardized clinical use. Participants were also asked to what extent, on a scale of 0 to 100%, they agree that greater clarity is needed regarding the legal and regulatory aspects of the (clinical) use of 3D-printed bone scaffolds.

In the next question, respondents were asked to indicate which medical device laws are currently in place for 3D-printed medical devices in their healthcare system, selecting one of the following five options: (1) None — 3D printing is such a new technology that it has not been regulated; (2) As they are medical products, the usual regulatory regime for medical products will apply; (3) None. 3D-printed products are custom-made and therefore excluded from the current law; (4) The 3D-printed product itself is not subject to the law, but the materials that it is made from must comply with materials standards and have to be cleared be the FDA or another regulatory body; (5) I am not certain/ sure at this time.

Evaluation of what is the most important aspect in deciding to use the new technology

In the following categorical ranking question, participants were asked to rank (1–5) a number of possible responses to the question, "If a new bone regeneration technology was introduced into clinical practice, what would most likely encourage you to switch to this new technology?": (1) Hearing from colleagues that they have successfully performed the procedure; (2) Reading about it in a peer-reviewed medical journal; (3) Seeing that the procedure is now endorsed or recommended by the appropriate surgical society or authority; (4) Witnessing the procedure being performed online or via video link; (5) Witnessing the procedure being performed in person.

### Cranial bone defects: current and future strategies [^113dknay]. Neurosurgical Focus (2010). Low credibility.

Bony defects in the craniomaxillofacial skeleton remain a major and challenging health concern. Surgeons have been trying for centuries to restore functionality and aesthetic appearance using autografts, allografts, and even xenografts without entirely satisfactory results. As a result, physicians, scientists, and engineers have been trying for the past few decades to develop new techniques to improve bone growth and bone healing. In this review, the authors summarize the advantages and limitations of current animal models; describe current materials used as scaffolds, cell-based, and protein-based therapies; and lastly highlight areas for future investigation. The purpose of this review is to highlight the major scaffold-, cell-, and protein-based preclinical tools that are currently being developed to repair cranial defects.

### Mineralized collagen plywood contributes to bone autograft performance [^115FZHhM]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

This work differs from conventional regenerative medicine approaches that use cell-preloaded matrices, as our biomaterials are free of cells and any associated molecular machinery (such as non-collagenous proteins or growth factors). Using sophisticated bone biomaterials was crucial to demonstrate that the mineralized twisted plywood pattern stimulates bone formation and contributes to performance comparable with AB, with the structural aspect complementing the biological and mechanical ones. This result reinforces the role played by physicochemical processes in bone physiology, and promising potential for application in bone replacement while also offering innovative models to investigate the interaction between materials and living tissues.

### Bioresorbability, porosity and mechanical strength of bone substitutes: what is optimal for bone regeneration? [^1134Wo2c]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Bone repair is a multi-dimensional process that requires osteogenic cells, an osteoconductive matrix, osteoinductive signalling, mechanical stability and vascularization. In clinical practice, bone substitute materials are being used for reconstructive purposes, bone stock augmentation, and bone repair. Over the last decade, the use of calcium phosphate (CaP) based bone substitute materials has increased exponentially. These bone substitute materials vary in composition, mechanical strength and biological mechanism of function, each having their own advantages and disadvantages. It is known that intrinsic material properties of CaP bone substitutes have a profound effect on their mechanical and biological behaviour and associated biodegradation. These material properties of bone substitutes, such as porosity, composition and geometry change the trade-off between mechanical and biological performance. The choice of the optimal bone substitutes is therefore not always an easy one, and largely depends on the clinical application and its associated biological and mechanical needs. Not all bone graft substitutes will perform the same way, and their performance in one clinical site may not necessarily predict their performance in another site. CaP bone substitutes unfortunately have yet to achieve optimal mechanical and biological performance and to date each material has its own trade-off between mechanical and biological performance. This review describes the effect of intrinsic material properties on biological performance, mechanical strength and biodegradability of CaP bone substitutes.

### Bone graft and bone graft substitutes in spine surgery: current concepts and controversies [^116j6rsy]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Iliac crest bone graft has long been the standard adjunct used in spine fusion surgery. This graft provides osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive elements that aid in creation of a fusion mass. However, morbidity associated with bone graft harvest has led surgeons to seek other potential adjuncts, including bone morphogenetic proteins, demineralized bone matrix, and graft expanders such as synthetic bone graft and allograft. Knowledge of fusion biology is required to understand the benefits and limitations of these agents, which promote fusion via one of four mechanisms: osteogenesis, osteoinduction, osteoconduction, and osteopromotion. Although bone morphogenetic proteins have shown a clear ability to aid in bone formation and successful fusion, recent concern regarding their safety has tempered enthusiasm regarding their use.

### Treatment of AVN using the induction chamber technique and a biological-based approach: indications and clinical results [^113RsQ2B]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of core decompression (CD) technique combined with recombinant morphogenetic proteins, autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and xenograft bone substitute into the necrotic lesion of the femoral head on clinical symptoms and on the progression of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

Patients and Methods

A total of 38 patients (40 hips) with early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head were studied over a 4-year period.

Results

CD technique combined with recombinant morphogenetic proteins, autologous MSCs and xenograft bone substitute was associated with a significant reduction in both pain and joint symptoms and reduced the incidence of fractural stages. At 36 months, 33 patients achieved clinical and radiographic healing.

Conclusion

This long-term follow-up study confirmed that CD technique combined with recombinant morphogenetic proteins, autologous MSCs and xenograft bone substitute may be an effective treatment for patients with early stage osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

### Bone substitutes: an update [^112H6Lb8]. Injury (2005). Low credibility.

Autograft is considered ideal for grafting procedures, providing osteoinductive growth factors, osteogenic cells, and an osteoconductive scaffold. Limitations, however, exist regarding donor site morbidity and graft availability. Allograft on the other hand, posses the risk of disease transmission. Synthetic graft substitutes lack osteoinductive or osteogenic properties. Composite grafts combine scaffolding properties with biological elements to stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation and eventually osteogenesis. We present here an overview of bone grafts and graft substitutes available for clinical applications.

### Mineralized collagen plywood contributes to bone autograft performance [^111hLta4]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

The osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties, of AB are mainly attributed to its biological characteristics, that is, the presence of progenitor cells, osteoblasts and blood cells, fresh growth factors, pre-existing vascular network, extracellular matrix (ECM) composition including mineralized collagen and an inherent and total immunocompatibility. Additionally, the physical properties of the substrate are now considered crucial for driving the physiological cells phenotype expression, opening a new paradigm for cell–matrix interactions and mechanobiology –. Such a structure–function relationship in bone is also fundamental. Notably, the collagen–mineral composite structure determines the final properties of bone material, which does not solely depend on the mineral quantity, rather on the interactions between the organic and mineral components. These cooperative mechanisms of deformation take place at different length scales, from the intrafibrillar to the tissue organizational level. Despite the recognized importance of microstructure hierarchy in fundamental research, its application in the development of competitive bone grafts tends to be overlooked, with the emphasis placed on achieving bone properties by means of mineral formulation (for example, bioceramics). The organic components in mineral-based scaffolds merely serve as a 'simple' coating to improve cell attachment. However, demineralized bone is a self-standing material (Supplementary Video 1), whereas the mineral counterpart exists as a powder (Extended Data Fig. 1), highlighting the importance of the organic scaffold for bone mechanical properties. Another notable deviation is the degree of crystallization of these alternative materials (highly crystalline hydroxyapatite (HA) versus bioapatite). Various experimental methodologies are used to decipher both biological and mechanical aspects involved in this complex physiological process, increasingly supplemented by computational modelling. However, synthetic bone materials still markedly differ from the native tissue, as they fail to integrate both the bone composition and its microstructure simultaneously.

### The use of bone graft substitutes in large cancellous voids: any specific needs? [^115QVqMc]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Bone graft is the second most common transplantation tissue, with blood being by far the commonest. Autograft is considered ideal for grafting procedures, providing osteoinductive growth factors, osteogenic cells and an osteoconductive scaffold. Limitations, however, exist regarding donor site morbidity and graft availability. Allograft on the other hand poses the risk of disease transmission. Synthetic graft substitutes lack osteoinductive or osteogenic properties. Composite grafts combine scaffolding properties with biological elements to stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation and eventually osteogenesis. We present here an overview of bone graft substitutes available for clinical application in large cancellous voids.

### Bone grafting [^1177aBsQ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

In recent years our understanding of spinal fusion biology has improved. This includes the continued elucidation of the step-by-step cellular and molecular events involved in the prototypic bone induction cascade, as well as the identification and characterization of the various critical growth factors governing the process of bone formation and bone graft incorporation. Based on these fundamental principles, growth factor technology has been exploited in an attempt to improve rates of spinal fusion, and promising results have been realized in preclinical animal studies and initial clinical human studies. In this article the authors review the recent advances in the biology of bone fusion and provide a perspective on the future of spinal fusion, a future that will very likely include increased graft fusion rates and improved patient outcome as a result of the successful translation of fundamental bone fusion principles to the bedside.

### Application of scaffolds for bone regeneration strategies: current trends and future directions [^111A4B2s]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Scaffolds are extensively used in surgery to replace missing bone and to achieve bony union and fusion. An ideal scaffold should not only maintain, induce, and restore biological functions where cells, extracellular matrix, and growth factors are needed, but also have the right properties with respect to degradation, cell binding, cellular uptake, non-immunogenicity, mechanical strength, and flexibility. Here we examine both the basic science behind the development of scaffolds and comprehensively and systematically review the clinical applications.

### Xenograft bone inclusion improves incorporation of hydroxyapatite cement into cancellous defects [^111JBnci]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hydroxyapatite cement (HAC) is biocompatible and osteoconductive, but its slow resorption limits new bone formation. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of adding partially demineralized xenograft cortical bone in an established animal model.

Methods

Eight 6-month-old female New Zealand white rabbits were used. Drill-hole defects (8.0 mm long, 5.0 mm diameter) were prepared and filled with either HAC alone or HAC mixed with processed xenograft bone particles from young pigs (XBC) at a volumetric ratio of approximately 25%. The particles were approximately 5 mm long and 1 mm diameter and were extensively washed, demineralized in dilute hydrochloric acid, and rewashed. Microcomputed tomography scanning and histology were performed after 10 weeks. New bone and inflammatory/immune response were graded on a 0 to 3 scale and calcein labeling was quantified as percent area new bone. Statistical analyses were by Student's t tests.

Results

XBC showed significantly more new bone formation than HAC throughout the defect (P < 0.05). XBC also showed significantly more inflammatory/immune response than HAC (P < 0.05). The three-dimensional microcomputed tomography reconstructions showed that the HAC was basically inert, whereas the XBC took on an appearance suggestive of more extensive incorporation.

Conclusions

Adding xenograft to HAC creates a bioactive composite that is more rapidly incorporated, resorbed, and replaced by new bone. The presence of processed xenograft particles creates a vigorous inflammatory response, but there may be some benefit to the resorption rate of the HAC as a result of the infiltration of cells. Future research should focus on the longer-term incorporation and remodeling of XBC.

### Autologous bone graft: properties and techniques [^114RHVQC]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2010). Low credibility.

Bone grafting is involved in virtually every procedure in reconstructive orthopaedic surgery. Although autologous bone grafts have excellent biologic and mechanical properties, considerable donor site morbidity and the limited volume available must be taken into consideration. Currently, there are no heterologous or synthetic bone substitutes available that have superior biologic or mechanical properties. This review article summarizes the biologic and mechanical properties of autologous bone grafts, differentiates various autologous bone graft types, and compares them with other bone substitutes.

### Lost in translation: the lack of agreement between surgeons and scientists regarding biomaterials research and innovation for treating bone defects [^111KQrPz]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

According to the authors, the different assessments of surgeons and scientists regarding the significance of autologous bone grafts and bone substitute products are also of particular economic and strategic relevance. When asked, for example, whether autologous bone grafts will be replaced by bone substitutes in the future, surgeons were on average 16.9% more likely to deem that this will not be the case. This finding is highly relevant for academic institutions and especially for industry. This means that it may make strategic sense to improve the harvesting of autologous bone grafts to achieve less harvesting morbidity on the one hand and higher quality bone grafts on the other. This is also consistent with recent literature highlighting the need for new technology to replace the current gold standard for harvesting larger volumes of autologous bone graft. According to the authors, a further impetus of the present study is that surgeons were, on average, 13.9% less likely to agree that the current development of bone graft substitutes is promising. This is also reflected in the current literature, which clarifies that no ideal bone substitute product has yet been developed. Significant costs of up to USD 150 million and a development phase of 6–8 years are incurred per product, which are invested in relevant cases without being implemented in clinical practice. For future efforts by the medical technology industry regarding research into new bone graft harvesting devices and the development and manufacturing of bone replacement products, it can be summarized that significant development costs could be saved through closer collaboration between surgeons and scientists, moderated by the respective manufacturing companies at the earliest possible product development phase. Moreover, translational research encompasses the iterative process wherein not only do basic scientific findings influence clinical applications, but clinical needs and observations also shape the focus of basic research. Hence why the classification into so-called "Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)" serves to objectively evaluate the maturity of a new technology across its development phases leading up to market launch (Fig. 6).

### Bioactive and osteoinductive bone graft substitutes: definitions, facts and myths [^113fnemW]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

The use of artificial bone grafts has been developed over recent years and is expected to increase further, for some indications even replacing the gold standard, autograft, in trauma and reconstructive surgery. However, the effectiveness of these materials is still a subject of debate, mostly because of unclear definitions or limited market surveillance. In this overview several facts and myths regarding bone-graft substitutes are summarized.

### Autogenous platelet-rich plasma in combination with bovine-derived hydroxyapatite xenograft for treatment of a cystic lesion of the jaw [^113S8782]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

In the last 5 years, many studies about autogenous platelet-rich plasma have been undertaken pointing out its regenerative and reparative properties on tissues. The features of this product are an attribute of platelet cells, which, after cellular interactions, release growth factors. These molecules promote tissue healing and also induce cellular regeneration. Bone is a dynamic tissue subject to balanced processes of bony formation and reabsorption; autologous platelet gel or concentrate (PRP) can be used alone or in association with bony graft for the treatment of bony defect, cystic lesions, alveolar bone defects, and periodontal pockets. Its application fields are oral and maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, and general surgery, and it can be applied particularly in patients with coagulation diseases. In our experience, a giant cystic lesion of the jaw was treated with PRP and granules of bovine-derived hydroxyapatite xenograft to enhance bony regeneration and promote tissue healing.

### Bone morphogenetic protein signaling enhances invasion and bone metastasis of breast cancer cells through smad pathway [^1147mvjP]. Oncogene (2008). Low credibility.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is known to promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Although bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the TGF-beta family, are expressed in a variety of human carcinoma cell lines, their roles in tumor progression have not been fully clarified. In this study, we sought to determine the roles of BMPs in the progression of breast cancer bone metastasis using human breast cancer samples and a mouse xenograft model. Immunohistochemical analysis of samples from breast cancer patients as well as a mouse xenograft model of MDA-231-D, highly metastatic human breast cancer cells, revealed phospho-Smad2 and phospho-Smad1/5/8 staining in the nuclei of cancer cells in primary tumor and/or bone metastasis. Using a functional in vivo bioluminescence imaging system, we showed that TGF-beta- and BMP-induced transcriptional pathways are active in bone metastatic lesions in vivo. In addition, both TGF-beta3 and BMP-2 promoted the motility and invasiveness of the MDA-231-D cells in vitro. Moreover, expression of dominant-negative receptors for TGF-beta and/or BMPs in the MDA-231-D cells inhibited invasiveness in vitro and bone metastasis in the xenograft model. These results suggest that BMPs as well as TGF-beta promote invasion and bone metastasis of breast cancer.

Augmentation of acute complete Achilles repair — Statement 7 asserts that augmentation with autograft, allograft, and xenograft implants is not recommended, but the panel judged this statement inappropriate; the text notes inadequate evidence to recommend routine use, including a prospective randomized trial of 60 patients comparing end-to-end repair with a gastrocnemius-turn down flap augmentation that found no advantage at 3- and 12-month intervals and a 12–14 years follow-up study, mixed case-series results (7 patients with synthetic material and 9 patients with human acellular dermal matrix reported satisfactory outcomes), a report of long-term inflammatory response 11 years after synthetic graft implantation, and a review of 14 cases using allograft with satisfactory results, with a meta-analysis reporting no improvement in patient satisfaction, rerupture rate, or infection rate and no high-level evidence that these tissues improve outcomes.

### Nonallograft osteoconductive bone graft substitutes [^116KAvee]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2002). Low credibility.

An estimated 500,000 to 600,000 bone grafting procedures are done annually in the United States. Approximately (1/2) of these surgeries involve spinal arthrodesis whereas 35% to 40% are used for general orthopaedic applications. Synthetic bone graft substitutes currently represent only 10% of the bone graft market, but their share is increasing as experience and confidence in their use are accrued. Despite 15 to 20 years of clinical experience with various synthetic substitutes, there have been few welldesigned, controlled clinical trials of these implants. Synthetic bone graft substitutes consist of hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, or a combination of these minerals. Their fabrication technique, crystallinity, pore dimensions, mechanical properties, and resorption rate vary. All synthetic porous substitutes share numerous advantages over autografts and allografts including their unlimited supply, easy sterilization, and storage. However, the degree to which the substitute provides an osteoconductive structural framework or matrix for new bone ingrowth differs among implants. Disadvantages of ceramic implants include brittle handling properties, variable rates of resorption, poor performance in diaphyseal defects, and potentially adverse effects on normal bone remodeling. These inherent weaknesses have refocused their primary use to bone graft extenders and carriers for pharmaceuticals. The composition, histologic features, indications, and clinical experience of several of the synthetic bone graft substitutes approved for orthopaedic use in the United States are reviewed.

### Evaluation of osteogenic / chondrogenic cellular proliferation and differentiation in the xenogeneic periosteal graft [^1145D4wC]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

To determine whether grafted young periosteum can induce new bone formation in elderly patients, this preliminary study evaluated cell proliferation and differentiation in xenogeneic periosteal grafts in old rats radiographically, histologically, and immunohistochemically. Periosteum harvested from the tibia of young Japanese white rabbits were grafted into old Sprague-Dawley rats with or without administration of 1.0 mg per kilogram per day immunosuppressant FK506. Autogenous old periosteal tissue grafts were also evaluated as a control. Grafted tissue was extirpated after 7, 14, 21, and 45 days. In the xenogeneic group, proliferative cell nuclear antigen-positive cells were observed 7 days after surgery, which differentiated into chondroblasts with bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression and finally formed cartilage by 14 days. Endochondral ossification was observed at 21 days, and bone replacement was completed by 45 days. No osteogenic cell activity was observed in the two other groups. Xenogeneic young periosteum thus maintained its osteogenic/chondrogenic potentiality in older rats.

### The choice between allograft or demineralized bone matrix is not unambiguous in trauma surgery [^115DCUEQ]. Injury (2021). Medium credibility.

In fracture surgery, large bone defects and non-unions often require bone transplantation, and alternatives to autograft bone substitutes in the form of allografts from bone banks and the derivate demineralised bone matrix (DBM) are widely used. With a focus on efficacy, clinical evidence, safety, cost, and patient acceptance, this review evaluated the difference between allogeneic allograft or DBM as a bone substitute in trauma surgery. The efficacy in supporting bone healing from allograft and DBM is highly influenced by donor characteristics and graft processing. Mechanical stability is achieved from a structural graft. Based on the existing literature it is difficult to identify where DBM is useful in trauma surgery, and the level of evidence for the relevant use of allograft bone in trauma is low. The risk of transmitting diseases is negligible, and the lowest risk is from DBM due to the extensive processing procedures. A cost comparison showed that DBM is significantly more expensive. The experiences of dental patients have shown that many patients do not want to receive allografts as a bone substitute. It is not possible to definitively conclude whether it makes a difference if allograft or DBM is used in trauma surgery. It is ultimately the surgeon's individual choice, but this article may be useful in providing considerations before a decision is made.

### Bone morphogenetic proteins: a realistic alternative to bone grafting for alveolar reconstruction [^1144DqRE]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Preclinical studies have shown that rhBMP-2 induces normal physiologic bone in clinically relevant defects in the craniofacial skeleton. The newly formed bone assumes characteristics of the adjacent resident bone and allows placement, osseointegration/re-osseointegration, and functional loading of endosseous implants. Clinical studies optimizing dose, delivery technologies, and conditions for stimulation of bone growth will bring about a new era in dentistry. The ability to predictably promote osteogenesis through the use of bone morphogenetic protein technologies is not far from becoming a clinical reality and will have an astounding effect on how dentistry is practiced.

### Mineralized collagen plywood contributes to bone autograft performance [^113WSNfN]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Autologous bone (AB) is the gold standard for bone-replacement surgeries 1, despite its limited availability and the need for an extra surgical site. Traditionally, competitive biomaterials for bone repair have focused on mimicking the mineral aspect of bone, as evidenced by the widespread clinical use of bioactive ceramics 2. However, AB also exhibits hierarchical organic structures that might substantially affect bone regeneration. Here, using a range of cell-free biomimetic-collagen-based materials in murine and ovine bone-defect models, we demonstrate that a hierarchical hybrid microstructure-specifically, the twisted plywood pattern of collagen and its association with poorly crystallized bioapatite-favourably influences bone regeneration. Our study shows that the most structurally biomimetic material has the potential to stimulate bone growth, highlighting the pivotal role of physicochemical properties in supporting bone formation and offering promising prospects as a competitive bone-graft material.

The presence of hypertrophic ES cells accompanies bone colonization

In addition to the overall increased frequency of enlarged cells in hypoxic ES xenografts, we observed their accumulation in areas of local bone invasion in control tumors (Fig. 3). This was found in SK-ES-1 and TC32 xenografts, both of which have a high ability to invade bone. ES cells located in the invaded niches within bone were positive for the ES marker, CD99, and a hypoxia marker, carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) (Figs. 3a and S 4a). In addition, these cells had enlarged nuclei, as compared to the cells in the main tumor mass outside of the bone (Fig. 3b). FISH with CDKNA2/CEN3/7/17 probes performed on tumor tissues from TC32 and SK-ES-1 xenografts revealed frequent chromosome gains in these cells (Fig. 3c). Collectively, this data suggests that the hypoxia that developed in areas of bone invasion triggered polyploidy. TC71 primary tumors have a low ability to invade bone tissue locally. However, within the TC71 FAL group, xenografts that gained the capacity to form distant bone metastases exhibited a higher prevalence of cells with enlarged nuclei, as compared to tumors that did not target bone (Figs. 3d and S 4b, c), indicating an association between the degree of hypoxia-induced polyploidy and osseous dissemination.

### Critical-size defect augmentation using sintered and non-sintered bovine bone matrix-an experimental controlled study in minipigs [^114s4Frh]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Xenogeneic bone substitute materials are often used for augmentation of larger bone defects. Purification methods for these materials vary, mainly in terms of temperature. The aim of this study was to determine in vivo how sintering affects quantitative and qualitative bone regeneration of 2 bovine augmentation materials.

Methods

A total of 56 critical size defects were set at the frontal bone of 14 domestic pigs (4 each) and filled randomly with either bovine, sintered hydroxyapatite (BO), bovine, non-sintered hydroxyapatite (BOS), local autologous bone (AB) or left empty. All defects were additionally covered with a collagen membrane. Specimens were harvested after 4 and 8 weeks and were evaluated histologically and histomorphometrically.

Results

Histologically new bone could be seen in every group. Significantly highest new bone formation was found in AB. No significant difference could be detected between BO and BOS.

Conclusions

According to the results of this study, sintered bone substitute material remains histologically distinguishable but does not affect quantitative and qualitative bone regeneration.

### Tissue engineering approaches for bone repair: concepts and evidence [^113ztZNt]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Over the last decades, the medical world has advanced dramatically in the understanding of fracture repair. The three components needed for fracture healing are osteoconduction, osteoinduction and osteogenesis. With newly designed scaffolds, ex vivo produced growth factors and isolated stem cells, most of the challenges of critical size bone defects have been resolved in vitro, and in some cases in animal models as well. However, there are still challenges needed to be overcome before these technologies can be fully converted from the bench to the bedside. These technological and biological advancements need to be converted to mass production of affordable products that can be used in every part of the world. Vascularity, full substation of scaffolds by native bone, and bio-safety are the three most critical steps to be challenged before reaching the clinical setting.

### Clinical outcomes after cranioplasty with titanium mesh, polyetheretherketone, or composite bone cement: a retrospective study [^112srGXx]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Cranial defects are a common neurosurgical condition and may be caused by multiple mechanisms necessitating craniectomy, such as severe traumatic brain injury, intracranial hematoma, and intracranial tumors. – Cranial defects cause not only irreversible damage to the neurological function and cognition of patients but also self-image issues. Therefore, cranioplasty has become a common procedure for patients with cranial defects. Cranial reconstruction can not only restore the esthetic contour of the skull to meet the psychological needs of patients, but also alleviate trephine syndrome, protect brain function, relieve abnormal cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and restore intracranial pressure adaptations. – However, many factors such as the timing of surgical intervention, choice of different materials, and area of the calvarial defect can affect the treatment outcomes of cranioplasty and the occurrence of postoperative complications.

At the time of this writing, one of the most debated factors is the choice of cranioplasty material. Biological compatibility should be considered when selecting materials, and there must be sufficient strength, stiffness, and durability that can protect brain function and restore skull shape and hair growth patterns. In the past, the most commonly used material for patients was autogenous bone; however, it carries an extremely high risk of infection and bone resorption, which in turn leads to the failure of cranioplasty and the need for revision surgery. Titanium mesh (Ti), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), composite bone cement (CBC; main components: hydroxyapatite particles, polymethyl methacrylate, and medical resin), and other xenograft materials have been used to address this issue. For example, a randomized controlled trial in Australia showed that patients using Ti were less likely to undergo a second operation than those using autologous cranioplasty, and another study reported similar results. However, the optimal material for cranioplasty remains controversial.

Although various studies have compared 2 types of cranioplasty materials, a simultaneous comparison of the 3 heterogeneous materials included in this study is still lacking. Therefore, this retrospective study analyzed differences in complications and long-term results after cranioplasty using Ti, PEEK, and CBC. The results of this retrospective chart review provide clinicians with relevant findings to their clinical practice and directions for clinical treatment.

### Island osteoperiosteal flaps with interpositional bone grafting in rabbit tibia: preliminary study for development of new bone augmentation technique [^112E4hoT]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Loss of alveolar vertical height is one of the most challenging conditions in the field of implantology. A few augmentation techniques have been proposed to address this challenge, including guided bone regeneration, alveolar distraction osteogenesis, sandwich osteotomies and autogenous block grafting. This is a pre-clinical study of lengthening the alveolar bone height using a thin osteoperiosteal bone flap, the "island bone flap" or i-flap, to establish vitality, stability and incorporation of the augmentation material after healing.

Materials and Methods

A rabbit tibia model was designed for this study and included 8 rabbits. An osteoperiosteal osteotomy was performed through the periosteum cutting 1 mm of the outer cortex of the bone in order to elevate a bone flap. The bone flap was detached, and remained attached to the periosteum as a free floating osteoperiosteal flap, and the resultant defect was filled with xenograft.

Results

The histological analysis demonstrates formation of maturing trabeculae in the site of the i-flap. In cases of trauma to the bone marrow during the surgical procedure, a centripetal gradient of bone remodeling from the surgical site toward the periphery was evident, while the bony component of the i-flap maintained vital.

Conclusions

Creating a free floating osteoperiosteal flap, used here with interpositional grafting in a rabbit tibia, appears to heal by both appositional modeling and creeping substitution remodeling. Volumetric augmentation persisted despite exuberant bone turnover in this animal model. This technique holds promise as a possible augmentation bone grafting approach for use in alveolar reconstruction.

### Promises and pitfalls of stem cell therapy for promotion of bone healing [^114X19ob]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

There is promise in combining stem cells with allogeneic bone matrix to promote bone healing. Murine bone marrow, peripheral blood, and compact bone cells were transplanted ectopically under the kidney capsule in mice, alone or in combination with allogeneic matrix products: powder and putty to determine their bone forming potential in comparison to transplanted femoral bone fragments and long-term cultured bone marrow cells. The end point was the amount of bone formed as determined by quantitative histology. Mononuclear cells from marrow, peripheral blood, or bone alone transplanted under the kidney capsule did not form bone. Mononuclear cell populations did not combine readily with matrix products and there was in vivo migration of the transplanted combinations. Kidney subcapsular transplanted cultured bone marrow cells formed bone in proportion to the culture period, but after 9 weeks, the extent was only 20% by area of that of similarly transplanted femoral bone fragments. An inductive stimulus for bone formation seemed necessary. Osteoprogenitor cells were not detected in significant numbers in blood unless high doses of cytokines were administered. A better definition of the optimal cell populations and manipulations required for promotion of bone healing is needed along with new (transplant) models that allow for cell tracking. Much work remains to overcome current pitfalls in the use of stem cells to promote allograft integration and bone healing.

### Bone grafts and their substitutes [^113Xttc8]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The continual cycle of bone formation and resorption is carried out by osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts under the direction of the bone-signaling pathway. In certain situations the host cycle of bone repair is insufficient and requires the assistance of bone grafts and their substitutes. The fundamental properties of a bone graft are osteoconduction, osteoinduction, osteogenesis, and structural support. Options for bone grafting include autogenous and allograft bone and the various isolated or combined substitutes of calcium sulphate, calcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, and coralline hydroxyapatite. Not all bone grafts will have the same properties. As a result, understanding the requirements of the clinical situation and specific properties of the various types of bone grafts is necessary to identify the ideal graft. We present a review of the bone repair process and properties of bone grafts and their substitutes to help guide the clinician in the decision making process.

### Potential of an ultraporous β-tricalcium phosphate synthetic cancellous bone void filler and bone marrow aspirate composite graft [^116DjhhG]. European Spine Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Autogenous cancellous bone is considered to be the best bone grafting material. Autogenous bone grafts provide scaffolding for osteoconduction, growth factors for osteoinduction, and progenitor stem cells for osteogenesis. However, the procurement morbidity, limited availability, and expense associated with the use of autogenous bone grafts are significant disadvantages. Allografts and xenografts lack the osteoinduction and osteogenesis properties of autogenous bone, and they introduce the potential for both transferring disease and triggering a host immune response. Synthetic bone grafts [hydroxyapatite or tricalcium phosphate (TCP)], while good platforms for osteoconduction, lack any intrinsic properties of osteoinduction and osteogenesis. A composite graft that combines synthetic scaffold with autogenous osteoprogenitor cells from bone marrow aspirate (BMA), a low-morbidity procedure, could potentially deliver the advantages of autogenous bone grafts without the disadvantages. A new ultraporous beta-TCP construct, engineered using solution-derived nano-particle technology, may prove to be an ideal carrier for BMA in such a composite. The unique, interconnected macroporosity, mesoporosity, and microporosity of this synthetic cancellous bone void filler allows it to wick in cells and nutrients via enhanced capillarity. Preliminary canine data support this expectation, demonstrating bone formation that suggests good penetration of cells and nutrients. These results suggest that BMA cells, absorbed into such a scaffold, may remain viable, thereby potentially making such a composite a true synthetic replacement for autogenous cancellous bone.

### Downregulation of CXCL12 in mesenchymal stromal cells by TGF β promotes breast cancer metastasis [^115pjjRt]. Oncogene (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Studies of the interactions between tumour cells and the tumour stroma in regulating tumour metastasis have been the subject of intense investigations. Many types of cells, such as immune cells, endothelial progenitor cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), are recruited to the stroma of developing tumours. MSCs are pluripotent stem cells, and are well known for their ability to maintain tissue homeostasis and regenerate the damaged tissue by sensing signals released from the injured tissue. These mechanisms also appear to operate in tumours, consistent with the concept that a tumour resembles a wound that does not heal. Experimental evidence has shown that the direct effects of MSCs on tumour cells can enhance tumour metastasis. Thus, the metastatic phenotype of tumour cells is not only dependent on autonomous changes in tumour cells, but is also influenced by tumour stroma cells in tumour microenvironment. The complexity of MSCs in regulating different types of tumour development, such as breast cancer, was associated with their ability to secrete plentiful growth factors that support tumour growth and angiogenesis, as well as their role in moulding the tumour immune microenvironment by facilitating monocyte and macrophage infiltration, and suppressing anti-tumour T-cell activity. However, the functions of MSCs in breast cancer metastasis have not been fully elucidated.

Investigations on MSCs within the stroma of breast cancer xenografts showed that MSCs can enhance the xenograft metastatic ability to the lungs and the bones. The contributions of MSCs to breast cancer metastasis are mostly mediated through their ability to produce a number of factors, such as CCL5, CXCL12, which in turn exert paracrine actions on breast cancer cells that resulted in their invasion and/or distant organ metastasis. Among them, CXCL12 has been widely investigated in breast cancer metastasis. Beside its role in supporting tumour growth and angiogenesis, CXCL12 was demonstrated to be important in helping select metastatic tumour cells for bone metastasis. More interestingly, breast cancer cells with high expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7, the chemokine receptors for CXCL12, are apt to migrate to the distant sites where CXCL12 is highly expressed. Systemically blocking CXCR4 with specific antagonists can impair metastasis of breast tumour cells to the lung. However, the role of CXCL12 produced by MSCs in tumour metastasis remains unclear.

### Is there a role of coral bone substitutes in bone repair? [^116H5dcs]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Xenogeneic bone graft materials are an alternative to autologous bone grafting. Among such implants, coralline-derived bone grafts substitutes have a long track record as safe, biocompatible and osteoconductive graft materials. In this review, we present the available literature surrounding their use with special focus on the commercially available graft materials. Corals thanks to their chemical and structural characteristics similar to those of the human cancellous bone have shown great potential but clinical data presented to date is ambiguous with both positive and negative outcomes reported. Correct formulation and design of the graft to ensure adequate osteo-activity and resorption appear intrinsic to a successful outcome.

### MiR-30–5p functions as a tumor suppressor and novel therapeutic tool by targeting the oncogenic wnt / β-catenin / BCL9 pathway [^114TDvMa]. Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

Wnt/β-catenin signaling underlies the pathogenesis of a broad range of human cancers, including the deadly plasma cell cancer multiple myeloma. In this study, we report that downregulation of the tumor suppressor microRNA miR-30–5p is a frequent pathogenetic event in multiple myeloma. Evidence was developed that miR-30–5p downregulation occurs as a result of interaction between multiple myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells, which in turn enhances expression of BCL9, a transcriptional coactivator of the Wnt signaling pathway known to promote multiple myeloma cell proliferation, survival, migration, drug resistance, and formation of multiple myeloma cancer stem cells. The potential for clinical translation of strategies to re-express miR-30–5p as a therapeutic approach was further encouraged by the capacity of miR-30c and miR-30 mix to reduce tumor burden and metastatic potential in vivo in three murine xenograft models of human multiple myeloma without adversely affecting associated bone disease. Together, our findings offer a preclinical rationale to explore miR-30–5p delivery as an effective therapeutic strategy to eradicate multiple myeloma cells in vivo.

Bone tissue engineering to treat bone fractures

A number of different approaches have been taken to promote bone repair, including the local application of osteogenic bone marrow-derived cells, transplantations using autografts and allografts. gene therapies, and the use of biomaterials, (Table 1). The standard method for bone repair is the implantation of autogenous bone, which is transferred from one site to another in the same patient. However, this method is subject to considerable limitations, such as graft resorption, donor site morbidity, limited availability, and the operative time for harvesting grafts. Alternatives to autografts, such as allografts and xenografts to treat bone defects, have become available. However, both of these alternatives are rarely used owing to their high costs, possibility of disease transmission, lack of osteoinduction, and immunogenesis. Immune engineering has been used to alter the immune system to boost bone repair and regeneration after bone fracture or injury. A bone fracture attracts an abundance of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in addition to promoting the differentiation of MSCs. These factors play a critical role in bone remodeling as a result of the formation and resorption of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. A healing bone fracture can, however, be impaired by aberrant inflammation and autoimmune disorders that suppress osteogenesis. Hydrogels, which comprise a group of polymeric materials, have been reported to promote bone tissue regeneration as a result of their ability to mimic the extracellular matrix topography and deliver bioactive agents. Nevertheless, the use of hydrogels suffers from difficulty in controlling the release of encapsulated bioactive molecules, and these compounds have also resulted in toxic reactions due to the use of inappropriate polymers. Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) have become one of the mainstays of current cell-based therapies. For example, experimental findings and clinical cases indicate that BM-MSCs, owing to their osteogenic potential, can be transplanted to repair bone defects. Moreover, the treatment of BM-MSCs with epigenetic modulators, such as agents that decrease genomic DNA methylation, has been reported to promote osteogenic differentiation and enhance osteogenic gene expression. However, the use of epigenetic modulators in clinical application for bone regeneration is restricted in elderly people due to the limited yield and expandability of BM-MSCs, and the ability of these cells to differentiate into osteoblasts. At present, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been recognized for their ability to differentiate into a range of different cell types that can be used in bone tissue engineering. Human iPSCs, for instance, have been differentiated toward bone fate, expressing osteogenic markers, such as RNUX2, OSX, OCN, BSP, and Col1a1. Furthermore, the in vivo transplantation of iPSC-derived osteoblasts has been reported to lead to mineralization and the formation of bone matrix. Thus, stem cell-based therapies have the potential to be applied in the treatment of bone defects. However, stem cell-based therapies suffer from several limitations, including time-consuming procedures, ethical and safety concerns related to their transplantation into humans, immunological rejection responses, and possibility of teratoma formation –.

### Hypoxia-activated neuropeptide Y / Y5 receptor / rhoA pathway triggers chromosomal instability and bone metastasis in ewing sarcoma [^111wDwKV]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Primary tumors arising from all tested cell fractions had similar growth rates (Fig. S 5a). However, HYP~4n xenografts presented with a more aggressive phenotype, as compared to control SK-ES-1 tumors. Cells isolated from HYP~4n primary tumors and metastases exhibited signs of CIN, which was indicated by increased DNA content, variable nuclear size and chromosome number alterations (Fig. 4d, e). Mice bearing HYP~4n xenografts had an increased number of total metastases caused by the higher frequency of bone lesions, while extra-osseous metastases remained unchanged (Fig. 4f). Bone was the main metastatic site of HYP~4n xenografts (87.5% of metastases), with multiple bone lesions per animal (Fig. 4g–i). This phenotype resembled the metastatic pattern of FAL-treated mice. No bone metastases were detected in mice with NOR-2n and NOR~4n xenografts (Fig. 4g, h). Aside from their capability to disseminate to bone, HYP~4n cells were resistant to doxorubicin, suggesting a role for polyploidy in the failure of chemotherapy in patients with bone metastasis (Fig. S 5b, c).

### The biology of bone grafting [^113W5fm9]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Many approaches are used to repair skeletal defects in reconstructive orthopaedic surgery, and bone grafting is involved in virtually every procedure. The type of bone graft used depends on the clinical scenario and the anticipated final outcome. Autogenous cancellous bone graft, with its osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive properties, remains the standard for grafting. However, the high incidence of morbidity during autogenous graft harvest may make the acquisition of grafts from other sources desirable. The clinical applications for each type of bone graft are dictated by the structure and biochemical properties of the graft. An elegant cellular and molecular cascade follows bone transplantation. Bone graft incorporation within the host, whether autogenous or allogeneic, depends on many factors: type of graft (autogenous versus allogeneic, vascular versus nonvascular), site of transplant, quality of transplanted bone and host bone, host bed preparation, preservation techniques, systemic and local disease, and mechanical properties of the graft.

### Vascularized bone allotransplantation: current state and implications for future reconstructive surgery [^1135dLRD]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

This article focuses on current advances in musculoskeletal tissue allotransplantation, including strategies for maintaining tissue viability in the face of histocompatibility mismatch and resulting acute and chronic rejection responses. In particular, it introduces a novel concept developed in the authors' laboratory and currently under evaluation that may obviate the problem of chronic rejection. The authors have used therapeutic angiogenesis to develop a host-derived neoangiogenic circulation that maintains blood flow regardless of rejection. The replacement of the allogeneic vessels together with bone remodeling from host-derived cells eventually may largely replace the allogeneic osteocytes and bone with native bone.

### Mineralized collagen plywood contributes to bone autograft performance [^1175W8G2]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Autologous bone (AB) is the gold standard for bone-replacement surgeries, despite its limited availability and the need for an extra surgical site. Traditionally, competitive biomaterials for bone repair have focused on mimicking the mineral aspect of bone, as evidenced by the widespread clinical use of bioactive ceramics. However, AB also exhibits hierarchical organic structures that might substantially affect bone regeneration. Here, using a range of cell-free biomimetic-collagen-based materials in murine and ovine bone-defect models, we demonstrate that a hierarchical hybrid microstructure — specifically, the twisted plywood pattern of collagen and its association with poorly crystallized bioapatite — favourably influences bone regeneration. Our study shows that the most structurally biomimetic material has the potential to stimulate bone growth, highlighting the pivotal role of physicochemical properties in supporting bone formation and offering promising prospects as a competitive bone-graft material.

In line with our findings, there is uncertainty surrounding how recent advances in 3D printing in healthcare will affect standard patient care. Some authors claim that 3D printing will revolutionize healthcare, while others argue that caution is warranted as there is little rigorous testing and long-term data on customized 3D-printed products. Indeed, to date, there is no specifically dedicated legal framework for 3D printing medical devices and implants in any jurisdiction. This does not mean that 3D-printed medical devices are unregulated, as the regulations for medical devices are technology-independent, meaning they do not differentiate according to how a product is manufactured. Therefore, the comprehensive existing regulations for medical devices are, in principle, also applicable to 3D-printed medical devices. In the USA, for example, the clinical use of 3D-printed orthopaedic devices is undoubtedly increasing, and the FDA strictly regulates the companies and their products. Therefore, more properly conducted preclinical and clinical studies with sufficiently large sample sizes are needed, particularly in the case of bioresorbable scaffolds for the treatment of large bone defects, before claims of therapeutic efficacy can be accepted and requirements of regulatory authorities for its routine clinical implementation are fulfilled. These findings are also reflected in the results of the present survey study. Both surgeons and scientists consider the need for preclinical (large) animal studies and clinical studies to be very great before 3D-printed scaffolds can be used regularly for bone regeneration.

### Bone regeneration: current concepts and future directions [^111cYaXw]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Bone regeneration is a complex, well-orchestrated physiological process of bone formation, which can be seen during normal fracture healing, and is involved in continuous remodelling throughout adult life. However, there are complex clinical conditions in which bone regeneration is required in large quantity, such as for skeletal reconstruction of large bone defects created by trauma, infection, tumour resection and skeletal abnormalities, or cases in which the regenerative process is compromised, including avascular necrosis, atrophic non-unions and osteoporosis. Currently, there is a plethora of different strategies to augment the impaired or 'insufficient' bone-regeneration process, including the 'gold standard' autologous bone graft, free fibula vascularised graft, allograft implantation, and use of growth factors, osteoconductive scaffolds, osteoprogenitor cells and distraction osteogenesis. Improved 'local' strategies in terms of tissue engineering and gene therapy, or even 'systemic' enhancement of bone repair, are under intense investigation, in an effort to overcome the limitations of the current methods, to produce bone-graft substitutes with biomechanical properties that are as identical to normal bone as possible, to accelerate the overall regeneration process, or even to address systemic conditions, such as skeletal disorders and osteoporosis.

### Bone health management after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an expert panel opinion from the American society for transplantation and cellular therapy [^117Db2KA]. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy expert panel opinion — bone health after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) states that bone health disturbances commonly occur after HCT, with loss of bone mineral density (BMD) and avascular necrosis (AVN) foremost; BMD loss is related to pretransplantation chemotherapy and radiation exposure and immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and results from deficiencies in growth or gonadal hormones, disturbances in calcium and vitamin D homeostasis, as well as osteoblast and osteoclast dysfunction. Although the pathophysiology of AVN remains unclear, high-dose glucocorticoid exposure is the most frequent association, and HCT survivors comprise a distinct population with unique comorbidities, making general approaches to bone health management inappropriate in some cases. To address a core set of 16 frequently asked questions (FAQs), the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Committee on Practice Guidelines convened a panel, noting that owing to a lack of relevant prospective controlled clinical trials specifically addressing bone health in HCT, the answers rely on evidence derived from retrospective HCT studies, results extrapolated from prospective studies in non–HCT settings, relevant societal guidelines, and expert panel opinion, and that answers to FAQs in this article should be considered general recommendations, with good medical practice and judgment ultimately dictating care of individual patients.

### An unexpected outcome during testing of commercially available demineralized bone graft materials: how safe are the nonallograft components? [^111vfwC1]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

Radiographic and histologic analyses of commercially available bone graft materials were performed.

Objective

To compare the osteoinductive efficacy of commercially available demineralized bone matrix material.

Summary Of Background Data

The relative in vivo bone formation and toxicology of the nonallograft components the make up various commercially available demineralized bone matrix products are not known.

Methods

An in vivo bone formation model was used in 30 athymic rats. Six different bone grafting materials were tested in subcutaneous and intermuscular locations. After 4 weeks, radiographic and histologic testing of bone formation was performed.

Results

Eight of nine rats implanted with Grafton demineralized bone matrix products died 1 to 4 days after implantation of the bone graft material. None of the remaining 10 animals implanted with the four other grafting materials died. The experiment was modified and completed with a lower dose of bone graft material. Pathologic analysis indicated that the cause of death was hemorrhagic necrosis of the kidneys, most likely caused by a toxic effect on the glomeruli and tubules. A possible causative factor may have been the glycerol in the graft material.

Conclusions

Although the volume of Grafton product per kilogram of body weight used in this study was approximately eight times the maximum volume used in humans, the authors believe that this data must be reported because this product is used substantially in clinical settings. In addition, the osteoinductive performance and relative safety of the nonallograft components in all commercially available demineralized bone grafts are not known.

### Orthopaedic traumatology: fundamental principles and current controversies for the acute care surgeon [^117XLRcu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Orthobiologics

New technology is arising to augment the biology of fracture care and is referred to as orthobiologics. There are many different bone substitutes in which three properties are described. Osteoinductive strategies provide growth factors to encourage mesenchymal osteoprogenitor cells to differentiate into the osteoblastic lineages, which direct bone growth and repair. Osteoconductive grafts provide structural support and serve as a scaffold for bone growth. Osteogenesis refers to the direct transplant of osteoblasts and periosteal cells to the fracture site to produce bone. The gold standard for bone graft had until recently been autogenous iliac crest bone, which includes all three biologic properties. However, harvesting iliac crest graft can result in chronic pain at the site of harvest and there is a limited supply. Alternatives to an autograft are cadaveric bone, demineralized bone matrix and bone morphogenic protein products. Cadaveric bone, however, only has osteoconductive properties. Demineralized bone matrix is commercially available as a putty, paste, sheets and pieces. This material provides a degradable matrix of bone proteins, calcium, phosphates and trace cellular debris that has both osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. It is often used as a supplement in bone repair and regenerative strategies, but the consistency of the product has been questioned. Recombinant bone morphogenic protein (rBMP) is osteoinductive and has been shown to induce bone formation in a variety of clinical scenarios. The addition of rBMP-2 to the fracture site of open tibial fractures is associated with significantly fewer hardware failures, faster healing and fewer infections compared with controls.

### First-line endocrine treatment of breast cancer: aromatase inhibitor or antioestrogen? [^114jbhmp]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Antioestrogens and AIs have distinct mechanisms of action

Tamoxifen (antioestrogen) and aromatase inhibition (oestrogen deprivation) are distinct approaches to oestrogen-dependent breast cancer and efficacy, tolerability and toxicity differences stem from these pharmacological fundamentals. Unlike tamoxifen, AIs do not exhibit intrinsic hormonal properties but affect oestrogen receptor (ER) function indirectly by blocking the conversion of adrenal androgens to oestrogen in the peripheral (i.e. nonovarian) tissues of postmenopausal women, including the breast itself. When deprived of oestrogens, ERs cannot bind to DNA, and are therefore incapable of direct involvement in signalling. As a consequence, the side effects of AIs stem from oestrogen deprivation – for example, bone loss and atrophic vaginitis. In contrast, tamoxifen has an intrinsic endocrine action by binding to ERs with high affinity and activating ER dimerisation and DNA binding. Tamoxifen-bound ER has altered gene-regulatory properties referred to as SERM. In several normal tissues, tamoxifen-bound ER is active and promotes, for example, bone mineralisation and endometrial proliferation. In these instances, tamoxifen is acting as an 'oestrogen mimic' or receptor agonist. As a consequence, the serious side effects of tamoxifen are remarkably similar to oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT) – venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, stroke and endometrial cancer. Like ERT, maintenance of bone mineral density is an advantage of tamoxifen. These agonist effects may, however, limit efficacy. Aromatase inhibitors do not interact with ER; so potential resistance mechanisms related to SERM agonist effects on tumour cells are avoided. Preclinical models with MCF7 xenografts engineered to overexpress aromatase, as well as models of tamoxifen-dependent tumour growth, support this explanation for the therapeutic advantage of AIs.

First-line therapy for advanced disease

This discussion will focus on anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane. Fadrozole, a second-generation nonsteroidal AI, has been shown to be equivalent to tamoxifen but inferior to letrozole in advanced breast cancer, and will not be discussed further, as drug approval is restricted to Japan.

### Hard and soft tissue evaluation of different socket preservation procedures using leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin: a retrospective clinical and volumetric analysis [^114zsc2U]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The extraction of a tooth is followed by hard and soft tissue changes that can compromise implant placement. The aim of the present retrospective study was to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of different ridge preservation procedures based on the use of leukocyte and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF).

Materials and Methods

The study population consisted of all patients who had undergone surgery from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018 for alveolar ridge preservation on single posterior teeth using 3 clinical protocols: L-PRF alone, L-PRF mixed with a bone xenograft, and bone xenograft alone. Clinical and radiographic measures were recorded preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively to determine the horizontal and vertical ridge resorption.

Results

A total of 45 patients were included in the present study. All the surgeries were performed successfully, and no intraoperative complications developed. The L-PRF group experienced significantly greater horizontal and vertical bone resorption. The L-PRF plus bone xenograft group had less vertical and horizontal bone resorption than the bone xenograft alone group. Statistically significant differences in postoperative pain and wound healing were observed, with the bone xenograft alone group, in particular, having higher values for pain and experiencing delayed wound healing.

Conclusions

Within the limitations of the present retrospective study, the use of a bone xenograft alone or L-PRF combined with a bone xenograft to perform alveolar ridge preservation procedures significantly limited bone resorption.

### Study details | Comparing synthetic bone alone… -clinical trials… [^1153S8En]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Study Overview Bone graft obtained from a patient's own bone, usually around the pelvis, is currently considered the gold standard for bone grafting material. It provides a structural scaffold on which the patient's own bone may grow into, growth factors that can stimulate healing, and primitive cells that can stimulate bone formation directly. The question that remains is whether additional growth factors that can stimulate bone formation and/or cells that form bone directly facilitate healing of these defects when added to a material other than the patient's own bone graft source. In our experience with the use of the synthetic bone graft substitute ultraporous beta-tricalcium phosphate over the last 3 years, the graft material, when combined with local blood alone, has performed well clinically but has persisted for a year or longer radiographically in some cases. Prolonged persistence of the graft material may serve as a potential stress riser, although we did not observe any untoward late effects in our published work. Several authors have studied the effects of composite grafts formed from a combination of bone graft substitutes and the patient's own bone marrow in animal models with promising results. Our hypothesis is that both graft resorption and trabeculation will be more advanced at each time point in those patients that receive BMA plus TCP compared to those that receive TCP alone. Patients with any type of benign bone lesion indicated for surgical curettage would be offered inclusion in the study and followed for a minimum of 2 years post-operatively.

Each patient will undergo radiographic evaluation of the lesion at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months and 2 years post operatively. At one time point a computerized tomogram of the grafted region will be obtained for each patient. Two qualified, blinded, independent reviewers will evaluate the radiographs and CT scans for six criteria:

- presence of graft within the soft tissues,
- presence of a rim of radiolucency surrounding the grafted defect,
- size/circumference of the rim of radiolucency,
- resorption of graft material,
- trabeculation through the defect and
- persistence of graft material in the lesion.

### Injectable bone-graft substitutes: current products, their characteristics and indications, and new developments [^115Jx6DK]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

More than a decade has passed since the first injectable bone substitutes were introduced for use in orthopaedic trauma, and over recent years the number of commercial products has increased dramatically. Despite the fact that these bone substitutes have been on the market for many years, knowledge amongst potential users on how and when they might be useful is still fairly limited. Most injectable bone substitutes belong to one of two major groups: by far the largest group contains products based on various calcium phosphate (CP) mixtures, whilst the smaller group consists of calcium sulphate (CS) compounds. Following mixing, the CP or CS paste can be injected into — for instance — a fracture space for augmentation as an alternative to bone graft, or around a screw for augmentation if the bone is weak. Within minutes an in situ process makes the substitute hard; the mechanical strength in compression resembles that of cancellous bone, whereas the strength in bending and shear is lower. Over time, CP products undergo remodelling through a cell-mediated process that seems to mimic the normal bone remodelling, whilst CS products are dissolved through a faster process that is not cell-mediated. For CP, a number of clinical studies have shown that it can be useful for augmentation of metaphyseal fractures when a space is present. Randomised studies have verified that CP works especially well in tibial plateau fractures when compared with conventional bone grafting. So far the number of clinical studies on CS products is very low. Development at present seems to be heading towards premixed or directly mixed products as well as new compounds that contain fibres or other components to enhance bending and shear strength. Products that are based on combinations of CP and CS are also being developed to combine the fast-dissolving CS with the stronger and more slowly remodelling CP. Injectable bone substitutes, and especially CS, have also been targeted as potentially good carriers for antibiotics and growth factors.

### Prospective study of bone augmentation with lateral sinus lift and… [^115snrDq]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Title: "Histomorphometric Evaluation of Bone Augmentation Using Xenografts Versus Autologous Bone Grafts in Dental Implant Patients: A Comparative Clinical Study". Objective: This study aims to compare and analyse the effectiveness of xenograft and autologous bone grafts in bone augmentation procedures for patients requiring dental implants in a clinical setting. By comparing the outcomes of bone augmentation using xenografts and autologous bone grafts, this study aims to develop treatment protocols prioritising reduced invasiveness and enhanced efficiency. Understanding which grafting material yields better osseointegration can lead to more streamlined procedures, benefiting clinicians and patients. Furthermore, we aim to assess their efficacy in achieving optimal outcomes in bone augmentation procedures by implants and biomaterials in the study.

The unique aspect of this study is the use of a split-mouth model and advanced digital technologies for data collection and analysis, which can provide more accurate and comprehensive insights into the comparative effectiveness of xenografts and autologous bone grafts. This includes digital imaging techniques for pre-operative assessment and post-operative evaluation of bone augmentation outcomes. By leveraging digital technologies, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data collection, enabling comprehensive analysis of the comparative effectiveness of xenografts and autologous bone grafts. Rest assured, every step of this study has been meticulously planned and executed to ensure the reliability and validity of the results. The comparative analysis of xenografts and autologous bone grafts will provide crucial insights into the prevention and management of complications such as infection, graft failure, and resorption associated with bone augmentation procedures.

By identifying which grafting material leads to fewer biological and technical complications, clinicians can tailor treatment protocols to minimize adverse events and maximize patient safety. This aligns with Straumann's commitment to continuously improving treatment protocols to ensure the long-term success of dental implants and restorative procedures. Significance: With the ageing population and increasing prevalence of partial or total edentulism, the challenges associated with dental implants will continue to rise. Bone augmentation using xenografts or autologous grafts can potentially enhance implant stability and success rates, improving patients' quality of life and mental well-being. This study aims to contribute valuable insights into treatment protocols that can positively impact patient outcomes.

### Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes combined with bone grafts ameliorate bone regeneration in mandibular defects [^1152AaNF]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Although scaffold materials serve as effective bone substitutes for mandibular reconstruction, their high resorption and biodegradation rates decrease the success of the therapeutic effect. This study aims to explore the bone regenerative potential of bovine-derived osteoid matrix xenografts coupled with cell-free treatments. The study was conducted as a randomized in vivo experiment to repair critical-sized defects in rabbit mandibles. Two treatment groups were established with 10 rabbits: the right hemimandibles were reconstructed with xenograft (control), and the left hemimandibles were reconstructed with dental pulp stem cell (DPSCs)-derived exosomes soaked xenograft (experimental group) within the same rabbit. Micro-computed tomography and histologic analysis were performed at 4 weeks postoperatively. The histopathologic analysis revealed a significant difference in new bone formation scores between the experimental group (4.87 ± 0.78) and the control group (2.87 ± 0.41). Although the micro-computer tomography analysis did not show a statistically significant difference in new bone volume and surface between the groups, it did reveal that the experimental group had greater bone mineral density, trabecular thickness, and separation. The combination of DPSCs-derived exosomes and xenografts proved to be a promising strategy for enhancing new bone formation and regenerative scores in repairing critical-size defects in rabbit mandibles.

### Tissue engineering rib with the incorporation of biodegradable polymer cage and BMSCs / decalcified bone: an experimental study in a canine model [^112j4XjD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

There still, however, remain several problems such as the mechanical integrity of the scaffolds. Although rib is a bone that suffers very little outer force, because of the effect of the chest muscle, the scaffold still is exposed to deforming forces, especially when the animal vocalizes. In the present study, we used DBM as the scaffold due to the suitable mechanical properties and porosity, which seemed to make it a more ideal scaffold than tricalcium phosphate. First, DBM has good osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity and osteogenic potential and has been widely used in orthopedic applications. Second, the rib is not a load bearing bone but may move with respiration. Thus we need a firm fixation of the scaffold. Third, the cortex of bone is the main component of the rib and yields very few seed cells for native tissue regeneration. Thus, a tissue engineering approach which can supply seed cells is the most suitable method for rib reconstruction.

Although we have achieved a good result with respect to the fixation of the scaffold and rib reconstruction, some problems should be studied further. First, the PDO cage as the material for fixation can only be used in non load bearing bone. Other materials or a method to augment the mechanical strength of the PDO should be investigated. Second, attempts should be made to optimize the bone regeneration. Nutrients are important to the seed cells, but the scaffolds used do not allow enough nutrients to reach cells seeded at the center of the scaffold. Thus it will be necessary to optimize the scaffold size and configuration with regard to the resultant mechanical properties so that a stable scaffold that allows maximal nutrient transfer is used. Third, xenograft may have rejection reaction if it is not properly managed and thus it may have worse effect of bone regeneration compared to autograft. Fourth, much research is needed into the seed cell source and any necessary manipulations that may be performed prior to implantation such as cell expansion or transformation. A number of options are currently being investigated, and the ideal seed cell for bone tissue engineering has not been identified.

### Incorporation of bovine-based structural bone grafts used in reconstructive foot surgery [^116bXBJu]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Timely incorporation of bone grafts is essential to the structural rigidity in most foot and ankle surgeries. Although bovine-based xenografts possess some of the key features necessary for foot and ankle surgery, the studies evaluating the efficacy of these grafts are limited. The aim of the present study was to determine the incorporation rate of bovine-based bone grafts in foot surgery. A total of 22 patients who had undergone reconstructive foot surgery using 31 bovine-based xenografts were identified, and the rate of radiographic incorporation of the grafts was evaluated. A survival analysis was used to show the trend of the incorporation of the xenografts over time. Of the 21 grafts observed for at least 12 weeks, none showed radiographic graft incorporation by 12 weeks. The analogous numbers for 24, 36, and 48 weeks were 3 (20%) of 15, 4 (31%) of 13, and 3 (27%) of 11 grafts. A total of 19 (61.29%) of the 31 grafts studied were never observed to have incorporated radiographically, for the entire observation period. A Kaplan-Meier estimate revealed the median interval to graft incorporation was 56 weeks. Compared with previous studies, which investigated the incorporation of other types of grafts, such as autograft and allografts, we believe that xenografts incorporate more slowly. For this reason, such grafts might not be ideal for use in reconstructive foot surgery.

### A validated preclinical animal model for primary bone tumor research [^115xhzvM]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the introduction of 21st-century surgical and neoadjuvant treatment modalities, survival of patients with osteosarcoma (OS) has not improved in two decades. Advances will depend in part on the development of clinically relevant and reliable animal models. This report describes the engineering and validation of a humanized tissue-engineered bone organ (hTEBO) for preclinical research on primary bone tumors in order to minimize false-positive and false-negative results due to interspecies differences in current xenograft models.

Methods

Pelvic bone and marrow fragments were harvested from patients during reaming of the acetabulum during hip arthroplasty. HTEBOs were engineered by embedding fragments in a fibrin matrix containing bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) and implanted into NOD-scid mice. After 10 weeks of subcutaneous growth, one group of hTEBOs was harvested to analyze the degree of humanization. A second group was injected with human luciferase-labeled OS (Luc-SAOS-2) cells. Tumor growth was followed in vivo with bioluminescence imaging. After 5 weeks, the OS tumors were harvested and analyzed. They were also compared with tumors created via intratibial injection.

Results

After 10 weeks of in vivo growth, a new bone organ containing human bone matrix as well as viable and functional human hematopoietic cells developed. Five weeks after injection of Luc-SAOS-2 cells into this humanized bone microenvironment, spontaneous metastatic spread to the lung was evident. Relevant prognostic markers such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and periostin were found to be positive in OS tumors grown within the humanized microenvironment but not in tumors created in murine tibial bones. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-2α (HIF-2α) was detected only in the humanized OS.

Conclusions

We report an in vivo model that contains human bone matrix and marrow components in one organ. BMP-7 made it possible to maintain viable mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells and created a bone microenvironment mimicking human physiology.

Clinical Relevance

This novel platform enables preclinical research on primary bone tumors in order to test new treatment options.

### Biological sample collection to advance research and treatment: a fight osteosarcoma through European research and euro ewing consortium statement [^1132jQy5]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

"Representativeness" of Current Research Models

Preclinical models are a central component of translational research. Model systems such as patient-derived cell lines, ex vivo engineered models and spheroids/tumoroids, in addition to in vivo rodent (e.g. mice and rats), nonrodent (e.g. canine, zebrafish, and Xenopus; ref.), and chicken chorioallantoic membrane models, allow researchers to mimic bone sarcoma including its genetics and molecular biology, local microenvironment, systemic dissemination, and drug response. Most bone sarcoma deaths occur because of the emergence of drug-resistant lung, bone, and/or bone marrow metastases. Orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft and engineered mouse models recapitulating disseminated disease are essential. Sampling paired treatment-naïve and relapsed material is critical for the development of relevant models to avoid unfavorable scenarios in which preclinical drug efficacy data generated using less-relevant models seem promising, but the subsequent clinical trials show no patient benefit.

Historical cell lines, recent patient-derived cells, and orthotopic xenograft mouse models have been developed for osteosarcoma (,–) and Ewing sarcoma but they typically over-represent the higher risk end of the disease spectrum. The Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer consortium has generated patient-derived xenografts for in vivo compound testing from children with relapsed disease and includes some bone sarcoma models, but more representative and accessible patient-derived cell lines, xenograft, and genetically engineered autograft models that allow simultaneous examination of the tumor, immune, extracellular, and structural microenvironment are needed.

### Bone regeneration: current concepts and future directions [^114ku8Vv]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Recently, an animal study has shown the potential for prefabrication of vascularised bioartificial bone grafts in vivo using β-TCP scaffolds intraoperatively filled with autogenous bone marrow for cell loading, and implanted into the latissimus dorsi muscle for potential application at a later stage for segmental bone reconstruction, introducing the principles of bone transplantation with minimal donor-site morbidity and no quantity restrictions.

Overall, bone-tissue engineering is in its infancy, and there are many issues of efficacy, safety and cost to be addressed before general clinical application can be achieved. Cultured-expanded cells may have mutations or epigenetic changes that could confer a tumour-forming potential. However, in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that the risk of tumour formation is minimal. No cases of tumour transformation were reported in 41 patients (45 joints) after autologous bone-marrow-derived MSC transplantation for cartilage repair, who were followed for up to 11 years and 5 months. Another important issue is the difficulty of achieving an effective and high-density cell population within three-dimensional biodegradable scaffolds. Consequently, numerous bioreactor technologies have been investigated, and many others should be developed. Their degradation properties should also preserve the health of local tissues and the continuous remodelling of bone. Three-dimensional porous scaffolds with specific architectures at the nano, micro and macro scale for optimum surface porosity and chemistry, which enhance cellular attachment, migration, proliferation and differentiation, are undergoing a continuous evaluation process.

### Biological therapy of bone defects: the immunology of bone allo-transplantation [^117DkCBa]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

Bone is one of the most transplanted tissues worldwide. Autograft is the ideal bone graft but is not widely used because of donor site morbidity and restricted availability. Allograft is easily accessible but can transmit infections and elicit an immune response.

Areas Covered In This Review

This review identifies all in vitro and in vivo evidence of immune responses following bone transplantation and highlights methods of improving host tolerance to bone allotransplantation.

What The Reader Will Gain

In humans, the presence of anti-HLA specific antibodies against freeze-dried and fresh-frozen bone allografts has been demonstrated. Fresh-frozen bone allograft can still generate immune reactions whilst freeze-dried bone allografts present with less immunogenicity but have less structural integrity. This immune response can have an adverse effect on the graft's incorporation and increase the incidence of rejection. Decreasing the immune reaction against the allograft by lowering the immunogenic load of the graft or lowering the host immune response, would result in improved bone incorporation.

Take Home Message

It is essential that the complex biological processes related to bone immunogenicity are understood, since this may allow the development of safer and more successful ways of controlling the outcome of bone allografting.
