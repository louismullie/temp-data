## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which molecule is formed first when glycogen is broken down in muscle. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the enzyme that initiates glycogen breakdown. Then, I should verify the immediate product of that enzymatic reaction. Next, I will consider whether that product is directly usable in glycolysis or requires a subsequent conversion. Finally, I will compare the options and confirm the best answer with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the initiating enzyme. In muscle, glycogenolysis is catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase, which phosphorolyzes terminal α-1,4-linked glucose residues from glycogen, releasing a phosphorylated sugar rather than free glucose [^a479575e] [^70abb1c4].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate product. The direct product of glycogen phosphorylase is glucose-1-phosphate, not free glucose, because the phosphate group is retained on the anomeric carbon during phosphorolysis [^a479575e] [^70abb1c4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about usability. I initially thought glucose-1-phosphate might be the direct substrate for glycolysis, but I should double-check that. Glucose-1-phosphate is not directly used by glycolysis; it must first be converted to glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase, after which it can enter glycolysis or other pathways, so glucose-6-phosphate is a subsequent metabolite, not the initial product [^8b473812] [^a479575e].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating liver and muscle pathways. In liver, glucose-6-phosphate can be dephosphorylated to free glucose for export, but in muscle the dominant fate of glycogen-derived glucose-1-phosphate is conversion to glucose-6-phosphate and then glycolysis, reinforcing that glucose-6-phosphate is not the initial product of glycogen breakdown in muscle [^8b473812] [^a479575e].

> Let me consider the distractors carefully. Glucose-1,6-diphosphate is a regulatory cofactor for phosphoglucomutase and is not a primary product of glycogenolysis, and free glucose is not the initial product of glycogen phosphorylase, which eliminates options A and D [^921600d7] [^a479575e].

> Putting this together, the initial product of glycogen breakdown in muscle is glucose-1-phosphate, which is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate before entering glycolysis, so the correct answer is B. glucose-1-phosphate [^a479575e] [^8b473812].

---

The correct answer is **B. glucose-1-phosphate**. Glycogen breakdown in muscle is initiated by **glycogen phosphorylase**, which catalyzes the phosphorolysis of glycogen to yield **glucose-1-phosphate** [^a479575e]. This is the immediate product before any further conversion to glucose-6-phosphate or free glucose [^8b473812].

---

## Enzymatic process of glycogen breakdown in muscle

Glycogen breakdown in muscle, known as **glycogenolysis**, is a tightly regulated process that ensures a rapid supply of glucose for energy during physical activity. The key enzyme responsible for initiating this process is **glycogen phosphorylase** [^a479575e], which catalyzes the phosphorolysis of glycogen — cleaving α-1,4-glycosidic bonds and releasing glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) [^70abb1c4].

---

## Immediate product of glycogen breakdown

The immediate product of glycogen breakdown by glycogen phosphorylase is **glucose-1-phosphate (G1P)** [^a479575e]. This molecule is a phosphorylated glucose unit that retains the phosphate group at the anomeric carbon (carbon 1), distinguishing it from free glucose and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) [^notfound].

---

## Subsequent metabolic steps

Following the formation of glucose-1-phosphate, the following **metabolic steps** occur:

- **Conversion to glucose-6-phosphate**: Phosphoglucomutase catalyzes the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate, which is a critical intermediate in glycolysis [^8b473812].

- **Glycolysis**: Glucose-6-phosphate enters the glycolytic pathway, where it is further metabolized to produce ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell [^8b473812].

- **Regulation**: The activity of glycogen phosphorylase is regulated by hormonal signals (e.g. epinephrine, glucagon) and allosteric effectors, ensuring that glycogenolysis occurs in response to energy demands [^notfound].

---

## Distinction from other glucose metabolites

It is important to distinguish glucose-1-phosphate from other glucose metabolites:

| **Metabolite** | **Description** | **Role in glycogenolysis** |
|-|-|-|
| Glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) | Phosphorylated glucose with phosphate at carbon 1 | Immediate product of glycogen breakdown [^a479575e] |
| Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) | Phosphorylated glucose with phosphate at carbon 6 | Formed from G1P by phosphoglucomutase; enters glycolysis [^8b473812] |
| Free glucose | Unphosphorylated glucose | Not directly produced in muscle glycogenolysis; produced in liver by glucose-6-phosphatase [^8b473812] |
| Glucose-1,6-diphosphate | Phosphorylated glucose with phosphates at carbons 1 and 6 | Regulatory metabolite, not a direct product of glycogen breakdown [^921600d7] |

---

## Clinical and physiological significance

Understanding the initial product of glycogen breakdown is clinically significant because defects in glycogenolysis or subsequent steps can lead to **glycogen storage diseases (GSDs)** [^aa658525], characterized by abnormal glycogen accumulation or impaired glucose release. For example, **GSD type V (McArdle disease)** results from a deficiency in muscle glycogen phosphorylase, causing muscle cramps, fatigue, and exercise intolerance [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Glycogen breakdown in muscle initially results in the formation of **glucose-1-phosphate** [^a479575e], catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase. This phosphorylated glucose intermediate is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate, which enters glycolysis to provide energy for muscle contraction [^8b473812].

Main text

Glycosylation defects are a major group of metabolic diseases comprising more than 100 different defects and a significant proportion of them are due to deficiencies in enzymes involved in the synthesis of nucleoside diphosphate sugars (NDP-sugars). In several instances, the synthesis of NDP-sugars starts with the conversion of a hexose-6-phosphate to a hexose-1-phosphate. This step is catalyzed by a phosphomutase and is followed by the addition of a nucleotidyl group to the phosphate on carbon 1, resulting in the activated sugars uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose, UDP- N -acetyl-glucosamine, and guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-mannose. The three phosphomutases that are needed to form glucose-1-phosphate (phosphoglucomutase 1 [PGM1]), N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate (phosphoglucomutase 3 [PGM3]), and mannose-1-phosphate (phosphomannomutase 2 [PMM2])all require low concentrations of the corresponding hexose-bisphosphate (glucose-, N-acetyl-glucosamine-, and mannose-1,6-bisphosphate) as a cofactor. This cofactor participates in the reaction mechanism and is therefore indispensable.

### Impaired glucose-1, 6-biphosphate production due to bi-allelic PGM2L1 mutations is associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder [^53e9c02c]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

The main enzymatic reaction forming these hexose-bisphosphates uses the high-energy intermediate of glycolysis 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate as a phosphoryl donor and a hexose-1 or 6-phosphate as a phosphate acceptor. In vertebrates, two proteins have been shown to catalyze this reaction: PGM2 and PGM2L1. PGM2 is a multifunctional enzyme able to catalyze several phosphomutase reactions on ribose-phosphate, deoxyribose-phosphate, and glucose-phosphate and, at a much lower rate, the synthesis of hexose-1,6-bisphosphates and ribose-1,5-bisphosphate.PGM2L1 has similar catalytic activities, but its bisphosphate synthesizing activity is higher compared to its mutase activity, which makes it suitable to synthesize high concentrations of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate and other hexose- and pentose-bisphosphates. This is also consistent with the tissue distribution of these two enzymes: PGM2 is widely distributed in tissues, while PGM2L1 is almost restricted to the brain. Intriguingly, the brain is characterized by a very high concentration of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate (> 100 μM), which is at least 100-fold more than the concentration needed for the functioning of sugar phosphomutases. These findings suggest that glucose-1,6-bisphosphate and PGM2L1 play a still unknown role in the brain. Here, we report the identification of four children with PGM2L1 deficiency sharing a common, largely neurological phenotype. More than 10 years after the molecular identification of PGM2L1, the discovery of this developmental disorder highlights the importance of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate in the brain.

### Imaging cancer metabolism: underlying biology and emerging strategies [^3b8ca1f2]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Aberrant cellular metabolism has long been recognized as a primary feature of cancer. Nearly a hundred years ago, Otto Warburg described the propensity of malignant cells to rapidly metabolize glucose to lactate, a seemingly wasteful process in terms of net energy production. This effect, which now bears his name, has been extensively studied with increasing research interest and effort. In fact, the reprogramming of energy metabolism has recently been recognized as a hallmark of cancer. Dysregulated cellular metabolism in cancer, though, extends beyond glycolysis; complex interrelationships exist between energy catabolism and biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 1), as well as adaptive responses to oncogenic stress. Carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism become similarly reprogrammed, providing opportunities for both targeted imaging and therapy. Indeed, Warburg's fundamental discovery of deranged carbohydrate metabolism in cancer has been successfully imaged with the glucose analog 18 F-FDG. PET imaging with 18 F-FDG has gained widespread clinical acceptance as a marker of tumor glycolysis. 18 F-FDG PET is currently approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services for numerous indications, including characterization, diagnosis, staging, and restaging of multiple malignancies (National Coverage Determination for PET Scans [220.6]).

### Developing the trehalose biosynthesis pathway as an antifungal drug target [^8d10ee8e]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

The trehalose biosynthesis pathway contributes to the virulence of fungal pathogens

Trehalose (α-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 1)-α-D-glucopyranoside) is a non-reducing disaccharide composed of two glucose molecules linked by an α,α-1,1-glycosidic linkage. Fungal pathogens employ a two-step trehalose biosynthesis pathway to generate trehalose (Fig. 1a). The first step is initiated when uridine-diphosphate glucose (UDPG) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) are converted to trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1). Next, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (Tps2) removes the phosphate group from T6P to generate trehalose. Several fungi contain additional regulatory proteins that lack known enzymatic activity and are hypothesized to contribute to complex formation in cells –.

a The canonical, two-step trehalose biosynthesis pathway in fungal pathogens. Tps1 (shown as the C. neoformans homo-tetramer) converts UDPG and G6P into T6P, releasing the byproduct UDP. Tps2 is a phosphatase that removes the phosphate group from T6P to generate trehalose. Trehalases can breakdown trehalose into two glucose molecules. Shown here are representations of trehalases from C. neoformans (Nth1 and Nth2). b There are multiple fungal virulence phenotypes attributed to Tps1 in several fungi including cryptococcal species and C. albicans. c Known fungal virulence phenotypes attributed to Tps2 amongst fungal pathogens are fewer than Tps1.

### Evaluation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose as a chemotherapeutic agent: mechanism of cell death [^f847bdb2]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Glucose-deprivation can be mimicked with glucose antagonists. Glucose analogues have been found to profoundly inhibit glucose metabolism in cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. Of the many glucose analogues, which have been investigated, 2DG appears to be the most effective in inhibiting glycolysis. 2DG is a structural analogue of glucose differing at the second carbon atom by the substitution of hydrogen for a hydroxyl group and appears to selectively accumulate in cancer cells (Figure 1). 2DG undergoes facilitated diffusion into cells via glucose transporters. Once intracellular, 2DG is phosphorylated by hexokinase to 2-deoxy-D-glucose-6-phosphate (2-DG-6-P). 2-DG-6-P is not a substrate for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or phosphohexoisomerase. Therefore, once formed, 2-DG-6-P is not further metabolised and will accumulate in the cell until de-phosphorylated by phosphorylase. In malignant cells, specific accumulation of 2DG is attributed to several mechanisms; increased glucose transporter expression resulting in increased uptake, increased hexokinase activity or phosphorylating activity resulting in trapping, and low phosphorylase activity resulting in accumulation. Inhibition of glycolysis by 2-DG is thought to occur by inhibition of key glycolytic enzymes such as phosphohexoisomerase as well as depletion of high energy compounds. 2-DG-6-P may act as a potent P i trap resulting in depletion of intracellular stores. Low P i rapidly leads to dephosphorylation of ATP with a concomitant increase in AMP. High AMP and low P i stimulates AMP deaminase, which converts AMP to inosine and leads to a decrease in the total adenine pool. The low P i and ATP makes hexokinase far more susceptible to inhibition by G-6-P which may occur by feedback inhibition and/or allosteric inhibition.

### Application of isotopic techniques using constant specific activity or enrichment to the study of carbohydrate metabolism [^49a6bd4a]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Tracer choice and its effects on measurement of glucose flux.

An important assumption underling tracer methodology is that the label used in a given tracer does not recycle into the compartment being studied after it leaves the compartment with the tracee. If this is the case, Ra will be progressively underestimated as more and more isotope recycles back into the pool being measured. Glucose tracers typically use a hydrogen isotope on the 2nd, 3rd, or 6th carbon. The label is lost to water at different points during glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, leading to potential differences in Ra measurement depending on the tracer used.

In the case of glucose labeled on the 2nd carbon, the isotope will be lost in the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate (assuming that the isomerase reaction is much more active compared with the formation of glucose-6-phosphate) and reconversion to glucose-6-phosphate. This results in overestimation of glucose utilization. Since the glucose/glucose-6-phosphate cycle results in hydrolysis of ATP but without glucose metabolism, this has been termed futile cycling.

On the other hand, label is lost from the 3rd carbon after cleavage of fructose-6-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G-3P). The label is present on the 1st carbon of DHAP but is then lost after isomerization to G-3P.

In the case of glucose labeled on the 6th carbon, label is lost from the 6th carbon after entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The action of uridine-diphosphoglucose dehydrogenase causes loss of tritium from carbon 6 when uracil-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose reenters glucose metabolism. Another potential mechanism by which the label on the 6th carbon is lost is when glucose is metabolized to fructose biphosphate and then recycles back to glucose. A variety of (in vitro) studies have demonstrated that futile cycling can occur at the fructose-6-phosphate/fructose diphosphate level. However, in vivo studies suggest that in postabsorptive humans, futile cycling at this level is insignificant. The use of 6,6–2 H 2 -glucose as a tracer overcomes some of these problems, as the 6–2 H 1 -glucose product of recycling can be distinguished from the underlying tracer.

### Sphingosine-1-phosphate suppresses GLUT activity through PP2A and counteracts hyperglycemia in diabetic red blood cells [^8233e087]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To explore the physiological consequences of the reduction on glucose uptake, we performed metabolic flux experiments using 1,2,3–13 C 3 -D-glucose. The triple 13 C label on position 1, 2 and 3 of the glucose isotope allows to distinguish the lactate production from direct (13 C 3 lactate) glycolysis from that following loss of the first carbon atom 13 C 1 in the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) resulting in 13 C 2 lactate generation. A reliable readout for the predominance of one over the other is provided by the 13 C 3 lactate/ 13 C 2 lactate ratio. Interestingly, we observed a 50% increase in the 13 C 3 lactate/ 13 C 2 lactate ratio (Fig. 1H) suggesting that increased glycolysis may compensate for less glucose entry. The preferential flux to direct glycolysis instead of PPP was convincingly confirmed by measurements of the direct PPP metabolite phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) as the relative exchange of 13 C 2 PRPP was reduced by 400% (Fig. 1H).

### Hepatic glycogen metabolism in type 1 diabetes after long-term near normoglycemia [^d9b46048]. Diabetes (2002). Low credibility.

We tested the impact of long-term near normoglycemia (HbA(1c) < 7% for > 1 year) on glycogen metabolism in seven type 1 diabetic and seven matched nondiabetic subjects after a mixed meal. Glycemic profiles (6.2 ± 0.10 vs. 5.9 ± 0.07 mmol/l; P < 0.05) of diabetic patients were approximated to that of nondiabetic subjects by variable insulin infusion. Rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis and breakdown were calculated from the glycogen concentration time curves between 7:30 P.M. and 8:00 A.M. using in vivo (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Glucose production was determined with D-[6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose, and the hepatic uridine-diphosphate glucose pool was sampled with acetaminophen. Glycogen synthesis and breakdown as well as glucose production were identical in diabetic and healthy subjects: 7.3 ± 0.9 vs. 7.1 ± 0.7, 4.2 ± 0.5 vs. 3.8 ± 0.3, and 8.7 ± 0.5 vs. 8.4 ± 0.7 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), respectively. Although portal vein insulin concentrations were doubled, the flux through the indirect pathway of glycogen synthesis remained higher in type 1 diabetic subjects: approximately 70 vs. approximately 50%; P < 0.05. In conclusion, combined long- and short-term intensified insulin substitution normalizes rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis but not the contribution of gluconeogenesis to glycogen synthesis in type 1 diabetes.

### Glucose-6-phosphate-mediated activation of liver glycogen synthase plays a key role in hepatic glycogen synthesis [^afdac4d5]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The liver plays a central role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis by uptake of glucose in the postprandial state and conversion to glycogen and triglyceride and by production of glucose in the postabsorptive state by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Defects in the mechanisms by which glucose and insulin regulate hepatic glycogen metabolism disrupt blood glucose homeostasis and are highly associated with metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and glycogen storage disease.

The rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen synthesis is glycogen synthase (GS), which catalyzes the addition of α-1,4–linked glucose units from uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucose to a nascent glycogen chain. In mammals, there are two GS isoforms: muscle GS (encoded by GYS1), which is abundantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles, and the liver-restricted isoform (encoded by GYS2). Activity of both isoforms is regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites and allosteric effectors of which glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is the most important. G6P functions as an allosteric activator of the phosphorylated enzyme, and even hyperphosphorylated GS can be fully activated by saturating concentrations of G6P in cell-free assays. Dephosphorylation activates GS and also results in significant changes in kinetic properties, decreasing the Km for the substrate UDP glucose and the A 0.5 for G6P. Despite decades of intensive research, the relative importance of these two regulatory mechanisms, particularly the contribution of allosteric regulation to the control of GS and glycogen storage in liver in vivo, is not established. This is mainly due to the complex interplay between multiple phosphorylation sites and allosteric effectors and most notably the lack of robust experimental tools.

### History of the first synthesis of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose the unlabeled forerunner of 2-deoxy-2-[18F] fluoro-D-glucose [^a3026d73]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2002). Low credibility.

The history of the first successful synthesis of 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (19FDG) is described. In many aspects, this substance imitates the behavior of naturally occurring glucose. For example, it is transported into the cells and is converted to the corresponding 6-phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase in a manner similar to glucose. Due to the presence of the fluorine atom at C-2, however, this phosphate derivative does not undergo further glycolysis but is metabolically trapped in the cell. Thanks to these properties, eight years after the synthesis of 19FDG, its 18F-labeled derivative was successfully used with positron emission tomography (PET).

O-GlcNAcylation by Uridine Diphosphate N -Acetylglucosamine

Why is fetal recapitulation of enhanced glucose uptake favorable to embryonic development but deleterious to the health and viability of the adult kidney under stress? Regardless of the ambient levels of glucose, fetal cells and adult cells under stress upregulate GLUT1 and increase their uptake of glucose, and it is the excess of intracellular glucose (not extracellular glucose) that triggers the identification of a nutrient surplus state, with upregulation of mTOR/HIF-1 α and downregulation of sirtuin/AMPK. The increase in intracellular glucose (and the formation of glucose-6-phosphate) can be directed to one of several fates, which include: (1) glycolysis (for the generation of lactate and ATP), (2) the pentose phosphate pathway (for the stimulation of anabolism and reduction of oxidative stress), and (3) the hexosamine synthetic pathway (which drives the formation of uridine diphosphate N -acetylglucosamine [UDP-GlcNAc]).UDP-GlcNAc is a nucleotide sugar that can modify the function of thousands of proteins that play a critical (favorable) role in embryonic development while functioning in a deleterious manner to promote the pathogenesis of CKD (Figure 1).

When glucose is directed to the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, glucose-6-phosphate is metabolized to fructose 6-phosphate, which (in states of nutrient excess, as reflected by heightened intracellular levels of glucose or glutamine) is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate and then to N -acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate. This conversion is regulated by glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), the rate-limiting enzyme for the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. The subsequent addition of uridine triphosphate (with the release of one phosphate) yields UDP-GlcNAc, the end product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. It is noteworthy that the structural constituents of UDP-GlcNAc reflect all key elements of cellular metabolism, including those involving glucose and amino acids (glucosamine), glucose and fatty acids (acetyl) high-energy metabolism (diphosphate), and nucleoside synthesis (uridine), and thus, UDP-GlcNAc dynamically integrates multiple energy signals, – allowing it to be well-positioned as a nutrient surplus sensor.

### The variable manifestations of disease in pyruvate kinase deficiency and their management [^04c7f324]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with PKD will experience an improvement in hemolysis with both an increased hemoglobin and decreased transfusion burden after splenectomy; however, patients have continued compensated hemolysis with an ongoing risk of severe anemia due to increased hemolysis with infections, aplastic crises associated with parvovirus, and bilirubin-related gallbladder disease. Approximately 15% of patients with PKD will be regularly transfused despite splenectomy. Although response to splenectomy is difficult to predict, those patients who continue to require transfusions despite splenectomy tend to have two drastic (e.g. non-missense) PKLR mutations and a higher pre-splenectomy rate of hemolysis.

### Impaired glucose-1, 6-biphosphate production due to bi-allelic PGM2L1 mutations is associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder [^f61147c8]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Although we have not explored directly the mechanism by which lack of PGM2L1 leads to the neurodevelopmental delay seen in these children, it is conceivable that glucose-1,6-bisphosphate and other sugar-bisphosphates made by PGM2L1 may have a regulatory role in sugar metabolism in the brain. Indeed, besides their actions as activators of phosphomutases, glucose-1,6-bisphosphate and ribose-1,5-bisphosphate have, in the range of concentrations observed in the brain, potential regulatory effects on several enzymes of sugar metabolism. In vitro, glucose-1,6-bisphosphate has also been described to be an inhibitor of hexokinase 1 and 2 (only at concentrations that are much higher than those needed to saturate phosphomutases), and of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Additionally, both glucose-1,6-bisphosphateand ribose-1,5-bisphosphateare stimulators of phosphofructokinase, although not as potent as fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, but more studies are needed to understand the physiological relevance of these effects or to discover the real target of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate's action.

Interestingly, degradation of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate is regulated by inosine monophosphate (IMP), suggesting that it may have some role in the control of energy metabolism. The concentration of IMP increases in energy shortage as a result of enhanced deamination of AMP by AMP-deaminase. Glucose-1,6-bisphosphate is indeed degraded by PMM1, a protein homologous to PMM2, which in the presence of micromolar concentrations of IMP, efficiently dephosphorylates glucose-1,6-bisphosphate. The effect of IMP is not only impressive by its magnitude, the low Ka for IMP (≈1.5–3 μM), and the specificity for this nucleotide but also by the fact that mechanistically it involves conserved residues that are specific for PMM1 and not found in PMM2. The occurrence of this regulation in vivo is supported by the observation that the decrease in glucose-1,6-bisphosphate that occurs during anoxia in mouse brain, does not occur in PMM1-deficient mice. These findings, and the fact that the presence of this IMP-dependent phosphatase in the brain parallels that of the glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthesizing enzyme, plead for a regulatory role of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate in response to energy shortage.

### Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate couples glycolytic flux to activation of ras [^b72f4751]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

In nearly all cells, glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase or glucokinase to glucose-6-phosphate (Glu6P) after its transport into the cells, then converted to fructose-6-phosphate (Fru6P) by phosphoglucoisomerase and subsequently phosphorylated to Fru1,6bisP by phosphofructokinase 1 (Fig. 1). Fru1,6bisP is by far the most elaborately controlled glycolytic metabolite since its biosynthetic and hydrolytic enzymes are post-translationally controlled by multiple mechanisms, including a specific allosteric regulator, Fru2,6bisP, which is synthesized and hydrolyzed in a parallel regulatory pathway. Fru1,6bisP is split into the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), which are ultimately converted into pyruvate, and further into a fermentation product, either ethanol in yeast (Fig. 1) or lactic acid in mammalian cells.

Multiple molecular changes have been identified in cancer cells contributing to the high glycolytic rate, including enhanced intrinsic activity of phosphofructokinase 1 and higher levels of its allosteric activator Fru2,6bisP. Hexokinase activity has also received particular attention as one of the major determinants of the Warburg effect. In certain types of cancer cells, type II hexokinase is strongly associated with the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier, losing its feedback inhibition by glucose-6P and allowing much higher catalytic activity due to efficient coupling with mitochondrial ATP provision. When such cancer cells were grown on galactose, a sugar whose metabolism does not involve hexokinase, the high fermentation rate was strongly reduced. Subsequent work showed that this alteration of type II hexokinase was sufficient to enhance the glycolytic rate of a normal cell up to that observed in cancer cells. Extensive additional evidence has highlighted the critical role of type II hexokinase in aberrant glycolytic metabolism of cancer cells.

### Fludeoxyglucose f 18 injection (fludeoxyglucose F 18) [^ead2f110]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

General

[18F]FDG, a radiolabeled analog of glucose, rapidly distributes, after intravenous injection, to all organs of the body. After background clearance, peak imaging is at 30–40 minutes after injection.

*Calibration Time

Pharmacokinetics

In 4 normal male volunteers, after an intravenous dose given over 30 seconds, the arterial blood level profile for [18F]FDG can be described by a triexponential decay curve. The half-lives for the different distribution and elimination phases are 0.2–0.3 min, 10–13 min (mean ± s.d.; 11.6 ± 1.1 min), and 80–95 min (88 ± 4 min).

Within 33 minutes, a mean of 3.9% of the injected dose can be measured in the urine. Bladder activity two hours after injection indicates that a mean of 20.6% of the injected dose is present. See the Metabolism Section for additional clearance times.

Metabolism

[18F]FDG is taken up by cells and phosphorylated to [18F]FDG-6-phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within a given tissue. [18F]FDG-6-phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2- deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-6-phospho-D-mannose ([18F]FDM-6-phosphate).

[18F]FDG may contain 2-deoxy-2-chloro-D-glucose (C1DG) as an impurity. Distribution and metabolism of C1DG are presumably similar to that of [18F]FDG, and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-g14icose (C1DG-6-phosphate) and 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6- phospho-D-mannose (CIDM-6-phosphate). The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated, and the resulting compounds, (FDG, FDM, C1DG and C1DM) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion.

FDG and related compounds are cleared from non-cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration; clearance from the heart may require more than 96 hours. [18F]FDG that is not involved in glucose metabolism is excreted unchanged in the urine.

### Muscle uridine diphosphate-hexosamines do not decrease despite correction of hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes [^e097b163]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Animal studies suggest that overactivity of the hexosamine pathway, resulting in increased UDP-hexosamines [UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc)] is an important mechanism by which hyperglycemia causes insulin resistance. This study was performed to test this hypothesis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Eight obese patients with uncontrolled DM type 2 and severe insulin resistance were treated with iv insulin for 28 ± 6 d aimed at euglycemia. Before and after iv insulin treatment, insulin sensitivity was measured using a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and a muscle biopsy was taken for measurement of UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-glucose, and UDP-galactose levels. Also, isoelectric focusing patterns of serum transferrin and the urinary excretion of glycosaminoglycans as measures of final products of the hexosamine pathway were examined. After euglycemia, insulin resistance improved, as demonstrated by an increase in the glucose infusion rate during the clamp from 12.7 ± 5.6 to 22.4 ± 8.8 micro mol/kg.min (P < 0.0005) and a decrease in insulin requirement from 1.7 ± 0.9 to 1.1 ± 0.6 U/kg.d (P < 0.005), whereas metabolic control improved. Surprisingly, both UDP-GlcNAc, from 8.81 ± 1.21 to 12.31 ± 2.52 nmol/g tissue (P < 0.005), and UDP-GalNAc concentrations, from 4.49 ± 0.85 to 5.89 ± 1.55 nmol/g tissue (P < 0.05) increased. Isoelectric focusing patterns of serum transferrin and excretion of glycosaminoglycans were similar before and after euglycemia. In conclusion, after amelioration of hyperglycemia- induced insulin resistance, UDP-hexosamines increased in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 DM. These results do not support the hypothesis that accumulation of products of the hexosamine pathway plays a major role in hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance.

### The effects of fructose-1, 6-diphosphate on haemodynamic parameters and survival in a rodent model of propranolol and verapamil poisoning [^f0d9e13e]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) is a metabolite in the glycolytic pathway created from glucose. Exogenously administered FDP increases the yield of ATP from anaerobic glycolysis. FDP reduces ischaemic tissue area in experimentally-induced cerebral and myocardial infarction and improves haemodynamics post-cardiac bypass. We hypothesised that FDP improves haemodynamics in propranolol and verapamil poisoning.

Method

Anesthetized Wistar rats were instrumented to record BP, heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO) and QRS-duration. Propranolol or verapamil were infused continually. When BP dropped by 50%, propranolol-poisoned rats received one of 10% FDP125 mg/kg or 10% FDP250 mg/kg loading dose over 20 minutes followed by infusion 20 mg/kg/h. Verapamil-poisoned rats received the higher dosing regimen of FDP250. Controls received comparable volumes of 10% glucose. Haemodynamic time-points were compared for FDP to control by unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate (p < 0.05). Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results

FDP-treated animals survived significantly longer than glucose-treated controls at both doses in propranolol poisoning and in verapamil-poisoning. In propranolol poisoning, FDP250-treated animals showed a statistically significant increase in BP. However, there was no significant difference in cardiac output at this dose. There were also no significant differences in any haemodynamic parameters compared to control at the lower FDP dose in propranolol poisoning or in verapamil poisoning.

Conclusion

FDP improved survival for both toxicants with an improvement in haemodynamics at the higher dose in propranolol poisoning. Future research could examine the efficacy of FDP in other beta-blocker and calcium channel-blocker poisoning as well as in concert with established inotropic therapies in drug-induced cardiovascular collapse.

### Staphylococcus aureus induces an itaconate-dominated immunometabolic response that drives biofilm formation [^67862c99]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Itaconate diverts carbohydrate flux in S. aureus to promote EPS and biofilm production

The findings described above suggest that itaconate selects for S. aureus strains with reduced glycolytic activity and increased carbohydrate production. We hypothesized that these carbohydrates are shunted into EPS production to support biofilm formation. To confirm the metabolic changes predicted by transcriptomics and determine if itaconate induces EPS production, we performed 13 C-glucose labeling and stable isotope tracing in LAC exposed to itaconate. We observed increased conservation of 13 C-labeled glucose (Fig. 4a, upper left panel), which was consistent with reduced glucose catabolism. We also detected substantial incorporation of 13 C-glucose into the EPS building block, UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine, as evidenced by increased labeling of its 15, 16, and 17 carbon isotopologues (Fig. 4a, bottom panel). This augmented UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine synthesis was also apparent in the carbon labeling of its precursors. UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine is synthesized from uridine-triphosphate (UTP) and N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is derived from fructose-6-phosphate, glutamine, and acetyl-coA (Fig. 3f). We observed increased incorporation of 13 C-glucose into the 6 and 8 carbon isotopologues of N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate (Fig. 4a, lower left panel), which correlated with rapid depletion of the 6-carbon isotopologue of fructose-6-phosphate (Fig. 4a, middle left panel). Similarly, we detected greater incorporation of 13 C-glucose into UTP (Fig. 4a, lower right panel) and its precursors, including uracil, uridine, uridine-5-monophosphate, uridine-5-diphosphate and uridine-diphosphate glucose (Supplementary Fig. 4a). While 13 C-incorporation was increased in other pyrimidines like cytosine, thymine, and their precursor orotate (Supplementary Fig. 4b), it was not in increased in purines like adenosine and guanosine (Supplementary Fig. 4c), suggesting that itaconate specifically induces pyrimidine synthesis, which supports EPS production.

### Vitamin B6 competition in the tumor microenvironment hampers antitumor functions of NK cells [^361b6b3b]. Cancer Discovery (2024). Medium credibility.

NK cells demonstrated increased glucose-1-phosphate levels upon short-term stimulation by target HPNE cells (Fig. 3A). However, reducing VB6 concentration decreased the levels of glucose-1-phosphate and UDP-glucose in NKs stimulated by HPNE-cocultured (Fig. 4A and B). Glucose-1-phosphate is both a precursor of glycogen synthesis and the product of the overall reaction of the breakdown of glycogen. Glucose-1-phosphate can be further converted to glucose-6-phosphate, which fuels cells and often ends up in glycolysis or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Thus, we speculated that glycogen degradation might provide the energy source for glycolysis or the TCA cycle in HPNE-stimulated NK cells. Short-term HPNE stimulation resulted in an increased rate of glycolysis, which was supported by increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, such as glucose-6-phosphate/fructose 1-phosphate (F-6-P/G-6-P), Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP), 3-phosphoglycerate/2-phosphoglycerate (3PG/2PG), and lactate, in NK cells (Fig. 4C). But NK cells maintained a relatively stable level of the TCA cycle metabolites post stimulation by HPNE cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). The HPNE-mediated increase in glycolysis was reduced by VB6 limitation in the cell culture medium (Fig. 4C). Reducing VB6 levels, however, had no significant effect on the TCA cycle metabolites in the control or HPNE-treated NK cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). These results demonstrated that glycogenolysis supports the increased glycolysis in HPNE-stimulated NK cells.

### Probing carbohydrate metabolism using hyperpolarizedC-labeled molecules [^91843ed4]. NMR in Biomedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Glycolysis is a fundamental metabolic process in all organisms. Anomalies in glucose metabolism are linked to various pathological conditions. In particular, elevated aerobic glycolysis is a characteristic feature of rapidly growing cells. Glycolysis and the closely related pentose phosphate pathway can be monitored in real time by hyperpolarized 13 C-labeled metabolic substrates such as 13 C-enriched, deuterated D-glucose derivatives, [2–13 C]-D-fructose, [2–13 C] dihydroxyacetone, [1–13 C]-D-glycerate, [1–13 C]-D-glucono-δ-lactone and [1–13 C] pyruvate in healthy and diseased tissues. Elevated glycolysis in tumors (the Warburg effect) was also successfully imaged using hyperpolarized [U- 13 C 6, U- 2 H 7]-D-glucose, while the size of the preexisting lactate pool can be measured by 13 C MRS and/or MRI with hyperpolarized [1–13 C]pyruvate. This review summarizes the application of various hyperpolarized 13 C-labeled metabolites to the real-time monitoring of glycolysis and related metabolic processes in normal and diseased tissues.

### Storage of red blood cells in alkaline PAGGGM improves metabolism but has no effect on recovery after transfusion [^5b7979a0]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Increased glycolytic activity in PAGGGM RBCs

Glycolysis was more active during storage in PAGGGM (Figure 2). As a result, ATP levels were significantly higher, and less glucose was present in PAGGGM-stored RBCs, resulting in increased levels of 7 metabolites of the glycolysis, including hexose phosphate (including unresolved isomers glucose 1 or 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate with the chromatographic conditions adopted in this study); fructose-1,6-biphosphate; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; diphosphoglycerate (including isomers 1,3 and 2,3-DPG); phosphoglycerate; phosphoenolpyruvate; and lactate. Several differences remained shortly after transfusion. Glucose–phosphate was higher 10 minutes after transfusion in the PAGGGM-stored RBCs but was similar after 6 hours. DPG, phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate were significantly higher up to 6 hours after transfusion. In SAGM RBCs, these levels increased after transfusion, while in PAGGGM RBCs, a decrease was observed. Consequently, 24 hours after transfusion, no differences were found between SAGM- and PAGGGM-stored RBCs that were still circulating. Also, no differences were found in adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and ATP levels after transfusion.

### GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE DEFICIENCY GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE: studiesonthe interrelationships of carbohydrate, lipid, and purine abnormalities… [^fc5eb95c]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Three siblings with glycogen storage disease have been studied. These children demonstrated the classic physical findings of von Gierke's disease. Liver enzyme assays on one sibling revealed very low glucose 6-phosphatase activity. Hepatic phosphoglucomutase, phosphorylase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose 1, 6-diphosphatase activities were within normal limits. Erythrocyte glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was also normal. Incubation of liver slices with glucose 1-C 14 and glucose 6-C 14 revealed an initial rate of C 14O 2 production at which CO 2 from C-1 was three times that from C-6. This is strong evidence for the active operation of the phosphogluconate oxidation pathway in this patient, and taken with the normal assay value of hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, constitutes a negation of the concept of a dual enzyme defect recently proposed for von Gierke's disease.

Striking elevations of free fatty acids in serum, triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, and blood ketones were noted. Potential mechanisms for these elevations have been discussed. Marked hyperuricemia was a persistent finding and was associated with a somewhat low renal clearance of urate in the one patient studied. All three had striking elevations of lactic acid in blood, which is known to interfere with renal urate excretion. Thus renal factors may have contributed to the hyperuricemia, previously considered solely a consequence of enhanced nucleoprotein catabolism secondary to persistent hypoglycemia. Long-term intramuscular administration of glucagon did not produce significant clinical or laboratory improvement in the one patient in whom it was employed. Comments.

### Fludeoxyglucose f18 (fludeoxyglucose) [^f73dc6c7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution: In four healthy male volunteers, receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration, the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 decayed triexponentially. The effective half-life ranges of the three phases were 0.2–0.3 minutes, 10–13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation (STD) of 12 (±) 1 min, and 80–95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 (±) 4 min. Plasma protein binding of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 has not been studied.

Metabolism: Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported into cells and phosphorylated to [F]-FDG-6- phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within that tissue. [F 18]-FDG-6- phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2-deoxy-2-[F 18]fluoro-6-phospho D-mannose([F 18]FDM-6-phosphate). Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection may contain several impurities (e.g., 2-deoxy-2-chloro-D-glucose (ClDG)). Biodistribution and metabolism of ClDG are presumed to be similar to Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-glucose (ClDG-6-phosphate) and 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-mannose (ClDM-6-phosphate). The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated and the resulting compounds (FDG, FDM, ClDG, and ClDM) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and related compounds are cleared from non-cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration. Clearance from the cardiac tissue may require more than 96 hours. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 that is not involved in glucose metabolism in any tissue is then excreted in the urine.

### Inhibition of glycogen synthase II with RNAi prevents liver injury in mouse models of glycogen storage diseases [^b8a1f68f]. Molecular Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The hepatic glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are inherited disorders of glycogen metabolism that present clinically with hepatomegaly, liver injury, failure to thrive, and/or fasting hypoglycemia. These GSDs, including types 0, I, III, IV, VI, and IX, are caused by deficiencies in enzymes or transporters involved in glycogen synthesis or breakdown. In a healthy individual, excess postprandial glucose is converted via a multi-enzyme process into uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose, from which an initial glycogen polymer is formed on the glycogenin 2 (GYG2) dimer scaffold via α-1,4 glycosidic linkages using its autoglycosylation activity (Figure S1). Glycogen synthase 2 (GYS2) continues to catalyze the addition of UDP-glucose onto existing glucose molecules to increase the length of linear glucose polymer chain. Subsequently, glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) is able to attach a new branch point with α-1,6 glycosidic linkage that serves as a new initial point for another cycle of linear glucose chain elongation. Working together, GYS2 and GBE build a complicated tree-like structured glycogen molecule with a GYG2 dimer in the center. During periods of fasting, glycogen phosphorylase (GLGP) starts to release glucose-1-phosphate from glycogen until a branching point is encountered. Glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE) activity then is required for transferring and liberating glucose molecules near the branching point before GLGP is able to further process glycogen and release glucose. Glucose-1-phosphate released from glycogen is then converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and subsequently to glucose by glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) in the final step of glycogenolysis to maintain glucose homeostasis in times of fasting.

### Fludeoxyglucose f 18 [^54b20f27]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Distribution: In four healthy male volunteers, receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration, the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 decayed triexponentially. The effective half-life ranges of the three phases were 0.2–0.3 minutes, 10–13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation (STD) of 12 (±) 1 min, and 80–95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 (±) 4 min.

Plasma protein binding of Fludeoxyglucose F18 has not been studied.

Metabolism: Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported into cells and phosphorylated to [18F]‑FDG-6- phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within that tissue. [F18]-FDG-6-phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2-deoxy-2-[F18]fluoro-6‑phospho-D-mannose ([F18]FDM-6-phosphate).

Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection may contain several impurities (e.g., 2-deoxy-2-chloro‑D-glucose (ClDG)). Biodistribution and metabolism of ClDG are presumed to be similar to Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2‑deoxy-2-chloro-6-phospho-D-glucose (ClDG-6-phosphate) and 2-deoxy-2-chloro-6‑phospho-D-mannose (ClDM-6-phosphate). The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated and the resulting compounds (FDG, FDM, ClDG, and ClDM) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion. Fludeoxyglucose F18 and related compounds are cleared from non-cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration. Clearance from the cardiac tissue may require more than 96 hours. Fludeoxyglucose F18 that is not involved in glucose metabolism in any tissue is then excreted in the urine.

### Thyroid hormone action and liver disease, a complex interplay [^e7994698]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

THYROID HORMONE ACTION ON HEPATIC CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM

The liver plays a unique role in carbohydrate metabolism owing to its ability to both store and release glucose to minimize changes in serum glucose concentration between fed and fasted states. In healthy individuals, the intake of a mixed meal results in modest hyperglycemia, accompanied by substantial storage of glycogen in the liver. In response to ingestion of glucose or a mixed meal and the resulting hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, the fasting liver shifts from net output to net uptake of glucose.

Glucose enters the hepatocyte by means of the insulin-independent glucose transporter-2 and is phosphorylated by hexokinase isoenzymes to glucose 6-phosphate, which may follow several metabolic pathways; during the post-prandial period, most glucose 6-phosphate is used to synthesize glycogen by means of the formation of glucose 1-phosphate and uracil-diphosphate (UDP)–glucose. Minor amounts of UDP–glucose are used to form UDP–glucuronate and UDP–galactose, which are donors of monosaccharide units used in glycosylation. A second pathway of glucose 6-phosphate metabolism is the formation of fructose 6-phosphate, which may either start the hexosamine pathway to produce UDP-N-acetylglucosamine or follow the glycolytic pathway to generate pyruvate and then acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA may enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle to be oxidized or may be exported to the cytosol to synthesize fatty acids when excess glucose is present within the hepatocyte. Finally, glucose 6-phosphate may produce NADPH and ribose 5-phosphate through the pentose phosphate pathway. In addition to metabolizing carbohydrates, the liver produces glucose to be released in circulation from glycogen breakdown, or by means of de novo synthesis using primarily lactate and alanine (gluconeogenesis), including the hexosamine pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, and oxidative routes. Excess glucose is used to synthesize fatty acids in the liver. This unique ability of the human liver to store and release glucose is crucial to endure periods of fasting.

### Sweet and sour: an update on classic galactosemia [^3a54f8b7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Galactose metabolism

The main dietary source of galactose is lactose present in milk and dairy products. After its ingestion, lactose is hydrolyzed in the intestinal lumen by lactase into glucose and galactose. Galactose is transported across the enterocyte brush border membrane by the sodium/glucose active co-transporter SGLT1, and through facilitated diffusion by the GLUT2 transporter across the enterocyte basolateral membrane. Upon entering the blood stream, it is delivered by the portal blood to the liver, the major site of galactose metabolism, where it is internalized by the low-affinity high-capacity GLUT2 (Wood and Trayhurn).

The main pathway of galactose metabolism

When released from lactose breakdown, galactose is in its beta configuration. Once inside the cells, β — galactose is epimerized into its alpha configuration by galactose mutarotase (GALM, EC 5.1.3.3) (Timson and Reece), so that it can enter the Leloir pathway (Fig. 1). This pathway converts α — galactose into glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) by the action of three consecutive enzymes: galactokinase (GALK1) converts α — galactose into galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P); galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) converts Gal-1-P and uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDP-Glc) into glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) and uridine diphosphate-galactose (UDP-Gal); and UDP-galactose 4′-epimerase (GALE) is responsible for the interconversion of UDP-Gal to UDP-Glc, as well as of UDP- N -acetylgalactosamine to UDP- N -acetylglucosamine in mammals. UDP-Glc re-enters the pathway so that further galactose is converted into Glc-1-P and UDP-Gal. The Glc-1-P produced by the Leloir pathway is converted by phosphoglucomutase into glucose-6-phosphate, to be further metabolized via i) the glycolytic pathway; ii) the pentose phosphate pathway; or iii) the gluconeogenic pathway. UDP-Gal, in turn, is the galactose donor for glycosylation reactions.

### Structural basis for dolichylphosphate mannose biosynthesis [^87683674]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Binding of donor substrate

The guanosine moiety of GDP is located in a pocket formed at the C-terminal ends of the parallel β-strands β1–β4, where interactions are offered mainly with the β-α loop regions (Supplementary Fig. 2). Guanosine interacts with the protein through several possible hydrogen bonds: guanine O6 – Gly68 N (β3-α3 loop); guanine N1 and N2 – Asp39 OD2 (β2-α2 loop); ribose O2 – Tyr10 N (β1-α1 loop); and ribose O3 – Ala90 N (β4-α4 loop). In addition, the guanine ring stacks with the hydrophobic Leu69 side chain (β3-α3 loop). The diphosphate-binding site is formed at the canonical DXD motif located in the β4-α4 loop, which is defined by DAD in DPMSs (Supplementary Fig. 3), and forms the inner wall of the diphosphate-binding site. The active site in the catalytic domain is gated by a flexible loop (residues 202–210), which we refer to as the acceptor loop, or A-loop (Figs. 1 a and 2). In the Pf DPMS•GDP•Mg 2+ and Pf DPMS•GDP-Man•Mn 2+ complexes, the A-loop is closed and folded over the diphosphate-binding site to create an outer wall ("front door") of the active site (Fig. 2).

### Allosteric regulation of glycogen breakdown by the second messenger cyclic di-GMP [^70abb1c4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The classical pathway for glycogen biosynthesis in bacteria involves three major reactions. The adenosine 5′-diphosphate (ADP)-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase; GlgC) catalyzes the formation of ADP-glucose from α-glucose-1-phosphate and ATP. Glycogen synthase (GS; GlgA) generates linear α-(1→4)-linked glucose chains out of ADP-glucose. The glycogen branching enzyme (GBE; GlgB) produces α-(1→6)-linked glucan branches in the polymer. On the other hand, glycogen degradation requires the glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE; GlgX), which directly catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-(1→6)-linked glucose residues and the glycogen phosphorylase (GP; GlgP) to generate glucose-1-phosphate, which feeds into primary metabolism. An alternative route to glycogen depends on the maltosyltransferase GlgE that uses the disaccharide α-maltose-1-phosphate as the building block to extend glucan chains. The glgE pathway was discovered in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and represents the sole route to glycogen biosynthesis in Streptomyces venezuelae, which does not encode glgA.

### Analysis of metabolism of 6FDG: a PET glucose transport tracer [^a48c6c24]. Nuclear Medicine and Biology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

We are developing (18)F-labeled 6-fluoro-6-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]6FDG) as a tracer of glucose transport. As part of this process it is important to characterize and quantify putative metabolites. In contrast to the ubiquitous positron emission tomography (PET) tracer (18)F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]2FDG) which is phosphorylated and trapped intracellularly, the substitution of fluorine for a hydroxyl group at carbon-6 in [(18)F]6FDG should prevent its phosphorylation. Consequently, [(18)F]6FDG has the potential to trace the transport step of glucose metabolism without the confounding effects of phosphorylation and subsequent steps of metabolism. Herein the focus is to determine whether, and the degree to which, [(18)F]6FDG remains unchanged following intravenous injection.

Methods

Biodistribution studies were performed using 6FDG labeled with (18)F or with the longer-lived radionuclides (3)H and (14)C. Tissues were harvested at 1, 6, and 24 h following intravenous administration and radioactivity was extracted from the tissues and analyzed using a combination of ion exchange columns, high-performance liquid chromatography, and chemical reactivity.

Results

At the 1 h time-point, the vast majority of radioactivity in the liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and blood was identified as 6FDG. At the 6-h and 24-h time points, there was evidence of a minor amount of radioactive material that appeared to be 6-fluoro-6-deoxy-D-sorbitol and possibly 6-fluoro-6-deoxy-D-gluconic acid.

Conclusion

On the time scale typical of PET imaging studies radioactive metabolites of [(18)F]6FDG are negligible.

### Neurological glycogen storage diseases and emerging therapeutics [^a479575e]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Architecture and metabolism of glycogen. (a) Chemical structure of glycogen. Glycogen is comprised of linear glucose chains linked together via α-1,4 glycosidic bonds and branched via α-1,6 bonds. Due to this structure, glycogen contains multiple non-reducing ends (free C4-residues) and a single reducing end (free C1-residue). (b) Model of glycogen architecture in concentric tiers. Each chain contains an average of two branch points that form a structure of up to 12 concentric layers. Chains of different layers are color-coded for better visualization. (c) Schematic of brain glycogen synthesis and cytosolic degradation. Glycogen elongation is mediated by glycogen synthase (GYS1) that transfers the glucosyl moiety of UDP-glucose to non-reducing ends. Branching enzyme (GBE1) hydrolyzes one α-1,4 glycosidic bond and transfers the released chain to the same or an adjacent chain by forming α-1,6 bond. GBE1-transferred glucose units are highlighted in dark red. In the brain, the glycogen particle is degraded in the cytosol by the coordinated action of brain-type and muscle-type glycogen phosphorylases (PYGB an PYGM, respectively) and the glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE/AGL). PYGB and PYGM phosphorolyze terminal glucose residues to release glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). PYGB and PYGM only bind glucose chains longer than four glucose units, and GDE/AGL removes the shorter glucose chain branch points. GDE/AGL transfers the branch to the same or an adjacent linear chain, and one glucose is released during the process. PYGB-mediated phosphorolysis then resumes. (d) Schematic of lysosomal glycogen degradation. Glycogen is targeted to the lysosomal lumen via processes that are not fully resolved yet but likely involve both macroautophagy and glycogen-specific autophagy (called glycophagy; see Ref. for review). The acid, α-glucosidase (GAA) is decorated by mannose-6-phosphate containing N-glycans that are recognized by the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). This interaction mediates GAA entry into lysosomal lumen. In the lysosomal acidic environment, GAA hydrolyzes glycogen into glucose that exits lysosomes via any of these potential transporters including GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT8, SPNS1 and SLC37A2. Abbreviations: Glc:-glucose; G1P: α — glucose-1-phosphate; Pi: orthophosphate; UDP: uridine-5′-diphosphate.

### Measurements of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis: a methodological review [^58209abc]. Diabetes (2015). Low credibility.

Gluconeogenesis is a complex metabolic process that involves multiple enzymatic steps regulated by myriad factors, including substrate concentrations, the redox state, activation and inhibition of specific enzyme steps, and hormonal modulation. At present, the most widely accepted technique to determine gluconeogenesis is by measuring the incorporation of deuterium from the body water pool into newly formed glucose. However, several techniques using radioactive and stable-labeled isotopes have been used to quantitate the contribution and regulation of gluconeogenesis in humans. Each method has its advantages, methodological assumptions, and set of propagated errors. In this review, we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the most commonly used stable isotopes methods to measure gluconeogenesis in vivo. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each method and summarize the applicability of these measurements in understanding normal and pathophysiological conditions.

### Dihydroxyacetone phosphate signals glucose availability to mTORC1 [^84120cb7]. Nature Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase regulates cell growth by setting the balance between anabolic and catabolic processes. To be active, mTORC1 requires the environmental presence of amino acids and glucose. While a mechanistic understanding of amino acid sensing by mTORC1 is emerging, how glucose activates mTORC1 remains mysterious. Here, we used metabolically engineered human cells lacking the canonical energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase to identify glucose-derived metabolites required to activate mTORC1 independent of energetic stress. We show that mTORC1 senses a metabolite downstream of the aldolase and upstream of the GAPDH-catalysed steps of glycolysis and pinpoint dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) as the key molecule. In cells expressing a triose kinase, the synthesis of DHAP from DHA is sufficient to activate mTORC1 even in the absence of glucose. DHAP is a precursor for lipid synthesis, a process under the control of mTORC1, which provides a potential rationale for the sensing of DHAP by mTORC1.

### Molecular mechanism by which AMP-activated protein kinase activation promotes glycogen accumulation in muscle [^d5678db8]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

AMPK is a major regulator of cellular and whole-body energy homeostasis that coordinates metabolic pathways to balance nutrient supply with energy demand. In response to cellular stress, AMPK inhibits anabolic pathways and stimulates catabolic pathways to restore cellular energy charge. In skeletal muscle, AMPK is activated under energy-consuming conditions such as during contraction and also energy-depleting processes such as hypoxia, which leads to an increase in fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, and inhibition of protein synthesis. The most well established function of AMPK activation in muscle is to stimulate glucose transport by promoting the redistribution of GLUT4 from intracellular compartments to the cell surface.

The resulting increase in glucose transport and phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase II leads to an increase in the intracellular level of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). G6P can be used for the synthesis of glycogen or metabolized in the glycolytic pathway to generate ATP. During glycogen synthesis, G6P is converted to uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucose, and the glucosyl moiety from UDP glucose is used to elongate a growing glycogen chain through α-1,4-glycosidic bonds by the action of glycogen synthase (GS). There are two GS isoforms in mammals encoded by separate genes. GYS1, encoding the muscle isoform, is expressed in muscle and many other organs, including kidney, heart, and brain, whereas GYS2, encoding the liver GS isoform, is expressed exclusively in the liver. GS activity of both isoforms is regulated by G6P, an allosteric activator, and by covalent phosphorylation, which inhibits enzyme activity.

Carling and Hardie reported that AMPK phosphorylates muscle GS at site 2 (Ser8 [amino acid numbering starts from the initiator methionine residue] in human, mouse, and rat), a known inhibitory site of the enzyme, in cell-free assays. Recent work has shown in intact skeletal muscle tissue that acute stimulation of AMPK by a pharmacologic activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), promotes phosphorylation of GS at site 2, resulting in a decrease in enzymatic activity. From these findings, it was anticipated that activation of AMPK would reduce muscle glycogen levels. However, in apparent conflict with this anticipation, long-term/chronic activation of AMPK increases glycogen storage in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Some have speculated that AMPK-mediated increases in glucose transport and the subsequent elevation of intracellular [G6P] are able to allosterically stimulate GS and thus glycogen synthesis by overriding the inhibitory phosphorylation of GS in muscles.

### Resolving futile glucose cycling and glycogenolytic contributions to plasma glucose levels following a glucose load [^51045a5c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

After a glucose load, futile glucose/glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) cycling (FGC) generates [2-(2) H]glucose from (2)H(2)O thereby mimicking a paradoxical glycogenolytic contribution to plasma glucose levels. Contributions of load and G6P derived from gluconeogenesis, FGC, and glycogenolysis to plasma glucose levels need resolution. A simple methodology is proposed integrating the administration of (2)H(2)O with a glucose load containing [1-(2)H, 1-(13)C]glucose and [2-(2)H, 2-(13)C]glucose.

Methods

Mice fasted for 6 (n = 7) or 24 h (n = 5) were intraperitoneally injected with 2 mg/g 10% enriched glucose in 35 µL/g (2)H(2)O. Plasma glucose enrichment was analyzed by (2)H NMR after 30 min.

Results

For 6-h fasted mice, 12.3 ± 1.5% of plasma glucose was pre-existing, 44.3 ± 2.7% was load derived, and 43.4 ± 1.8% G6P derived. G6P origins were 26.0 ± 2.0% gluconeogenesis, 10.9 ± 2.6% FGC, and 6.5 ± 3.4% glycogenolysis. For 24-h fasted mice, 18.2 ± 8.5% was pre-existing, 41.1 ± 5.0% was load derived, and 40.8 ± 4.3% G6P derived. G6P origins were 27.1 ± 3.3% gluconeogenesis, 13.1 ± 2.8% FGC, and 0.6 ± 2.4% glycogenolysis.

Conclusion

After a glucose load, glycogenolytic contribution to plasma glucose was negligible, whereas FGC was significant for both 6- and 24-h fasted mice.

### A critical assessment of fasting to promote metabolic health and longevity [^8b473812]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The first phase, glycogenolysis, involves the release of glucose molecules from glycogen chains, which accumulate in the liver and skeletal muscle in the fed state. The breakdown of glycogen is enzymatically driven by glycogen phosphorylase, yielding individual molecules of glucose-1 phosphate, which in turn are converted to glucose-6 phosphate by the action of phosphoglucomutase. In skeletal muscle, where the glycogen stores provide a rapidly accessible energy source during periods of intense muscle contraction, glucose-6 phosphate is directly catabolized by glycolysis. In the liver, by contrast, the phosphate moiety is removed by glucose-6 phosphatase, yielding glucose, which in turn can exit the cell via glucose transporters to maintain systemic glucose levels and supply distant tissues with fuel for glycolytic metabolism. As such, the liver glycogen stores are of greater relevance to the systemic adaptive response to fasting.

### A potential role for muscle in glucose homeostasis: in vivo kinetic studies in glycogen storage disease type 1a and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase deficiency [^0cd9d8fa]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Background

A potential role for muscle in glucose homeostasis was recently suggested based on characterization of extrahepatic and extrarenal glucose-6-phosphatase (glucose-6-phosphatase-beta). To study the role of extrahepatic tissue in glucose homeostasis during fasting glucose kinetics were studied in two patients with a deficient hepatic and renal glycogenolysis and/or gluconeogenesis.

Design

Endogenous glucose production (EGP), glycogenolysis (GGL), and gluconeogenesis (GNG) were quantified with stable isotopes in a patient with glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD-1a) and a patient with fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) deficiency. The [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose dilution method in combination with the deuterated water method was used during individualized fasting tests.

Results

Both patients became hypoglycemic after 2.5 and 14.5 h fasting, respectively. At that time, the patient with GSD-1a had EGP 3.84 micromol/kg per min (30% of normal EGP after an overnight fast), GGL 3.09 micromol/kg per min, and GNG 0.75 micromol/kg per min. The patient with FBPase deficiency had EGP 8.53 micromol/kg per min (62% of normal EGP after an overnight fast), GGL 6.89 micromol/kg per min GGL, and GNG 1.64 micromol/kg per min.

Conclusion

EGP was severely hampered in both patients, resulting in hypoglycemia. However, despite defective hepatic and renal GNG in both disorders and defective hepatic GGL in GSD-1a, both patients were still able to produce glucose via both pathways. As all necessary enzymes of these pathways have now been functionally detected in muscle, a contribution of muscle to EGP during fasting via both GGL as well as GNG is suggested.

### Glycogen metabolism regulates macrophage-mediated acute inflammatory responses [^da659320]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Glycogenolysis-derived G6P is channeled to the PPP

Synthesized glycogen is stored in the cytoplasm or enters glycogenolysis for degradation. Notably, glycogen-degrading enzymes such as glycogen phosphorylase Pygl (liver) and Pygm (muscle) were found to be upregulated in IFN-γ/LPS-treated rather than untreated or IL-4-treated macrophages (Fig. 2a, b). Consistent results were also obtained from IFN-γ/LPS-treated human THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b), implying that inflammatory macrophages have glycogenolytic activity, leading to G6P production. In addition, we roughly calculated the glycogen turnover rate, which was around 52% (Supplementary Fig. 2c). As a central metabolite, G6P can be channeled to different directions: becoming glucose via dephosphorylation; being oxidized to pyruvate along glycolysis or to ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) via PPP. The 13 C tracing showed that G6P could be channeled to m + 5 R5P (Fig. 2c), which was blocked by glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor (GPI), Gys1 or Pygl siRNA (Fig. 2d), suggesting that glycogenolysis-derived G6P is channeled through the PPP. Consistently, two enzymes G6P dehydrogenase (G6pdx) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6Pgd) that mediate the oxidation of PPP were upregulated in inflammatory macrophages (Fig. 2e, f). Blocking PPP by G6pdx siRNA or G6pdx inhibitor 6-aminonicotinamide (6AN) or blocking glycogenolysis by Pygl siRNA or GPI led to accumulation of glycogen in inflammatory macrophages (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). The PPP can be divided into oxidative and non-oxidative steps: G6P is first oxidized to an intermediate molecule ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P); for the non-oxidative step, Ru5P is either converted to R5P for nucleotide synthesis, or converted to R5P and xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P), leading to the generation of intermediate products [sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S7P) and erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P)] and end products [glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P)]. In line with the carbon flow from G6P to R5P, the 13 C tracing assay further showed that G6P could be channeled to m + 7 S7P and m + 4 E4P (Fig. 2h). Blocking glycogen synthesis by Ugp2 or Gys1 siRNA or blocking glycogenolysis by Pygl siRNA led to decreased S7P and E4P in inflammatory macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 2f), suggesting that glycogenolysis-derived G6P is channeled through the PPP in inflammatory macrophages. Here, we also clarified how much G6P was derived from glucose taken up by the macrophages versus how much G6P was generated from glycogenolysis. Bone marrow cells were cultured with [U6]- 13 C-glucose medium for 5 days in the presence of M-CSF, followed by 6-hour stimulation with IFN-γ/LPS or IFN-γ/LPS + GPI and the switch of the medium to 13 C-glucose-free medium for the last 2- or 4 h. Cell lysates were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Based on such m + 6 G6P tracing, we calculated that 83.08% vs. 1.77% G6P at 2 h and 94.03% vs. 3.18% G6P at 4 h were generated by glycolysis vs. glycogenolysis (Fig. 2i, j). In addition, we found that blockade of glycogenolysis by GPI led to the increase of 13 C-labeled glucose in glycogen from 70 to 84% and the decrease of m + 5 R5P from 95% to 84% (Supplementary Fig. 2g). This 14% increase was some consistent with 11% decrease, suggesting that glycogenolysis-derived G6P might flow to PPP.

### Mechanism of amino acid-induced skeletal muscle insulin resistance in humans [^4e4538c1]. Diabetes (2002). Low credibility.

Plasma concentrations of amino acids are frequently elevated in insulin-resistant states, and a protein-enriched diet can impair glucose metabolism. This study examined effects of short-term plasma amino acid (AA) elevation on whole-body glucose disposal and cellular insulin action in skeletal muscle. Seven healthy men were studied for 5.5 h during euglycemic (5.5 mmol/l), hyperinsulinemic (430 pmol/l), fasting glucagon (65 ng/l), and growth hormone (0.4 microg/l) somatostatin clamp tests in the presence of low (approximately 1.6 mmol/l) and increased (approximately 4.6 mmol/l) plasma AA concentrations. Glucose turnover was measured with D-[6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose. Intramuscular concentrations of glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) were monitored using (13)C and (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. A approximately 2.1-fold elevation of plasma AAs reduced whole-body glucose disposal by 25% (P < 0.01). Rates of muscle glycogen synthesis decreased by 64% (180–315 min, 24 plus minus 3; control, 67 plus minus 10 micromol center dot l(-1) center dot min(-1); P < 0.01), which was accompanied by a reduction in G6P starting at 130 min (DeltaG6P(260–300 min), 18 plus minus 19; control, 103 plus minus 33 micromol/l; P < 0.05). In conclusion, plasma amino acid elevation induces skeletal muscle insulin resistance in humans by inhibition of glucose transport/phosphorylation, resulting in marked reduction of glycogen synthesis.

### Assessing the pentose phosphate pathway using [2, 3-C] glucose [^480cc9da]. NMR in Biomedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is essential for reductive biosynthesis, antioxidant processes and nucleotide production. Common tracers such as [1,2–13 C 2]glucose rely on detection of 13 C in lactate and require assumptions to correct natural 13 C abundance. Here, we introduce a novel and specific tracer of the PPP, [2,3–13 C 2]glucose. 13 C NMR analysis of the resulting isotopomers is informative because [1,2–13 C 2]lactate arises from glycolysis and [2,3–13 C 2]lactate arises exclusively through the PPP. A correction for natural abundance is unnecessary. In rats receiving [2,3–13 C 2]glucose, the PPP was more active in the fed versus fasted state in the liver and the heart, consistent with increased expression of key enzymes in the PPP. Both the PPP and glycolysis were substantially increased in hepatoma compared with liver. In summary, [2,3–13 C 2]glucose and 13 C NMR simplify assessment of the PPP.

CpgA functions as a metabolite-proofreading phosphatase

To determine if CpgA functions as a metabolite-proofreading phosphatase, we used LC-MS to compare intracellular metabolite levels in WT and Δ cpgA cells 30 min. after shift from LB to MSMM containing 0.8% glucose. Strikingly, loss of cpgA led to at least a 100-fold increase in intracellular 4PE, which was below the detection limit in WT cells (Fig. 5c, d). In addition, we noted a more modest increase in intracellular accumulation of 6-phosphogluconate (2.2-fold), as well as GTP (1.7-fold) and erythrose-4-P (1.4-fold). This compares with an 8-fold increase in 6-phosphogluconate in yeast lacking Pho13. In contrast, other phosphorylated intermediates were largely unchanged including hexose-1-phosphates (the assay used did not distinguish glucose-1-phosphate and fructose-1-phosphate). Thus, CpgA may function analogously to Pho13 to dephosphorylate 4PE, and perhaps other metabolites, and thereby prevent inhibition of GndA.

To explore the substrate range of CpgA, we purified the protein and tested a variety of candidate substrates (GTP, G6P, F6P, 6-phosphogluconate, erythrose-4-phosphate, and 4PE) (Fig. 5d). The highest levels of phosphatase activity were observed for erythrose derivatives: erythrose-4-phosphate and 4PE (~25–28 μmole min −1 mg −1 of CpgA). This is nearly identical to the rate measured with Pho13 using 4PE (~30 μmole min −1 mg −1), although Pho13 had very low activity with erythrose-4-phosphate. GTP and 6-phosphogluconate were also moderately good substrates for CpgA (~10–12 μmole min −1 mg −1). Much lower rates were observed for G6P and F6P (~2–3 μmole min −1 mg −1). Previously, a K177A mutation the Walker A motif of CpgA was shown to abolish GTPase activity. Consistent with a central role for the CpgA active site in metabolite proofreading, expression of a CpgA(K177A) mutant did not allow growth on glucose (Supplementary Fig. 3a). These data strongly suggest that CpgA is a broad specificity phosphatase with a preference for erythrose-derived phosphosugars.

### Effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (7–36)-amide on initial splanchnic glucose uptake and insulin action in humans with type 1 diabetes [^85e5165a]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

In vitro studies indicate that glucagon-like peptide-1(7–36)-amide (GLP-1) can enhance hepatic glucose uptake. To determine whether GLP-1 increases splanchnic glucose uptake in humans, we studied seven subjects with type 1 diabetes on two occasions. On both occasions, glucose was maintained at approximately 5.5 mmo/l during the night using a variable insulin infusion. On the morning of the study, a somatostatin, glucagon, and growth hormone infusion was started to maintain basal hormone levels. Glucose (containing [3H]glucose) was infused via an intraduodenal tube at a rate of 20 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1). Insulin concentrations were increased to approximately 500 pmol/l while glucose was clamped at approximately 8.8 mmol/l for the next 4 h by means of a variable intravenous glucose infusion labeled with [6,6-2H2]glucose. Surprisingly, the systemic appearance of intraduodenally infused glucose was higher (P = 0.01) during GLP-1 infusion than saline infusion, indicating a lower (P < 0.05) rate of initial splanchnic glucose uptake (1.4 ± 1.5 vs. 4.8 ± 0.8 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)). On the other hand, flux through the hepatic uridine-diphosphate- glucose pool did not differ between study days (14.2 ± 5.5 vs. 13.0 ± 4.2 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)), implying equivalent rates of glycogen synthesis. GLP-1 also impaired (P < 0.05) insulin-induced suppression of endogenous glucose production (6.9 ± 2.9 vs. 1.3 ± 1.4 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1)), but caused a time-dependent increase (P < 0.01) in glucose disappearance (93.7 ± 10.0 vs. 69.3 ± 6.3 micromol.kg(-1).min(-1); P < 0.01) that was evident only during the final hour of study. We conclude that in the presence of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and enterally delivered glucose, GLP-1 increases total body but not splanchnic glucose uptake in humans with type 1 diabetes.

### Pathophysiology of the neutropenia of GSDIb and G6PC3 deficiency: origin, metabolism and elimination of 1, 5-anhydroglucitol [^a33e42db]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Neutropenia in Glycogen Storage Disease Type Ib (GSDIb) and G6PC3 deficiency results from defects in metabolite repair, leading to the accumulation of 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate (1,5-AG6P). Treatment currently relies on inhibitors of SGLT2, the renal sodium-glucose co-transporter, which indirectly enhances urinary excretion of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), the precursor of the toxic 1,5-AG6P that accumulates in neutrophils and is at the origin of these patients' neutropenia. In this context, a detailed understanding of the formation, intestinal absorption, renal reabsorption, and metabolism of 1,5-AG is essential. Here, we review the current knowledge of these mechanisms, their role in the pathophysiology of 1,5-AG6P-related neutropenia, and explore potential strategies to improve treatment outcomes.

Glycolytic inhibition induces rapid eSG formation through ATP deficiency

Glycolysis is a major pathway of energy metabolism that breaks down glucose imported from the extracellular environment or glycogen stored intracellularly to generate pyruvate and ATP via multiple enzymatic steps (Fig. 1a). We first analyzed the influence of glycolysis on stress granule dynamics. To block the glycolysis pathway completely, we treated cells with glucose deprivation (GD) using a glucose-free medium, in combination with the administration of a specific glycogen phosphorylase (GP) inhibitor, CP91149 (CP), which blocks the breakdown of cell-intrinsic glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) for subsequent catabolism, to shut down glucose and glycogen metabolism simultaneously (GD + CP) (Fig. 1a). Alternatively, we used 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), a glucose analog that cannot be utilized by glycolysis and competitively inhibits hexokinase (HK) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), to inhibit glycolysis fueled by both glucose and glycogen (GD + 2DG) (Fig. 1a). We found that robust cytoplasmic eSGs formed rapidly in HeLa cells stably expressing mCherry-G3BP1 after a 1-h inhibition of glycolysis (Fig. 1b). Conversely, increasing extracellular glucose concentrations competitively diminished 2DG-induced eSG formation, confirming the critical role of glycolysis in inducing eSGs (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Interestingly, glucose deprivation (GD) alone did not induce eSG formation, suggesting that complete glycolysis inhibition is essential for eSG formation (Fig. 1b).

### Evaluation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose as a chemotherapeutic agent: mechanism of cell death [^026c088a]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Nutrient deprivation has been shown to cause cancer cell death. To exploit nutrient deprivation as anti-cancer therapy, we investigated the effects of the anti-metabolite 2-deoxy-D-glucose on breast cancer cells in vitro. This compound has been shown to inhibit glucose metabolism. Treatment of human breast cancer cell lines with 2-deoxy-D-glucose results in cessation of cell growth in a dose dependent manner. Cell viability as measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide conversion assay and clonogenic survival are decreased with 2-deoxy-D-glucose treatment indicating that 2-deoxy-D-glucose causes breast cancer cell death. The cell death induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose was found to be due to apoptosis as demonstrated by induction of caspase 3 activity and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. Breast cancer cells treated with 2-deoxy-D-glucose express higher levels of Glut1 transporter protein as measured by Western blot analysis and have increased glucose uptake compared to non-treated breast cancer cells. From these results we conclude that 2-deoxy-D-glucose treatment causes death in human breast cancer cell lines by the activation of the apoptotic pathway. Our data suggest that breast cancer cells treated with 2-deoxy-D-glucose accelerate their own demise by initially expressing high levels of glucose transporter protein, which allows increased uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and subsequent induction of cell death. These data support the targeting of glucose metabolism as a site for chemotherapeutic intervention by agents such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose.

### Novel arguments in favor of the substrate-transport model of glucose-6-phosphatase [^92b40bfd]. Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

The purpose of this work was to discriminate between two models for glucose-6-phosphatase: one in which the enzyme has its catalytic site oriented toward the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, requiring transporters for glucose-6-phosphate, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and glucose (substrate-transport model), and a second one in which the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate occurs inside the membrane (conformational model). We show that microsomes preloaded with yeast phosphoglucose isomerase catalyzed the detritiation of [2-(3)H]glucose-6-phosphate and that this reaction was inhibited by up to 90% by S3483, a compound known to inhibit glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis in intact but not in detergent-treated microsomes. These results indicate that glucose-6-phosphate is transported to the lumen of the microsomes in an S3483-sensitive manner. Detritiation by intramicrosomal phosphoglucose isomerase was stimulated twofold by 1 mmol/l vanadate, a phosphatase inhibitor, indicating that glucose-6-phosphatase and the isomerase compete for the same intravesicular pool of glucose-6-phosphate. To investigate the site of release of Pi from glucose-6-phosphate, we incubated microsomes with Pb(2+), which forms an insoluble complex with Pi, preventing its rapid exit from the microsomes. Under these conditions, approximately 80% of the Pi that was formed after 5 min was intramicrosomal, compared with < 10% in the absence of Pb(2+). We also show that, when incubated with glucose-6-phosphate and mannitol, glucose-6-phosphatase formed mannitol-1-phosphate and that this nonphysiological product was initially present within the microsomes before being released to the medium. These results indicate that the primary site of product release by glucose-6-phosphatase is the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

### Prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia in a moderately preterm boy with mediterranean glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 null mutations [^b4dbcbae]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 33-week gestation boy with Mediterranean glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and a glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 null mutations (GSTM1*0/✱0) developed prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia (PIH). He had no laboratory evidence of haemolysis or infection, and no exposure to oxidising agents. He has two full-term older brothers who have no history of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. One brother, who was exclusively breast fed, has only Mediterranean G6PD and the other has only GSTM1*0/✱0. The three boys have no mutation in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 gene. This suggests that a combination of all or any two of prematurity, G6PD deficiency and GSTM1*0/✱0 is a possible risk factor for PIH. However, this remains to be confirmed.

### In vivo imaging of glycogen in human muscle [^f01df797]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The exact regulating mechanism for the biphasic glycogen recovery post exercise remains poorly understood and multiple factors that regulate GSase or GPase may play a role. Considering that the initial repletion rates were positively correlated with glycogen depletion (Fig. 4i), exercise induced factors may be important for the regulation of GSase and GPase during the initial phase of recovery. These may include the enhanced glucose uptake, several-fold increaseof glucose 6-phosphate (G6P, an activator of GSaseand inhibitor of GPase), the change of glycogen concentration, and structures, protein kinases, and phosphatases. The glycogen re-synthesis in muscle relies mainly on the continual supply of blood glucose via a chain of reactions, including glucose transport (by primarily glucose transporter type 4, GLUT4) into cells, phosphorylation to G6P (by hexokinase) and incorporation of UDP-glucose into glycogen by GSase. It has been proposed that the glucose uptake (glucose transporter and/or hexokinase) step is the rate-controlling step of glycogen synthesis by providing a "feed-forward" mechanism to activate GSase via G6P. However, the current data support that both GSase and GPase contribution should be considered during initial hours of muscle glycogen recovery post exercise. The GPase activities in local regions after exercise may play a role in several processes. Firstly, the breakdown of glycogen/glucose produces energy and lactate which can be further oxidized by mitochondria in the same or neighboring cells. The produced energy may support different cellular events, including the re-synthesis of PCr and glycogen. Secondly, the produced lactate may be transported to neighboring muscle regions for glycogen re-synthesis. While the production of glucose from lactate is historically considered to occur mainly in the liver, many studies have shown that the conversion of lactate to glucose/glycogen also exists in skeletal muscle in vivo, and that it might contribute substantially to glycogen synthesis post exercise, thus the re-distribution of the overall carbohydrate storage in muscle after exercise. Thirdly, parts of produced lactate may be transported to other organs such as the liver and brain, and used as a substrate for metabolisms.

### Glucose 6-phosphate regulates hepatic glycogenolysis through inactivation of phosphorylase [^941a8980]. Diabetes (2003). Low credibility.

High glucose concentration suppresses hepatic glycogenolysis by allosteric inhibition and dephosphorylation (inactivation) of phosphorylase-a. The latter effect is attributed to a direct effect of glucose on the conformation of phosphorylase-a. Although glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), like glucose, stimulates dephosphorylation of phosphorylase-a by phosphorylase phosphatase, its physiological role in regulating glycogenolysis in intact hepatocytes has not been tested. We show in this study that metabolic conditions associated with an increase in G6P, including glucokinase overexpression and incubation with octanoate or dihydroxyacetone, cause inactivation of phosphorylase. The latter conditions also inhibit glycogenolysis. The activity of phosphorylase-a correlated inversely with the G6P concentration within the physiological range. The inhibition of glycogenolysis and inactivation of phosphorylase-a caused by 10 mmol/l glucose can be at least in part counteracted by inhibition of glucokinase with 5-thioglucose, which lowers G6P. In conclusion, metabolic conditions that alter the hepatic G6P content affect glycogen metabolism not only through regulation of glycogen synthase but also through regulation of the activation state of phosphorylase. Dysregulation of G6P in diabetes by changes in activity of glucokinase or glucose 6-phosphatase may be a contributing factor to impaired suppression of glycogenolysis by hyperglycemia.

### Pathophysiology of the neutropenia of GSDIb and G6PC3 deficiency: origin, metabolism and elimination of 1, 5-anhydroglucitol [^baec0a90]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

1,5‐AG6P is a good substrate for G6PC3 and a much poorer one for the classical glucose‐6‐phosphatase, G6PC1. Studies in ER vesicles (microsomes) show that its hydrolysis is inhibited by a specific inhibitor of G6PT. Accumulation of 1,5‐AG6P in cells lacking functional G6PC3 or G6PT/SLC37A4 indicated that these proteins help eliminate this compound, supporting the view that 1,5‐AG6P serves no physiological function and may even be harmful. Notably, 1,5‐AG6P strongly inhibits hexokinase. This inhibition occurs via binding to the G6P regulatory site, which is distinct from the catalytic glucose‐binding site. This explains the discrepancy between substrate and inhibitor specificities: glucose, mannose, and 2‐deoxyglucose are excellent substrates, but only G6P is a strong inhibitor. Conversely, although 1,5‐AG is a poor substrate, its phosphate form is a potent inhibitor.

### Molecular mechanism by which AMP-activated protein kinase activation promotes glycogen accumulation in muscle [^efdaa71f]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Interestingly, despite the significant impairment in glycogen synthesis, overall glucose utilization, as determined by metabolism of [5–3 H]glucose was also similar between wild-type and GS R582A/R582A mice (Fig. 7 D). The decrease in glycogen synthesis in GS R582A/R582A mice was compensated by a significant increase in the rate of glycolysis in both resting and AICAR-stimulated muscles. Consistent with this finding, the rate of lactate release was also elevated under resting and AICAR-stimulated conditions in GS R582A/R582A mice compared with wild-type (Fig. 7 E). We confirmed that GS activity in resting EDL muscles was comparable between wild-type and GS R582A/R582A mice when assayed in the absence of G6P, whereas the robust G6P-mediated activation observed in wild-type mice was completely abolished in the muscle of GS R582A/R582A mice (Fig. 7 F). AICAR modestly deactivated muscle GS in both wild-type and GS R582A/R582A animals (Fig. 7 F). Potentially, hypophosphorylation of GS by inhibition of GSK3 may compensate for the lack of allosteric activation by G6P in GS R582A/R582A mice. Accordingly, we co-incubated EDL muscle with AICAR and the GSK3 selective inhibitor, CT99021, and observed a significant, albeit modest increase in glycogen synthesis compared with muscle treated with AICAR alone.

### Glycogen storage disease type 1a-a secondary cause for hyperlipidemia: report of five cases [^c0ff6a93]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I) comprises a group of relatively rare autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorders. It is caused by deficient activity of glucose-6-phosphatase system (G6Pase), an enzyme complex that plays a major role in both glycogenolisis and gluconeogenesis. This complex is required for the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into glucose and inorganic phosphate.

The annual incidence is about 1/100000 births and the carrier frequency of 1 in 150, being the GSD type Ia (McKusick, #232200) the more frequent type, accounting for 80% of the GSD I patients. It is caused by mutations in the G6PC, located on chromosome 17q21, which encodes the catalytic subunit of glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α), whose expression is limited to the liver, kidney and intestinal mucosa; more than 85 mutations have been identified.

The disturbed glucose homeostasis associated with the inability to breakdown glycogen stores makes patients prone to fast induced hypoglycemia, with secondary metabolic derangements: hyperlactacidemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperuricemia. Another common manifestation is a protruded abdomen due to marked hepatomegaly; patients usually present before 1 year and have a round "doll like" face, growth and psychomotor delay and late onset of puberty, subclinical muscle weakness, osteopenia, platelet dysfunction, with bleeding tendency, anemia and intermittent diarrhea; in women polycystic ovaries are usually found.

The diagnosis can be based on clinical and biochemical findings, functional tests, enzyme assays of liver biopsy tissue and mutation analysis; currently, the increased knowledge of the genetic basis of GSD I makes the mutation analysis the method of choice for confirming the diagnosis.

A poor metabolic control may lead to long term complications, namely development of hepatocellular adenomas (HCA), renal dysfunction, gout and nephrocalcinosis associated with hyperuricemia, and increased risk of pancreatitis, related to severe hypertrigliceridemia.

Pregnancy and PCP therapies — G6PD-dependent agents and corticosteroids: Because of concerns about hemolytic anemia in exposed fetuses who are G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficient, primaquine or dapsone should be used in pregnancy only if other alternatives are not available or tolerated and benefit is felt to outweigh the risk (AIII), and G6PD levels should be checked before administration of these agents in pregnancy; if G6PD deficiency is found, an alternative agent should be used. During pregnancy, adjunctive corticosteroid therapy should be used to improve treatment outcomes as in any other person with HIV (AIII), with maternal glucose, blood pressure, and fetal growth monitored closely (AIII); patients on chronic steroid therapy for non-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disorders do not need stress doses for delivery but should continue their therapeutic dose without interruption (BIII).

### Pentose conversions support the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer distant metastases [^4b7e47ee]. Oncogene (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) adopts several unique metabolic strategies to support primary tumor growth. Whether additional metabolic strategies are adopted to support metastatic tumorigenesis is less clear. This could be particularly relevant for distant metastasis, which often follows a rapidly progressive clinical course. Here we report that PDAC distant metastases evolve a unique series of metabolic reactions to maintain activation of the anabolic glucose enzyme phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD). PGD catalytic activity was recurrently elevated across distant metastases, and modulating PGD activity levels dictated tumorigenic capacity. Metabolomics data raised the possibility that distant metastases evolved a core pentose conversion pathway (PCP) that converted glucose-derived metabolites into PGD substrate, thereby hyperactivating the enzyme. Consistent with this, each individual metabolite in the PCP stimulated PGD catalysis in distant metastases, and knockdown of each individual PCP enzyme selectively impaired tumorigenesis. We propose that the PCP manufactures PGD substrate outside of the rate-limiting oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP). This enables PGD-dependent tumorigenesis by providing adequate substrate to fuel high catalytic activity, and raises the possibility that PDAC distant metastases adopt their own unique metabolic strategies to support tumor growth.

### Fludeoxyglucose f18 (fludeoxyglucose) [^ccb3904d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is a glucose analog that concentrates in cells that rely upon glucose as an energy source, or in cells whose dependence on glucose increases under pathophysiological conditions. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [F] FDG-6-phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, within a given tissue or pathophysiological process, the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities. When allowance is made for the kinetic differences between glucose and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 transport and phosphorylation (expressed as the "lumped constant" ratio), Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism.

In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism. Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolist.

### In vivo imaging of glycogen in human muscle [^c57690ce]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In humans, the majority of-glucose taken up is deposited as muscle glycogen, (~400 g in total) with a resting concentration of around 100 mM (glucose units) in healthy controls. During exercise, muscle glycogen is consumed to maintain a continuous supply of adenosine triphosphate, with glycogen metabolic rates depending on the exercise intensity of a particular muscle and its duration. When performing a contractile task (e.g. plantar flexion), muscles are recruited with intensities that vary within the same muscle and among different muscle groups –. This may lead to spatially heterogeneous muscular glycogen utilization and storage at both macroscopic (muscle group), and subcellular levels. At recovery, the exercised muscles resynthesize glycogen mainly from blood-glucose via a multiple-step enzymatic regulation (e.g.-glucose transporter, hexokinase, and glycogen synthase (GSase)), a process that is also regulated locally. In the context of this metabolic heterogeneity and complex regulation, the spatial characterization of glycogen usage and recovery in situ would deepen our understanding of muscle metabolic regulation and disorders.

### Influence of TSH on uptake of [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose in human thyroid cells in vitro [^95a20545]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2004). Low credibility.

Recent clinical evidence suggests that positron emission tomography with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is more accurate in detecting thyroid carcinomatous tissue at high than at low TSH levels. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of TSH on FDG uptake in human thyroid cells in vitro. Monolayers of human thyroid tissue were cultured after mechanical disintegration and enzymatic digestion of samples from patients undergoing surgery for nodular goitre. The purity of thyroid cell preparations was ascertained by immunohistochemical staining for the epithelial antigen KL-1, and their viability by measuring the synthesis of thyroglobulin in vitro. The cells were incubated with 0.8–1.5 MBq FDG/ml uptake medium for 1 h. FDG uptake in thyroid cells was quantified as percent of whole FDG activity per well (% ID) or as % ID in relation to total protein mass. This experimental protocol was subsequently varied to study the effect of incubation time, glucose dependency and TSH. Furthermore, radio-thin layer chromatography was used to identify intracellular FDG metabolites. FDG accumulated in the thyroid cells linearly with time, doubling roughly every 20 min. Uptake was competitively inhibited by unlabelled glucose and decreased to approximately 70% at 100 mg/dl glucose compared to the value measured in glucose-free medium. FDG was intracellularly trapped as FDG-6 phosphate and FDG-1,6-diphosphate. TSH significantly increased FDG uptake in vitro in a time- and concentration-dependent manner: Cells cultured at a TSH concentration of 50 micro U/ mL doubled FDG uptake compared to TSH-free conditions, and uptake after 72 h of TSH pre-incubation was approximately 300% of that without TSH pre-incubation. TSH stimulates FDG uptake by benign thyroid cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This supports the clinical evidence that in well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas, most of which are still TSH-sensitive, FDG-PET is more accurate at high levels of TSH.

### Glucose-6-phosphate-mediated activation of liver glycogen synthase plays a key role in hepatic glycogen synthesis [^ac81cb38]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The liver responds to an increase in blood glucose levels in the postprandial state by uptake of glucose and conversion to glycogen. Liver glycogen synthase (GYS2), a key enzyme in glycogen synthesis, is controlled by a complex interplay between the allosteric activator glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and reversible phosphorylation through glycogen synthase kinase-3 and the glycogen-associated form of protein phosphatase 1. Here, we initially performed mutagenesis analysis and identified a key residue (Arg(582)) required for activation of GYS2 by G6P. We then used GYS2 Arg(582)Ala knockin (+/R582A) mice in which G6P-mediated GYS2 activation had been profoundly impaired (60–70%), while sparing regulation through reversible phosphorylation. R582A mutant-expressing hepatocytes showed significantly reduced glycogen synthesis with glucose and insulin or glucokinase activator, which resulted in channeling glucose/G6P toward glycolysis and lipid synthesis. GYS2(+/R582A) mice were modestly glucose intolerant and displayed significantly reduced glycogen accumulation with feeding or glucose load in vivo. These data show that G6P-mediated activation of GYS2 plays a key role in controlling glycogen synthesis and hepatic glucose-G6P flux control and thus whole-body glucose homeostasis.

### Metabolic incorporation of HO into specific glucose-6-phosphate oxygens by red-blood-cell lysates as observed byC isotope-shifted NMR signals [^b72a49fe]. NMR in Biomedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Water enriched with oxygen-18 (H 2 18 O) is a potential tracer for evaluating the sources of glucose and glycogen synthesis since it is incorporated into specific sites of glucose-6-phosphate via specific enzyme-mediated exchange/addition mechanisms. Unlike 2 H, 18 O does not experience significant isotope effects for any of these processes. Therefore, H 2 18 O might provide more precise estimates of endogenous carbohydrate synthesis compared with deuterated water provided that positional 18 O enrichments of glucose can be measured. As a proof of concept, H 2 18 O was incorporated into a well characterized hemolysate model of sugar phosphate metabolism and 13 C NMR was applied to quantify positional 18 O enrichment of glucose-6-phosphate oxygens. Human erythrocyte hemolysate preparations were incubated overnight at 37°C with a buffer containing sugar phosphate precursors and 20% (n = 5) and 80% (n = 1) H 2 18 O. Enrichment of glucose-6-phosphate was analyzed by 13 C NMR analysis of 18 O-shifted versus unshifted signals following derivatization to monoacetone glucose (MAG). 13 C NMR MAG spectra from hemolysate revealed resolved 18 O-shifted signals in Positions 1–5. Mean 18 O enrichments were 16.4 ± 1.6% (Position 1), 13.3 ± 1.3% (Position 2), 4.1 ± 1.1% (Position 3), 12.6 ± 0.8% (Position 4), 10.7 ± 1.4% (Position 5), and no detectable enrichment of Position 6. No 18 O-shifted glucose-6-phosphate signals were detected in preparations containing sugar phosphate precursors only. H 2 18 O is incorporated into Positions 1–5 of glucose-6-phosphate in accordance with spontaneous aldose hydration and specific enzymatic reaction mechanisms. This provides a basis for its deployment as a tracer for glucose and glycogen biosynthesis.

### Hyperpolarized δ-[1-C] gluconolactone as a probe of the pentose phosphate pathway [^a7cb9082]. NMR in Biomedicine (2017). Low credibility.

The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is thought to be upregulated in trauma (to produce excess NADPH) and in cancer (to provide ribose for nucleotide biosynthesis), but simple methods for detecting changes in flux through this pathway are not available. MRI of hyperpolarized 13 C-enriched metabolites offers considerable potential as a rapid, non-invasive tool for detecting changes in metabolic fluxes. In this study, hyperpolarized δ-[1–13 C]gluconolactone was used as a probe to detect flux through the oxidative portion of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP ox) in isolated perfused mouse livers. The appearance of hyperpolarized (HP) H 13 CO 3 - within seconds after exposure of livers to HP-δ-[1–13 C]gluconolactone demonstrates that this probe rapidly enters hepatocytes, becomes phosphorylated, and enters the PPP ox pathway to produce HP-H 13 CO 3 - after three enzyme catalyzed steps (6P-gluconolactonase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and carbonic anhydrase). Livers perfused with octanoate as their sole energy source show no change in production of H 13 CO 3 - after exposure to low levels of H 2 O 2, while livers perfused with glucose and insulin showed a twofold increase in H 13 CO 3 - after exposure to peroxide. This indicates that flux through the PPP ox is stimulated by H 2 O 2 in glucose perfused livers but not in livers perfused with octanoate alone. Subsequent perfusion of livers with non-polarized [1,2–13 C]glucose followed by 1 H NMR analysis of lactate in the perfusate verified that flux through the PPP ox is indeed low in healthy livers and modestly higher in peroxide damaged livers. We conclude that hyperpolarized δ-[1–13 C]gluconolactone has the potential to serve as a metabolic imaging probe of this important biological pathway.

### Chronic hemolytic anemia associated with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (guadalajara) 1 159 C – > T (387 arg – > cys) deficiency associated with Gilbert syndrome in a Turkish patient [^7e3fce9e]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

The case of an 8-year-old male child with severe kernicterus sequelae is presented in this paper. The child's hemoglobin value varied between 6.0 and 10.8 g/dL and his reticulocyte count ranged between 3.4 and 46.0% during the steady-state condition and hyperhemolytic crisis, respectively. A chronic hemolytic type of red cell G6PD deficiency was diagnosed. DNA studies indicate that the mutation was G6PD Guadalajara 1159 C → T (387 Arg → Cys) that is situated at the NADP binding site. Additionally, extra nucleotides of (TA) in the A(TA)n TAA motif of the promoter region of the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT-1 A) were found to be homozygous in the patient. The coexistence of Gilbert syndrome with a chronic type of G6PD deficiency was suggested as a cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia leading to kernicterus.

### Glycogen metabolism regulates macrophage-mediated acute inflammatory responses [^8936aa62]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Remodeled metabolism is known to be vital for a macrophage-mediated inflammatory response, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear, especially for the regulation of inflammatory gene expression by the altered metabolism. In this study, we provide evidence that macrophages mobilize glycogen metabolism, which governs macrophage-mediated inflammatory response. On one hand, glucose through the PPP via glycogenesis and glycogenolysis, thus providing antioxidative NADPH for the survival of activated inflammatory macrophages; on the other hand, glycogen metabolism produces an intermediate metabolite UDPG which triggers the P2Y 14 signaling pathway, which then regulates the key inflammatory transcription factor STAT1 expression and activity.

Glycogen, the long-term reservoir of glucose, is known to be primarily produced by liver and muscle cells, thus providing energy for cells and maintaining blood sugar homeostasis of the body. Notwithstanding this original understanding, the physio-pathological role of glycogen metabolism may be more complex. We previously reported that CD8 + memory T cells use a glycogen metabolic program to regulate memory formation and maintenance. In the present study, we further show that an active glycogen metabolism governs the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages. In these macrophages, the end product of glycogen metabolism, G6P, is not channeled to glycolysis but to the PPP. Previously, an active PPP was observed in inflammatory macrophages. However, those studies considered that the PPP was directly branched from glycolysis and used glycolysis-derived G6P. Nevertheless, by conducting 13 C tracing assay, here we provide clear evidence that the G6P is not directly derived from glycolysis but from glycogenolysis. Following glucose phosphorylation by hexokinase, the formed G6P is first used in glycogenesis. Then, the glycogen is degraded to produce G6P again and the latter is channeled through the PPP. Identification of this metabolic pathway undoubtedly provides new insight into how glucose metabolism regulates macrophage phenotype, but raises the question that why macrophages use G6P to synthesize glycogen and then degrade glycogen to produce G6P, an overt futile glycogen synthesis/degradation cycle. This might be due to the distinctive compartmentalization of the involved enzymes. Another explanation is that glycogen metabolism triggers the UDPG-P2Y 14 signaling pathway that regulates inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. UDP-glucose (UDPG) and other UDP-sugars are essential for glycosylation. Following the synthesis in the cytosol, UDPG is translocated to the ER/Golgi via ER/Golgi-resident SLC35 transporters, where UDPG is used for glycosylation. On the other hand, UDPG in the ER/Golgi lumen can also be released as cargo to the extracellular space via the constitutive secretory pathway. This released UDPG can bind with the P2Y 14 receptor via an autocrine or paracrine pattern.

### Fludeoxyglucose f-18 (fludeoxyglucose F 18) [^f1abc099]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is a glucose analog that concentrates in cells that rely upon glucose as an energy source, or in cells whose dependence on glucose increases under pathophysiological conditions. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [18F] FDG-6-phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase. Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, within a given tissue or pathophysiological process, the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities. Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism.

In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type, regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism. Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolism.

### Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is the primary defect in type 2 diabetes [^be106aa6]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Glucose disposal during OGTT

After a mixed-meal or oral glucose load, the ensuing hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia work in concert to suppress HGP and stimulate glucose uptake by the splanchnic (liver) and peripheral (muscle) tissues. After glucose is transported into the cell, it is phosphorylated and subsequently oxidized to carbon dioxide and water or converted to glycogen, which can be stored in the liver or skeletal muscle. Glycogen synthesis is regulated by the enzyme glycogen synthase, and glycolysis primarily is controlled by the enzyme complex of pyruvate dehydrogenase. In humans, the rate of glucose oxidation and the nonoxidative glucose metabolism (primarily reflects glycogen synthesis) in the insulin-stimulated state can be estimated by indirect calorimetry or magnetic response spectroscopy. Approximately 75% of glucose is metabolized nonoxidatively, and impaired glycogen synthesis is one of the earliest metabolic defects seen in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

Intracellular pathways of glucose disposal

Under physiologic conditions, approximately two-thirds of all glucose-6-phosphate is converted to glycogen, and one-third enters glycolysis. Of the glucose that enters the glycolytic pathway, the majority (80–90%) is converted to carbon dioxide and water, whereas the remaining 10–20% is converted to lactate. Studies using indirect calorimetry and euglycemic clamp technique have shown that the glucose oxidation is more sensitive (lower half-maximum) but saturates earlier (lower maximum) than glycogen synthesis, which has low sensitivity but high capacity. Skeletal muscle is the predominant site of glycogen synthesis.

### Targeting 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the oxidative PPP sensitizes leukemia cells to antimalarial agent dihydroartemisinin [^37dd78b4]. Oncogene (2017). Low credibility.

The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is crucial for cancer cell metabolism and tumor growth. We recently reported that targeting a key oxidative PPP enzyme, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), using our novel small-molecule 6PGD inhibitors Physcion and its derivative S3, shows anticancer effects. Notably, humans with genetic deficiency of either 6PGD or another oxidative PPP enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, exhibit non-immune hemolytic anemia upon exposure to aspirin and various antimalarial drugs. Inspired by these clinical observations, we examined the anticancer potential of combined treatment with 6PGD inhibitors and antimalarial drugs. We found that stable knockdown of 6PGD sensitizes leukemia cells to antimalarial agent dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Combined treatment with DHA and Physcion activates AMP-activated protein kinase, leading to synergistic inhibition of human leukemia cell viability. Moreover, our combined therapy synergistically attenuates tumor growth in xenograft nude mice injected with human K562 leukemia cells and cell viability of primary leukemia cells from human patients, but shows minimal toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells in mice as well as red blood cells and mononucleocytes from healthy human donors. Our findings reveal the potential for combined therapy using optimized doses of Physcion and DHA as a novel antileukemia treatment without inducing hemolysis.

### Glycogen pathways in disease: new developments in a classical field of medical genetics [^aa658525]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in animal cells. Its degradation can rapidly provide fuel for energy production (particularly important in muscle), or replenish blood glucose during fasting by the liver. Genetic defects of glycogen metabolism give rise to glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), manifesting histologically in abnormal quantity or quality of glycogen in the cells. GSDs can be caused by defects of proteins participating in the synthesis or degradation of glycogen itself, in the glycolytic degradation of glucose phosphates in muscle and erythrocytes, in the release of glucose from liver and kidney into the bloodstream, in the clearance of glycogen from lysosomes (all, "primary GSDs"), or in the control of these pathways ("secondary GSDs"). Most genes responsible for classical, primary GSDs have probably been identified, and future progress in understanding the biochemical and genetic defects underlying unsolved disorders presenting with glycogen storage abnormalities will perhaps be predominantly in the field of secondary GSDs.

Immunosuppressive agents for immune-related adverse events — sulfasalazine: For mild or moderate IA (inflammatory arthritis), dosing is initial 500 mg once daily or 1 g/d in 2 divided doses; increase weekly to maintenance dose 2 g/d in 2 divided doses; maximum 3 g/d (if response to 2 g/d is inadequate after 12 weeks of treatment). Sulfasalazine tablets are contraindicated in patients with intestinal or urinary obstruction, patients with porphyria, and patients hypersensitive to sulfasalazine, its metabolites, sulfonamides, or salicylates. Additional cautions include that only after critical appraisal should sulfasalazine tablets be given to patients with hepatic or renal damage or blood dyscrasias, deaths associated with the administration of sulfasalazine have been reported, tablets should be given with caution to patients with severe allergy or bronchial asthma, adequate fluid intake must be maintained to prevent crystalluria and stone formation, patients with glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency should be observed closely for signs of hemolytic anemia, and if toxic or hypersensitivity reactions occur, the drug should be discontinued immediately.

### O-glcNAcylation of G6PD promotes the pentose phosphate pathway and tumor growth [^112fe6e5]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) plays a critical role in macromolecule biosynthesis and maintaining cellular redox homoeostasis in rapidly proliferating cells. Upregulation of the PPP has been shown in several types of cancer. However, how the PPP is regulated to confer a selective growth advantage on cancer cells is not well understood. Here we show that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP, is dynamically modified with an O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine sugar in response to hypoxia. Glycosylation activates G6PD activity and increases glucose flux through the PPP, thereby providing precursors for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis, and reducing equivalents for antioxidant defense. Blocking glycosylation of G6PD reduces cancer cell proliferation in vitro and impairs tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, G6PD glycosylation is increased in human lung cancers. Our findings reveal a mechanistic understanding of how O-glycosylation directly regulates the PPP to confer a selective growth advantage to tumours.

### Regulation of glucose metabolism from a liver-centric perspective [^fe001029]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Regulation of glycogen metabolism in the liver

The accumulation of glycogen in the liver during feeding conditions provides a storage form of glucose that can be used in times of reduced food intake (Figure 1). Multiple layers of regulation are required for this process for both the activation of glycogen synthase, which is a key enzyme of glycogenesis (glycogen synthesis), and the inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase, which is a key enzyme of glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown) in the liver. Glycogen synthase is a major enzyme that facilitates the elongation of glycogen chains by catalyzing the transfer of the glucose residue of UDP-glucose to the non-reducing end of a pre-existing glycogen branch to produce a new α1→4 glycosidic linkage. The regulation of glycogen synthase has been mostly studied using a muscle-specific isoform. In the muscle, glycogen synthase is inactivated via phosphorylation on multiple serine residues by various serine/threonine kinases such as casein kinase-1, protein kinase A (PKA), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Most notably, the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by GSK-3 at serine residues 640, 644 and 648 has been linked to the most important inhibitory post-translational modification for its catalytic activity.

### Estimating pentose phosphate pathway activity from the analysis of hepatic glycogenC-isotopomers derived from [U-C] fructose and [U-C] glucose [^91b755ee]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is an important component of hepatic intermediary metabolism. Jin et al developed an elegant 13 C-NMR method for measuring hepatic PPP flux by quantifying the distribution of glucose 13 C-isotopomers formed from [U- 13 C]glycerol. We demonstrate that this approach can be extended to exogenous [U- 13 C]fructose and [U- 13 C]glucose precursors by 13 C-NMR analysis of glycogen.

Methods

Twelve male C57BL/6 mice fed standard chow were provided a 55/45 mixture of fructose and glucose at 30% w/v in the drinking water for 18 wk. On the evening before sacrifice, the fructose component was enriched with 20% [U- 13 C]fructose for 6 mice, while the glucose component was enriched with 20% [U- 13 C]glucose for the remaining 6 mice. Mice were allowed to feed and drink naturally overnight, and then, euthanized. Livers were freeze-clamped and glycogen was extracted and derivatized for 13 C NMR spectroscopy. Flux of each sugar into the PPP relative to its incorporation into glycogen was quantified from selected 13 C glycogen isotopomer ratios.

Results

Both [U- 13 C]fructose and [U- 13 C]glucose precursors yielded glycogen 13 C-isotopomer distributions that were characteristic of PPP activity. The fraction of [U- 13 C]glucose utilized by the PPP relative to its conversion to glycogen via the direct pathway was 14 ± 1%, while that from [U- 13 C]fructose relative to its conversion to glycogen via the indirect pathway was significantly lower (10 ± 1%, P = 0.00032).

Conclusions

Hepatic PPP fluxes from both [U- 13 C]glucose and [U- 13 C]fructose precursors were assessed by 13 C NMR analysis of glycogen 13 C-isotopomers. Glucose-6-phosphate generated via glucokinase and the direct pathway is preferentially utilized by the PPP.

### Palladium-mediated enzyme activation suggests multiphase initiation of glycogenesis [^a51edcb5]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Biosynthesis of glycogen, the essential glucose (and hence energy) storage molecule in humans, animals and fungi 1, is initiated by the glycosyltransferase enzyme, glycogenin (GYG). Deficiencies in glycogen formation cause neurodegenerative and metabolic disease 2–4, and mouse knockout 5 and inherited human mutations 6 of GYG impair glycogen synthesis. GYG acts as a 'seed core' for the formation of the glycogen particle by catalysing its own stepwise autoglucosylation to form a covalently bound gluco-oligosaccharide chain at initiation site Tyr 195. Precise mechanistic studies have so far been prevented by an inability to access homogeneous glycoforms of this protein, which unusually acts as both catalyst and substrate. Here we show that unprecedented direct access to different, homogeneously glucosylated states of GYG can be accomplished through a palladium-mediated enzyme activation 'shunt' process using on-protein C-C bond formation. Careful mimicry of GYG intermediates recapitulates catalytic activity at distinct stages, which in turn allows discovery of triphasic kinetics and substrate plasticity in GYG's use of sugar substrates. This reveals a tolerant but 'proof-read' mechanism that underlies the precision of this metabolic process. The present demonstration of direct, chemically controlled access to intermediate states of active enzymes suggests that such ligation-dependent activation could be a powerful tool in the study of mechanism.

Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) supportive care — Rasburicase is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency; however, in patients with TLS at risk for end-organ injury with unknown G6PD status, the benefit of rasburicase may outweigh the risk. Rasburicase is given as a single dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg; the maximum dose is 6 mg and it should be repeated only if necessary based on laboratory values, and if used, blood samples for uric acid must be placed on ice to avoid spuriously low levels. Hyperkalemia management per Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) removes exogenous potassium sources, with frequent potassium checks (every 4–6 hours), continuous cardiac monitoring, and oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate recommended; glucose plus insulin or beta agonists can be temporizing measures, and calcium gluconate may be used to reduce dysrhythmia risk while awaiting hemodialysis and/or hemofiltration, which most effectively remove potassium. Hyperphosphatemia is managed with a phosphorus-restricted diet and consideration of phosphate binder such as sevelamer; do not use calcium carbonate in patients at risk for TLS, especially if the calcium phosphate product is > 60 mg2/dL2. For hypocalcemia, correct hyperphosphatemia and avoid calcium supplementation unless symptomatic with tetany, muscle spasm, or Trousseau/Chvostek signs. Consider hemodialysis/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for worsening renal function when electrolyte abnormalities do not correct with medical management. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Crystal structure of glycogen debranching enzyme and insights into its catalysis and disease-causing mutations [^56086433]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The overall GDE activity was assayed by following the glucose produced from glycogen phosphorylase-digested glycogen. Glycogen phosphorylase-digested glycogen was produced as described. Briefly, 1 g of oyster glycogen (Sigma) and 200 U of rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase-a (Sigma) were dissolved in 20 mL digestion buffer (0.2 M phosphate, pH 6.8), and were dialyzed against a large volume of digestion buffer at 37 °C overnight. Afterwards glycogen phosphorylase was precipitated by heating at 95 °C for 30 min and removed by centrifugation. Glycogen phosphorylase-digested glycogen was subsequently precipitated by adding 40 mL of ethanol and collected by centrifugation. Glucose production was coupled to NAD + reduction with hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the resulting absorption change at 340 nm was monitored on an ultraspec 2100 pro spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). The reaction mixture contained 16.7 mM citric acid pH 6.5, various amounts of glycogen phosphorylase-digested glycogen, 1.67 × of the hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction mix (1.67 U mL −1 hexokinase, 1.67 U mL −1 glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 2.5 mM NAD + and 1.67 mM ATP; Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.33 μM CgGDE. For reactions containing two CgGDE mutants, 0.33 μM of each mutant was added.

The interaction between glycogen and CgGDE was assayed by pull-down experiments using glycogen immobilized on concanavalin A (conA) agarose beads. 100 μl of conA agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) pre-equilibrated in the binding buffer (67 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 0.2 mM CaCl 2, 10 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM MnCl 2) were incubated with 30 mg of glycogen (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with the binding buffer, the charged beads were incubated with increasing amounts of CgGDE (25, 100 and 400 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h. Unbound CgGDE was removed by washing three times with the binding buffer, and the amount of bound CgGDE was revealed by SDS PAGE analysis with Coomassie blue staining. The assay was repeated three times with similar results. A representative uncropped scan of the SDS PAGE is presented in Supplementary Fig. 8.

### Fasting-induced protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit contributes to postprandial blood glucose homeostasis via regulation of hepatic glycogenesis [^75c523c3]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

The blood glucose level fluctuates with the fasting–feeding cycle in most animals. On feeding, the increase in postprandial blood glucose is mainly reduced by increased glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, such as liver and skeletal muscles. This process is regulated by changes in the insulin/glucagon ratio, by portal signals, and by the blood glucose concentration itself. The liver, as a glucose sensor, actively contributes to the control of postprandial blood glucose homeostasis. In particular, the liver takes up approximately one-third of the oral glucose load in the animal. In the liver, glycogen metabolism is regulated in a complex manner to maintain postprandial blood glucose homeostasis (,–). In brief, two critical enzymes are directly involved in glycogen metabolism, glycogen synthase (GS) for glycogenesis and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) for glycogenolysis. The activities of GS and GP are regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events, but in opposing directions. GS is inhibited by phosphorylation at multiple sites mediated by protein kinases, such as protein kinase A and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and activated by dephosphorylation via glycogen synthase phosphatase (GSP). On the other hand, GP is activated by phosphorylation at a single residue near the N -terminus by phosphorylase kinase and inhibited by dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). A postprandial increase in blood glucose results in an elevated intracellular concentration of glucose that binds activated GP (GPa) and promotes its dephosphorylation and inactivation, thus releasing the allosteric inhibitory effect of GPa on GSP. On the other hand, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) produced from glucose is an allosteric activator of GS, and the potency of G6P as an activator increases as GS is dephosphorylated by GSP. In addition, the postprandial increase of insulin stimulates GS by reducing its phosphorylation and inactivation by GSK3, at least in muscle. Collectively, these events converge to activate GS and inhibit GP on feeding, resulting in accumulation of liver glycogen after a meal.

### Glucose and mannose analogs inhibit KSHV replication by blocking N-glycosylation and inducing the unfolded protein response [^fbd798c2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

A better understanding of the cellular mechanisms affected by 2‐DG could offer new avenues for innovative therapies against KSHV. However, because 2‐DG inhibits glycolysis and N ‐glycosylation, it is challenging to identify its molecular targets. For this reason, we added to our study the‐mannose analog 2‐deoxy‐2‐fluoro‐‐mannose (2‐DFM), which exerts a more specific effect on N ‐glycosylation obstruction than the other two drugs. Briefly, 2‐DG is structurally equivalent to 2‐deoxy‐‐mannose and, therefore, can be incorporated into the 14‐sugar precursor (Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 ‐P‐P‐Dolichol) that is cotranslationally added to the nascent polypeptide in the ER during N ‐glycosylation, leading to its premature termination. Also, intracellular conjugation of 2‐DG to guanosine diphosphate or dolichol phosphate depletes these‐mannose‐activating precursors, further disrupting normal oligosaccharide formation.2‐FDG does suppress N ‐glycosylation, albeit with significantly lower potency than 2‐DG. It indirectly inhibits this posttranslational modification by decreasing the metabolites necessary for‐mannose transport from the cytosol into the ER and directly by competing for the glucose added at the end of the 14‐sugar precursor assembly.2‐DFM suppresses N ‐glycosylation by inhibiting mannosyl transferases indispensable for‐mannose incorporation into the 14‐sugar precursor. Unlike 2‐DG, however, it cannot be incorporated into this oligosaccharide chain and, therefore, the order of potency in disrupting N ‐glycosylation is 2‐DG > 2‐DFM > 2‐FDG.

### P-MRS of healthy human brain: measurement of guanosine diphosphate mannose at 7 T [^65a37b33]. NMR in Biomedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Guanosine diphosphate mannose (GDP-Man) is the donor substrate required for mannosylation in the synthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids and the newly discovered glycoRNA. Normal GDP-Man biosynthesis plays a crucial role in support of a variety of cellular functions, including cell recognition, cell communication and immune responses against viruses. Here, we report the detection of GDP-Man in human brain for the first time, using 31 P MRS at 7T. The presence of GDP-Man is evidenced by the detection of a weak 31 P doublet at -10.7ppm that can be assigned to the phosphomannosyl group (Pβ) of the GDP-Man molecule. This weak but well-resolved signal lies 0.9ppm upfield of UDP(G) Pβ-multiplet from a mixture of UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc. In reference to ATP (2.8 mM), the concentration of GDP-Man in human brain was estimated to be 0.02 ± 0.01 mM, about 15-fold lower than the total concentration of UDP(G) (0.30 ± 0.04, N = 17) and consistent with previous reports of UDP-Man in cells and brain tissue extracts measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The reproducibility of the measured GDP-Man between test and 2-week retest was 21% ± 15% compared with 5% ± 4% for UDP(G) (N = 7). The measured concentrations of GDP-Man and UDP(G) are linearly correlated ([UDP(G)] = 4.3 [GDP-Man]+0.02, with R = 0.66 and p = 0.0043), likely reflecting the effect of shared sugar precursors, which may vary among individuals in response to variation in nutritional intake and consumption. Given that GDP-Man has another set of doublet (Pα) at -8.3ppm that overlaps with NAD(H) and UDP(G)-Pα signals, the amount of GDP-Man could potentially interfere with the deconvolution of these mixed signals in composition analysis. Importantly, this new finding may be useful in advancing our understanding of glycosylation and its role in the development of cancer, as well as infectious and neurodegenerative diseases.

### The source of glycolytic intermediates in mammalian tissues [^6364465e]. Cell Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Glycolysis plays a central role in organismal metabolism, but its quantitative inputs across mammalian tissues remain unclear. Here we use 13 C-tracing in mice to quantify glycolytic intermediate sources: circulating glucose, intra-tissue glycogen, and circulating gluconeogenic precursors. Circulating glucose is the main source of circulating lactate, the primary end product of tissue glycolysis. Yet circulating glucose highly labels glycolytic intermediates in only a few tissues: blood, spleen, diaphragm, and soleus muscle. Most glycolytic intermediates in the bulk of body tissue, including liver and quadriceps muscle, come instead from glycogen. Gluconeogenesis contributes less but also broadly to glycolytic intermediates, and its flux persists with physiologic feeding (but not hyperinsulinemic clamp). Instead of suppressing gluconeogenesis, feeding activates oxidation of circulating glucose and lactate to maintain glucose homeostasis. Thus, the bulk of the body slowly breaks down internally stored glycogen while select tissues rapidly catabolize circulating glucose to lactate for oxidation throughout the body.
