## Question

How to treat brain fog

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat brain fog. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining brain fog and its core domains. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and common etiologies. Next, I will review the initial assessment strategy, including screening tools and red flags. After that, I need to outline etiology-specific treatments, followed by universal supportive strategies. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring and follow-up, and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check claims and correct any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm what "brain fog" means clinically. Patients use the term to describe heterogeneous subjective cognitive complaints such as forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, cognitive slowness, dissociation, communication difficulties, and mental fatigue; these experiences are common across many conditions and often co-occur with fatigue, sleep disturbance, and mood symptoms, so I need to ensure I capture both subjective and objective cognitive domains in assessment [^11188vgn] [^112Fh5Ya] [^113WkZGe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes; I should review the differential. Brain fog is reported in long COVID, hypothyroidism, fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, SLE, celiac disease, mast cell activation, vestibular disorders, migraine prodrome, substance use and withdrawal, and iatrogenic contexts like chemotherapy or gadolinium exposure, so a careful history and targeted testing are essential to avoid anchoring bias [^111doeeq] [^111TVLJu] [^114DgfeZ] [^116MQwqt] [^11229cKk] [^11544rd7] [^113pbpKy] [^1176t2Q8] [^114PycPc] [^115hWMf1].

> I will now examine the initial assessment strategy. I need to check for temporal onset, course, and triggers; screen for sleep, mood, pain, and autonomic symptoms; review medications and substances; and perform a focused neurologic exam. For screening, the MoCA can be used but has limited sensitivity for mild deficits in PASC, so if complaints persist with a normal MoCA, I should refer for formal neuropsychological testing focused on attention, processing speed, and executive function; I should also consider basic labs including CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, and inflammatory markers when indicated, and escalate to MRI or EEG if focal deficits, seizures, or atypical features are present [^113vVPr9] [^116C5Jed] [^114wHVoy] [^112CFxK2].

> Wait, let me verify etiology-specific management for long COVID–related brain fog. The evidence base is evolving, but supportive care with pacing, energy conservation, sleep optimization, and treatment of comorbidities is foundational; CBT-based approaches and structured rehabilitation programs show promise, and small studies suggest cognitive rehabilitation may improve self-reported functional cognition, though anxiety can blunt benefit; I should also consider autonomic contributors and, in selected cases, discuss investigational sympathetic modulation strategies like cervical sympathetic block or stellate ganglion block while acknowledging limited-quality evidence and the need for shared decision-making [^115kna1r] [^115FDzda] [^114LimDb] [^111jhJ2j] [^111aBYTt].

> Let me consider hypothyroidism next. I should confirm that thyroid labs are optimized and that patients are adherent; if brain fog persists despite biochemical euthyroidism, I need to check for alternative or contributing causes and consider cognitive rehabilitation, as many patients report persistent cognitive symptoms even on levothyroxine, and current evidence suggests individualized, biopsychosocial plans rather than routine switching of thyroid formulations without a clear indication [^111TVLJu] [^1146Bg1d].

> For fibromyalgia and ME/CFS, I should double-check that I am recommending a multidisciplinary approach with pacing, graded activity within limits, CBT for coping and sleep, and treatment of pain and mood comorbidities; I need to ensure I am not overpromising on pharmacotherapy, as evidence for disease-modifying drugs is limited and management remains largely supportive and symptom-targeted [^114DgfeZ] [^111q2S7e] [^117NcA3E].

> In SLE, I should confirm that routine mood screening and mental health referrals are incorporated, since "type 2" symptoms like fatigue and brain fog lack disease-specific therapies but substantially impair quality of life; I need to ensure we do not neglect these symptoms while focusing on organ disease activity [^116MQwqt] [^111rMSCK].

> For celiac disease, I need to ensure strict, supervised gluten elimination and nutritional repletion; if brain fog persists despite adherence, I should reconsider the diagnosis or look for additional contributors, as cognitive symptoms can improve with a gluten-free diet in true celiac disease but not in non-celiac gluten sensitivity where evidence remains limited [^1125Rfjd].

> In mast cell activation, I should confirm that guideline-directed therapy for systemic mastocytosis or MCAS is used, recognizing that brain fog is a recognized symptom domain; avapritinib has RCT evidence for indolent systemic mastocytosis symptom reduction, but I need to be cautious extrapolating to non-mastocytosis MCAS and tailor therapy to phenotype and severity [^11544rd7] [^114jGnpF].

> For vestibular-related cognitive complaints, I should verify vestibular function and consider vestibular rehabilitation, as emerging evidence links vestibular dysfunction to spatial and nonspatial cognitive deficits and suggests that treating the vestibular disorder may improve cognition, though data are still developing [^113pbpKy].

> In migraine, I need to check whether brain fog clusters in the prodrome and consider acute and preventive strategies that target the attack cycle; CGRP pathway modulation has been shown to impact prodromal cognitive symptoms, but I should confirm that treatment is individualized to attack phenotype and comorbidities [^1176t2Q8].

> For substance-related brain fog, I should confirm the substance, timing, and withdrawal context; management centers on cessation, supportive care, and treating withdrawal, with attention to sleep, mood, and anxiety, and I should avoid prematurely labeling persistent symptoms without reassessment over time [^notfound].

> For iatrogenic causes, I need to review medications and exposures carefully; for example, topiramate can cause cognitive slowing, and gadolinium deposition disease is treated by avoiding further GBCAs and considering chelation in selected cases, so a meticulous medication reconciliation is essential [^111AGNQg] [^115hWMf1].

> Next, I should review universal supportive strategies that apply across etiologies. Sleep optimization with CBT-I, activity pacing to avoid post-exertional crashes, stress reduction and mindfulness, nutrition with attention to micronutrients like B12, hydration, and moderate exercise as tolerated are foundational; I need to ensure these are individualized and adapted to comorbidities and baseline function [^116zU36q] [^111q2S7e] [^117NcA3E] [^114wHVoy] [^11341iQH].

> But wait, what about investigational or off-label pharmacologic options. I should be cautious: guanfacine has a mechanistic rationale for fronto-network modulation in neuroinflammatory cognitive syndromes and is being explored for long COVID brain fog, but high-quality RCT data are lacking; modafinil and stimulants are sometimes used symptomatically for fatigue and attention, yet evidence is inconsistent and adverse effects must be weighed, especially in autonomic dysfunction or anxiety [^115P2b2L] [^111q2S7e].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In older adults, I should screen for delirium, depression, medication effects, and neurodegenerative disease; in women during the menopausal transition, I should consider hormonal influences and modifiable vascular risks; in adolescents and young adults with long COVID, I should emphasize pacing, school accommodations, and mental health support while avoiding overmedicalization [^116tWGvL] [^11657yuS] [^11341iQH].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. I will track symptoms with validated tools and patient-reported outcomes, reassess for new etiologies if symptoms evolve, and adjust interventions iteratively; I should double-check that I am not anchoring on a single diagnosis when the clinical course deviates from expectations, and I will use shared decision-making to align treatment with patient goals and tolerance [^111rsUHa].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and verify it aligns with the evidence. Start with a thorough history, exam, and targeted screening; identify and treat reversible causes; implement universal supportive strategies; layer etiology-specific interventions; consider investigational therapies only when benefits outweigh risks and within appropriate oversight; and schedule regular follow-up to track trajectory and recalibrate the plan, ensuring I remain alert to functional cognitive disorders where subjective complaints exceed objective deficits and where biopsychosocial rehabilitation may be particularly helpful [^114jBFDR] [^1132i9Us].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and correct any overstatements. Evidence for brain fog treatments remains heterogeneous and often low quality; many recommendations are consensus- or practice-based rather than RCT-proven, so I need to communicate uncertainty transparently, avoid overpromising, and prioritize safety, patient preferences, and measurable functional outcomes in shared decision-making [^115kna1r] [^117TR6Df] [^113WkZGe].

Brain fog is best managed with a **multimodal, individualized approach** that targets underlying causes and supports cognitive function [^114jBFDR]. Core strategies include optimizing sleep with CBT-I [^116zU36q], regular aerobic exercise, stress reduction (mindfulness, meditation), and a Mediterranean-style diet with omega-3s and B12 [^notfound]. Cognitive rehabilitation and compensatory strategies improve daily function, while medications (modafinil, methylphenidate, guanfacine) are reserved for refractory cases with careful monitoring [^114LimDb]. Address comorbidities (fatigue, depression, anxiety, thyroid dysfunction) and use pacing to avoid post-exertional malaise [^111q2S7e]; for long COVID, consider autonomic support (fluids, compression, graded exercise) [^11341iQH] and emerging therapies such as low-dose naltrexone or stellate ganglion block in selected patients [^111jhJ2j]. Track symptoms and adjust the plan over time, as recovery is often gradual and nonlinear [^113JDxja].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

### Sleep optimization

- **CBT-I**: First-line for insomnia; improves sleep quality and cognitive function [^116zU36q].
- **Sleep hygiene**: Regular schedule, limit caffeine/alcohol, screen time, and a calming bedtime routine.
- **Melatonin**: 1–3 mg nightly may aid sleep onset and quality.

---

### Physical activity

Regular **aerobic exercise** (e.g. brisk walking, cycling, swimming) improves cognition, mood, and fatigue; begin with 10–15 minutes and progress to 30–45 minutes most days. Incorporate **resistance training** 2–3 times weekly to enhance executive function and processing speed.

---

### Stress management

Use **mindfulness meditation** (10–20 minutes daily) to reduce stress and improve attention and working memory. Practice **deep breathing** and progressive muscle relaxation to lessen anxiety and enhance mental clarity.

---

### Nutrition

Emphasize a **Mediterranean diet** rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats to support cognition. Include **omega-3 fatty acids** (1–2 g/day of EPA/DHA) for anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Ensure adequate **vitamin B12** intake through diet or supplementation, especially in older adults or those on metformin/PPIs [^114wHVoy].

---

## Cognitive rehabilitation

- **Cognitive training**: Targeted programs improve attention, memory, and executive function.
- **Compensatory strategies**: Use calendars, reminders, and task breakdown to manage daily tasks.
- **Psychoeducation**: Teach patients about brain fog and coping strategies to reduce distress.

- **Depression/anxiety**: CBT, SSRIs/SNRIs as indicated.
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Optimize thyroid replacement therapy [^notfound].
- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Fluids, compression, graded exercise [^11341iQH].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Use **regular assessment** with standardized tools (e.g. MoCA, Trail Making Test) to track cognition and adjust treatment. Provide **patient education** on symptom tracking and self-management. Maintain **multidisciplinary care** with neurology, psychiatry, psychology, and rehabilitation specialists.

---

## Emerging therapies

Investigate **neuromodulation** (tDCS, rTMS) for cognitive enhancement, and consider **personalized medicine** approaches based on biomarkers and patient characteristics.

---

Brain fog management requires a **comprehensive, individualized plan** that combines lifestyle changes, cognitive rehabilitation, and selective pharmacotherapy, with ongoing monitoring and comorbidity management to optimize recovery.

### Management of freezing of gait-mechanism-based practical recommendations [^1162atEs]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating motor symptom that commonly occurs in Parkinson disease, atypical parkinsonism and other neurodegenerative conditions. Management of FOG is complex and requires a multifaceted approach that includes pharmacological, surgical and non-pharmacological interventions. In this Expert Recommendation, we provide state-of-the-art practical recommendations for the management of FOG, based on the latest insights into the pathophysiology of the condition. We propose two complementary treatment flows, both of which are linked to the pathophysiology and tailored to specific FOG phenotypes. The first workflow focuses on the reduction of excessive inhibitory outflow from the basal ganglia through use of dopaminergic medication or advanced therapies such as deep brain stimulation and infusion therapy. The second workflow focuses on facilitation of processing across cerebral compensatory networks by use of non-pharmacological interventions. We also highlight interventions that have potential for FOG but are not supported by sufficient evidence to recommend for clinical application. Our updated recommendations are intended to enable effective symptomatic relief once FOG has developed, but we also consider potential targets for preventive approaches. The recommendations are based on scientific evidence where available, supplemented with practice-based evidence informed by our clinical experience.

### Prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog in people with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111doeeq]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Long COVID can include impaired cognition ('brain fog'; a term encompassing multiple symptoms) and mental health conditions. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate their prevalence and to explore relevant factors associated with the incidence of impaired cognition and mental health conditions.

Methods

Searches were conducted in Medline and PsycINFO to cover the start of the pandemic until August 2023. Included studies reported prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog in adults with long COVID after clinically-diagnosed or PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Findings

17 studies were included, reporting 41,249 long COVID patients. Across all timepoints (3–24 months), the combined prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog was 20·4% (95% CI 11·1%-34·4%), being lower among those previously hospitalised than in community-managed patients(19·5 vs 29·7% respectively; p = 0·047). The odds of mental health conditions and brain fog increased over time and when validated instruments were used. Odds of brain fog significantly decreased with increasing vaccination rates (p = ·000).

Conclusions

Given the increasing prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog over time, preventive interventions and treatments are needed. Research is needed to explore underlying mechanisms that could inform further research in development of effective treatments. The reduced risk of brain fog associated with vaccination emphasizes the need for ongoing vaccination programs.

### Brain fog [^112Fh5Ya]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

'Brain fog' is a term that patients use increasingly frequently in the neurology clinic. We may think that we know what patients are talking about but at least some of the time we are likely to be getting it wrong. Patients use the term 'brain fog' to describe a wide range of subjective phenomena and symptoms. This paper suggests useful lines of questioning, and discusses the clinical correlates of a range of common 'brain fog' experiences.

### Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome: brain fog phenotype, patient-centric understanding, and biopsychosocial-oriented treatment [^114jBFDR]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Post-Acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), a term used to describe ongoing symptoms following SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) infection, includes prominent neuropsychological sequela, such as a subjective sense of brain fog. Brain fog can be persistent and interfere with quality of life and daily functioning across multiple domains. Rehabilitation professionals can comprehensively address PACS-related brain fog through a biopsychosocial framework of chronic illness. Through emphasizing a patient-centric perspective, rehabilitation practitioners can understand lifestyle protective factors, as well as the reciprocal relationships between emotional processing and behaviors that potentially maintain symptomology manifesting as brain fog. However, current practice models do not fully address the biopsychosocial components for adults suffering from PACS-related brain fog. To address gaps in the literature, we present a biopsychosocial framework for PACS-related brain fog and provide treatment strategies based on evidence from current literature of neuropsychiatric sequela of mild traumatic brain injury. These recommendations will provide practice guidance to rehabilitation professionals in 1) identifying common protective factors that can be optimized in the context of persistent PACS-related brain fog and 2) addressing these symptoms via integrative interventions considering the biopsychosocial presentation of brain fog.

### Brain fog in hypothyroidism: what is It, how is It measured, and what can Be done about It [^111TVLJu]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: Some levothyroxine (LT4)-treated hypothyroid patients report a constellation of persistent and distressing cognitive symptoms that has been termed brain fog. This narrative review focuses on attempts to define and measure hypothyroid-associated brain fog, summarize possible etiologies and contributing factors, present treatment options, and propose avenues for future research. Methods: Published literature was reviewed to summarize available information on patient-reported symptoms associated with brain fog in hypothyroidism, as well as objective evidence of impairment based on neurocognitive testing and functional imaging studies. Given the limited information specific for hypothyroid-associated brain fog, relevant data from other medical conditions associated with brain fog were also reviewed and incorporated into recommendations for clinical care and future research areas. Results: Hypothyroid-associated brain fog has not been well defined or quantitated, and the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Symptoms vary among patients but commonly include fatigue, depressed mood, and cognitive difficulties in the areas of memory and executive function. Symptoms often predate the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and the magnitude of cognitive impairment can range from mild to severe. Regardless of severity, these symptoms are associated with impaired quality of life and cause dissatisfaction with treatment, so often lead to requests for alternate therapies. Disease-specific and psychological factors impact the experience of brain fog in complex ways, including potential limitations in LT4 monotherapy, self-knowledge of a disease state, and expectations for therapeutic effects. Conclusions: Brain fog is a variable symptom complex in people with hypothyroidism, causing significant distress and diminished quality of life. In the absence of proven therapies, individualized treatment plans are recommended, which incorporate thyroid-specific, general medical, and psychosocial approaches. In particular, cognitive rehabilitation is an underutilized technique that is beneficial in other medical conditions associated with brain fog and could improve symptoms in hypothyroid people. The limitations in our current knowledge and questions presented throughout this review highlight a major need for clinical research in this understudied area. Future research should include attention to standardization of survey instruments to quantitate brain fog in hypothyroid people, as well as rigorously designed intervention studies.

### Treatments for enhancing sleep quality in fibromyalgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zU36q]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

CBT

This review finds a significant beneficial effect of CBT-I on sleep quality in fibromyalgia, updating prior findings, though limited by the high overall risk of bias. This aligns with evidence from other musculoskeletal pain disorders and insomnia. While CBT-I is a first-line treatment for insomnia, its impact on objective PSG sleep measures remains unclear, reinforcing the need for studies incorporating both subjective and objective assessments. Variability in CBT-I protocols, outcome measures and control arms complicates interpretation. Scaling CBT-I is challenging due to a shortage of trained clinicians, but digital CBT-I may offer a viable alternative with comparable effectiveness. However, co-morbid symptoms like brain fog and fatigue may hinder engagement.

In contrast, CBT-P showed no significant effect on sleep. While it improves mood and pain coping in fibromyalgia, its impact on sleep is minimal. This suggests that non-pharmacological sleep interventions should target sleep directly (i.e. CBT-I) rather than indirectly through mood or pain. Notably, combined CBT-I/CBT-P did not outperform CBT-I alone.

### Freezing of gait: pharmacological and surgical options [^115S7nX3]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The primary aim of this review is to describe and update the pathophysiological and relevant therapeutic strategies for freezing of gait (FoG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

Recent Findings

FoG presumably involves dysfunction of multiple cortical and subcortical components, including dopaminergic and nondopaminergic circuits. In this regard, levodopa and physical therapy represent the first-choice therapeutic options for PD patients with FoG. However, the relationship between FoG and levodopa is not fully predictable. For those patients with levodopa-resistant FoG, there is promising but still controversial data on the benefits of bilateral high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation on the subthalamic nuclei, substantia nigra pars reticulata, pedunculopontine nucleus, and the Fields of Forel. On the other hand, general exercise, gait training with a treadmill, focus attention on gait training, and conventional physiotherapy have demonstrated moderate to large benefits in FoG.

Summary

FOG requires different treatment strategies. The inclusion of adequate detection and prediction of FoG combined with double-blind, and statistically powered protocols are needed to improve patients' quality of life, the motor and nonmotor symptoms and societal burden associated with FoG.

### A review of cognitive, sleep, and mood changes in the menopausal transition: beyond vasomotor symptoms [^11657yuS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Complaints of brain fog, mood changes, and sleep disruption are common in the menopause transition. These symptoms can negatively affect overall health, quality of life, productivity, and relationships. This narrative review addresses the epidemiology, underlying mechanisms, and treatment options associated with changes in cognition, mood, and sleep during the menopause transition. The goal is to help health care professionals recognize these symptoms, provide information and support to their patients, and use an evidence-based approach to managing these symptoms.

### Freezing of gait: moving forward on a mysterious clinical phenomenon [^113KmouV]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Freezing of gait (FoG) is a unique and disabling clinical phenomenon characterised by brief episodes of inability to step or by extremely short steps that typically occur on initiating gait or on turning while walking. Patients with FoG, which is a feature of parkinsonian syndromes, show variability in gait metrics between FoG episodes and a substantial reduction in step length with frequent trembling of the legs during FoG episodes. Physiological, functional imaging, and clinical-pathological studies point to disturbances in frontal cortical regions, the basal ganglia, and the midbrain locomotor region as the probable origins of FoG. Medications, deep brain stimulation, and rehabilitation techniques can alleviate symptoms of FoG in some patients, but these treatments lack efficacy in patients with advanced FoG. A better understanding of the phenomenon is needed to aid the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

### Could adaptive deep brain stimulation treat freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease? [^116qFdEs]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Next-generation neurostimulators capable of running closed-loop adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) are about to enter the clinical landscape for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Already promising results using aDBS have been achieved for symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and motor fluctuations. However, the heterogeneity of freezing of gait (FoG) with its wide range of clinical presentations and its exacerbation with cognitive and emotional load make it more difficult to predict and treat. Currently, a successful aDBS strategy to ameliorate FoG lacks a robust oscillatory biomarker. Furthermore, the technical implementation of suppressing an upcoming FoG episode in real-time represents a significant technical challenge. This review describes the neurophysiological signals underpinning FoG and explains how aDBS is currently being implemented. Furthermore, we offer a discussion addressing both theoretical and practical areas that will need to be resolved if we are going to be able to unlock the full potential of aDBS to treat FoG.

### Towards adaptive deep brain stimulation for freezing of gait [^117Spjpt]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

How to optimize deep brain stimulation to better treat freezing of gait?

Once a biomarker is detected, one way to improve DBS is to change the stimulation to a predefined pattern that is more suitable for the specific clinical state. Low-frequency stimulation (generally 60 Hz or 80 Hz) may help some patients with axial symptoms. However in this study,60 Hz stimulation did not reduce freezing episodes compared to 130 Hz stimulation. Stimulating the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) has been shown to improve temporal parameters of gaitand combining low-frequency SNr stimulation and high-frequency STN stimulation may have a synergistic effect for some patients. Recently, Fischer et al.found that alternating stimulation between the left and right STN in a rhythm close to the natural stepping frequency, which resembles the endogenous STN modulation pattern observed during stepping, could entrain patients' stepping movements. It remains to be tested if this new biomimetic stimulation pattern can facilitate rhythmic movements during free walking and thus reduce freezing.

Another way to improve DBS is to specifically target pathological brain signals by optimizing the precise pattern of stimulation. In this case, the brain signal must not merely correlate with the clinical state, but must also cause it in order to be a legitimate target. FoG can be triggered by multiple scenarios, including encountering a narrow doorway. If we can understand what causes FoG in response to sensory inputs or increased cognitive demands, we could develop tailored stimulation patterns involving cross-site sensing and stimulation that can modulate local synchrony as well as cross-site functional connectivity. Such an approach has the potential to probe the causal relationship between different neural signatures and freezing, and may also open up new therapeutic avenues.

In summary, to improve DBS for better treatment of FoG, a more detailed understanding of the pathological brain signals underlying this symptom and more research on novel stimulation patterns and targets will be required.

### Menopause and brain fog: how to counsel and treat midlife women [^116tWGvL]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Brain fog, referring to menopause-related subjective cognitive difficulties, is common in midlife women. Longitudinal studies find small but reliable declines in objective memory performance as women transition into perimenopause, and these are not explained by advancing age alone. When memory declines occur, performance levels remain within normal limits for all but a very small number of women. Women's experience of brain fog extends beyond memory complaints, reflecting the negative effect on a broad range of cognitive abilities. Clinicians can counsel women about how menopause symptoms, estrogen, hormone therapy, and modifiable risk factors (eg, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle) can influence cognitive health.

### Brain fog in central disorders of hypersomnolence: a review [^113WkZGe]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Brain fog is an undefined term describing a cluster of symptoms related to fatigue and impaired memory, attention, and concentration. Brain fog or brain fog-like symptoms have been reported in central disorders of hypersomnolence and in a range of seemingly unrelated disorders, including coronavirus disease 2019, major depressive disorder, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and celiac disease. This narrative review summarizes current evidence and proposes a consensus definition for brain fog. Brain fog is prevalent in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, with more than three-quarters of patients with either disorder reporting this symptom in a registry study; it has also been reported as particularly difficult to treat in idiopathic hypersomnia. Studies directly evaluating brain fog are rare; tools for evaluating this symptom cluster typically are patient reports, with few objective measures validated in any disorder. Evaluating brain fog is further complicated by confounding symptoms, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, which is a hallmark of hypersomnolence disorders. No treatments specifically address brain fog. The paucity of literature, assessment tools, and medications for brain fog highlights the need for research leading to better disambiguation and treatment. Until a clear consensus definition is established, we propose brain fog in hypersomnia disorders be defined as a cognitive dysfunction that may or may not be linked with excessive sleepiness, related to an underlying neuronal dysfunction, which reduces concentration and impairs information processing, leading to a complaint of lack of clarity of mental thinking and awareness.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves Parkinson's freezing of gait via normalizing brain connectivity [^113NkPiW]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Freezing of gait (FOG), characterized by sudden and brief episodes of inability to produce effective forward stepping, is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is a major risk factor for falls and contributes greatly to reduced mobility and quality of life. Treatment of FOG is very challenging, as evidence for pharmacological treatment, deep brain stimulation, and rehabilitation strategies is inconclusive. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive neural modulation technique, has been used as a treatment for various neurologic and psychiatric disorders. A recent meta-analysis carried out by Wagle et al.demonstrated that rTMS therapy improves general motor symptoms and can be used as a potential adjunct therapy for PD patients. However, it is suggested that future studies are warranted to specifically examine rTMS effects on particular clinical features of PD, including FOG.

### Hepatitis C: what is the best treatment? [^114PtSQG]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2004). Low credibility.

The treatment of hepatitis C is expensive, difficult and arduous from the patient's perspective. It is similarly difficult for the clinician to decide who and when to treat. If hepatitis C is viewed from the liver's perspective we need only treat those patients who will develop the complications of chronic liver disease within their lifetimes. If we take a more holistic approach, then we have to consider the implications of being a carrier of a potentially transmissible blood borne virus on the patient themselves, their relationships, their families and their sense of wellbeing. There is now evidence of the large impact HCV has on quality of life and we have to consider extra hepatic manifestations of hepatitis C infection, possibly including the syndrome of 'brain fog' recently described. An additional factor that has to be considered in the decision to treat is whether patients perceive hepatitis C as a significant problem for themselves. For some patients, who have chaotic live styles, it is extremely difficult to get them to access healthcare. To then undergo the rigors and tribulations of hepatitis C therapy that is posing no current problem is unlikely to succeed. However, failure to engage these patients with therapy will lead to a significant proportion of them presenting with serious complications of chronic liver disease, with its attendant mortality, morbidity and cost. Underlying all these considerations is the tension between the costs of therapy and the benefits of therapy. Good arguments can be made in terms of cost-effectiveness for treating patients with a high likelihood of progressing to chronic liver disease and its complications. These arguments become much less persuasive when all patients are concerned.

### Physiology of freezing of gait [^111k2afx]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and debilitating, but largely mysterious, symptom of Parkinson disease. In this review, we will discuss the cerebral substrate of FOG focusing on brain physiology and animal models. Walking is a combination of automatic movement processes, afferent information processing, and intentional adjustments. Thus, normal gait requires a delicate balance between various interacting neuronal systems. To further understand gait control and specifically FOG, we will discuss the basic physiology of gait, animal models of gait disturbance including FOG, alternative etiologies of FOG, and functional magnetic resonance studies investigating FOG. The outcomes of these studies point to a dynamic network of cortical areas such as the supplementary motor area, as well as subcortical areas such as the striatum and the mesencephalic locomotor region including the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). Additionally, we will review PPN (area) stimulation as a possible treatment for FOG, and ponder whether PPN stimulation truly is the right step forward. Ann Neurol 2016;80:644–659.

### A meta-analysis identifies factors predicting the future development of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^111xYCK3]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Freezing of gait (FOG) is an extremely debilitating problem that is common among people with Parkinson's disease (PD). FOG is characterized by episodes in which walking cannot start or is interrupted, despite the effort to move forward. This severely impairs function, independence, and quality of life. FOG is considered the leading contributor to falls in PD, further contributing to its major negative impact –.

Multiple theories and models have been proposed to explain the causes of FOG. however, the precise mechanisms that trigger FOG are not yet well understood. Many attempts at ameliorating FOG frequency and severity have also been made. These include anti-parkinsonian medications, cueing, exercise, and invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation. In addition, interventions designed to ameliorate FOG severity by treating anxiety and depression or improving executive function and other cognitive domains have been investigated. While FOG may partially be resolved in response to these therapies, it generally persists and worsens over time, with minimal or no long-term resolution. The sheer number of approaches and unsuccessful studies underscores both the clinical significance of FOG and the absence of an effective therapeutic approach.

To make a robust, clinically meaningful impact, we suggest, therefore, that an "upstream" approach to treating FOG may be needed: prevention. Treating FOG before it occurs has not yet been attempted, likely for several reasons. Prevention requires relatively long, prospective studies. Moreover, it is not yet clear how FOG could be prevented. Still, if modifiable, early signs can be identified, this could, perhaps, lead to the targeted application of FOG prevention among patients who have a greater risk of developing FOG. A growing number of observational studies have prospectively evaluated factors associated with FOG incidence, providing a timely opportunity to review the literature and to start to consider the possibility of preventing or lowering the risk of the development of FOG. Briefly, several factors have been suggested to be associated with FOG incidence. These include, for example, longer disease duration, increased depression or anxiety, higher levels of levodopa daily equivalent dose, reduced sleep quality, worse cognitive function, and the PIGD motor subtype –. Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies, we aimed to summarize and synthesize studies that report on the risk factors and potential early signs of the future development of FOG, among patients with PD who do not yet have FOG.

### Dialysis and cognitive impairment [^1157PJj3]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

People with chronic kidney disease who require maintenance dialysis characteristically experience accelerated and aggravated cognitive decline compared with those with advanced kidney disease who are not receiving this form of kidney replacement therapy. This effect is inadequately appreciated, but of crucial importance to patients, their carers and the health-care systems that support them. Although many of the comorbid conditions prevalent in this patient population have the potential to affect brain structure and function, an evolving body of evidence indicates that the dialysis therapy itself has a central role in the pathophysiology of progressive cognitive impairment. Both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are associated with structural and functional changes in the brain that can lead to characteristic short-term symptoms, such as headache, confusion, delirium and brain fog, as well as long-term reductions in cognitive functional ability. Here, we explore the mechanisms, both established and putative, underlying these effects and consider approaches to addressing this issue with both single and complex therapeutic interventions.

### Current concepts in long COVID-19 brain fog and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^114w2Fji]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Neurologic complications of long COVID-19 syndrome are one of the leading causes of global disability. In particular, post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction and dysautonomia in the form of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) markedly affect patient quality of life and ability to return to work. The underlying pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurologic complications is unknown but is likely multifactorial with immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction playing central roles. Specific pathogenic factors with supportive evidence to date include cytokine-mediated inflammation, autoantibodies, immune exhaustion, disruption of the renin-angiotensin system, reduced serotonin levels, and microglial activation. The prevalence of post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction ranges from 10% to 88% and is affected by viral variant and hospitalization status among other factors, whereas that of long COVID-19 POTS is unknown due to referral bias and varying definitions. Treatment is largely supportive and often incorporates combined modalities. Marginal benefits with cognitive behavioral therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and supplements have been found for post-COVID-19 brain fog, whereas established POTS therapies aimed at improving venous return and reducing heart rate may reduce symptoms of long COVID-19 POTS. Although significant recovery has been noted for many cases of post-COVID-19 brain fog and POTS, prospective studies have revealed evidence of persistent symptoms and neurologic deficits a year after infection in some patients. Further studies that provide insight into the underlying pathophysiology of long COVID-19 are needed for development of target directed therapy.

### Cognitive symptoms of post-COVID-19 condition and daily functioning [^1143rfR3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this survey study suggest that cognitive symptoms represent common features of post–COVID-19 condition, encompassing impairments often characterized by the widely used lay term brain fog. In light of their marked association with poorer functioning and quality of life, these symptoms represent important targets for assessment and identifying scalable interventions to remediate cognitive dysfunction in post–COVID-19 condition.

### Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^114fZ8hL]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Freezing of Gait (FOG) is one of the most disabling and least understood symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), and is usually observed in the advanced stage of the disease. FOG can be experienced on turning, in narrow spaces, whilst reaching a destination, and in stressful situations. FOG is commonly observed in the "off" state, but it can also be observed in the "on" state. Dual tasking (cognitive load) aggravates FOG. Visual or auditory cues often resolve FOG. Analysis of gait revealed that the rhythm of stepping suddenly jumps into high frequency (4–5 Hz) in FOG (hastening), and that floor reaction forces are disregulated. Stride-to-stride variability is increased in FOG. Hastening phenomenon was reported not only in PD patients but also in patients with striatal lesions. The basal ganglia and its frontal projections may be one of the essential lesion sites for FOG. A recent study using single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) revealed enhanced lateral premotor cortex (PMC) activity during paradoxical gait in PD, suggesting that PMC can compensate for the impaired function of the medial frontal cortex when cued by visual input. Treatment of FOG includes behavioural, medical, and surgical approaches. Tricks of all kinds (including external cues) are effective therapeutic approaches. If FOG occurs predominantly in the "off" state, dopaminergic therapy can be increased. For "on" freezing or if "on" response is otherwise optimised, the dose of the dopaminergic agent may be manipulated, but it could lead to the deterioration of parkinsonism. Deep brain stimulation of the STN often alleviates FOG in the "off" state.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^114DgfeZ]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

CFS is a heterogenous disorder with disabling fatigue, as well as chronic pain, headaches, sleep disturbances, autonomic/neuroendocrine/immune manifestations and cognitive fog. A multidisciplinary approach to therapy has been proposed, including CBT, physiotherapy, exercise therapy and pacing strategies. To date, there are no recommended pharmacological treatments for CFS.

FM is characterized by widespread pain, along with multiple other symptoms including fatigue and cognitive fog. As in CFS, a multidisciplinary approach to management is recommended, often accessed through chronic pain clinics. This approach may include non-pharmacologic management including education around pacing, CBT and exercise.

Although the pathophysiology of FM is not completely understood, there is evidence that FM may have a neuropathic pain component, and there may be a deficit in central nervous system inhibition. Treatments aimed at modulating cortical excitability, both pharmacologic and non-invasive brain stimulation, appear to be effective in symptom improvement. A number of pharmacologic treatments have been studied. A meta-analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in pain intensity with the use of pregabalin for a small proportion of patients (10%). Pregabalin exerts its therapeutic effect by modulating cortical excitability, increasing the cortical silent period and the short intracortical inhibition. Meanwhile, a meta-analysis of seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials investigating the use of duloxetine for FM found it to be more effective than placebo at improving pain, but with considerable risk of side effects. The analgesic effect of duloxetine may be linked to changes in frontal quantitative EEG. The combination of pregabalin and duloxetine has been shown to be more effective than pregabalin monotherapy. Only very low-quality evidence for the use of gabapentin in FM exists, and thus there is uncertainty about the risk–benefit ratio.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves Parkinson's freezing of gait via normalizing brain connectivity [^114TXru8]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Though our prior study investigated the clinical effects of rTMS therapy on FOG in PD patients, however, the underlying neural mechanisms of rTMS-induced improvements need to be further addressed. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) proves valuable in understanding the pathophysiology of some features of PD, including FOG –. This non-invasive method infers neural activity from spontaneous blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations. Functional connectivity can be inferred from spatially distinct brain regions that show temporally correlated time courses during rest. In this study, we aim to explore the neural mechanisms of rTMS treatments utilizing rs-fMRI techniques. More specifically, in order to establish if rTMS over SMA works on FOG specifically or on PD generally (or both), we applied novel exploratory multivariate approaches to identify the imaging biomarkers for FOG (FOGbm) and PD (PDbm) by contrasting the functional connections in datasets from PD patients with FOG (PD-FOG) to those without FOG (PD-noFOG) and normal controls (NC), respectively. Next, we studied the effects of high-frequency rTMS on the aforementioned two imaging biomarkers. We hypothesized that at least one biomarker would be improved, which would indicate that the abnormal brain connectivity pattern of PD-FOG was normalized or modulated by the utilization of rTMS over SMA.

### Cervical sympathetic block to treat long COVID: a scoping review [^111jhJ2j]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Long COVID is a complex and poorly understood condition characterized by persistent symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, neurocognitive impairment, and olfactory disturbances. Current treatments offer limited and inconsistent benefits. Dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system is increasingly recognized as a contributor to Long COVID pathophysiology. Cervical sympathetic block (CSB), a procedure that modulates sympathetic tone, has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach.

Objective

To review the existing literature on CSB, for Long COVID, focusing on symptom outcomes, proposed mechanisms, and procedural considerations.

Evidence Review

A structured literature search across PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science identified studies published between 2022 and March 2025 reporting on CSB in adults with Long COVID. Eligible articles included case reports, case series, observational studies, and one randomized controlled trial evaluating symptom outcomes after the procedure.

Findings

Sixteen studies involving 224 patients were included. Most reported improvement in fatigue, brain fog, and autonomic symptoms, including reduced heart rate and enhanced orthostatic tolerance. Cognitive and psychiatric symptoms such as memory impairment, anxiety, and depression showed variable improvement. Olfactory recovery was inconsistent and appeared to depend on symptom severity. Symptom relief was observed after both unilateral and bilateral blocks, with some responses lasting up to 1 year. No serious complications were reported.

Conclusions

CSB may offer symptom relief in Long COVID, particularly for fatigue, brain fog, and dysautonomia. However, the evidence remains preliminary and limited by small sample sizes and methodological heterogeneity. Controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy and patient selection criteria.

### Long COVID: rapid evidence review [^113JDxja]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Postacute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as long COVID, affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days. The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and does not require a prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm infection. Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anosmia, chest pain, cognitive impairment (brain fog), dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, insomnia, mood changes, palpitations, paresthesias, and postexertional malaise. The presentation is variable, and symptoms can fluctuate or persist and relapse and remit. The diagnostic approach is to differentiate long COVID from acute sequelae of COVID-19, previous comorbidities, unmasking of preexisting health conditions, reinfections, new acute concerns, and complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation. Many presenting symptoms of long COVID are commonly seen in a primary care practice, and management can be improved by using established treatment paradigms and supportive care. Although several medications have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to long COVID, the evidence for their use is currently lacking. Holistic treatment strategies for long COVID include discussion of pacing and energy conservation; individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity programs; maintaining adequate hydration and a healthy diet; and treatment of underlying medical conditions.

### Ubrogepant for the treatment of migraine prodromal symptoms: an exploratory analysis from the randomized phase 3 PRODROME trial [^1176t2Q8]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Migraine is a common, globally recognized, neurological disorder characterized by recurrent disabling attacks involving headache and symptoms of brain dysfunction. The attack has recognized phases: premonitory (prodrome), aura, headache and postdrome, which, although distinctive, can overlap. The canonical manifestations of an attack — lateralized, throbbing headache with associated sensitivity to light (photophobia), sound (phonophobia) and head movement — have received considerable attention for the last three decades as treatments aimed at the headache phase of the attack were developed. The identification of the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and the utility of CGRP blockers for both acute and preventive treatment of migraineoffer the possibility of exploring migraine pathophysiology with new tools.

Migraine symptoms that can occur in the premonitory phase (prodrome) fall broadly into three groups: first, higher center, such as cognitive impairment, manifests as difficulty concentrating or thinking — brain fog as it is often labeled by patients — and fatigue. Second, symptoms broadly reflect homeostatic dysfunction, such as food cravings or polyuria and, third, symptoms usually associated with the headache phase can occur in the premonitory phase, such as sensitivity to light (photophobia) or sound (phonophobia). Prodromal symptoms are highly predictive of impending headacheand are generally considered to be common when enquired after in adults, and children. Functional brain imaging has identified activations in the central nervous system, such as the hypothalamic region, in the premonitory phase. Mapping symptoms to imaging findings suggests central nervous system origins for the migraine attack, with implications for understanding the pathophysiology and, importantly, where to target therapies.

### Holistic approaches in systemic lupus erythematosus: do physicians avoid addressing difficult-to-treat but highly relevant symptoms? [^111rMSCK]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite advancements in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), patients experience poor health-related quality of life (hrQoL) and premature death due to disease severity and treatment side effects. Achieving remission offers substantial benefits, including improved hrQoL and reduced mortality, yet the complexity of SLE, with its diverse underlying immune mechanisms and clinical manifestations, hampers progress. Involvement of the central nervous system with symptoms like fatigue, pain and brain fog often goes unaddressed due to limited evidence-based guidance and measurement tools. This neglect reflects gaps in training, discomfort in addressing untreatable symptoms and an overemphasis on evidence-based medicine, compromising holistic care. Recognising patient-reported outcomes has shifted SLE care towards a more patient-centred model, addressing hrQoL and aligning treatment goals. Embracing this approach and prioritising symptom management, even when a definitive cure is lacking, ensures compassionate, comprehensive care that improves adherence, satisfaction and the overall lived experience of patients with SLE.

### How resistant are levodopa-resistant axial symptoms? Response of freezing, posture, and voice to increasing levodopa intestinal infusion rates in parkinson disease [^115Bacht]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

These data suggest that, in most advanced patients treated with LCIG, episodes of FoG presenting in a practical daily‐ON condition can benefit from an increase in the levodopa dose, pointing toward a relative rather than an absolute FoG resistance to levodopa. Conversely, in a few cases, our data support the hypothesis of the existence of rare cases of FoG induced by high doses of levodopa, with a different threshold for each patient.

A role of maladaptive plasticity caused by long‐term levodopa treatment, resulting in a mismatch between understimulated motor loops and activated nonmotor loops, could be implicated in the difficulty of managing axial symptoms in advanced PD phases, so that increasingly higher dopamine concentrations are required to overcome thresholds of postsynaptic receptors within the motor circuitry. Thus, a new activation of aberrant loops could be overcome by a substantial increase in the dopaminergic dose or by a different type of stimulation of the dopaminergic networks (e.g. deep brain stimulation or LCIG). A certain degree of efficacy in treating FoG by continuous dopaminergic stimulation has already been described as superior to the pulsatile effect typical of oral therapy even in the absence of significant dose changes.

### Directional subthalamic deep brain stimulation better improves gait and balance disorders in Parkinson's disease patients: a randomized controlled study [^113tRj75]. Annals of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gait and balance disorders represent the main motor disabilities in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease (PD), with freezing of gait (FOG) episodes and falls reported in 50 to 70% of patients after 10 years of disease duration.FOG and falls show only partial and inconsistent improvement with dopamine replacement therapy and become increasingly resistant to pharmacological interventions as the disease progresses. This results in a significant burden on patients, impacting their quality of life and increasing the rates of institutionalization, morbidity, and mortality. Although the neural underlying mechanisms of FOG and falls are not yet fully understood, recent studies have reported structural and functional anomalies in a number of brain regions including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPF), as well as the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR).

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for alleviating motor and non‐motor symptoms of PD. On average, STN‐DBS improves significantly FOG. However, approximately 1 of 3 PD patients show residual, worsened, or de novo FOG after surgery. Advanced age, dysexecutive syndrome, prior FOG (OFF‐DOPA), and specific DBS parameter settings have been linked to an increased risk of post‐operative FOG. However, the precise factors contributing to post‐operative FOG for individual patients remain incompletely identified. In a prior retrospective cohort study we showed that the best FOG alleviation with STN‐DBS is achieved when stimulating contacts are positioned within the central part of the STN. Another retrospective study showed that FOG improvement was obtained when stimulating contacts were preferentially localized in the posterior‐central two‐thirds of the STN. Such FOG improvement was also related to the recruitment by the STN‐DBS of the right primary sensorimotor, premotor, and SMA cortico‐subthalamic streamlines while avoiding prefrontal cortices.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^113a1cmF]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the abundance of promising short-term evidence in supporting the use of ketogenic diets for diabetes management, especially for T2DM, there is a still a paucity of research to support the long-term efficacy and safety in a variety of cohorts to broadly recommend as a therapeutic approach for diabetes management at a population level. For balance it is important to point out this is true for all dietary approaches for diabetes management due to the logistic problems in long-term studies. The lack of adherence and non-compliance is a limiting factor of ketogenic diets which is one contributor to the lack of long-term studies for diabetes management. It has been shown that adherence can be improved through intervention of psychological support and reinforcing mindful eating and other behavioural adherence strategies. A study highlights the importance of adequate lifestyle support from healthcare professionals when individuals embark on a ketogenic diet to improve diabetes management, with an increase of non-adherence and dropout rates when lifestyle support was stopped. The social impact of reducing a main source of food for many is a major contributor to non-adherence as many social events revolve around consuming carbohydrate-rich food.

Non-adherence may also be attributable to the side effects experienced from ketogenic diets, a temporary experience so common it has been coined "keto flu". This phenomenon primarily includes neurological symptoms such as headache, brain fog and dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and constipation which is positively related to the degree of nutritional ketosis reached.

### Chronic fatigue in cancer survivorship: psychiatry versus oncology or psychiatry with oncology? [^111q2S7e]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Institute of Medicine Report (2015): In the absence of APA/WPA guidelines, the IOM's expert panel report serves as a de facto guide in the U.S. The IOM re-defined ME/CFS with the term "systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID)" and established updated diagnostic criteria, underscoring core features like post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), and orthostatic intolerance. The report validated that ME/CFS is a real, biological illness – not a merely psychosomatic condition – and called for greater clinician education and research investment. For management, the IOM similarly highlighted pacing of activities, symptomatic treatments, and CBT as a supportive therapy. It did not endorse any specific pharmacotherapy for fatigue, noting that trials of drugs such as rintatolimod or various stimulants had shown inconsistent results. The IOM's conclusions align with the current ethos: management should be personalized, holistic, and supportive. The CDC's recommendations echo these principles, emphasizing adequate rest, activity management (pacing), counselling for coping strategies, and treating comorbid issues. Patients may benefit from psychological support (e.g. therapy or support groups) to help cope with the impact of chronic fatigue on mental health and daily function (Abrahams et al. 2018). Psychiatrists can play a key role in addressing secondary depression or anxiety, and in working as part of a multidisciplinary team to support the patient's overall well-being.

In summary, official guidelines for chronic fatigue (ME/CFS) stress a cautious, patient-tailored approach: diagnose early, rule out other causes, validate the patient's experience, and focus on improving quality of life through pacing and symptom management. Overly aggressive exercise programs are contraindicated, and while behavioural interventions like CBT or graded activity had been mainstays in older guidance, they are now considered supportive at best (and potentially harmful if misapplied)​. The shift in ME/CFS guidelines highlights the field's recognition that chronic fatigue in this context has multifactorial biological underpinnings, requiring a management strategy distinct from the approach to fatigue in other illnesses such as cancer. To synthesize the above, Table 4 presents key points from prominent official guidance on ME/CFS.\.

### Scientific rationale for the use of α ₂ A-adrenoceptor agonists in treating neuroinflammatory cognitive disorders [^115P2b2L]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

As will be described in detail below, research has shown that the selective noradrenergic α2A-adrenoceptor (α2A-AR) agonist, guanfacine, can strengthen PFC network connections and improve PFC cognitive functioning by regulating cAMP-calcium signaling. Based on this research, extended release guanfacine was approved by the FDA in 2009 for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which is characterized by PFC deficits. Guanfacine is also being used off-label and/or being tested to treat cognitive deficits in a variety of neuroinflammatory disorders including traumatic brain injury (TBI), delirium (post-anesthetic or infectious), and cognitive deficits from long-COVID ("brain fog"). However, the scientific bases for guanfacine's actions in these disorders are generally not understood, as this research has arisen from multiple, and often disparate, disciplines. While many scientists and physicians are aware of how stimulation of presynaptic α2A-AR autoreceptors reduces NE release from the sympathetic nervous system, they are often unaware of important, post-synaptic α2A-AR actions in brain that are especially relevant to cognitive functioning. The current review describes new data on why PFC circuits are so vulnerable to neuroinflammation, and how α2A-AR stimulation can coordinate a "safety signal" across the neuroaxis and the immune system that helps to restore normative brain and inflammatory functioning needed for healthy cognition.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^115kna1r]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Long covid can comprise several distinct phenotypes, and we anticipated that the effects of interventions might differ based on the predominant symptoms patients experience. Accordingly, based on previous classifications of long covid and the eligibility criteria of trials, we categorised trials as including patients with either general symptoms such as fatigability and an impairment in functional capacity to perform routine activities of daily living, primarily respiratory sequelae characterized by dyspnoea, or primarily neurological or cognitive sequelae characterized by cognitive impairments and brain fog.

We also anticipated that the effects of interventions might depend on diagnostic criteria for long covid, severity of acute covid-19 infection, time since infection, number of infections, vaccination status, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. When reported, we extracted stratified data based on these factors for subgroup analyses.

In response to growing concerns about untrustworthy trial publications, reviewers applied the trustworthiness in randomised controlled trials (TRACT) checklist to assess each trial for signs of data fabrication, data falsification (manipulation of data or results), and errors in the conduct of the trial or analysis of data that could undermine the conclusions, such as confusing standard errors with standard deviations and misclassification of intervention and control groups. This checklist includes 19 items in seven domains: governance, author group, plausibility of intervention, timeframe, dropouts, baseline characteristics, and outcomes. The checklist does not include a cut-off at which a trial is considered suspicious, and experience in applying the checklist to systematic reviews is currently limited. Therefore, the core authorship group reviewed all trials flagged as having potential concerns in one or more domain and identified those they considered untrustworthy by consensus.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^116MQwqt]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Scope of recommendations — covered topics, mental health, and APS/pregnancy boundaries: Treatment for all people with SLE regardless of age, ancestry, or other individual patient variables is presented here, and general and organ-specific treatment recommendations and monitoring are offered, except for LN, which is addressed in a separate guideline; we do not offer guidance on diagnosis of SLE and do not include recommendations for the treatment of certain broader and/or less well understood SLE-related issues including "type 2" SLE symptoms, mental health issues, and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). "Type 2" SLE symptoms, including fatigue, generalized pain, and brain fog, impact quality of life for individuals with SLE, and the pathophysiology and optimal treatment of "type 2" symptoms are incompletely understood and are acknowledged as a high research priority; no specific recommendations are offered, but we suggest that routine mood screening and attention to mental health should ideally be incorporated into general SLE care, with appropriate referrals to specialists when indicated. Presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) impacts therapy considerations for patients with SLE, this guideline does not include specific recommendations for APS; while often overlapping with SLE, therapy and management of APS are beyond the scope of this SLE treatment guideline, and recommendations regarding SLE treatment options during pregnancy are not included; they are addressed in the ACR's guideline for the management of reproductive health in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.

### Unraveling brain fog in post-COVID syndrome: relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and cognitive function, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^116C5Jed]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

These findings have important practical implications. According to our findings, "brain fog" may be interpreted as the result of two main processes: objective cognitive impairment and fatigue. Regarding the other factors, only depression showed an influence mediated by fatigue. This underscores the importance of comprehensive cognitive (especially attention and processing speed and episodic memory) and fatigue assessments in patients reporting subjective cognitive complaints. Thus, a report of brain fog in the context of a neuropsychological assessment within normal limits should suggest a greater role of cognitive fatigue and vice versa. In this regard, the combination of cognitive testing, fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms is necessary when evaluating patients reporting cognitive complaints. Cognitive testing should be focused on attention and processing speed tests (e.g. Stroop, SDMT), but other tests should also be necessary to evaluate the state of the other cognitive domains and for differential diagnosis. Furthermore, mediation analysis suggests that future studies to alleviate brain fog in these patients should focus on the improvement of cognitive functioning and fatigue. In this regard, some clinical trials on cognitive training and/or non‐invasive brain stimulation have shown positive results. Further studies examining the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms in PCS patients and the relationship between fatigue and depression are also necessary. Due to the weak effect of depressive symptoms, antidepressant therapies could not have a direct role in brain fog but might have an indirect role by modulating fatigue. Overall, the interplay among cognitive deficits, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric symptoms should be considered in the design of future clinical trials addressing brain fog and PCS. In addition, quantitative assessment of peripheral fatigue, the consideration of previous therapies during the acute and post‐acute phase (e.g. corticosteroids), and immune dysregulation and endocrine system status (e.g. the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis) may be of interest in future studies to further understand the complexities of fatigue and cognitive function.

### Human schwann cell exosome treatment attenuates secondary injury mechanisms, histopathological consequences, and behavioral deficits after traumatic brain injury [^111rFW7f]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global epidemic that affects more than 50 million individuals each year. TBI results in a combination of extensive neurological, emotional, and functional consequences, ranging from mild headache, sleep disturbances, and cognitive fog, to those much more severe, including amnesia, aphasia, emotional disorders, motor dysfunction, coma, or brain death. Furthermore, symptoms may be transient or permanent, and often exacerbate due to the progressive nature of injurious mechanisms. Injury-induced alterations result from the primary mechanical injury that occurs at the time of trauma, which is characterized by tissue deformation, shearing and sliding of the parenchyma, as well as vascular rupture. At the immediate onset of the injury, an extensive array of secondary injury mechanisms commences and can persist for decades. Detrimental secondary mechanisms after TBI are multifold and complex. While prevention, such as continued safety education on the importance of wearing seat belts and helmets are strategies for proactively addressing the potential occurrence of primary injuries, secondary injury mechanisms still lack defined treatment strategies.

### Clearing the air: a review of our current understanding of "chemo fog" [^113FNUZD]. Current Oncology Reports (2013). Low credibility.

An increasing number of cancer survivors has led to a greater interest in the long-term side effects of cancer treatments and their impact on quality of life. In particular, cognitive impairments have been frequently reported by cancer survivors as an adverse effect which they attribute to the neurotoxicity of chemotherapy and have dubbed "chemobrain" or "chemo fog". Research within the past 15–20 years has explored the many factors thought to contribute to cancer-related cognitive decline in an attempt to determine a potential cause. In spite of many confounding factors, there is growing evidence that the neurotoxicity of chemotherapy does contribute to cognitive changes. This review examines the evolution of "chemo fog" research with a look at methodological issues, the status of our current understanding, and suggestions for future research.

### Effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus on freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease: a prospective controlled study [^114zSQZf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating gait disorder in Parkinson's disease (PD) with partial responsiveness to dopaminergic medication. To date, notions about the effects of subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) on FOG remain controversial.

Objectives

To compare the effects of bilateral STN-DBS and continued best medical treatment (BMT) on FOG occurrence, FOG severity and clinical outcomes in PD patients at 6 and 12months follow-up.

Methods

In this prospective, controlled study, 41 PD patients with at least 5years disease duration participated. Twenty-four subjects (20 with FOG) were treated with STN-DBS and seventeen (15 with FOG) continued BMT. The primary outcome was the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOGQ) at 6months postsurgery. Other outcomes were the NFOGQ at 12months and clinical outcomes (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III), timed gait, falls and quality of life) at both time points.

Results

STN-DBS increased the likelihood to convert from being a freezer to a non-freezer at 6 and 12months follow-up (relative risk reduction = 0.4). However, 45% of baseline freezers still experienced FOG 6 and 12months postsurgery although with reduced severity. Three baseline non-freezers (1/2 BMT-treated, 2/4 STN-DBS-treated) developed FOG during follow-up. STN-DBS-induced benefits on FOG were mostly mediated by baseline levodopa equivalent dose, altered medication-intake and reduced motor fluctuations.

Conclusions

In contrast to continued BMT, STN-DBS reduced FOG occurrence and severity at 6months postsurgery with largely sustained effects at 12months follow-up. Longer follow-up periods are needed to test whether FOG improvements after STN-DBS persist with disease progression.

### Brief outpatient rehabilitation program for post-COVID-19 condition: a randomized clinical trial [^115FDzda]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Post–COVID-19 condition and PIFS are phenotypically similar to chronic fatigue syndrome, and a recent meta-analysis reported high acceptance of CBT for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, with low rates of noncompletion, drop out, and treatment refusal. Even though 35% of patients in this study had incomplete data, active treatment withdrawal in the intervention group was 6%, and only 2 of the 9 participants who withdrew actively reported the treatment as the reason for dropping out.

The pragmatic design of the present study, including the wide inclusion criteria, makes it relevant for general practitioners. A recent study of a very similar intervention in a primary health care context showed beneficial effects for people with persistent physical symptoms, including fatigue, pain, and brain fog.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of the study include the pragmatic approach where the intervention was fully embedded in the daily work and routines of an outpatient clinic. This increases external validityand makes the results applicable to a general population with PCC in need of rehabilitation. Furthermore, the sample size was larger than similar intervention studies on PCC and PIFS, and the primary outcome measure (SF-36-PFS) is generally recognized as a valid and reliable outcome measure for intervention trials in the field.

Limitations include the single-center approach and the lack of blinding for group allocation due to the nature of the intervention, which implies that the placebo effect cannot be controlled for. Furthermore, patients were moderately impaired and almost exclusively nonhospitalized, and the results may thus not be generalizable to patients with more disabling sequelae following severe, acute COVID-19. Similarly, current definitions of PCC are broad and based on clinical attributes alone; future identification of subgroups might elucidate which groups the current treatment is most relevant for, either alone or with treatments targeting core pathophysiologic mechanisms. The attention given to patients in the intervention group was not matched with that of the CAU group; still, most patients in the CAU group received medical care that can affect patient-reported outcome measures, conceivably reducing the impact of not including a sham intervention in the control group. Although no statistical evidence indicates nonrandom missingness, the possibility cannot be ruled out, particularly given the noticeable differences in missing data proportions between the intervention and CAU groups. Objective measures of physical and social function (eg, steps per day and work attendance) were not included but could have yielded valuable information; however, as the diagnosis of PCC is based on patients' self-report, patient-reported outcomes appear to be most relevant for evaluation of a rehabilitation program.

### Effects of virtual reality on spatiotemporal gait parameters and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^112YwNYV]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Freezing of gait (FOG), defined as "a brief, episodic absence or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet despite the intention to walk", is one of the most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is a major cause of falls, loss of independence, and reduced quality of life. Development of effective therapies has been hindered by a poor understanding of FOG pathophysiology. A major barrier to progress in the field is the challenge of eliciting FOG episodes in traditional laboratory settings, as FOG episodes are unpredictable and often triggered by complex, real-life environmental demands –. Common FOG triggers include performing turns, passing through doorways, navigating crowded spaces, multitasking, and experiencing stress. There is considerable heterogeneity in patients' susceptibility to different freezing triggers, leading to the proposal that multiple pathophysiological mechanisms may exist –. Therefore, the ability to elicit freezing reliably and with diverse triggers is essential to study the transient changes in sensorimotor processing that lead to FOG episodes, and to assess therapeutic strategies.

Immersive virtual reality (VR) during overground walking has become an effective method for enhancing the ecological validity of brain research in humans, including the study of gait –. The ability to systematically control the environment with VR to create ecological, patient-specific triggers could provide a powerful method to reliably elicit freezing, without being limited to the small set of static triggers that can be implemented in a physical laboratory (e.g. turning in place or straight walking). Indeed, a few studies using fully immersed virtual reality during overground walking have shown promise: FOG episodes have been successfully induced in VR, such as simulating walking on an elevated plankor by varying the width of a virtual doorway. These early studies demonstrate that immersive VR can replicate complex, real-life demands during overground gait, providing a controlled environment to elicit FOG episodes in patients with PD. However, more recent studies using VR to simulate real-world environments have faced challenges in reliably inducing FOG episodes –. This raises an important question about how similar FOG episodes observed in VR are to those occurring in real-world scenarios. Bridging this gap is key to optimizing VR-based research for understanding and treating FOG.

### Ε 4, the door to insulin-resistant dyslipidemia and brain fog? A case study [^112vV8QW]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2019). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

A 68-year-old male with comorbid mild AD and a 15+ year history of insulin-dependent T2DM completed a 10-week lifestyle intervention, which incorporated a clinically prescribed ketogenic diet (KD) designed to ameliorate cognitive function, restore memory loss, and functionally reverse T2DM via homeostatic restoration of metabolic fuel flux in the cells of the brain and body. The prescribed nutritional protocol utilized a clinically prescribed KD with moderate protein (based on lean mass and activity level) designed to reduce fasting insulin levels, thereby sustain hepatic synthesis of endogenous blood ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) as measured by the Precision Extra Abbott Blood Ketone Meter (≥ 0.5 mmol/L). Intermittent fasting utilizing an 8 hour time-restricted feeding window together with moderate intensity exercise was integrated into the lifestyle intervention plan approximately 3 days per week. The patient was monitored in real time by licensed health care providers as well as the student researcher. PEAK brain training games were completed/scored and recorded 5 days per week on a mobile device. The electronic application challenges memory, problem solving, language, mental agility, focus, and mental coordination; the PEAK domains correlate with executive function in the four lobes of the cerebral cortex: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. While the PEAK application was designed to improve functionality in the cerebral lobes and sharpen action of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal region, recent longitudinal studies demonstrated that stand-alone, cognitive exercises, such as PEAK, fail to increase neuroplasticity. In this case analysis, the PEAK application was utilized to measure and quantify improvements in cerebral cortex activity resultant of increased metabolic flux in ketone oxidation; ketones offered the patient an alternative fuel thereby rescuing the starving brain. The conclusions of this study support the previously documented bioenergetic hypothesis of cognitive degeneration; because ATP is rate limiting, the mediation of cerebral hypometabolism via restoration of metabolic flexibility in the neurons is a first-order change occurring before neuroplasticity.

### Thalamic morphology predicts the onset of freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^112rfRDh]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom affecting many people with Parkinson's disease (PD), defined as a 'brief, episodic absence or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet despite the intention to walk'. This leads to an increased risk of falling, and a major impact on physical and mental health-related quality of life. Notoriously, FOG is challenging to treat due to the differential response to dopamine-replacement therapy and the potential negative effects of levodopa on FOG with time. In addition, the effects of rehabilitation are short-termand only possible when FOG is still mild –. Given these challenges, markers of FOG onset are essential to screen for FOG conversion and deliver therapy pre-emptively.

Until now, various studies have looked into the clinical risk factors of conversion to FOG –. However, only one study investigated neural markers of conversion, and found that striatal dopaminergic deficits additionally contributed to a clinical prediction model of this transition. Owing to the limited evidence, an investigation into neural markers of conversion is warranted for additional predictive purposes and to help explain the elusive mechanisms leading to the onset of FOG. While freezing episodes likely signify transient dysfunctional information processing across the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical parallel circuits –, these transient events are challenging to elicit and interpret, and therefore have poor applicability as predictive markers. Compensatory or maladaptive structural alterations of the nodes within these circuits, however, are more persistent and therefore easier to capture as possible predictive markers for FOG in PD. A recent systematic reviewof cross-sectional investigations of structural alterations in persons with PD and FOG revealed widespread cortical and subcortical grey matter atrophy –, and associations between FOG severity and atrophy, suggesting that grey matter morphology may be a useful marker of FOG onset and progression. Furthermore, when centrally or peripherally originating PD pathology enters the brain, subcortical structures are affected earlier, and maybe early markers of FOG onset. However, a prospective assessment of this hypothesis is lacking.

### Systematic review of interventions for mental health, cognition and psychological well-being in long COVID [^117TR6Df]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Although acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 can be mild and time limited, with recovery over days or weeks, a subset of patients experience long-term symptoms, which can persist for months or years after the acute infection. This is referred to as long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition, among other terms.WHO defines long COVID as 'the continuation or development of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no other explanation'. Long COVID is associated with a wide range of enduring symptoms that appear to be similar to other postviral syndromes, and which can have substantial impacts on patient well-being.

The prevalence of long COVID appears to be around 13.9% among adults who experience an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, long COVID can affect patients with SARS-CoV-2 regardless of hospitalisation status or the severity of initial infection. Symptoms of long COVID appear to be multisystemic and include neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some of the most common symptoms include fatigue, dyspnoea, 'brain fog' or cognitive dysfunction, headache, attention problems. Mental health symptoms and conditions are associated with long COVID, including generalised anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and post-traumatic stress disorder. Substantial impacts on mental health, well-being and coping with the challenges of everyday life have been noted by patients.

### Do neurocognitive impairments explain the differences between brain tumor patients and their proxies when assessing the patient's IADL? [^11349GK5]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Neurocognitive impairments or reduced neurocognitive abilities are common in patients with a primary brain tumor or brain metastases, even before treatment. A brain tumor disrupts the functional networks of the brain, causing epileptic seizures and neurocognitive problems. Moreover, most anti-tumor treatments can have a positive or negative effect on a patient's neurocognitive functioning. Although brain tumor treatments target brain cancer cells, healthy brain tissue may also be affected by the treatment. In addition, patients with brain metastases often undergo systemic therapy for the primary tumor which also could induce neurocognitive deficits. Chemotherapeutic drugs, for example, have been shown to induce cognitive deficits in several cognitive domains and is often described by cancer patients as a brain fog. This phenomenon is frequently referred to as "chemo-brain" and can persist for months after treatment. Therefore, neurocognitive impairments can affect brain tumor patients during the entire disease and treatment trajectory.

Intact neurocognitive functioning is important in all aspects of everyday life, particularly in complex activities of daily living that rely more heavily on higher order neurocognitive functioningsuch as managing personal finances, participating in traffic, using a mobile telephone, and caring for family members. Deterioration of neurocognitive functioning has been associated with more problems with such so-called instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in the generaland elderlypopulation, and in patients prone to neurocognitive impairments, such as those suffering from dementia. Despite being a relevant outcome, IADL is not regularly measured in patients with brain tumors. An important reason for this is the paucity of valid and reliable IADL questionnaires designed specifically for this population. At present, a European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)questionnaire to asses IADL in brain tumor patients is under development.

### Treatment experiences, preferences, and expectations for cognitive impairments in long COVID among Chinese young and older adults: a constructivist grounded theory study [^116Genvh]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Economic affordability and accessibility of reliable medical resources also played significant roles. Several participants noted that potential financial limitations would affect their ability to pursue treatments, such as effective pharmacological options or professional therapies, when they become available. For example, one participant shared, "If there are new medications or treatment options in the future, it will depend on how expensive they are and how long the treatment will take. If it's expensive and requires long-term treatment, it might be unaffordable. It also depends on how much the insurance can cover" (man, 70 s). Accessing reliable medical resources not only means whether the socioeconomic status of participants helps them access these resources, but also whether these resources are actually available. Many participants expressed frustration with the lack of clear guidelines and specialised clinics for managing long COVID cognitive symptoms in China. One participant remarked, "However, around here, there doesn't seem to be any clear or formal approach to managing cognitive symptoms of long COVID. I haven't heard of any specific places that specialize in treating this condition. It feels like no one really knows where to go for proper care" (woman, 70 s). In addition, stigma surrounding long COVID symptoms further compounded these challenges, particularly among younger adults. As one individual noted, "In real life, within my peer group, cognitive symptoms, especially those that are often subjective or less obvious, such as brain fog and mental fatigue, are frequently seen as exaggerated or even fabricated. I feel that cultural attitudes in China reinforce this bias, viewing prolonged recovery as a lack of personal effort or adaptability. This certainly adds a psychological burden to our group on top of the physical challenges of long COVID", "People think you're exaggerating or being lazy. It's hard to talk about it without being judged" (man, 20 s).

### Functional imaging of chemobrain: usefulness of nuclear medicine in the fog coming after cancer [^116QCT8Y]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The impact of chemotherapy on brain functionality has been widely investigated from a clinical perspective, and there is a consensus on a significant impairment of multiple cognitive domains affecting cancer patients after treatment. Nuclear medicine offers a variety of biomarkers for evaluating possible effects of chemotherapy on the brain and for depicting brain changes after chemotherapy. This review summarizes the most relevant findings on brain imaging in patients undergoing chemotherapy for the most common oncologic diseases. The literature published to date offers exciting results on several radiolabeled compounds, from the more common imaging of glucose metabolism to neuroinflammation. This review also provides a general overview of the literature concerning clinical features and the physiopathologic basis of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment.

### Gadolinium deposition disease: current state of knowledge and expert opinion [^115hWMf1]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This review describes the current knowledge of a form of gadolinium toxicity termed gadolinium deposition disease (GDD), supplemented with the opinions of the authors developed during 6 years of clinical experience treating GDD. Gadolinium deposition disease can also be considered a subset under the symptoms associated with gadolinium exposure rubric. Young and middle-aged White women of central European genetic origin are the most affected. The most common symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, skin pain, skin discoloration, bone pain, muscle fasciculations, and pins and needles, but a long list of additional symptoms is reported herein. The time of onset of symptoms ranges from immediate to 1 month after gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) administration. The primary treatment is to avoid further GBCAs and metal removal through chelation. Presently, the most effective chelating agent is DTPA because of its high affinity with gadolinium. Flare development is an expected outcome, amenable to concurrent immune dampening. We emphasize in this review the critical nature of recognizing GDD when it first arises, as the disease becomes progressively more severe with each subsequent GBCA injection. It is generally very treatable after the first symptoms of GDD, often arising after the first GBCA injection. Future directions of disease detection and treatment are discussed.

### Cognitive training for freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease: a randomized controlled trial [^117JnK7T]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanism of freezing of gait (FoG) has been linked to executive dysfunction. Cognitive training (CT) is a non-pharmacological intervention which has been shown to improve executive functioning in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to explore whether targeted CT can reduce the severity of FoG in PD. Patients with PD who self-reported FoG and were free from dementia were randomly allocated to receive either a CT intervention or an active control. Both groups were clinician-facilitated and conducted twice-weekly for seven weeks. The primary outcome was percentage of time spent frozen during a Timed Up and Go task, assessed both on and off dopaminergic medications. Secondary outcomes included multiple neuropsychological and psychosocial measures. A full analysis was first conducted on all participants randomized, followed by a sample of interest including only those who had objective FoG at baseline, and completed the intervention. Sixty-five patients were randomized into the study. The sample of interest included 20 in the CT group and 18 in the active control group. The primary outcome of percentage time spent frozen during a gait task was significantly improved in the CT group compared to active controls in the on-state. There were no differences in the off-state. Patients who received CT also demonstrated improved processing speed and reduced daytime sleepiness compared to those in the active control. The findings suggest that CT can reduce the severity of FoG in the on-state, however replication in a larger sample is required.

### Rasagiline improves freezing in a patient with primary progressive freezing gait [^1158yKmu]. Movement Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

We herein report the case of a 84-year-old man with a 4-year history of freezing of gait (FOG) consistent with the diagnosis of primary progressive freezing gait. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT) with a radiolabeled ligand of the dopamine transporter (DAT-SPECT) showed integrity of striatal dopaminergic terminals, whereas brain perfusion SPECT disclosed multiple areas of decreased perfusion in frontal and parietal lobes, as well as in the subcortical gray nuclei of both sides. Treatment with the new irreversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor rasagiline at standard doses resulted in a rapid, dramatic, and sustained improvement of the frequency and duration of FOG episodes. In addition, brain perfusion SPECT after treatment showed a marked increase of the activity in all cortical areas as well as in the basal ganglia and thalamus. Rasagiline may prove to be an effective and safe treatment for this disabling condition.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves Parkinson's freezing of gait via normalizing brain connectivity [^114kzeH6]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study is the first to explore the underlying brain connectivity mechanisms in supporting the potential treatment effects of rTMS on FOG utilizing rs-fMRI. To this end, we carried out a rs-fMRI study and developed two imaging biomarkers, FOGbm and PDbm, which were negatively correlated with the severity of FOG and motor symptoms, respectively, suggesting that they could be used as biomarkers to assess the effects of rTMS on connectivity patterns. In the subsequent rTMS study, our results revealed significantly increased FOGbm and PDbm after verum stimulation, demonstrating that high-frequency rTMS over SMA not only improves the brain connectivity pattern specifically associated with FOG but also the pattern associated with PD overall. These results therefore suggest that high-frequency rTMS over SMA could alleviate FOG via normalization of abnormal brain connectivity patterns.

We found an imaging biomarker (FOGbm) that contributes to our understanding of the physiopathological basis of FOG. Functional imaging techniques have previously demonstrated that during "motor arrests", PD-FOG has decreased neural activity within the bilateral sensorimotor regions and a concomitant increased response within fronto-parietal cortical regions. Another rs-fMRI study demonstrated that functional connectivity disruption of the "fronto-parietal" network is associated with the development of FOG in PD patients. Decreased neural responses have also been observed in a number of subcortical nuclei within the frontostriatal loops during FOG episodes, including the bilateral caudate head, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and globus pallidus internus. A re-organization of functional communication within the locomotor network, including the SMA, subthalamic nucleus, mesencephalic, and cerebellar locomotor region, has also been demonstrated in PD-FOG. Taken together, what emerges from these studies is that frontoparietal and frontostriatal dysfunction, as well as neural alterations within the locomotor network, may all take part in the pathophysiology of FOG. In the present study, we selected the union of all these brain regions as our ROIs.

### Evidence for cognitive impairment in patients with vestibular disorders [^113pbpKy]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Extensive animal research has shown that vestibular damage can be associated with cognitive deficits. More recently, new evidence has emerged linking vestibular disorders to cognitive impairment in humans. Herein, we review contemporary research on the pathophysiology of cognitive-vestibular interactions and discuss its emerging clinical relevance.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases.

Review Methods

A systematic literature search was performed with combinations of search terms: "cognition", "cognitive impairment", "chronic fatigue", "brain fog", "spatial navigation", "attention", "memory", "executive function", "processing speed", and "vestibular hypofunction". Relevant articles were considered for inclusion, including basic and clinical studies, case series, and major reviews.

Conclusions

Patients with vestibular disorders can demonstrate long-term deficits in both spatial and nonspatial cognitive domains. The underlying mechanism(s) linking the vestibular system to cognitive function is not well characterized, but several neuro-biologic correlates have been identified. Additional screening tools are required to identify individuals at risk for cognitive impairment, and further research is needed to determine whether treatment of vestibular dysfunction has the capacity to improve cognitive function.

Implications For Practice

Physicians should be aware of emerging data supporting the presence of cognitive deficits in patients with vestibular disorders. Prevention and treatment of long-term cognitive deficits may be possible through screening and rehabilitation.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^114Khkfi]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Comorbid pain, fatigue and "cognitive fog"

There is a high frequency of pain, including chronic migraine, fatigue and the subjective sense of "cognitive fog" in patients with FND. Although distinct entities, there appears to be significant overlap with FND, fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), particularly in the way patients describe subjective cognitive difficulties, perhaps underpinned by excessive attention towards the body, severe pain and fatigue. It is necessary to recognize and treat these symptoms as part of FND, as they may be acting as either triggering or maintaining factors in FND. No strong evidence exists for the management of fatigue and chronic pain in FND, but a potential therapeutic approach would be to address these symptoms in a similar fashion to CFS and FM, respectively, with the caveat that these diagnoses likely encompass a range of different aetiologies.

### Deep brain stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus area in parkinson disease: MRI-based anatomoclinical correlations and optimal target [^116z8HDF]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Experimental studies led to testing of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) as a new therapy to treat freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson disease (PD). Despite promising initial results fueling a growing interest toward that approach, several clinical studies reported heterogeneity in patient responses. Variation in the position of electrode contacts within the rostral brainstem likely contributes to such heterogeneity.

Objective

To provide anatomoclinical correlations of the effect of DBS of the caudal mesencephalic reticular formation (cMRF) including the PPN to treat FOG by comparing the normalized positions of the active contacts among a series of 11 patients at 1- and 2-yr follow-up and to provide an optimal target through an open-label study.

Methods

We defined a brainstem normalized coordinate system in relation to the pontomesencephalic junction. Clinical evaluations were based on a composite score using objective motor measurements and questionnaires allowing classification of patients as "bad responders" (2 patients), "mild responders" (1 patient) and "good responders" (6 patients). Two patients, whose long-term evaluation could not be completed, were excluded from the analysis.

Results

Most effective DBS electrode contacts to treat FOG in PD patients were located in the posterior part of the cMRF (encompassing the posterior PPN and cuneiform nucleus) at the level of the pontomesencephalic junction.

Conclusion

In the present exploratory study, we performed an anatomoclinical analysis using a new coordinate system adapted to the brainstem in 9 patients who underwent PPN area DBS. We propose an optimal DBS target that allows a safe and efficient electrode implantation in the cMRF.

### Long COVID-ACOEM guidance statement [^116MH3n9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Long COVID — "brain fog", neurologic symptoms, and cognitive impairment show that persistent cognitive dysfunction after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely in those with severe illness or who were admitted to the ICU; among those hospitalized, moderate or severe cognitive deficits were associated with elevated inflammatory markers 5 months after the acute illness, and cognitive changes in those who did not feel recovered persisted through almost 2 years of follow-up; in a small study involving 29 patients with persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19, including 79% reporting problems with memory and 93% with concentration complaints, symptomatic patients had similar performance on the NIH Toolbox battery as controls; in a study of 200 patients, an average of 125 days since a positive COVID-19 test, self-reported neurocognitive dysfunction did not correlate with quantitative testing, although self-reported cognitive symptoms were associated with depression and anxiety.

### Diagnosing respiratory long COVID: a practical approach [^111QBRTP]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID or post-COVID Condition, defined as the persistence of symptoms at least three months post-acute COVID-19 infection, is a novel condition where a definitive diagnostic marker and treatment has yet to be found. This condition, which has been estimated to impact more than 65 million individuals worldwide, manifests with multisystem involvement, most commonly presenting with fatigue, brain fog, dyspnea and/or cough. The burden of these symptoms can range from mild to severe with many patients reporting an inability to return to usual activities. Here, we present several hypothetical but clinically representative cases to allow discussion around how we approach the diagnosis of respiratory symptoms of Long COVID in those with and without chronic lung disease.

### Assessment of cognitive function in patients after COVID-19 infection [^116KbxpZ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

People who have survived COVID-19 frequently complain of cognitive dysfunction, which has been described as brain fog. The prevalence of post–COVID-19 cognitive impairment and the association with disease severity are not well characterized. Previous studies on the topic have been limited by small sample sizes and suboptimal measurement of cognitive functioning. We investigated rates of cognitive impairment in survivors of COVID-19 who were treated in outpatient, emergency department (ED), or inpatient hospital settings.

### What is brain fog? [^11188vgn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The term 'brain fog' is increasingly used colloquially to describe difficulties in the cognitive realm. But what is brain fog? What sort of experiences do people talk about when they talk about brain fog? And, in turn, what might this tell us about potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms? This study examined first-person descriptions in order to better understand the phenomenology of brain fog.

Methods

Posts containing 'brain fog' were scraped from the social media platform Reddit, using python, over a week in October 2021. We examined descriptions of brain fog, themes of containing subreddits (topic-specific discussion forums), and causal attributions.

Results

1663 posts containing 'brain fog' were identified, 717 meeting inclusion criteria. 141 first person phenomenological descriptions depicted forgetfulness (51), difficulty concentrating (43), dissociative phenomena (34), cognitive 'slowness' and excessive effort (26), communication difficulties (22), 'fuzziness' or pressure (10) and fatigue (9). 50% (363/717) posts were in subreddits concerned with illness and disease: including COVID-19 (87), psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, autoimmune and functional disorders. 134 posts were in subreddits about drug use or discontinuation, and 44 in subreddits about abstention from masturbation. 570 posts included the poster's causal attribution, the most frequent attribution being long COVID in 60/570 (10%).

Conclusions

'Brain fog' is used on Reddit to describe heterogeneous experiences, including of dissociation, fatigue, forgetfulness and excessive cognitive effort, and in association with a range of illnesses, drugs and behaviours. Encouraging detailed description of these experiences will help us better understand pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive symptoms in health and disease.

### Cognitive rehabilitation improved self-reported cognitive skills in individuals with long COVID: an observational study [^114LimDb]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the effects of cognitive rehabilitation provided to patients with lingering cognitive difficulties or "brain fog" after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Outpatient rehabilitation setting.

Participants

Seventy consecutive patients with Long COVID who were referred from a Neuro-COVID clinic and evaluated and treated by speech-language pathologists.

Interventions

Usual care cognitive rehabilitation.

Main Outcome Measures

Patients completed the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders Cognition Function Short Form and the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test Story Recall assessments before and after treatment. Demographics, goals, treatment frequency/duration, and interventions were analyzed to determine treatment outcomes and patterns of care.

Results

Of 70 patients, 83% were never hospitalized for COVID-19, the average age was 46.5 years, 77% were women, and 69% were White. There were no differences in demographics, race, ethnicity, or objective cognitive measures before starting treatment between the 50 individuals who completed their plan of care (POC) versus the 20 who did not. However, patients who did not complete their POC reported higher anxiety before treatment. Patients with higher anxiety before treatment demonstrated less improvement in cognitive quality of life measures after treatment. Of the 50 patients who completed their POC, 45 (90%) met all short-term goals. There was a significant increase in Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders Cognition Function scores from pre- to post- cognitive rehabilitation in 36 patients tested, but no significant differences in objective measures of memory in 23 patients tested.

Conclusions

Cognitive rehabilitation resulted in self-reported improvement in functional cognition. However, anxiety limited the favorable effect of treatment and should be addressed in conjunction with cognitive therapy to maximize outcomes.

### Assessment of psychosocial aspects in adults in post-COVID-19 condition: the EURONET-SOMA recommendations on core outcome domains for clinical and research use [^111rsUHa]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-COVID-19 condition or syndrome (often referred to as Long COVID) is the term coined by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the development or continuation of new symptoms 12 weeks after an acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, with these symptoms lasting for more than 2 months and not explained by an alternative diagnosis. With 6–10% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals reporting long-lasting symptoms, at least 75 million people are affected globally. With a wide variety of more than 200 symptoms reported, post-COVID-19 condition seems an urgent, complex, and massive healthcare problem. Recent studies on post-COVID-19 have identified several prevalent symptoms that persist for up to 2 years after infection: Commonly reported symptoms include fatigue, observed in approximately 28% of cases, and neurocognitive issues such as memory difficulties, dizziness, and brain fog, affecting around 28% of patients. Other symptoms like sleep disturbances (21%), depression (18%), anxiety (13%), and pain (8%) have also been frequently documented among COVID-19 survivors. Given the high variability in these estimates, which reflect diverse populations and study methodologies, we refer readers to recent meta-analyses such as Fernández-de-las-Peñas et al. for a detailed prevalence breakdown of post-COVID-19 symptoms. These symptoms significantly reduce health recovery, everyday functioning, and work capacity 6–12 months post-infection, even in young people with initially mild disease. Since our understanding of and existing treatment options for post-COVID-19 condition are limited, further research and new approaches are necessary. While the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically described with a focus on the immunological processes and growing evidence shows the relevance of biological changes, such as persistent alterations in the brainstem of post-COVID-19 patients, the chronic course of post-COVID-19 condition requires a broad biopsychosocial perspective that considers the biological (e.g. immunological) and the psychosocial factors that can contribute to or result from the clinical condition. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis has confirmed the relevance of depression and anxiety as co-occurring phenomena and predictive factors of post-COVID-19, but has dramatically shown the scarcity of available evidence on broader psychosocial predictors.

### Theta-frequency subthalamic stimulation enhances conflict resolution in Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait through frontal cortex modulation [^112j1mRq]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating motor symptom linked to executive dysfunction, particularly impaired conflict resolution. However, the underlying neural mechanisms and optimal treatment remain unclear. We assessed conflict resolution using a modified Flanker task in 90 PD patients (52 with FOG) and 37 healthy controls. PD-FOG patients exhibited significantly greater conflict costs than patients without FOG and healthy controls. Task-based fMRI revealed enhanced frontal cortical activation associated with conflict processing deficits in PD-FOG, positively correlating with FOG severity. In a subgroup of 18 PD-FOG patients undergoing fMRI during subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS), theta-frequency (5 Hz) stimulation improved conflict resolution and increased frontal activation, whereas high-frequency (130 Hz) stimulation primarily activated motor regions without cognitive benefit. These findings indicate that frontal dysfunction contributed to the conflict resolution deficits in PD-FOG and support theta-frequency STN-DBS as a promising therapeutic approach for enhancing cognitive function.

### Baseline cerebral structural morphology predict freezing of gait in early drug-naïve Parkinson's disease [^113HAWFU]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It has attracted increasing attention that in advanced disease stages, most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from a crippling gait disorder: freezing of gait (FOG). This gait disturbance greatly interferes with the daily life of patients with PD. More importantly, FOG is now considered to be one of the main risk factors for falls and contributes to increased emotional disorders in PD patients –. Therefore, it could significantly weaken the movement ability and diminish the quality of life in PD patients. Some researchers have found that compared with PD patients without FOG and healthy people, the gray matter (GM) of several brain regions related to motor, executive attention, and cognition have different degrees of atrophy in PD patients with FOG –. At present, the treatment of FOG is still extremely challenging, and there is no unified and effective treatment in the clinic, let alone a cure. Therefore, it is of great importance to predict FOG in the early stage of the disease for prevention and intervention in PD patients.

Recent studies have suggested that clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and brain imaging of early PD patients could predict the progression of dyskinesias, as well as the occurrence of postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGD)and even FOG – with generalized linear models or logistic regression models. However, these studies have only focused on a certain brain area or have a small sample. What's more, combining clinical, laboratory, and imaging data to predict the occurrence of FOG using machine learning has not previously been undertaken in early drug-naïve PD patients.

Additionally, previous imaging studies have shown that cerebral structural morphology changes in PD are mainly located in brain regions related to dopamine transport pathways, such as the temporo-occipital lobe, and part of the frontoparietal lobe –. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the current findings, while the localization and extent of PD-related cortical damage and/or white matter (WM) abnormalities still need to be further explored.

Here, we developed a model that could predict the occurrence of FOG at the individual level using machine learning with clinical assessments, laboratory tests and cerebral structural imaging information of early drug-naïve PD patients. As a secondary objective, we explored the morphological alterations of the cerebrum in early drug-naïve PD patients and their relationship with clinical and laboratory assessments.

### Stellate ganglion block reduces symptoms of long COVID: a case series [^111aBYTt]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Medium credibility.

After recovering from COVID-19, a significant proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals develop Long COVID. Fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, brain fog, anosmia, and ageusia/dysgeusia in Long COVID resemble "sickness behavior", the autonomic nervous system response to pro-inflammatory cytokines (Dantzer et al., 2008). Aberrant network adaptation to sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance is expected to produce long-standing dysautonomia. Cervical sympathetic chain activity can be blocked with local anesthetic, allowing the regional autonomic nervous system to "reboot". In this case series, we successfully treated two Long COVID patients using stellate ganglion block, implicating dysautonomia in the pathophysiology of Long COVID and suggesting a novel treatment.

In the authors' experience, the most common complaints are fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, joint pain, hair loss, and gastrointestinal issues. The next sections will focus on potential causes for the most common symptoms and options for evaluation (Table 2).

Table 2.
Laboratory and Imaging Assessment of and Referral for Common Systemic Symptoms Reported by Patients With Breast Implants a

Fatigue

Fatigue has many possible causes, such as aging, motherhood, medication side effects, sleep disturbance, cardiopulmonary disease, anemia, infection, endocrine dysfunction (eg, diabetes, hypothyroidism), inflammatory/rheumatologic disease, psychiatric illness (eg, depression or anxiety), and lifestyle factors. Among patients who undergo implant-based breast reconstruction following cancer surgery, it is important to perform a physical examination, including examining for lymphadenopathy, which could be a sign or recurrence or tumor spread. Type and dosages of prescription and over-the-counter medications should be reviewed. Laboratory tests that should be considered in most patients with at least a 2-week history of fatigue include an electrocardiogram or cardiac workup as dictated by symptoms, a CBC, ESR, vitamin D and calcium levels, chemistry panel, and thyroid, liver, and kidney function tests. Because nonorganic causes of fatigue are common, many plausible causes will likely remain once defined organic factors are ruled out for any given patient.

Brain Fog

The term "brain fog" generally refers to cognitive symptoms such as an inability to think clearly and attentional or memory impairment. As described above, brain fog is a common symptom in the general population as well as potentially occurring in increased frequency in the context of perimenopausal hormonal changes. Patients should be asked about menses as well as about possible causes of brain fog, such as transient ischemic attack symptoms and sleep problems or disorders. Thorough assessment should explore whether the patient is experiencing or has a history of other symptoms or medical conditions and whether the patient is taking medications, such as chemotherapy or anticholinergics, that may adversely impact their cognitive function. Assessment of medically unexplained neuropsychological symptoms such as brain fog should include psychological evaluation to determine whether a mood, anxiety, or psychotic disorder is present. If dementia is suspected, an evaluation should be performed by a neurologist and/or psychologist. Neurological imaging may also be considered as appropriate (eg, if the patient has a recent history of transient ischemic attack/stroke symptoms or if cancer metastases are suspected). Accompanying neurological symptoms, such as tremors, nystagmus, abnormal reflexes, and gait abnormalities, require an examination by a neurologist.

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait: an exploratory analysis [^111QZ1xi]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Freezing of gait (FOG) is characterized by arrests of stepping when initiating gait, turning, and walking straight ahead and patients describe it as their feet being "glued" to the floor. While it is a well-known feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), it has been reported in other parkinsonian disorders as well. FOG frequency in PD patients increases with disease duration and occurs in > 60% of patients with ≥ 10 years of disease. It is a gait symptom complex that has potentially grave consequences, as it is unpredictable in character, a leading cause of falls with injury, and results in loss of independence and social isolation. Treatment options are limited. Although FOG is considered to be a cardinal feature of PD, it appears to develop and/or progress independently of the other cardinal motor features. It is associated with specific clinical risk factors (longer disease duration, psychotic symptoms, and absence of tremor), is associated with cognitive change, and is thought to be caused by specific as yet unknown pathology –. The pathophysiology of FOG remains poorly understood. The literature shows great variability in findings related to physiological and imaging research, as well as motor and non-motor correlates and therapeutic response to various treatment modalities,– suggesting it possibly relates to a multimodal circuit change.

There has been little in the way of biofluid research in FOG. One study of data from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative study (PPMI) showed that low CSF β-amyloid42 (Aβ42) levels in early PD predicted incident FOG within the first few years after diagnosisusing measures from the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and this has been supported by increased neocortical deposition of β-amyloid in the brain with imaging studies. However, these CSF data have been reported only for the first 3 years after disease onset. In this study, we present initial results of CSF analysis in more advanced PD patients with and without FOG (average disease duration ~10 years) and age-matched healthy controls (HC). We also present results describing variation in CSF markers over a wide range of disease duration (onset–23 years).

14.3	Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis

The efficacy of AYVAKIT was demonstrated in PIONEER (NCT03731260), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in adult patients with Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis (ISM) based on World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Enrolled patients had moderate to severe symptoms despite receiving at least 2 symptom directed therapies. Patients were randomized to receive 25 mg AYVAKIT orally once daily with best supportive care versus placebo with best supportive care. The treatment duration was over a 24-week period, during the randomized portion of the study.

Efficacy was based on the absolute mean change from baseline to Week 24 in the Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis-Symptom Assessment Form (ISM-SAF) total symptom score (TSS). The ISM-SAF is a patient-reported outcome measure assessing ISM signs and symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, spots, itching, flushing, bone pain, fatigue, dizziness, headache, brain fog. Scores ranged from 0 ("none") to 10 ("worst imaginable"). The item scores were summed to calculate a daily ISM-SAF TSS (range 0–110), with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. A biweekly average ISM-SAF TSS was used to evaluate efficacy endpoints.

### Characterizing predictors and chronicity of brain fog in long COVID [^113ggo62]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID is a chronic illness that persists following COVID-19 infection, with fatigue and brain fog as the most frequent complaints. However, there is no objective case definition for brain fog in long COVID and chronicity of symptoms remains unclear. This study recruited two waves of participants: those with a history of COVID-19, who participated in 2023 (N = 793, age = 38.5 ± 13.2, 44% female, 35.1% long COVID) and a follow up cohort collected in 2024 of participants who qualified as having long COVID at time point 1 (N = 119, 61 female, 58 male). Participants completed questionnaires and cognitive tasks from home. We trained a binary classification model for long COVID diagnosis (73% accuracy) and a linear regression model for cognitive complaints (RMS error 5.8). A long COVID diagnosis at timepoint 1 was classified by biopsychosocial variables including stress, social support, and sex (women more likely). Symptom clustering revealed that phenotypes with both mental and physical health symptoms were predictive of brain fog, but not phenotypes with only sleep-related or physical symptoms. Markers of brain fog included slower reading and typing, slower reaction times in cognitive tasks, and changes in information processing speed and thresholds for making choices. Timepoint 2 data showed that the majority (82.4%) of participants did not remit from long COVID. These findings highlight the complex biopsychosocial factors that predict having long COVID with brain fog, and the need for interventions to improve remission rates.

### 'Their role has a lot of purpose beyond being just being about exercises': a qualitative study of patients' experiences of physiotherapy following a mild traumatic brain injury [^114osiGr]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) occur following a force to the head or body that results in an altered level of consciousness and includes injuries referred to as concussions. Despite being classified as mild injuries, up to half of patients diagnosed with mTBI will not recover within weeks, months or even years. For these individuals, mTBI can seriously impact all aspects of their lives, including study, employment, social relationships and engagement in the community.mTBI is a global concern, with general population incidence ranging between 200 and 800 people per 100 000. With a projected growing and ageing global population, early identification, assessment and appropriate management of mTBI are critical moving forward as the incidence of mTBI is likely to increase.

mTBI is a complex condition that is characterised by symptoms that can be grouped into physical (eg, headache, dizziness, balance dysregulation and nausea), behavioural/emotional (eg, fatigue, anxiety, depression) and cognitive domains (eg, difficulty remembering and concentrating, feeling in a fog). These symptoms may be exacerbated or overlap with other conditions such as cervical strain, neurological disorders, medicines, depression and developmental disorders (eg, ADHD), highlighting the importance of performing a thorough assessment for differential diagnoses. Consequently, early, multifaceted assessment and interdisciplinary management for mTBI is recommended to optimise recovery.

### Screening for brain fog: is the Montreal cognitive assessment an effective screening tool for neurocognitive complaints post-COVID-19? [^113vVPr9]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive complaints are one of the most frequent symptoms reported in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been used to estimate prevalence of cognitive impairment in many studies of PASC, and is commonly employed as a screening test in this population, however, its validity has not been established.

Objective

To determine the utility of the MoCA to screen for cognitive impairment in PASC.

Methods

Sixty participants underwent neuropsychological, psychiatric, and medical assessments, as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 6–8 months after acute COVID-19 infection.

Results

The overall sample had a mean score of 26.1 on the MoCA, with approximately one third screening below the cutoff score of 26, similar to the rate of extremely low NP test performance. MoCA score was inversely correlated with fatigue and depression measures and ethnic minority participants scored on average lower, despite similar education and estimated premorbid function. The MoCA had an accuracy of 63.3% at detecting any degree of diminished NP performance, and an accuracy of 73.3% at detecting extremely low NP performance.

Discussion/Conclusion

The MoCA may not be accurate for detecting neither mild nor more severe degrees of diminished NP test performance in PASC. Therefore, patients with persistent cognitive complaints in the setting of PASC who score in the normal range on the MoCA should be referred for formal NP assessment.

### Cognitive domains affected post-COVID-19; a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138R7fU]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As seen in previous coronavirus epidemics, a significant proportion of patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 develop cognitive (neuropsychological) sequelae from the infection, and a significant proportion of these persist long term. Post‐COVID‐19 condition is defined by National Institutes of Health guidance as symptoms present 3 months from the onset of COVID‐19 with symptoms that have lasted at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Cognitive impairment appears to be common after recovering from COVID‐19 disease, with an estimated 18%–36% of people affected depending on whether subjective or objective measures are used, and 32% of patients reporting subjective 'brain fog' over 3 months after the initial infection.

Meta‐analysis demonstrates a prevalence of objectively measured global cognitive impairment of 22% at 12 weeks or more following COVID‐19 infection, compared to infected controls, and similar persistent cognitive impairment can be seen in formal testing even in those without persistent COVID‐19 symptomology. Early reports suggested that COVID‐19 patients suffered from a dysexecutive syndrome during acute infection; however, a detailed, domain‐specific phenotype of cognitive impairment occurring in individuals in this post‐acute phase is yet to be established.

An acute‐phase dysexecutive syndrome may suggest frontal lobe pathology, but the neurobiological basis of post‐COVID‐19 cognitive impairment remains unclear, with multiple and multifactorial aetiologies being proposed. Likely mediators include the well‐established cognitive sequelae of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, acute respiratory distress syndrome and delirium. The medium‐ and long‐term cognitive symptoms experienced by those with asymptomatic or mild effects from the initial infection suggest a separate aetiology to those seen in patients with more direct effects such as stroke or encephalitis. Although there is literature on how general severity of COVID‐19 illness may affect cognitive symptoms, fewer studies have explored how the presence of neurological sequelae in this context might affect outcomes.

Elucidating the pattern of cognitive impairment is key to understanding this pathophysiology, improving diagnosis and formulating management options for a condition that is likely to have an impact on quality of life, economic output and societal engagement.

The aims of this review were therefore (1) to identify which primary cognitive domains are impaired in this population and, if present, whether these change over time, (2) to identify which neuropsychological tasks were used and how impairment was defined and (3) to establish whether any demographic or clinical factors predict the presence, and/or severity, of this impairment.

### Cholinergic system changes in dopa-unresponsive freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease [^113osEs4]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Freezing of gait (FoG) is a debilitating mobility disturbance that becomes increasingly resistant to dopaminergic pharmacotherapies with advancing Parkinson's disease (PD). The pathophysiology underlying the response of FoG to dopaminergic treatment is poorly understood. Prior vesicular acetylcholine transporter positron emission tomography (VAChT PET) imaging studies implicate the degeneration of cholinergic pathways, including bilateral striatal and limbic archicortex deficits, as significant contributors to FoG.

Objective

We aim to investigate whether specific cholinergic system changes are associated with FoG responsiveness to levodopa treatment in PD patients.

Methods

Thirty six PD subjects (31M/5F) completed [18 F]‐fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18 F]FEOBV) vesicular acetylcholine transporter positron emission tomography (VAChT PET) and underwent videotaped clinical assessments for FoG on and off levodopa.

Results

Sixteen subjects had‐dopa‐unresponsive FoG. Whole brain voxel‐based analyses of [18 F]FEOBV PET (false discovery rate‐corrected at P < 0.05 and adjusted for levodopa‐equivalent dose) showed that those with‐dopa‐unresponsive FoG had more severe cholinergic terminal deficits in the bilateral insula, hippocampi, fimbria, and lateral geniculate nuclei; left mid‐temporal, putamen, and posterior cingulate regions; and the right mid‐frontal region and anterior ventral nucleus of the thalamus compared to those with‐dopa‐responsive FoG.

Conclusion

FoG unresponsive to levodopa is associated with bilateral cholinergic terminal reductions, mostly in extra‐striatal regions involved in multisensory and cognitive integration of gait and postural control as well as spatial navigation. The lack of specific striatal involvement points to the disruption of widespread cerebral network functions underlying‐dopa‐unresponsive FoG in PD and may explain the treatment‐resistant nature of FoG to levodopa. © 2025 The Author(s).

### Subthalamic electrophysiological mapping of gait initiation dynamics and freezing in Parkinson's disease [^113VXuHk]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Activity PrecedingEpisodes

FOG episodes were preceded by further deterioration in stepping rhythm, with increased cadence and shorter step durations, as reported during obstacle avoidance or door passage. These changes were evident as early as the GI phase, prior to the observable FOG onset. At GI, the relationship between GI and STN activity also dynamically shifted – both in terms of frequency bands and spatial distribution within the STN. Notably, high beta power in the posterior STN showed a positive correlation with stepping rhythm and a negative correlation with pace, whereas in the central STN, high‐beta power negatively correlated with balance. These findings suggest a breakdown in the compensatory gait‐related dynamics observed when FOG is absent. Prior studies have linked FOG with increased STN beta entropy, elevated low‐ or high‐beta power, prolonged low‐beta burst durations, cortico‐STN decoupling, and high‐beta‐gamma phase‐amplitude coupling in the primary motor cortex. These patterns likely reflect a functional decoupling or conflict between the posterior STN, primarily connected with motor and premotor cortical areas, and the central STN, linked to associative and prefrontal cortices. High‐beta STN power is considered a pathological marker of the hyperdirect cortico‐STN pathway, and is less influenced by dopaminergic medication. Its elevation may increase surround inhibition within BG pathways, interfering with the direct pathway's facilitation of movement. This could lead to a failure in resolving competing motor commands, resulting in an over‐inhibition of the "center‐facilitated" gait initiation and triggering FOG.

Gait Pattern andNeuronal Modulations: Potential Biomarkers for Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation to Treat

FOG‐OBS patients with PD show early, identifiable changes in GI and STN activity patterns up to 19 seconds before FOG. These early markers offer a potential window for preventive interventions using adaptive DBS (aDBS). Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of aDBS, potentially reducing side effects and enhancing efficacy by minimizing unnecessary stimulation. Pilot studies using kinetic parameters, beta‐band power, or burst duration as control signals have shown efficacy in treating tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia in patients with PD. However, applying aDBS to FOG remains challenging due to the variability and unpredictability of FOG events. Reliable detectionmay require individualized algorithms trained on both controlled structured, and ecological walking tasks. Advances in sensing‐enabled neurostimulators could eventually support at‐home, real‐time aDBS for gait management.

### Combination of sibutramine and topiramate for the treatment of obesity: the SIBAMATE retrospective cohort study: sibutramine and topiramate for the treatment of obesity [^111AGNQg]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Weight loss, even in a small amount, is related to the improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid levels, glucose metabolism and blood pressure. There was a tendency for improvement in all biomarkers evaluated in the present article, but since this is a non-interventional study, it is not possible to exclude possible confounding factors, as many patients started treatment with statins, antihypertensives and antidiabetics throughout follow-up.

The majority of side effects presented are well-reported in the literature. Topiramate can be associated with brain fog and paresthesia due to its central action and slight inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, respectively. Sibutramine, due to its noradrenergic effect, can increase blood pressure and predispose to tachyarrhythmia. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse effects encountered of ~ 25% was comparable to that observed with other oral combinations.

Probably the future of obesity treatment will be accompanied by several changes as observed for other chronic conditions. Recently, as an example, the European Society of Cardiology released a new guideline for hypertension treatment and stated that all patients should receive as first-line therapy a combination of two antihypertensive drugs. The reason is that the combination is more potent for lowering blood pressure than a monotherapy in its highest dose. This finding is also applicable for obesity management as seen here with the combination of sibutramine plus topiramate, but also for triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon agonist versus GLP-1 agonist alone.

In fact, recent studies showed that combined GLP-1 analogs and bupropion plus naltrexone are a very effective treatment for weight loss even when the dose used is not maximal. Moreover, the addition of bupropion plus naltrexone achieved greater weight loss, including in patients who were initially non-responsive to GLP-1 analogs.

### Precipitating factors for functional cognitive disorder [^1132i9Us]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Migrainous cognitive symptoms, and likely alarming acute pain, may also alter brain predictions in a way that makes cognitive symptoms persistent. Over 80% of migraine sufferers report cognitive difficulties including brain fog, confusion and slow thinking before, during and after a migraine attack. Migraine patients may also be more vulnerable to cognitive symptoms when exposed to additional triggers such as a head injury or COVID‐19 infection, and vice‐versa. Taken together, this suggests that migraine may act as both a potential predisposing and precipitating factor for FCD, and these findings are supported by reports of a correlate between the location of a precipitating physical injury and the subsequent functional symptom across various functional disorders, an aspect that can be considered in future educational and therapeutic strategies.

Eighteen patients in our cohort fulfilled diagnostic criteria for FCD after COVID‐19 infection. Further research is needed to unravel the likely multiple causes of cognitive symptoms in long‐COVID. These data does not suggest that all cognitive symptoms as part of long‐COVID relate to FCD. However, a range of research findings may be in keeping with this being the case in a subset of patients. A detailed analysis of the most affected cognitive domains in long‐COVID patients reveals that working memory, attention and concentration difficulties tend to dominate the picture, resembling other FCDs and functional cognitive symptoms present in other functional disorders. Current evidence also supports a poor correlation between perceived cognitive impairment and objectively measured cognitive performance in post‐COVID‐19 infection, with cognitive symptoms independent from the severity of the initial COVID infection, and mostly driven by fatigue and depression. An area of further enquiry is the potential suboptimal task engagement and task effort found at higher rates in long‐COVID patients in comparison with other neurological disorders. Authors from a systematic review on long‐COVID studies found similarities between manifestations of long‐COVID and the cluster of symptoms observed in functional disorders although data were insufficient to support or refuse a diagnosis of FND based on positive features. Importantly, in long‐COVID series, cognitive problems, including memory difficulties, fatigue, headache and sleep disorders, were the most commonly observed symptoms, as in our study (Box 1). It is likely that some evolve to a full FCD phenotype over time, and positive features supporting this diagnosis should be explored, which may open complementary treatment avenues.

### Gaps and roadmap of novel neuromodulation targets for treatment of gait in Parkinson's disease [^113W1MJG]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation

Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) is an established neurostimulation therapy used in the treatment of epilepsy, migraine and cluster headache. Recently, its implication on gait function in PD has been studied. An open-label, pilot study has analyzed the effect of single dose nVNS on gait pattern in 19 patients with PD-related disorder (twelve with FoG). A total of two treatments were applied to the left vagus nerve in the left side of the neck. Assessments were performed just before and 15 min following the application of nVNS. The study demonstrated improvement in spatiotemporal gait parameters following nVNS and included step count, velocity, step length, and stride velocity variability. Video-analysis of the FoG patients showed improvements in the time taken for turning, steps taken for turning, and steps taken for start hesitation. A follow-up crossover randomized controlled study corroborated these initial findings and showed significant improvements in walking speed, stance time and step length comparing active phase (30 days of nVNS stimulation) to sham. Similarly, overall motor function (MDS-UPDRS III) also improved. The average duration of freezing episodes was reduced, but other FoG measures did not change. Moreover, serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and glutathione levels decreased and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increased significantly after treatment with nVNS. The authors propose that the ability of nVNS to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and to increase serum BDNF could be a sign of neuroplasticity. The effects observed on anti-oxidant levels might also point to disease-modifying actions. nVNS might activate locus coeruleus neurons, which are thought to degenerate even prior to substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons in PD. Improvement in postural instability and gait in PD is expected if there is direct cortical activation through excitatory neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline. The nucleus basalis of Meynert, which provides extensive cholinergic projections to cerebral cortex, is also in receipt of afferent input from locus coeruleus; cortical cholinergic tone is thus also likely to be enhanced by nVNS and could be responsible for gait changes in these patients. Future studies of nVNS in PD should confirm repeatability, optimize treatment parameters and establish how long treatment effects (and potential neuroprotective effects) of nVNS persist. Larger, multi-centre trials of nVNS in PD are warranted.

### Brain fog in hypothyroidism: understanding the patient's perspective [^1146Bg1d]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patient-centered studies have shown that several patients on thyroid hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism exhibit persistent symptoms, including "brain fog". Here, we aimed to determine which of these specific symptoms are associated with brain fog, identify patient-reported factors that modify these symptoms, and identify patient concerns related to brain fog not included in thyroid-specific questionnaires.

Methods

A survey on brain fog symptoms adapted from thyroid-specific patient-reported outcome was distributed online. Textual data analysis was performed to identify common areas of concern from open-ended survey responses.

Results

A total of 5170 participants reporting brain fog while being treated for hypothyroidism were included in the analysis. Of these, 2409 (46.6%) participants reported symptom onset prior to the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and 4096 (79.2%) participants experienced brain fog symptoms frequently. Of the symptoms listed, participants associated fatigue and forgetfulness most frequently with brain fog. More rest was the most common factor provided for improving symptoms. The textual data analysis identified areas of concern that are not often included in thyroid-specific quality of life questionnaires, including a focus on the diagnosis of hypothyroidism, the types and doses of medications, and the patient-doctor relationship.

Conclusion

Brain fog in patients treated for hypothyroidism was associated most frequently with fatigue and cognitive symptoms. Several additional areas of patient concern were found to be associated with brain fog, which are not typically addressed in thyroid-specific questionnaires.

### Different cerebral cortical areas influence the effect of subthalamic nucleus stimulation on parkinsonian motor deficits and freezing of gait [^114cywFJ]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Inconsistent response in freezing of gait (FOG) with levodopa treatment or STN DBS makes the pathogenesis difficult to understand. We studied brain areas associated with the expression of STN DBS effect on parkinsonian motor deficits and FOG. Ten Parkinson's disease patients with typical FOG were included. One month before STN DBS, we performed [(18)F]-deoxyglucose PET scans and measured the UPDRS motor and modified FOG (mFOG) scores during levodopa off and on periods. At two months after STN DBS, same rating scores were measured. The percentage improvement of mFOG and UPDRS motor scores by STN DBS during levodopa off period was calculated. We searched for brain areas in which glucose metabolism correlated with the improvement of mFOG and UPDRS motor scores by DBS. During levodopa off period, STN DBS improved the UPDRS motor scores by 32.3% and the mFOG scores by 56.6%. There was no correlation between the improvements of both scores. The improvement of UPDRS motor score by DBS correlated with the metabolic activities of rostral supplementary motor area (Brodmann's area 8; BA8), anterior cingulate cortex (BA32), and prefrontal cortex (BA9). On the other hand, there was a positive correlation between the improvement of mFOG score by DBS and the metabolic activity of the parietal, occipital, and temporal sensory association cortices. In conclusion, dysfunction of different cerebral cortical areas limits the beneficial effects of DBS on parkinsonian motor deficits and FOG.

### Blood-brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment [^113Es4G9]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Long COVID is a substantial burden in many patients after recovery from COVID-19. Patients describe fatigue, memory loss and dyspnea as some of the key symptoms of long COVID, while another subset of patients describe 'brain fog' like the one commonly reported in postconcussive syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. Our data suggest that BBB disruption occurs during acute infection and long COVID, where it is strongly associated with cognitive impairment. Our work provides objective evidence for a link between BBB disruption and cognitive impairment within a cohort of patients with long COVID. Further longitudinal studies are required to examine changes in BBB permeability over time and in other postviral illnesses; however, targeted regulation of BBB integrity could now potentially be considered for the treatment of patients with brain fog associated with long COVID.

Our study has some limitations. First, we did not have access to CSF samples from our cohort to confirm molecular BBB breakdown in those with brain fog. However, other studies found increased CSF permeability and BBB disruption in a subset of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with elevated Q-albumin ratios that correlated with markers of inflammation. Patients with severe neurological complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection have an increased CSF Q-albumin ratio indicating BBB disruption, coupled with elevated CSF proteins, such as IL-8, which are associated with BBB disruption. Blood–CSF barrier breakdown was the most frequent pathological finding in a multicenter study of 127 patients with COVID-19 with neurological impairment.

Second, we did not examine longitudinal changes in BBB function in our cohort with long COVID; it will be important to determine how long it takes for individuals to recover and if there is resolution of BBB function and prolonged inflammation. As many as half of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported no, or incomplete, recovery between 6 and 18 months after infection with 11% reporting deterioration in symptoms. Understanding the long-term outcome of long COVID will be critical to develop treatment options for this large group of individuals.

Our study is also limited by a small sample size. Future studies with larger patient cohorts should perform unbiased proteome profiling on blood and CSF samples. In agreement with our study, another study also found elevated levels of markers of neurological injury and BBB disruption, such as GFAP, in individuals with long COVID with self-reported neurological symptoms. Ultimately, expanding the use of clinical tools focused on understanding the role of the BBB in postviral illnesses may lead to better treatment and management strategies for patients in the future.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

PASC-CVS — definition, symptoms, diagnostic timing, and management: PASC-CVS is a heterogeneous disorder that includes widely ranging cardiovascular symptoms without objective evidence of cardiovascular disease using standard diagnostic tests, with exercise intolerance and tachycardia commonly reported along with chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, cognitive complaints (memory impairment, attention deficit, poor executive function/brain fog), sleep disturbance or nonrestorative sleep, and postexertional malaise. There are no established timelines for diagnosis; PASC-CVS should be considered when cardiovascular symptoms persist beyond a timeframe typical for the severity of acute infection and projected recovery based on a person's age and underlying health status, and it may be reasonable to consider PASC when symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks after mild acute infection, as opposed to waiting more than 12 weeks as suggested in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and World Health Organization definitions. Where possible, evaluation and management strategies for the most common PASC-CVD entities should follow existing guideline recommendations.

Symptoms of problematic ketamine use

When asked about physical symptoms related to ketamine use, 13% reported no symptoms. However, a significant number experienced bladder problems (60%), nasal issues (60%), 'K‐cramps' (56%), headaches (17%) and other symptoms (12%). Within the 'other' category, specific symptoms included kidney issues, gall bladder issues, body aches, pancreas issues and liver issues, among others such as heart palpitations, erectile dysfunction, blood in urine, constipation and brain fog.

In response to these symptoms, the majority (56%) did not seek treatment. Of those who did, 26% went to accident and emergency, 25% consulted their doctor, 12% saw an urologist and 6% sought other types of care, including self‐management and gallbladder removal. Satisfaction with treatment of these physical symptoms was low, with only 36% reporting feeling satisfied. When asked for further elaboration of treatment experiences, qualitative analyses revealed several cited a lack of effective treatment options or only receiving pain relief (Table 2).

TABLE 2

Abstinence syndrome/withdrawal symptoms

During periods of abstinence, the most commonly reported withdrawal symptoms were cravings (71%), low mood (62%), anxiety (59%) and irritability (45%). Other frequently reported symptoms included sleep disturbances (36%), fatigue (34%), abdominal pain (34%) and insomnia (32%). Less common symptoms included poor appetite (24%), sweating (23%), shaking (17%), palpitations (12%), dysphoria (12%), tremors (9%) and delusions (9%). Additional symptoms reported by some participants included mania, bladder pain and negative psychological impacts.

### Characterizing long COVID in an international cohort: 7 months of symptoms and their impact [^11189d4V]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

3.3.1 Brain fog/Cognitive dysfunction and memory impairment

85.1% (95% confidence interval 83.9% to 86.2%) of respondents (3203) reported experiencing brain fog and cognitive dysfunction, including poor attention, executive functioning, problem solving, and decision making (Fig. 3 d, Supplemental Table S15 for prevalence of sub-symptoms). 72.8% (71.4% to 74.2%) of all respondents (2739) experienced memory impairments, including both short-term and long-term memory loss (Fig. 3 e & Supplemental Table S16 for prevalence of sub-symptoms).

For 31.2% (29.7% to 32.7%) of respondents, the onset of brain fog/cognitive dysfunction occurred in the first week of symptoms. Reports of cognitive dysfunction increased over the first three months, peaking at 66.7% (65.1% to 68.2%), then decreased slightly in the following months. 55.5% (52.5% to 58.8%) of month 7 respondents experienced cognitive dysfunction during month 7 (Fig. 4 j).

The probability of experiencing memory symptoms increased the first few months, with 55.9% (54.3% to 57.5%) reporting memory symptoms in month 4. 50.5% (47.3% to 53.6%) of respondents with symptoms for over six months experienced memory symptoms in month 7 (also Fig. 4 j).

Of those who experienced memory and/or cognitive dysfunction symptoms and had a brain MRI, 87% of the brain MRIs (n = 345, of 397 who were tested) showed no abnormalities.

2 LONG COVID, NEUROLOGICAL AND COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS, AND EEG SIGNATURES

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection can induce "Long COVID", a postacute sequela of COVID‐19 that refers to persistent symptoms continuing for months or longer after the initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The persistent symptoms affect multiple physiological systems with respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and psychological symptoms. One study found that 76% of individuals with mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 experienced at least one persistent symptom 6 months after their initial infection. Another study found that 52% of COVID‐19 survivors experienced persistent symptoms 3 months after infection. These persistent symptoms can significantly impair individuals' quality of life and result in higher healthcare costs.

2.1 Neurological and cognitive symptoms of Long COVID

Neurological symptoms are a significant part of Long COVID, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for better diagnosis and treatment. In a meta‐analysis of 18 studies on 10,530 patients 3 months after COVID‐19 onset, overall prevalence of neurological symptoms was 32% for brain fog, 28% for memory problems, and 22% for attention disorder. Another report with clinical observations of neurological complications in 236,379 patients in the 6 months after a COVID‐19 diagnosis found that 33.62% of patients had demonstrated clinically significant neurological or psychiatric dysfunction.

Neurological symptoms of Long COVID reflect the COVID‐19 neuroinvasion and include headache, tremors, problems with attention and concentration, sluggish cognitive function, dysfunction in the peripheral nerves, and mental health problems. Beyond these typical brain fog symptoms, systematic evidence suggests frequent associations with depressionand post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Together, these symptoms can be characterized as "brain fog". The American Medical Association defines brain fog as some persistent neurological symptoms, including slowed cognition, concentration difficulties, confusion, and forgetfulness. Most people with Long COVID report instances of severe fatigue and brain fog several months after their initial infection. Those symptoms may fluctuate or relapse over time.

Many patients who have suffered from acute COVID infections have long-lasting symptoms affecting several organs including the brain. This long COVID status can include "brain fog" and cognitive deficits that can disturb activities of daily living and can delay complete recovery. Here, we report two cases of neurological long COVID with abnormal FDG PET findings marked by hypometabolic regions of the cingulate cortex.

### A unifying theory for cognitive abnormalities in functional neurological disorders, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: systematic review [^113CdEPo]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

There is ongoing debate regarding the relevance of the growing pathophysiological understanding of FND to people who have chronic pain or chronic fatigue, who are typically diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FM) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). FM and CFS can be regarded as functional somatic syndromes, a group of conditions affecting different body systems, but which are argued to have overlapping clinical and aetiological characteristics. In our clinical practice, it is very common to see patients with FND and comorbid FM and/or CFS. Importantly, FM and CFS are also associated with subjective cognitive difficulties, sometimes referred to as 'brain fog'.

The relationship between archetypal FCD and cognitive symptoms in the context of FM, CFS and FND remains unclear. Furthermore, the extent to which cognitive difficulties in these conditions are separate or overlapping disorders has not previously been studied. However, the extensive literature on cognitive symptomatology in these conditions affords an opportunity to compare them and to consider whether the cognitive symptoms of FND, FM, and CFS provide a template for understanding the emerging concept of FCD.

We conducted a systematic review of cognitive findings in patients with FM, CFS and FND, in order to define their key neuropsychological characteristics. Our hypothesis was that the cognitive profiles associated with functional motor, fatigue and pain syndromes would be similar to each other and to that proposed for isolated FCD. This would support the existence of a shared causal mechanism contributing to cognitive symptoms in these conditions with important implications for diagnosis and treatment.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: common questions and answers [^114wHVoy]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (eg, metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated. Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations. Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

### Neuropsychiatric adverse effects from CFTR modulators deserve a serious research effort [^115cY9Uk]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CURRENT APPROACHES TO MANAGEMENT

One current approach to mitigating neuropsychiatric AEs of ETI in PwCF is off-label ETI dose reduction. This is suboptimal because there is minimal data informing the approach to dose reduction, and while dose reduction can help mitigate neuropsychiatric symptoms for some, it comes at the cost of an uncertain risk of short- or long-term reduced effectiveness against CF symptoms. PwCF, family caregivers and CF care teams may thus be reluctant to employ this strategy or differ in opinion about its risk/benefit ratio. Additionally, in some cases neuropsychiatric AEs continue unless ETI is discontinued or psychopharmacologic therapies are employed.

In a study of 266 adults with CF taking ETI, 19 (7%) reported neuropsychiatric AEs including anxiety, low mood, insomnia, brain fog, and reduced concentration. Of these, 13 attempted ETI dose reduction, of whom all also received psychological intervention and six received antidepressants; all maintained clinical efficacy and sweat chlorides in the normal to borderline range. Ten of 13 had improvement or resolution of neuropsychiatric AEs, with postdose reduction sweat chlorides in the normal or borderline range; two required discontinuation and one switched back to ivacaftor. The authors hypothesized that neuropsychiatric AEs were attributable to psychiatric vulnerability, differences in elexacaftor metabolism, and increased systemic CFTR expression.

In a case series of ten PwCF with new neuropsychiatric symptoms after ETI initiation, including anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbance and/or mental slowness, one discontinued ETI and resumed ivacaftor therapy. Nine underwent dose reduction, using a standardized protocol with serial sweat chloride measurement. Mean sweat chlorides were similar on the standard dose (33.4 mmol/L) and the reduced dose (34 mmol/L). While six of the nine had complete resolution of symptoms with dose reduction, three had only partial resolution. Sweat chloride concentrations decrease with ETI treatment, and data show a direct relationship between improved pulmonary function and sweat chloride concentrations, but to our knowledge neither ETI concentrations nor sweat chloride concentrations have been associated with the occurrence of AEs. Additionally, when an AE is associated with ETI, there is not a standard approach to monitoring the balance of safety (avoidance of AEs) and efficacy (pulmonary function, exacerbations, etc.). Plasma concentrations of ETI and sweat chloride concentrations have been evaluated in small studies but are not clinically validated to guide dose titration and are not correlated with safety or efficacy.

### The omics landscape of long COVID – A comprehensive systematic review to advance biomarker, target and drug discovery [^112avfFL]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3.1 Proteomics and Genomics

LC patients with neurologic complaints exhibit a distinctive plasma proteomic profile compared to COVID‐19 convalescents, characterized by reduced pro‐inflammatory and antiviral response proteins, alongside increased immunoregulatory proteins, correlating with neurocognitive dysfunction. Genetic associations were identified between SNPs and neurological symptoms, in which FURIN and SLC6A20 were emphasized. Taylor et al. identified 73 genes related to severe LC and fatigue‐dominant cohorts, with five genes (D2HDGH, GUCY1A2, PCSK2, CCDC146, PGPEP1) involved in metabolism and regulatory pathways present in both. Combinatorial analytics highlighted 42 genes as potential therapeutic targets, with 13 already linked to existing drugs. Pathway analysis showed these genes were mostly related to neurological and cardiometabolic diseases. TLR4 was proposed for drug repurposing.

3.3.2 Transcriptomics

Brain fog, a neurological manifestation of LC, can lead to cognitive impairment. Greene et al. found significantly increased concentrations of S100β, a marker of blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction that was also positively associated with age, in AC patients. A transcriptomics study in LC patients with brain fog revealed differentially expressed genes compared to recovered individuals that showed dysregulated immune responses. Upregulated genes were related to T‐cell activation, angiogenesis (including HIF1A, HES1 and DLL1) and TGF‐signaling (including SMAD3, SNAI1, SMURF1), crucial for BBB regulation. Downregulated genes involved platelet activation and hemostasis, suggesting systemic alterations and vascular abnormalities. Compared to LC patients without brain fog, those affected had distinct gene expression profiles related to T‐cell differentiation and activation (including TNFSF9, IFNG and RUNX3), but also the negative regulation of immune responses, pointing to sustained systemic inflammation (including WASL, TNFAIP3 and ID2) and BBB disruption.

### Hypoparathyroidism: changes in brain structure, cognitive impairment, and reduced quality of life [^115qRMiZ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a disease with no/or inadequate production/secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid glands. Low levels of PTH result in hypocalcemia, which is often treated with calcium supplementation and active vitamin-D analogs. However, increasing evidence suggests that HypoPT has a profound impact on several organ systems. Quality of life (QOL) is reduced in patients with HypoPT, partly due to symptoms related to the central nervous system-including subjective feelings of confusion, a reduced ability to focus and think clearly (ie, "brain fog"). However, the extent to which these complex symptoms relate to quantifiable changes in patients' cognitive performance as determined by neuropsychological tests remains unclear. The brains of HypoPT patients may reveal tissue calcifications, but the extent to which long-term brain exposure to low PTH levels and/or changing calcium levels affects brain structure is unknown. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated PTH levels, QOL, cognitive impairment, and brain structure in well-treated post-surgical and non-surgical hypoparathyroid patients compared with healthy controls. QOL was quantified by the SF36v2, WHO-5 wellbeing Index, and two disease-specific questionnaires-the HPQ28 and Hypoparathyroidism Symptom Diary. Cognitive functions were tested using comprehensive neuropsychological. Brain structure was quantified by morphological analyses of magnetic resonance imaging images. We found reduced QOL and cognitive functioning in terms of processing speed, executive functions, visual memory, and auditory memory in HypoPT. Furthermore, HypoPT revealed a reduced volume of the hippocampus-and the size of the thalamus in postsurgical patients was associated with the disease duration. Importantly, patients reporting severe brain fog had a smaller hippocampus than those with less brainfog. HypoPT is associated with quantifiable cognitive deficits and changes in brain structure that align with patient symptoms. Our exploratory study warrants further studies of the neurobiological impact of PTH and of the impact of PTH replacements therapy on patients' cognitive functioning.

### Directional subthalamic deep brain stimulation better improves gait and balance disorders in Parkinson's disease patients: a randomized controlled study [^113PuMc1]. Annals of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gait parameters and clinical scales were assessed both in the OFF‐DOPA condition (withdrawal of 12 hours of antiparkinsonian treatment) and in the ON‐DOPA condition (after administering a suprathreshold dose of‐dopa) at baseline, month 8, and month 13.

Cortico‐Subthalamic Connectivity

We assessed the cortico‐subthalamic streamlines encompassed by the individual VTAs for each STN‐DBS condition for each hemisphere of each patient, as previously reported (Fig 2E, F, see Supplemental methods). Each VTA was modeled using the Lead‐DBS toolbox, by computing the electrical fields using the Simbio/Fieldtrip techniqueand thresholding at 0.2V/mm. We, then, extracted the connectivity of each VTA with the 39 cortical Brodmann areas (BA) from the whole brain tractography, and segmented using the Brodmann atlas included in MRIcro. We used the normalized sum of streamline weights involved in tracks of interest and the fiber bundle capacity (FBC), as a quantitative measure of connectivity (see Fig 2).

Statistical Analysis

We used linear mixed‐effects models to test the planned comparison between central STN‐dDBS, posterior STN‐dDBS and ring‐mode STN‐DBS (all conditions OFF‐DOPA) at month (randomized double‐blind period). Treatment condition was coded as a factor and included as a fixed effect as well as a random slope, where patient identification was used as the grouping factor in the random effects. Separate models were fit for the Euclidean distance of the PC scores and individual PC scores derived from gait initiation data, as well as clinical scores at month 7. We used linear mixed‐effects models with the same fixed and random effects structures to compare data collected before surgery in the OFF‐DOPA and ON‐DOPA states, and between central STN‐dDBS at month 7, month 8, and month 13 (OFF‐DOPA). We used a binomial generalized linear mixed model to examine the probability of experiencing FOG during a gait trial.

### Living with ME / CFS… [^117NcA3E]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Everyday strategies Healthcare providers can treat some symptoms with medicine, but there are other management strategies that do not involve medications. These strategies may be helpful to some patients:

- Professional counseling. Talking about how to cope with the illness and its impact on daily life may help.
- Occupational counseling to identify workplace accommodations and strategies to conserve energy while performing daily living activities.
- Balanced diet. This is important for everyone and benefits people with or without chronic illness.
- Nutritional supplements. Benefits and risks of interactions with other medications should be considered.
- Other therapies. Meditation, gentle massage, deep breathing, or relaxation therapy might help. Important note: Patients should talk with their healthcare providers about all therapies before beginning them. Many treatments promoted as cures for ME/CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.

In October, I got a COVID booster shot and after, I felt like the dizziness was not as bad, but the fatigue was still there. At this point I had to change my work schedule. I had worked three 12-hour shifts but now had to make sure that I took a day off in between each shift so I could recover, especially from the feeling of being exhausted after doing something. And the brain fog and insomnia were hard. As I planned Thanksgiving, I almost went over the edge with depressing thoughts, and had difficulty making non-routine decisions or choices. I made an appointment at a post-COVID clinic, but it took until January 2022 for me to see the doctor. The doctor told me that my post-COVID symptoms were parallel to ME/CFS and that it was all very similar. For me, the neurological symptoms, fatigue, and POTS were the worst. Also, the activity intolerance.

Learning to live with my symptoms and the management plan have helped me. Most importantly, I committed to therapy and have worked to let go of the shame I built up over the years. For the first time, I mourned the loss of the person I once was and am learning to have more compassion for who I am moving forward. With the additional help of antidepressants, I've realized I never would have taken control of my health in this way if I hadn't gotten sick. Resources CDC developed a ME/CFS Patient Toolkit. It provides information about ME/CFS and helpful support for visiting a healthcare provider.

### How primary care physicians can recognize and treat long COVID… [^11341iQH]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

While awaiting Lyme titers, Jeansonne started a course of doxycycline, then had a routine surgery that had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2 weeks, she did "pretty much nothing" while recovering at home. "I felt great, " she said. Returning to work, though, "everything came back almost exponentially" — the numbness, the tingling, the palpitations — and then the brain fog started. Jeansonne struggled to get through her continuing medical education work. "I told my husband, something's really wrong, " she said. The team decided early on that they would just "start seeing patients and figure it out — let's hear the story. Let's see what the patterns are. And take it from there, " Brode said in an interview. Over time, they noticed a handful of symptoms over and over again. "Almost everybody has fatigue, brain fog, neurocognitive impairment, and postexertional malaise, " the latter being a worsening of symptoms for days or even weeks after physical or mental exertion, Brode said.

After watching several of the center's videos and downloading its guidance for ME/CFS-related postexertional malaise, Jeansonne started drinking electrolyte fluids and wearing compression socks. She paced her activity, lying down for a 15-minute break every few hours and not answering evening calls. She downloaded an exercise protocol developed for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and began a graded program of horizontal exercise. After 6 months on this regimen, Jeansonne has resumed seeing patients 4½ days a week. She rejoined the YMCA, has normal blood pressure, and rarely gets a headache. Address fatigue. "If patients stop overexerting themselves, they start to feel better. It's as simple as that, " Brode said. Physicians should discuss with patients "what they can honestly do in their daily activities. " Look to familiar conditions.

According to the CDC, long COVID can share symptoms with ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome, dysautonomia, and mast cell activation syndrome. Approaches to managing these conditions can help some patients with long COVID. For example, POTS can be alleviated with fluids, compression garments, and graded horizontal exercise.
