## Question

Are there conclusive studies regarding the effect of mobile phones on human health?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are conclusive studies regarding the effect of mobile phones on human health. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "conclusive" means in evidence-based medicine and how to grade certainty. Then, I should distinguish mobile phone use as a health intervention (mHealth) from potential harms due to radiofrequency exposure. Next, I will review the highest-quality evidence for mHealth benefits, followed by the evidence on RF-related harms. After that, I should examine key limitations that constrain certainty. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced, clinically useful conclusion and outline practical implications for patients and clinicians.

> Let me first confirm what "conclusive" entails. In clinical research, conclusive typically implies convincing (class 1) evidence from large, low-heterogeneity meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with adequate power, low risk of bias, and no publication bias; highly suggestive (class 2) evidence falls short of this bar due to heterogeneity or untested bias, and GRADE ratings of high certainty reflect consistent, precise, and unbiased estimates across studies, which I should verify against the umbrella review methodology and WHO guideline standards before drawing conclusions [^112UZq8M] [^115RQdj1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to separate two distinct questions. One is whether mobile phone–based health interventions improve clinical outcomes (mHealth), and the other is whether mobile phone use itself causes adverse health effects via radiofrequency exposure; conflating these would mislead interpretation, so I will treat them separately and weigh the certainty of evidence for each domain independently [^112UZq8M] [^114amG2C].

> Next, I should review the strongest evidence for mHealth benefits. Multiple high-quality syntheses show that mobile phone interventions can improve health behaviors and some clinical outcomes, but effects are generally modest and certainty varies by outcome. For smoking cessation, Cochrane reviews consistently show increased quit rates at six months with text messaging (RR about 1.5–1.7), with biochemical verification strengthening confidence, though heterogeneity persists and generalizability beyond high-income settings requires caution [^11395AXX] [^114o2Gcs]. For chronic disease self-management, an umbrella review of 34 meta-analyses found mobile phone interventions yield moderate improvements in adherence and some physiologic measures, but zero effects met class 1 "convincing" criteria, indicating the evidence is promising yet not definitive across PICOs [^112UZq8M] [^113Q8CQQ]. For sexual and reproductive health, targeted mobile communication increases STI/HIV testing and modestly improves contraception use, but certainty is low to moderate and sensitive to control conditions and context [^116EP7ZW] [^112rk7Wg]. For appointment attendance, text reminders improve attendance versus no reminder and perform similarly to phone calls at lower cost, supporting implementation value despite modest effect size [^116df98R] [^114a5KZs].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and clinical relevance of these effects. Effect sizes are typically small to moderate; for example, text messaging for CVD prevention shows mean reductions of about 1–4 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and ~0.2 kg/m² in BMI in pooled analyses, with authors noting potential public health significance if sustained and scalable, but also emphasizing that current data are not conclusive on hard outcomes or cost-effectiveness at scale [^114hGGRS] [^1151U7KJ]. Similarly, mobile apps for overweight/obesity show minimal, often non–clinically significant weight loss at 12–24 months, reinforcing that while benefits exist, they are modest and context dependent [^114WP6dD].

> I will now examine the evidence for RF-related harms. Large cohort and case-control studies, including Danish nationwide cohorts and the Interphone consortium, generally show no increased risk of brain tumors overall, with occasional subgroup signals (e.g., heavy ipsilateral use > 10 years) that are vulnerable to recall and selection bias; taken together, there is no consistent evidence of increased brain tumor risk from mobile phone use to date [^117PQEBV] [^11766h62]. For leukemia, case-control studies likewise show no association with regular use, though very long-term exposure remains less well characterized, and the biological plausibility for hematologic malignancy from non-ionizing RF remains weak [^116k52Kk] [^111vcZhr]. Regarding 5G, high-quality epidemiologic evidence is essentially absent, and current discussions emphasize uncertainty and the precautionary principle rather than demonstrated harm, which I should be careful not to over-interpret as established risk [^111qG6kU].

> But wait, what about non-cancer outcomes like hearing or neurocognitive effects? Small studies suggest possible auditory changes with long-term heavy use, yet these findings are inconsistent, methodologically limited, and not corroborated by larger, high-quality evidence; thus, they remain hypothesis-generating rather than conclusive [^116Kynde]. Overall, authoritative reviews conclude that while absolute safety cannot be proven, epidemiologic evidence does not demonstrate clear RF-related health harms at exposure levels from typical phone use, aligning with the long-standing consensus that the main, well-established health risk is motor vehicle collisions due to distracted driving, not RF exposure per se [^114amG2C].

> I need to check key limitations that constrain certainty. Many mHealth meta-analyses suffer from heterogeneity, short follow-up (median ~6 months), small primary studies (mean ~200 participants), and inconsistent control conditions; only a minority test for publication bias, and risk of bias domains such as blinding and incomplete outcomes are frequently problematic, all of which downgrade confidence and preclude "conclusive" grading across most PICOs [^117EK3C2] [^1128th93] [^116VjoXR]. For RF harms, most data are observational with exposure misclassification and potential recall bias; even large studies acknowledge that a small risk after very long-term use cannot be entirely excluded, which is why conclusions remain cautious rather than categorical [^117PQEBV] [^11766h62].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. For mHealth, there is moderate-certainty evidence of modest benefit for several behaviors and some clinical outcomes (notably smoking cessation, medication adherence, appointment attendance, and select diabetes/HTN measures), but no domain meets class 1 "convincing" criteria, so the overall conclusion is that benefits are real but not definitive enough to be called conclusive across all settings and outcomes [^113Q8CQQ] [^11395AXX]. For RF-related harms, there is no consistent evidence of increased brain tumor or leukemia risk from typical mobile phone use, though very long-term heavy use remains less certain; thus, there are no conclusive studies demonstrating harm, but absence of evidence is not proof of absence, warranting continued surveillance and methodological improvement [^117PQEBV] [^11766h62].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical guidance. Clinicians can reasonably recommend evidence-based mHealth tools as adjuncts for smoking cessation, chronic disease self-management, and appointment adherence, while setting expectations about modest effect sizes and the need for sustained, sometimes interactive, engagement; they should also counsel on distracted-driving risks, which are well established and preventable [^11395AXX] [^116df98R] [^113DueTi]. For patients concerned about RF exposure, simple precautions (hands-free, texting over calling, limiting prolonged calls) align with precautionary principles without implying proven harm, and shared decision-making should reflect current uncertainty and patient preferences [^114amG2C] [^113cdZ5v].

There is **no conclusive evidence** that mobile phones cause adverse health effects in humans [^114amG2C]. Large epidemiological studies and meta-analyses show **no consistent link** to brain tumors, including glioma and acoustic neuroma [^117PQEBV] [^114PLYU7], and no clear association with leukemia or other cancers [^116k52Kk] [^111vcZhr] [^117PQEBV]. Evidence for non-cancer effects (cognition, sleep, fertility) is mixed and generally low quality [^114P3qd2]. The WHO classifies radiofrequency radiation as "possibly carcinogenic" (Group 2B) [^116eqGUG] based on limited evidence, but major reviews conclude that if any risk exists, it is likely very small [^113cdZ5v]. Long-term, high-quality studies are ongoing, but current data do not support a causal relationship between mobile phone use and harm [^114amG2C] [^117PQEBV].

## Epidemiological evidence on cancer risk

### Brain tumors

- **Interphone study**: No overall increased risk of glioma or meningioma with regular mobile phone use; a modest increase in glioma risk was observed in the highest exposure group (> 1,640 cumulative hours), but this finding is subject to potential bias and uncertainty [^117PQEBV].

- **Danish cohort study**: No increased risk of brain or nervous system tumors among mobile phone subscribers, including long-term users (≥ 10 years) [^11766h62].

- **Acoustic neuroma**: No substantial risk in the first decade of use; a small increase after long-term use cannot be ruled out, but evidence remains limited [^114PLYU7].

---

### Leukemia and other cancers

Regarding leukemia and other cancers, **case-control studies** show no association between regular mobile phone use and leukemia risk, including with long-term use (≥ 15 years) [^116k52Kk] [^111vcZhr]. Additionally, **other cancers** show no consistent evidence linking mobile phone use to increased risk of breast, testicular, or salivary gland cancers.

---

## Non-cancer health effects

### Cognitive function and neurological symptoms

Evidence for cognitive effects is **mixed**, with some studies reporting subtle changes in cognitive function or neurological symptoms, but overall evidence is inconclusive and often confounded by other factors [^111UktpY]. Regarding **electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS)**, no robust evidence supports a causal link between mobile phone use and EHS symptoms; reported symptoms may be psychogenic or related to other environmental factors.

---

### Sleep disturbances

Sleep disturbances have been explored, but **limited evidence** suggests possible sleep disturbances from mobile phone use, particularly with nighttime exposure; however, findings are inconsistent and often not replicated [^notfound].

---

### Fertility and reproductive health

Regarding fertility and reproductive health, **male fertility** has been studied with mixed results; some studies suggest potential effects on sperm quality, but evidence remains inconclusive and confounded by lifestyle factors.

---

## Biological mechanisms and experimental studies

- **Thermal effects**: Mobile phones emit non-ionizing radiation, primarily causing tissue heating. Current safety guidelines (e.g. SAR limits) are designed to prevent harmful thermal effects.

- **Non-thermal effects**: Experimental studies have explored potential non-thermal biological effects (e.g. oxidative stress, DNA damage), but findings are inconsistent and not clearly linked to adverse health outcomes in humans.

---

## Expert opinions and regulatory assessments

- **WHO classification**: The WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2B), based on limited evidence of increased glioma risk with heavy use. This classification reflects uncertainty rather than established harm [^116eqGUG].

- **Regulatory bodies**: Major health organizations (e.g. FDA, FCC, ICNIRP) conclude that current evidence does not demonstrate significant health risks from mobile phone use within established safety guidelines.

---

## Gaps in current research

- **Long-term exposure**: Most studies have relatively short follow-up periods (< 10 years), limiting conclusions about long-term health effects.

- **Children and adolescents**: Limited data exist on potential health effects in children and adolescents, who may be more vulnerable to environmental exposures.

- **Exposure assessment**: Accurate measurement of mobile phone use remains a challenge, leading to potential misclassification and bias in epidemiological studies.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Current evidence **does not support a causal relationship** between mobile phone use and adverse health effects, including cancer, cognitive impairment, or reproductive harm [^11766h62]. The WHO's "possibly carcinogenic" classification reflects limited evidence and ongoing uncertainty, not established harm. Continued research — particularly long-term studies and those focused on vulnerable populations — is warranted. Users concerned about potential risks can adopt precautionary measures, such as using hands-free devices, limiting call duration, and avoiding phone use in areas with weak signals.

### Mobile phone interventions to improve health outcomes among patients with chronic diseases: an umbrella review and evidence synthesis from 34 meta-analyses [^116inrm4]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

There are several key limitations to the current evidence base that impede dissemination of knowledge about digital mobile phone interventions and policy efforts. First, reviews on mobile phone interventions reach inconsistent conclusions on their effects across chronic health conditions, – making implementation and dissemination efforts challenging. Second, despite a growing number of RCTs, the quality of the available meta-analyses varies greatly. Methodological limitations, such as combining active (eg, another intervention programme) and inactive (eg, usual care without additional intervention) control conditions, infrequent reporting of moderators, and little assessment of publication bias, can produce skewed results and misleading policy implications.

This Review aims to synthesise the extant literature on the efficacy of mobile phone interventions for patients with chronic diseases through umbrella review methods. This approach can provide a clear summary of rigorously conducted meta-analyses of RCTs designed to test mobile phone interventions for chronic diseases, uncovering the degree of evidence certainty across subcategories (ie, differing types of participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes [PICOs]). In an umbrella review of mobile phone interventions for mental health, published in 2022, we found no convincing (class 1) evidence for efficacy across PICOs despite a large RCT base (145 RCTs, n = 47 940 participants). Mobile phone interventions for chronic diseases is an older field compared with these interventions for mental health, based on the history of funding and the number of digital health startups. However, existing umbrella reviews have focused on specific conditions (eg, text message interventions for type 2 diabetes). – A comprehensive umbrella review of mobile phone interventions for chronic conditions is therefore timely and can provide information on what types of mobile phone interventions are effective for which chronic conditions and specific health outcomes. As mobile phone interventions become increasingly popular, consolidating evidence can offer guidance to the public, researchers, clinicians, and policy makers on the utility of these interventions.

### Mobile phone text-messaging interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (text2PreventCVD): systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^1151U7KJ]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this paper is that mobile phone text-messaging interventions have modest impacts on objective measures of cardiovascular risk factors of BP and BMI in analyses of pooled data using standard and IPD meta-analyses. Modest impacts on cardiovascular risk factors could have clinical and/or public health significance if they could impact on multiple risk factors simultaneously and/or do this at a very low cost, but the current data are not conclusive on these points. The pooled data are from a number of different regions, and the high acceptability of texting interventions reported by most studies in our review suggests generalisability of findings and potential for widespread implementation, but there is still relatively few large-scale or multicentre evaluations.

Efficient, simultaneous risk factor reduction is important in the prevention of CVD as risk reduction is additive across single risk factors; for example, BP lowering plus lipid lowering is more effective at reducing risk than either alone. The reasons that the data are still inconclusive are likely because of the small number of individual participants in trials, the heterogeneity of the study population (including primary and secondary prevention populations), the heterogeneity of the interventions and the likely small individual impact of the interventions themselves.

### Mobile phone interventions to improve health outcomes among patients with chronic diseases: an umbrella review and evidence synthesis from 34 meta-analyses [^112UZq8M]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

We applied a previously proposed umbrella review methodology to evaluate the strength of evidence. Evidence grade was determined for each representative effect size based on the associated sample size, p value, heterogeneity, and presence of publication bias (panel 1). For instance, class 1 or convincing evidence requires a sample of 1000 participants or more, p < 10⁻⁶, I² ≤ 50%, and no publication bias. Class 2 or highly suggestive evidence requires a sample of 1000 participants or more and p < 10⁻⁶ but other class 2 criteria (ie, heterogeneity or publication bias) are not met. To characterise class 2 effect sizes that did not test for publication bias (which can occur when insufficient studies are available for an adequately powered test), as shown in panel 1, effect sizes without an evaluation of publication bias yet meeting all other criteria for class 1 were categorised as class 2+ or highly suggestive+.

As additional information on evidence certainty, we reported meta-analysts' evaluation of evidence via the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach when it was used. We did not conduct additional GRADE ratings on extracted effect sizes due to the Cochrane guideline on overviews of reviews that suggests the extraction of certainty of evidence from the systematic reviews themselves and little reliability in GRADE ratings when made with meta-analyses.

Introduction

The global burden of chronic diseases, defined as "conditions that last one year or more and require ongoing medical attention", such as diabetes, hypertension, and HIV or AIDS, is high. In 2023, WHO reported that non-communicable diseases were responsible for seven out of ten deaths worldwide. People in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) will have the highest risk of dying from chronic diseases in the next decade. In response, in 2015 global leaders endorsed the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 of a reduction by a third in premature mortality by non-communicable diseases by 2030 through prevention and treatment. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to reach the vast patient populations with chronic diseases and promote optimal health.

In parallel, the past decade has had rapid development in the area of mobile health, defined as "medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants, and other wireless devices". In particular, mobile phone interventions (eg, smartphone apps and SMSs) have gained global ubiquityand have the potential to reach and engage patients with chronic diseases, provide health education, monitor symptoms, promote a healthy lifestyle, and support behavioural interventions. Research on mobile phone interventions for patients with chronic disease, with rigorous, gold-standard designs (ie, randomised controlled trials [RCTs]), has rapidly expanded. Mobile phone interventions are increasingly integrated into clinical care in the real world, and this trend has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration and similar organisations worldwide are piloting approaches to evaluate these interventions. Thus, there is a need to understand the current risks and benefits to such mobile health interventions. Given a paucity of research coming from mobile health companies themselves, our use of RCTs to benchmark the state of the science is timely and relevant to many stakeholders.

### Mobile phone interventions to improve health outcomes among patients with chronic diseases: an umbrella review and evidence synthesis from 34 meta-analyses [^113Q8CQQ]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

This umbrella review included ten chronic conditions and a wide range of physical (eg, blood pressure, weight, and HbA₁c), behavioural (eg, medication adherence), and psychological (eg, quality of life) health outcomes. Strengths of this approach include capturing a broad range of conditions and health outcomes, categorisation of the strength of the evidence, and assessment of moderators. In summary, current evidence suggests that mobile phone interventions could support various health outcomes amenable to self-management (eg, medication adherence). The magnitude of effects tends to be moderate compared with usual care alone. In real-world clinical care, the add-on effect of mobile phone interventions in combination with routine medical care could make clinically relevant differences for patients. This possibility presents a promising view of mobile phone interventions in the future of medical care for patients with chronic diseases.

### Sexual health interventions delivered to participants by mobile technology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116EP7ZW]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of mobile technologies to prevent STIs is recognised as a promising approach worldwide; however, evidence has been inconclusive, and the field has developed rapidly. With about 1million new STIs a day globally, up-to-date evidence is urgently needed.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of mobile health interventions delivered to participants for preventing STIs and promoting preventive behaviour.

Methods

We searched seven databases and reference lists of 49 related reviews (January 1990-February 2020) and contacted experts in the field. We included randomised controlled trials of mobile interventions delivered to adolescents and adults to prevent sexual transmission of STIs. We conducted meta-analyses and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence following Cochrane guidance.

Results

After double screening 6683 records, we included 22 trials into the systematic review and 20 into meta-analyses; 18 trials used text messages, 3 used smartphone applications and 1 used Facebook messages as delivery modes. The certainty of evidence regarding intervention effects on STI/HIV occurrence and adverse events was low or very low. There was moderate certainty of evidence that in the short/medium-term text messaging interventions had little or no effect on condom use (standardised mean differences (SMD) 0.02, 95%CI -0.09 to 0.14, nine trials), but increased STI/HIV testing (OR 1.83, 95%CI 1.41 to 2.36, seven trials), although not if the standard-of-care control already contained an active text messaging component (OR 1.00, 95%CI 0.68 to 1.47, two trials). Smartphone application messages also increased STI/HIV testing (risk ratio 1.40, 95%CI 1.22 to 1.60, subgroup analysis, two trials). The effects on other outcomes or of social media or blended interventions is uncertain due to low or very low certainty evidence.

Conclusions

Text messaging interventions probably increase STI/HIV testing but not condom use in the short/medium term. Ongoing trials will report the effects on biological and other outcomes.

### Mobile phone messaging for preventive health care [^115YdHKL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Preventive health care promotes health and prevents disease or injuries by addressing factors that lead to the onset of a disease, and by detecting latent conditions to reduce or halt their progression. Many risk factors for costly and disabling conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases) can be prevented, yet healthcare systems do not make the best use of their available resources to support this process. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), could offer a convenient and cost-effective way to support desirable health behaviours for preventive health care.

Objectives

To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging interventions as a mode of delivery for preventive health care, on health status and health behaviour outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We included studies using SMS or MMS as a mode of delivery for any type of preventive health care. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third author. Primary outcomes of interest were health status and health behaviour outcomes. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, health service utilisation and costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. Because the included studies were heterogeneous in type of condition addressed, intervention characteristics and outcome measures, we did not consider that it was justified to conduct a meta-analysis to derive an overall effect size for the main outcome categories; instead, we present findings narratively.

Main Results

We included four randomised controlled trials involving 1933 participants. For the primary outcome category of health, there was moderate quality evidence from one study that women who received prenatal support via mobile phone messages had significantly higher satisfaction than those who did not receive the messages, both in the antenatal period (mean difference (MD) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.72) and perinatal period (MD 1.19, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.01). Their confidence level was also higher (MD 1.12, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.73) and anxiety level was lower (MD -2.15, 95% CI -3.42 to -0.88) than in the control group in the antenatal period. In this study, no further differences were observed between groups in the perinatal period. There was low quality evidence that the mobile phone messaging intervention did not affect pregnancy outcomes (gestational age at birth, infant birth weight, preterm delivery and route of delivery). For the primary outcome category of health behaviour, there was moderate quality evidence from one study that mobile phone message reminders to take vitamin C for preventive reasons resulted in higher adherence (risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.74). There was high quality evidence from another study that participants receiving mobile phone messaging support had a significantly higher likelihood of quitting smoking than those in a control group at 6 weeks (RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.70) and at 12 weeks follow-up (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.84). At 26 weeks, there was only a significant difference between groups if, for participants with missing data, the last known value was carried forward. There was very low quality evidence from one study that mobile phone messaging interventions for self-monitoring of healthy behaviours related to childhood weight control did not have a statistically significant effect on physical activity, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages or screen time. For the secondary outcome of acceptability, there was very low quality evidence from one study that user evaluation of the intervention was similar between groups. There was moderate quality evidence from one study of no difference in adverse effects of the intervention, measured as rates of pain in the thumb or finger joints, and car crash rates. None of the studies reported the secondary outcomes of health service utilisation or costs of the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very limited evidence that in certain cases mobile phone messaging interventions may support preventive health care, to improve health status and health behaviour outcomes. However, because of the low number of participants in three of the included studies, combined with study limitations of risk of bias and lack of demonstrated causality, the evidence for these effects is of low to moderate quality. The evidence is of high quality only for interventions aimed at smoking cessation. Furthermore, there are significant information gaps regarding the long-term effects, risks and limitations of, and user satisfaction with, such interventions.

### Mobile phone-based interventions for improving contraception use [^112rk7Wg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Contraception provides significant benefits for women's and children's health, yet many women have an unmet need for contraception. Rapid expansion in the use of mobile phones in recent years has had a dramatic impact on interpersonal communication. Within the health domain text messages and smartphone applications offer means of communication between clients and healthcare providers. This review focuses on interventions delivered by mobile phone and their effect on use of contraception.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of mobile phone-based interventions for improving contraception use.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was August 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of mobile phone-based interventions to improve forms of contraception use amongst users or potential users of contraception.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. uptake of contraception, 2. uptake of a specific method of contraception, 3. adherence to contraception method, 4. safe method switching, 5. discontinuation of contraception and 6. pregnancy or abortion. Our secondary outcomes were 7. road traffic accidents, 8. any physical or psychological effect reported and 9. violence or domestic abuse.

Main Results

Twenty-three RCTs (12,793 participants) from 11 countries met our inclusion criteria. Eleven studies were conducted in high-income resource settings and 12 were in low-income settings. Thirteen studies used unidirectional text messaging-based interventions, six studies used interactive text messaging, four used voice message-based interventions and two used mobile-phone apps to improve contraception use. All studies received funding from non-commercial bodies. Mobile phone-based interventions probably increase contraception use compared to the control (odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 1.60; 16 studies, 8972 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in rates of unintended pregnancy with the use of mobile phone-based interventions compared to control (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.38; 8 trials, 2947 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis assessing unidirectional mobile phone interventions versus interactive mobile phone interventions found evidence of a difference between the subgroups favouring interactive interventions (P = 0.003, I² = 88.5%). Interactive interventions had an OR of 1.71 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.29; P = 0.0003, I² = 63%; 8 trials, 3089 participants) whilst unidirectional interventions had an OR of 1.03 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.22; P = 0.72, I² = 17%; 9 trials, 5883 participants). Subgroup analysis assessing high-income versus low-income trial settings found no difference between groups (subgroup difference test: P = 0.70, I² = 0%). Only six trials reported on safety and unintended outcomes; one trial reported increased partner violence whilst another four trials reported no difference in physical violence rates between control and intervention groups. One trial reported no road traffic accidents with mobile phone intervention use.

Authors' Conclusions

This review demonstrates there is evidence to support the use of mobile phone-based interventions in improving the use of contraception, with moderate-certainty evidence. Interactive mobile phone interventions appear more effective than unidirectional methods. The cost-effectiveness, cost benefits, safety and long-term effects of these interventions remain unknown, as does the evidence of this approach to support contraception use among specific populations. Future research should investigate the effectiveness and safety of mobile phone-based interventions with better quality trials to help establish the effects of interventions delivered by mobile phone on contraception use. This review is limited by the quality of the studies due to flaws in methodology, bias or imprecision of results.

### An umbrella review of effectiveness and efficacy trials for app-based health interventions [^114NtvCh]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Health interventions based on mobile phone or tablet applications (apps) are promising tools to help patients manage their conditions more effectively. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on efficacy and effectiveness of such interventions is increasingly available. This umbrella review aimed at mapping and narratively summarizing published systematic reviews on efficacy and effectiveness of mobile app-based health interventions within patient populations. We followed a pre-specified publicly available protocol. Systematic reviews were searched in two databases from inception until August 28, 2023. Reviews that included RCTs evaluating integrated or stand-alone health app interventions in patient populations with regard to efficacy/effectiveness were considered eligible. Information on indications, outcomes, app characteristics, efficacy/effectiveness results and authors' conclusions was extracted. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR2 tool. We identified 48 systematic reviews published between 2013 and 2023 (35 with meta-analyses) that met our inclusion criteria. Eleven reviews included a broad spectrum of conditions, thirteen focused on diabetes, five on anxiety and/or depression, and others on various other indications. Reported outcomes ranged from medication adherence to laboratory, anthropometric and functional parameters, symptom scores and quality of life. Fourty-one reviews concluded that health apps may be effective in improving health outcomes. We rated one review as moderate quality. Here we report that the synthesized evidence on health app effectiveness varies largely between indications. Future RCTs should consider reporting behavioral (process) outcomes and measures of healthcare resource utilization to provide deeper insights on mechanisms that make health apps effective, and further elucidate their impact on healthcare systems.

### Mobile phone interventions to improve health outcomes among patients with chronic diseases: an umbrella review and evidence synthesis from 34 meta-analyses [^114Kwnwb]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

Adverse events

Only two of 34 meta-analyses (6%) reported adverse events. In a meta-analysis focused on type 1 and type 2 diabetes, risk of severe hypoglycaemia from four trials, including three RCTs on type 1 diabetes and one on type 2 diabetes (risk ratio 1.07; 95% CI 0.23–5.09), and overall hypoglycaemia from three trials, including two RCTs on type 1 diabetes and one on type 2 diabetes (1.62; 0.48–5.40), did not differ between mobile phone and usual care conditions. A meta-analysis that focused on type 2 diabetes for Chinese adultsnoted that incidence of hypoglycaemia after 6 months from five primary studies and incidence of diabetic complications (eg, diabetic neuropathy or diabetic ketoacidosis) in three primary studies was lower in the mobile phone intervention group than usual care group, although an effect size was not reported.

### Mobile phone text-messaging interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (text2PreventCVD): systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^116YYSKD]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Mobile phone text-messaging interventions have modest impacts on objective measures of BP and BMI. Evidence is suggestive, but inconclusive, that texting is acceptable, generalisable and scalable, and their modest impacts on cardiovascular risk factors may apply to multiple cardiovascular risk factors and hence make this a mHealth solution with public health significance.

### Mobile phone interventions to improve health outcomes among patients with chronic diseases: an umbrella review and evidence synthesis from 34 meta-analyses [^115byWxb]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

Close to half of the evidence came from the literature focused on type 2 diabetes (29 of 64 representative effect sizes; 45%), reflecting the uneven level of research maturity across chronic diseases. The effect sizes for type 2 diabetes outcomes are similar to previous umbrella reviews, yet the representative effect sizes and heterogeneity tended to be smaller in our review, with a larger number of studies available in the current analysed literature. Given that previous summaries of the area of mobile phone health interventions focused on diabetes-related conditions, this umbrella review provides key information on the utility of mobile health interventions across conditions, medical outcomes, and populations.

Results also highlight an uneven distribution of study settings. The majority of primary RCTs were based in high-income (40%) and upper-middle-income (42%) countries, with fewer than 20% conducted in LMICs. More than 85% of the evidence comes from Asia, Europe, and North America, with little research in the global south. As low-income countries have been experiencing an epidemiological transition from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases, these findings represent an important missed opportunity to address the global burden of chronic diseases. Epidemiological data suggest there will be drastic increases in disability and premature death due to chronic diseases by 2040 in LMICs and the global south (eg, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Brazil), regions that also lack resources and preparedness. Investment in research for these regions, infrastructure (eg, satellite connectivity, free internet hotspots, and low-cost mobile phones), and education (eg, digital literacy training) will support the success of mobile phone interventions in areas where the effect could be greatest.

### Does women's mobile phone ownership matter for health? Evidence from 15 countries [^11342r3J]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Mobile phones have the potential to increase access to health information, improve patient-provider communication, and influence the content and quality of health services received. Evidence on the gender gap in ownership of mobile phones is limited, and efforts to link phone ownership among women to care-seeking and practices for reproductive maternal newborn and child health (RMNCH) have yet to be made. This analysis aims to assess household and women's access to phones and its effects on RMNCH health outcomes in 15 countries for which Demographic and Health Surveys data on phone ownership are available. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to explore factors associated with women's phone ownership, along with the association of phone ownership to a wide range of RMNCH indicators. Study findings suggest that (1) gender gaps in mobile phone ownership vary, but they can be substantial, with less than half of women owning mobile phones in several countries; (2) the gender gap in phone ownership is larger for rural and poorer women; (3) women's phone ownership is generally associated with better RMNCH indicators; (4) among women phone owners, utilisation of RMNCH care-seeking and practices differs based on their income status; and (5) more could be done to unleash the potential of mobile phones on women's health if data gaps and varied metrics are addressed. Findings reinforce the notion that without addressing the gender gap in phone ownership, digital health programmes may be at risk of worsening existing health inequities.

### Mobile phone interventions for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^117GtjHt]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Mobile health in the form of text messaging and mobile applications provides an innovative and effective approach to promote prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, the magnitude of these effects is unclear. Through a comprehensive search of databases from 2002–2016, we conducted a quantitative systematic review. The selected studies were critically evaluated to extract and summarize pertinent characteristics and outcomes. A large majority of studies (22 of 28, 79%) demonstrated text messaging, mobile applications, and telemonitoring via mobile phones were effective in improving outcomes. Some key factors associated with successful interventions included personalized messages with tailored advice, greater engagement (2-way text messaging, higher frequency of messages), and use of multiple modalities. Overall, text messaging appears more effective than smartphone-based interventions. Incorporating principles of behavioral activation will help promote and sustain healthy lifestyle behaviors in patients with CVD that result in improved clinical outcomes.

### A case-control study of risk of leukaemia in relation to mobile phone use [^116k52Kk]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

There are currently > 4.6 billion mobile phone subscriptions in use worldwide, and thus any potential health effects could be of great public health importance. Although no biological mechanism has been identified, there is considerable public and scientific interest in the possibility that RF exposure from phone use might affect cancer risk. Leukaemia risk is of interest because of the proximity of phone use to the skull and mandible, which contain 13% of the body's active bone marrow. We found no association between regular phone use and developing leukaemia, and no significant results relating to time since first use, total years of use or cumulative number of calls or hours of use, although there was a non-significantly 1.9-fold raised risk in people who had first used a mobile phone 15 or more years before the reference date.

The results from the few previous studies are largely consistent with ours. Two cohort studies based on subscription data, and hence without direct information on who used the phone, one in Denmark with 351 leukaemia cases and one in the United States with 15 deaths from leukaemia, found no raised risk in phone subscribers. A case–control study of 180 cases in Thailand, among participants with a low prevalence of phone use, found a slight non-significantly raised risk in people who had ever used a mobile phone. There are no previous data on risk after 15 years of use, but the Danish cohort, in which the longest subscription category was 10 or more years, found no substantially raised risk and no evidence of a trend. It seems unlikely that the raised risk in our study represents a true effect, as leukaemia is associated with particularly short induction periods for known carcinogens, for example ionising radiation and alkylating chemotherapy – whereas there was no evidence of a raised risk at shorter times since first use in our data or the Danish cohort.

### Mobile phone-based interventions for improving contraception use [^111LiCNA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Contraception provides significant benefits for women's and children's health, yet an estimated 225 million women had an unmet need for modern contraceptive methods in 2014. Interventions delivered by mobile phone have been demonstrated to be effective in other health areas, but their effects on use of contraception have not been established.

Objectives

To assess the effects of mobile phone-based interventions for improving contraception use.

Search Methods

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of client-provider interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve contraception use compared with standard care or another intervention. We searched the electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, PsycINFO, POPLINE, Africa-Wide Information and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) from January 1993 to October 2014, as well as clinical trials registries, online mHealth resources and abstracts from key conferences.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of mobile phone-based interventions to improve any form of contraception use amongst users or potential users of contraception. Outcome measures included uptake of contraception, measures of adherence, pregnancy and abortion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of studies retrieved using the search strategy and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Differences in interventions and outcome measures did not permit us to undertake meta-analysis.

Main Results

Five RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Three trials aimed to improve adherence to a specific method of contraception amongst existing or new contraception users by comparing automated text message interventions versus standard care. Two trials aimed to improve both uptake and adherence, not limited to one method, in both users and non-users of contraception. No trials were at low risk of bias in all areas assessed. One trial in the United States reported improved self reported oral contraceptive (OC) continuation at six months from an intervention comprising a range of uni-directional and interactive text messages (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.35). One trial in Cambodia reported increased self reported use of effective contraception at four months post abortion from an intervention comprising automated interactive voice messages and phone counsellor support (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.66). One feasibility trial in the United States reported a lower mean number of days between scheduled and completed attendance for the first but not subsequent Depo-Provera appointments using clinic records from an intervention comprising reminders and healthy self management text messages (mean difference (MD) -8.60 days, 95% CI -16.74 to -0.46). Simple text message OC reminders had no effect on missed pills as assessed by electronic medication monitoring in a small trial in the United States (MD 0.5 missed pills, 95% CI -1.08 to 2.08). No effect on self reported contraception use was noted amongst isotretinoin users from an intervention that provided health information via two uni-directional text messages and mail (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.89). One trial assessed potential adverse effects of the intervention and reported no evidence of road traffic accidents or domestic abuse.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review provides limited evidence that interventions delivered by mobile phone can improve contraception use. Whilst evidence suggests that a series of interactive voice messages and counsellor support can improve post-abortion contraception, and that a mixture of uni-directional and interactive daily educational text messages can improve OC adherence, the cost-effectiveness and long-term effects of these interventions remain unknown. Further high-quality trials are required to robustly establish the effects of interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve contraception use.

### Mobile phone interventions to improve health outcomes among patients with chronic diseases: an umbrella review and evidence synthesis from 34 meta-analyses [^113S5wUR]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

The following search terms were used: ("meta-analy") AND ("smartphone" OR "smart phone" OR "mobile phone" OR "cellular phone" OR "cell phone" OR "mobile app" OR "mobile device" OR "mobile-based" OR "mobile health" OR "mhealth" OR "m-health" OR "iphone" OR "android" OR "tablet"). Six databases were searched: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews. We searched databases from inception to June 13, 2022. Only studies reported in English were considered.

Studies were eligible for review if they conducted a meta-analysis, reported meta-analytical outcomes (ie, effect sizes) for mobile phone interventions, focused on populations with chronic diseases (eg, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and HIV or AIDS), reported effect sizes derived from k ≥ 4 RCTs, and included comparison conditions that could be categorised as usual care or other specific treatment (eg, usual care plus another behavioural health programme). Usual care conditions included standard usual care (eg, routine medical visits) or augmented usual care (eg, patients were provided a paper handout on medication adherence or received advice to stay active) without mobile phone intervention or another behavioural health programme. Effect sizes needed to be presented with their 95% CIs and to be based on RCTs that did not combine control condition types (eg, a mix of usual care and usual care plus other behavioural health programme conditions), since they address different scientific questions (ie, effects of mobile phone interventions vs standard clinical care or effects of mobile phone interventions vs another active intervention on top of usual care). If a meta-analysis included more than one condition (eg, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, diabetes, and hypertension), they needed to report effect sizes specific to one type of chronic condition to be included.

Three scientists with PhDs and expertise in conducting systematic reviews (SS, OS, and SBG) independently reviewed abstracts and full texts in duplicate. Disagreements were discussed until a consensus was reached. These authors also extracted the data.

### Mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation [^117YRUf7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Innovative effective smoking cessation interventions are required to appeal to those who are not accessing traditional cessation services. Mobile phones are widely used and are now well integrated into the daily lives of many, particularly young adults. Mobile phones are a potential medium for the delivery of health programmes such as smoking cessation.

Objectives

To determine whether mobile phone-based interventions are effective at helping people who smoke, to quit.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library, the National Research Register and the ClinicalTrials register, with no restrictions placed on language or publication date.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized trials. Participants were smokers of any age who wanted to quit. Studies were those examining any type of mobile phone-based intervention. This included any intervention aimed at mobile phone users, based around delivery via mobile phone, and using any functions or applications that can be used or sent via a mobile phone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on the specified quality criteria and methodological details was extracted using a standardised form. Participants who dropped out of the trials or were lost to follow up were considered to be smoking. Meta-analysis of the included studies was undertaken using the Mantel-Haenszel Risk Ratio fixed-effect method provided that there was no evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity as assessed by the I² statistic. Where meta-analysis was not possible, summary and descriptive statistics are presented.

Main Results

Four studies were excluded as they were small non-randomized feasibility studies, and two studies were excluded because follow up was less than six months. Four trials (reported in five papers) are included: a text message programme in New Zealand; a text message programme in the UK; and an Internet and mobile phone programme involving two different groups in Norway. The different types of interventions are analysed separately. When combined by meta-analysis the text message programme trials showed a significant increase in short-term self-reported quitting (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.65). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in long-term outcomes, with the much larger trial having problems with misclassification of outcomes; therefore these data were not combined. When the data from the Internet and mobile phone programmes were pooled we found statistically significant increases in both short and long-term self-reported quitting (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.94).

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence shows no effect of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions on long-term outcome. While short-term results are positive, more rigorous studies of the long-term effects of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions are needed.

### Mobile phone interventions to improve health outcomes among patients with chronic diseases: an umbrella review and evidence synthesis from 34 meta-analyses [^116VjoXR]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

As mobile phone interventions become increasingly used in routine medical care, evaluating safety is essential. A review of safety concerns with consumer-facing health apps also suggests the need for rigorous and standardised reporting of adverse events. However, only two meta-analyses in our review evaluated adverse events, and both focused on diabetes. Compared with usual care, neither meta-analysis found increased risk for adverse events with mobile phone interventions, and Yang and colleagues provided a narrative summary showing that there was a lower incidence of medical complications for patients in mobile app interventions, indicating the potential of mobile phone interventions in preventing some negative outcomes. However, the scarcity of data on adverse events makes it challenging to assess the clinical risks and benefits of mobile phone interventions.

There are several limitations to the current review and gaps in the meta-analytical and RCT literature (panel 2). First, as an umbrella review, our evaluation of evidence is limited by the available meta-analyses. Although we evaluated 34 meta-analyses, there is an uneven maturity in evidence across chronic diseases. For instance, results for several conditions that had few participants included in the primary RCTs (eg, osteoporosis and coronary heart disease) were graded as weak. The effects of interventions should be further evaluated when larger clinical trials and updated meta-analyses are available. Second, to avoid combining comparison conditions, we excluded effect sizes that mixed control types (ie, combining active and inactive control condition types). Future meta-analyses should carefully review and categorise comparison conditions to support a clear understanding of the efficacy of mobile phone interventions in the context of specific comparisons. Third, the scarce testing for publication bias could have caused an underestimation of evidence certainty for some effects. Although it is suggested that publication bias should be routinely done in meta-analyses, issues such as small sample size and substantial heterogeneity can negatively affect the power to detect publication bias. Fourth, we used the Fusar-Poli and Raduamethod for this umbrella review, which does not consider risk of bias and "optimal size information criterion" when evaluating the strength of evidence from meta-analyses. We could not convert mean differences to standardised mean differences in instances in which SDs were not reported. Although mean differences might have more clinical relevance (eg, percentage change in HbA₁c), the reporting of only mean differences introduces challenges in interpreting the magnitude of effects. Fifth, the search strategy could have been more exhaustive. For instance, we did not use Medical Subject Headings terms. In addition, as we used "meta-analy" as one of the terms to identify studies, reviews that conducted meta-analyses but did not report this term in the title or abstract could have been missed. Only meta-analyses available in English were included, which might have not captured the full literature. Sixth, few meta-analyses tested moderators. Future meta-analyses will ideally examine various aspects of the sample and intervention characteristics, including the use of theory in intervention development as moderators. Relatedly, as mobile phone interventions can involve multiple components (eg, in-person counselling, phone calls, and supplemental materials), it is possible that these features affect results yet were not captured in moderator tests. In addition, little reporting on adverse events limits understanding of the safety of mobile phone interventions. Various gaps also exist on the primary RCT level, including (as noted previously) little evidence in LMICs and the global south, research focused on youth, and other prevalent chronic diseases (eg, cancer, stroke, or chronic kidney disease). There is also a scarcity of knowledge on the sustainability of mobile phone interventions' effects, which warrants RCTs assessing outcomes in long-term follow-ups (eg, 1 year or longer).

### A case-control study of risk of leukaemia in relation to mobile phone use [^111vcZhr]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Mobile phone use is now ubiquitous, and scientific reviews have recommended research into its relation to leukaemia risk, but no large studies have been conducted.

Methods

In a case-control study in South East England to investigate the relation of acute and non-lymphocytic leukaemia risk to mobile phone use, 806 cases with leukaemia incident 2003–2009 at ages 18–59 years (50% of those identified as eligible) and 585 non-blood relatives as controls (provided by 392 cases) were interviewed about mobile phone use and other potentially aetiological variables.

Results

No association was found between regular mobile phone use and risk of leukaemia (odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.76, 1.46). Analyses of risk in relation to years since first use, lifetime years of use, cumulative number of calls and cumulative hours of use produced no significantly raised risks, and there was no evidence of any trends. A non-significantly raised risk was found in people who first used a phone 15 or more years ago (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 0.96, 3.63). Separate analyses of analogue and digital phone use and leukaemia subtype produced similar results to those overall.

Conclusion

This study suggests that use of mobile phones does not increase leukaemia risk, although the possibility of an effect after long-term use, while biologically unlikely, remains open.

### Mobile phone use and risk of tumors: a meta-analysis [^113H1dWe]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

Case-control studies have reported inconsistent findings regarding the association between mobile phone use and tumor risk. We investigated these associations using a meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library in August 2008. Two evaluators independently reviewed and selected articles based on predetermined selection criteria.

Results

Of 465 articles meeting our initial criteria, 23 case-control studies, which involved 37,916 participants (12,344 patient cases and 25,572 controls), were included in the final analyses. Compared with never or rarely having used a mobile phone, the odds ratio for overall use was 0.98 for malignant and benign tumors (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.07) in a random-effects meta-analysis of all 23 studies. However, a significant positive association (harmful effect) was observed in a random-effects meta-analysis of eight studies using blinding, whereas a significant negative association (protective effect) was observed in a fixed-effects meta-analysis of 15 studies not using blinding. Mobile phone use of 10 years or longer was associated with a risk of tumors in 13 studies reporting this association (odds ratio = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.34). Further, these findings were also observed in the subgroup analyses by methodologic quality of study. Blinding and methodologic quality of study were strongly associated with the research group.

Conclusion

The current study found that there is possible evidence linking mobile phone use to an increased risk of tumors from a meta-analysis of low-biased case-control studies. Prospective cohort studies providing a higher level of evidence are needed.

### WHO digital health guidelines: a milestone for global health [^115RQdj1]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the first-ever evidence-based guidelines for digital health. The guideline provides nine recommendations on select digital health interventions that involve the use of a mobile phone or device. It also provides information on implementation considerations, quality and certainty of extant evidence, factors related to acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, and gaps in the evidence that can inform future research. Given the pivotal role digital health can play in supporting health systems, seen especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, these guidelines can help provide a roadmap for governments and policymakers in introducing and scaling up digital health interventions to support population health outcomes.

### How dangerous are mobile phones, transmission masts, and electricity pylons? [^1175jmyq]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2006). Low credibility.

Electrical power and mobile communications deliver enormous benefit to society, but there are concerns whether the electric and magnetic field (EMF) emissions associated with the delivery of this benefit are linked to cancer or other health hazards. This article reviews the strength of the available epidemiological and laboratory evidence and notes that this falls short of what is normally required to establish a causal link. However, because of scientific uncertainty a cautious approach is often advocated, but here, too, there may be a tendency to judge these risks more harshly than those in other areas with similar strength of evidence.

### Does women's mobile phone ownership matter for health? Evidence from 15 countries [^112aLd8u]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Despite increasing mobile phone ownership, inequalities persist by gender, geographical areas and sociodemographic characteristics. Study findings suggest that phone ownership among women may be associated with increased uptake of some RMNCH interventions, with a few notable exceptions. Women phone owners in the higher income strata were more likely to have 4+ ANC, skilled birth attendance and postnatal care for newborns (interventions that require significant healthcare seeking). In contrast, women mobile phone owners in the lowest income strata are less likely to have their demand for family planning satisfied, receive immunisations for tetanus and DTP3, and vitamin A supplementation (interventions that are proactively supplied by health services, often at the community level). Further research and improvements in digital health metrics and data collection is needed to improve understanding of and devise strategies for addressing gaps in women's ownership and use of mobile phones so that it effectively leads to improved utilisation of different RMNCH interventions. The failure to do so could result in a worsening of health inequities among women and their families, as mobile phone penetration improves and health systems increasingly use mobile and other digital tools to improve health information and quality of care for those who can most easily access them versus those who need them the most.

### Mobile phone messaging for facilitating self-management of long-term illnesses [^116UjDMc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term illnesses affect a significant proportion of the population in developed and developing countries. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), may present convenient, cost-effective ways of supporting self-management and improving patients' self-efficacy skills through, for instance, medication reminders, therapy adjustments or supportive messages.

Objectives

To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging applications designed to facilitate self-management of long-term illnesses, in terms of impact on health outcomes and patients' capacity to self-manage their condition. Secondary objectives include assessment of: user evaluation of the intervention; health service utilisation and costs; and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We selected only studies where it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third. Primary outcomes of interest were health outcomes as a result of the intervention and capacity to self-manage long-term conditions. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, health service utilisation and costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. The included studies were heterogeneous in type of condition addressed, intervention characteristics and outcome measures. Therefore, a meta-analysis to derive an overall effect size for the main outcome categories was not considered justified and findings are presented narratively.

Main Results

We included four randomised controlled trials involving 182 participants. For the primary outcome of health outcomes, including physiological measures, there is moderate quality evidence from two studies involving people with diabetes showing no statistical difference from text messaging interventions compared with usual care or email reminders for glycaemic control (HbA1c), the frequency of diabetic complications, or body weight. There is moderate quality evidence from one study of hypertensive patients that the mean blood pressure and the proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure control were not significantly different in the intervention and control groups, and that there was no statistically significant difference in mean body weight between the groups. There is moderate quality evidence from one study that asthma patients receiving a text messaging intervention experienced greater improvements on peak expiratory flow variability (mean difference (MD) -11.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -19.56 to -2.68) and the pooled symptom score comprising four items (cough, night symptoms, sleep quality, and maximum tolerated activity) (MD -0.36, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.17) compared with the control group. However, the study found no significant differences between the groups in impact on forced vital capacity or forced expiratory flow in 1 second. For the primary outcome of capacity to self-manage the condition, there is moderate quality evidence from one study that diabetes patients receiving the text messaging intervention demonstrated improved scores on measures of self-management capacity (Self-Efficacy for Diabetes score (MD 6.10, 95% CI 0.45 to 11.75), Diabetes Social Support Interview pooled score (MD 4.39, 95% CI 2.85 to 5.92)), but did not show improved knowledge of diabetes. There is moderate quality evidence from three studies of the effects on treatment compliance. One study showed an increase in hypertensive patients' rates of medication compliance in the intervention group (MD 8.90, 95% CI 0.18 to 17.62) compared with the control group, but in another study there was no statistically significant effect on rates of compliance with peak expiratory flow measurement in asthma patients. Text message prompts for diabetic patients initially also resulted in a higher number of blood glucose results sent back (46.0) than email prompts did (23.5). For the secondary outcome of participants' evaluation of the intervention, there is very low quality evidence from two studies that patients receiving mobile phone messaging support reported perceived improvement in diabetes self-management, wanted to continue receiving messages, and preferred mobile phone messaging to email as a method to access a computerised reminder system. For the secondary outcome of health service utilisation, there is very low quality evidence from two studies. Diabetes patients receiving text messaging support made a comparable number of clinic visits and calls to an emergency hotline as patients without the support. For asthma patients the total number of office visits was higher in the text messaging group, whereas the number of hospital admissions was higher for the control group. Because of the small number of trials included, and the low overall number of participants, for any of the reviewed outcomes the quality of the evidence can at best be considered moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

We found some, albeit very limited, indications that in certain cases mobile phone messaging interventions may provide benefit in supporting the self-management of long-term illnesses. However, there are significant information gaps regarding the long-term effects, acceptability, costs, and risks of such interventions. Given the enthusiasm with which so-called mHealth interventions are currently being implemented, further research into these issues is needed.

### Improving type 1 diabetes management with mobile tools: a systematic review [^111iVC6b]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2014). Low credibility.

This study aims to provide a better understanding of the ability of mobile health tools to offer glycemic control for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Data gained from research articles searched in PubMed, Ovid (Medline), and CINAHL from 2005 to 2013 focused on interventions introduced to a type 1 diabetic population. Articles were screened to identify interventions that examined mobile health tools effect on glycemic control using %A1C as a proxy. Fourteen articles were included in this study. Descriptive data, %A1C difference, and statistical significance, if available, were extracted for comparison. Five major categories were identified across the spectrum of interventions, including "Internet", "Mobile", "Mobile and Internet", "Phone", and "Videoconference and phone". Seven of the 14 articles reported statistically significant decreases in measured outcomes. Seven studies examine a single cohort, and 7 examined a double cohort. Eleven of the 14 authors (79%) reported success with their intervention. Twelve studies reported a decrease in %A1C values in their intervention groups. Initial results for glycemic control through these tools appear promising, though inconclusive. Additional measures of mobile health tool efficacy should be assessed more directly. More rigorous study methods are also needed to improve the reliability of results.

### Mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical investigations [^113F5Wwk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mobile phone messaging, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), has rapidly grown into a mode of communication with a wide range of applications, including communicating the results from medical investigations to patients. Alternative modes of communication of results include face-to-face communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, through web-based health records and email. Possible advantages of mobile phone messaging include convenience to both patients and healthcare providers, reduced waiting times for health services and healthcare costs.

Objectives

To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical investigations, on people's healthcare-seeking behaviour and health outcomes. Secondary objectives include assessment of participants' evaluation of the intervention, direct and indirect healthcare costs and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention.

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We included studies assessing mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical tests, between a healthcare provider or 'treatment buddy' and patient. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third. Primary outcomes of interest were health outcomes and healthcare utilisation as a result of the intervention. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, costs and potential harms or adverse effects of the intervention.

Main Results

We included one randomised controlled trial involving 2782 participants. The study investigated the effects of mobile phone messaging in alleviating anxiety in women waiting for prenatal biochemical screening results for Down syndrome, by providing fast reporting of results before a follow-up appointment. The study measured health outcomes using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which includes a scale (20 to 80 points, higher score indicates higher anxiety) to describe how the respondent feels at a particular moment in time (state anxiety). The study, which was at high risk of bias, found that women who had received their test result early by text message had a mean anxiety score 2.48 points lower than women who had not yet received their result (95% CI - 8.79 to 3.84). Women with a serum-negative test result receiving their result early had a mean anxiety score 5.3 points lower (95% CI - 5.99 to -4.61) than women in the control group. Women with a serum-positive test result receiving their result early by text message had a mean anxiety score 1.2 points higher (95% CI - 3.48 to 5.88) than women in the control group. The evidence was of low quality due to high risk of bias in the included study, and the fact that the evidence comes from one study only. The study did not report on other outcomes of interest, such as patient satisfaction, adverse events or cost.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very limited evidence of low quality that communicating results of medical investigations by mobile phone messaging may make little or no difference to women's anxiety overall or in women with positive test results, but may reduce anxiety in women with negative test results. However, with only one study included in this review, this evidence is insufficient to inform recommendations at this time. More research is needed on the effectiveness and user evaluation of these interventions. In particular, more research should be conducted into the potential risks and limitations of these interventions.

### Mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation [^114KkcqN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Innovative and effective smoking cessation interventions are required to appeal to those who are not accessing traditional cessation services. Mobile phones are widely used and are now well-integrated into the daily lives of many, particularly young adults. Mobile phones are a potential medium for the delivery of health programmes such as smoking cessation.

Objectives

To determine whether mobile phone-based interventions are effective at helping people who smoke, to quit.

Search Methods

For the most recent update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in May 2012. We also searched UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio for current projects in the UK and the ClinicalTrials register for on-going or recently completed studies. We searched through the reference lists of identified studies and attempted to contact the authors of ongoing studies, with no restrictions placed on language or publication date.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized trials. Participants were smokers of any age who wanted to quit. Studies were those examining any type of mobile phone-based intervention. This included any intervention aimed at mobile phone users, based around delivery via mobile phone, and using any functions or applications that can be used or sent via a mobile phone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on risk of bias and methodological details was extracted using a standardised form. Participants who dropped out of the trials or were lost to follow-up were considered to be smoking. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for each included study. Meta-analysis of the included studies was undertaken using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Where meta-analysis was not possible, summary and descriptive statistics are presented.

Main Results

Five studies with at least six month cessation outcomes were included in this review. Three studies involve a purely text messaging intervention that has been adapted over the course of these three studies for different populations and contexts. One study is a multi-arm study of a text messaging intervention and an internet QuitCoach separately and in combination. The final study involves a video messaging intervention delivered via the mobile phone. When all five studies were pooled, mobile phone interventions were shown to increase the long term quit rates compared with control programmes (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.99, over 9000 participants), using a definition of abstinence of no smoking at six months since quit day but allowing up to three lapses or up to five cigarettes. Statistical heterogeneity was substantial as indicated by the I² statistic (I² = 79%), but as all included studies were similar in design, intervention and primary outcome measure, we have presented the meta-analysis in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence shows a benefit of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions on long-term outcomes, though results were heterogenous with findings from three of five included studies crossing the line of no effect. The studies included were predominantly of text messaging interventions. More research is required into other forms of mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation, other contexts such as low income countries, and cost-effectiveness.

### Epidemiological evidence on health risks of cellular telephones [^114amG2C]. Lancet (2000). Excellent credibility.

It is too soon for a verdict on the health risks from cellular telephones, especially in view of changing technology. From the Interphone project and some other large studies in progress, better information may emerge. Based on the epidemiological evidence available now, the main public-health concern is clearly motor vehicle collisions, a behavioural effect rather than an effect of radiofrequency exposure as such. Neither the several studies of occupational exposure to radiofrequencies nor the few of cellular telephone users offer any clear evidence of an association with brain tumours or other malignancies. Even if the studies in progress were to find large relative effects for brain cancer, the absolute increase in risk would probably be much smaller than the risk stemming from motor vehicle collisions. Cellular telephones affect the quality of our lives in myriad ways, for good and ill; the health risk is just one part of a picture that is slowly coming into focus.

### Mobile phone interventions to improve health outcomes among patients with chronic diseases: an umbrella review and evidence synthesis from 34 meta-analyses [^117EK3C2]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

The 235 primary studies represented in the 34 meta-analyses had a mean sample size of 209.22 participants (SD 339.03). The appendix (pp 27–37) has the primary studies, their full citation, the location (ie, country) of the RCT, and a matrix on their appearance in each meta-analysis. A primary study appeared across all included meta-analyses a mean of 1.57 times (SD = 1.29; median = 1, range 1–10). These primary studies were published between 2004 and 2021, with 2016 being the median year. The appendix (p 2) presents the regions and country income of primary RCTs. RCTs were based in Asia (n = 120, 51%), Europe (n = 42, 18%), North America (n = 38, 16%), Africa (n = 21, 9%), Oceania (n = 12, 5%), and South America (n = 5, 2%). The figure presents the country locations of the RCTs. The 235 RCTs reported 243 locations (some RCTs involved more than one country), with most evidence coming from China (n = 87 studies, 36%) and the United States (n = 34 studies, 14%). A total of 240 country income levels for 235 RCTs were documented (some studies involved countries with varied income levels). More than 82% of the trials occurred in high-income (n = 95, 40%) and upper-middle-income countries (n = 100, 42%), with only 37 (15%) taking place in lower-middle-income countries and eight (3%) in low-income countries. Interventions lasted a median 6 months (range 0.5–24 months).

### Mobile health (M-health) smartphone interventions for adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity [^114WP6dD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is considered to be a risk factor for various diseases, and its incidence has tripled worldwide since 1975. In addition to potentially being at risk for adverse health outcomes, people with overweight or obesity are often stigmatised. Behaviour change interventions are increasingly delivered as mobile health (m-health) interventions, using smartphone apps and wearables. They are believed to support healthy behaviours at the individual level in a low-threshold manner.

Objectives

To assess the effects of integrated smartphone applications for adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS, as well as the trials registers ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 2 October 2023 (date of last search for all databases). We placed no restrictions on the language of publication.

Selection Criteria

Participants were adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity. Eligible interventions were integrated smartphone apps using at least two behaviour change techniques. The intervention could target physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, weight loss, healthy diet, or self-efficacy. Comparators included no or minimal intervention (NMI), a different smartphone app, personal coaching, or usual care. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of any duration with a follow-up of at least three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology and the RoB 2 tool. Important outcomes were physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and weight, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, well-being, change in dietary behaviour, and adverse events. We focused on presenting studies with medium- (6 to < 12 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) outcomes in our summary of findings table, following recommendations in the core outcome set for behavioural weight management interventions.

Main Results

We included 18 studies with 2703 participants. Interventions lasted from 2 to 24 months. The mean BMI in adults ranged from 27 to 50, and the median BMI z-score in adolescents ranged from 2.2 to 2.5. Smartphone app versus no or minimal intervention Thirteen studies compared a smartphone app versus NMI in adults; no studies were available for adolescents. The comparator comprised minimal health advice, handouts, food diaries, smartphone apps unrelated to weight loss, and waiting list. Measures of physical activity: at 12 months' follow-up, a smartphone app compared to NMI probably reduces moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) slightly (mean difference (MD) -28.9 min/week (95% confidence interval (CI) -85.9 to 28; 1 study, 650 participants; moderate-certainty evidence)). We are very uncertain about the results of estimated energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory fitness at eight months' follow-up. A smartphone app compared with NMI probably results in little to no difference in changes in total activity time at 12 months' follow-up and leisure time physical activity at 24 months' follow-up. Anthropometric measures: a smartphone app compared with NMI may reduce BMI (MD of BMI change -2.6 kg/m 2, 95% CI -6 to 0.8; 2 studies, 146 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at six to eight months' follow-up, but the evidence is very uncertain. At 12 months' follow-up, a smartphone app probably resulted in little to no difference in BMI change (MD -0.1 kg/m², 95% CI -0.4 to 0.3; 1 study; 650 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A smartphone app compared with NMI may result in little to no difference in body weight change (MD -2.5 kg, 95% CI -6.8 to 1.7; 3 studies, 1044 participants; low-certainty evidence) at 12 months' follow-up. At 24 months' follow-up, a smartphone app probably resulted in little to no difference in body weight change (MD 0.7 kg, 95% CI -1.2 to 2.6; 1 study, 245 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A smartphone app compared with NMI may result in little to no difference in self-efficacy for a physical activity score at eight months' follow-up, but the results are very uncertain. A smartphone app probably results in little to no difference in quality of life and well-being at 12 months (moderate-certainty evidence) and in little to no difference in various measures used to inform dietary behaviour at 12 and 24 months' follow-up. We are very uncertain about adverse events, which were only reported narratively in two studies (very low-certainty evidence). Smartphone app versus another smartphone app Two studies compared different versions of the same app in adults, showing no or minimal differences in outcomes. One study in adults compared two different apps (calorie counting versus ketogenic diet) and suggested a slight reduction in body weight at six months in favour of the ketogenic diet app. No studies were available for adolescents. Smartphone app versus personal coaching Only one study compared a smartphone app with personal coaching in adults, presenting data at three months. Two studies compared these interventions in adolescents. A smartphone app resulted in little to no difference in BMI z-score compared to personal coaching at six months' follow-up (MD 0, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.2; 1 study; 107 participants). Smartphone app versus usual care Only one study compared an app with usual care in adults but only reported data at three months on participant satisfaction. No studies were available for adolescents. We identified 34 ongoing studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The available evidence is limited and does not demonstrate a clear benefit of smartphone applications as interventions for adolescents or adults with overweight or obesity. While the number of studies is growing, the evidence remains incomplete due to the high variability of the apps' features, content and components, which complicates direct comparisons and assessment of their effectiveness. Comparisons with either no or minimal intervention or personal coaching show minor effects, which are mostly not clinically significant. Minimal data for adolescents also warrants further research. Evidence is also scarce for low- and middle-income countries as well as for people with different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. The 34 ongoing studies suggest sustained interest in the topic, with new evidence expected to emerge within the next two years. In practice, clinicians and healthcare practitioners should carefully consider the potential benefits, limitations, and evolving research when recommending smartphone apps to adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity.

### Mobile phone text-messaging interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (text2PreventCVD): systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^112SY1qo]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The primary limitation of this meta-analysis was the differences in participants' characteristics, risk factor measurements and primary outcomes of interest across studies. A potential limitation is the small number of trials and a highly significant study included in the meta-analysis, potential publication bias and influence of heterogeneity is possible. Of the nine trials included in the standard meta-analysis, we were only able to obtain full datasets from five trials. Also, we calculated the effect estimate from available data from published studies, and it is thus possible that bias can be introduced from differential loss to follow-up. Therefore, the results of this IPD meta-analysis cannot be generalised across different populations and should be interpreted with caution. Finally, the meta-analysis is not a mechanistic study; thus, we cannot determine whether the benefit associated with the use of text messaging was attributable to BP lowering or to other mechanisms.

The primary strength of this meta-analysis was its systematic search to identify potential studies and the inclusion of only RCTs, which are less subject to bias and confounding than observational studies. The IPD analysis approach used in this study has advantages over a meta-analysis because the outcomes can be matched between studies and all studies are then analysed in the same prespecified statistical model. The use of data from many studies with different inclusion criteria should make the findings more generalisable, and the robustness of the main conclusions to subsidiary methods of analysis further supports the conclusion drawn.

Future research

There are still a number of unanswered questions that we were unable to adequately address, for example, whether different characteristics of the texting interventions influenced outcomes (ie, number of behaviour change techniques used, unidirectional vs bidirectional, high vs low frequency, personalised vs non-personalised). How can effects be maintained into the longer term and how are interventions best scaled up to populations? Future studies should address these questions, as well as the potential of these interventions in varied socioeconomic groups, age groups and cultures. Variations in effectiveness of behavioural interventions have been shown by gender.

In addition, substantial variability exists with regard to the definitions of outcome measures for the different cardiovascular risk factors across studies. A standardised method for measuring the different outcomes in CVD prevention is warranted to improve comparability of outcome measures across studies for a more rigorous and reliable evaluation of the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for CVD.

### Mobile health as a viable strategy to enhance stroke risk factor control: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1136EdKb]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Background

With the rapid growth worldwide in cell-phone use, Internet connectivity, and digital health technology, mobile health (mHealth) technology may offer a promising approach to bridge evidence-treatment gaps in stroke prevention. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mHealth for stroke risk factor control through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched PubMed from January 1, 2000 to May 17, 2016 using the following keywords: mobile health, mHealth, short message, cellular phone, mobile phone, stroke prevention and control, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking cessation. We performed a meta-analysis of all eligible randomized control clinical trials that assessed a sustained (at least 6months) effect of mHealth.

Results

Of 78 articles identified, 13 met eligibility criteria (6 for glycemic control and 7 for smoking cessation) and were included for the final meta-analysis. There were no eligible studies for dyslipidemia or hypertension. mHealth resulted in greater Hemoglobin A1c reduction at 6months (6 studies; 663 subjects; SMD: -0.44; 95% CI: [-0.82, -0.06], P = 0.02; Mean difference of decrease in HbA1c: -0.39%; 95% CI: [-0.74, -0.04], P = 0.03). mHealth also lead to relatively higher smoking abstinence rates at 6months (7 studies; 9514 subjects; OR: 1.54; 95% CI: [1.24, 1.90], P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis supports that use of mHealth improves glycemic control and smoking abstinence rates.

### Radiofrequency radiation and gene / protein expression: a review [^116atXfo]. Radiation Research (2009). Low credibility.

Mobile telecommunications have developed considerably in recent years. With the proliferation of wireless technologies, there is much public anxiety about the potential health impact associated with exposure to radiofrequency (RF) radiation from these novel products. Contradictory scientific evidence, often reported in the popular media, has further fueled public concern. Some epidemiological studies have reported that ipsilateral use of a mobile phone is associated with an increased risk for brain tumors, while other studies have reported an association between brain tumor risk and mobile phone use for longer than 10 years. However, other large epidemiological studies have failed to find similar associations. Despite the existence of national and international RF-radiation exposure guidelines, there are increasing public demands for precaution with respect to human exposure to RF radiation. Since current epidemiological evidence is insufficient to make a definitive judgment on the health risks of low-level RF radiation exposure, laboratory evidence assessing biological plausibility and theoretical mechanisms of interaction are important. A number of studies have reported that RF radiation may induce alterations in gene/protein expression in a variety of cells/tissues that may be associated with potentially harmful health outcomes, while other studies have shown no clear effects related to RF radiation. This review focuses on the current scientific evidence related to changes in protein and gene expression induced by low-level RF radiation.

### Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments [^116df98R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of the original Cochrane review published in July 2012. Missed appointments are a major cause of inefficiency in healthcare delivery with substantial monetary costs for the health system, leading to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients' forgetfulness is one of the main reasons for missed appointments. Patient reminders may help reduce missed appointments. Modes of communicating reminders for appointments to patients include face-to-face communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, and mobile phone messaging. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), could provide an important, inexpensive delivery medium for reminders for healthcare appointments.

Objectives

To update our review assessing the effects of mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments. Secondary objectives include assessment of costs; health outcomes; patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation of the intervention and perceptions of safety; and possible harms and adverse effects associated with the intervention.

Search Methods

Original searches were run in June 2009. For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012) and CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to August 2012). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing mobile phone messaging as reminders for healthcare appointments. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third author. Two authors assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. As the intervention characteristics and outcome measures were similar across included studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate an overall effect size.

Main Results

We included eight randomised controlled trials involving 6615 participants. Four of these studies were newly identified during this update. We found moderate quality evidence from seven studies (5841 participants) that mobile text message reminders improved the rate of attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders (risk ratio (RR) 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.26)). There was also moderate quality evidence from three studies (2509 participants) that mobile text message reminders had a similar impact to phone call reminders (RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.02). Low quality evidence from one study (291 participants) suggests that mobile text message reminders combined with postal reminders improved the rate of attendance at healthcare appointments compared to postal reminders alone (RR 1.10 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.19)). Overall, the attendance to appointment rates were 67.8% for the no reminders group, 78.6% for the mobile phone messaging reminders group and 80.3% for the phone call reminders group. One study reported generally that there were no adverse effects during the study period; none of the studies reported in detail on specific adverse events such as loss of privacy, data misinterpretation, or message delivery failure. Two studies reported that the costs per text message per attendance were respectively 55% and 65% lower than costs per phone call reminder. The studies included in the review did not report on health outcomes or people's perceptions of safety related to receiving reminders by text message.

Authors' Conclusions

Low to moderate quality evidence included in this review shows that mobile phone text messaging reminders increase attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders, or postal reminders. Text messaging reminders were similar to telephone reminders in terms of their effect on attendance rates, and cost less than telephone reminders. However, the included studies were heterogeneous and the quality of the evidence therein is low to moderate. Further, there is a lack of information about health effects, adverse effects and harms, user evaluation of the intervention and user perceptions of its safety. The current evidence therefore still remains insufficient to conclusively inform policy decisions. There is a need for more high-quality randomised trials of mobile phone messaging reminders, that measure not only patients' attendance rates, but also focus on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Health outcomes, patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation and perceptions of the safety of the interventions, potential harms, and adverse effects of mobile phone messaging reminders should be assessed. Studies should report message content and timing in relation to the appointment.

### Mobile phone text-messaging interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (text2PreventCVD): systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^114hGGRS]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A variety of small mobile phone text-messaging interventions have indicated improvement in risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet the extent of this improvement and whether it impacts multiple risk factors together is uncertain. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis to investigate the effects of text-messaging interventions for CVD prevention.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched to identify trials investigating a text-messaging intervention focusing on CVD prevention with the potential to modify at least two CVD risk factors in adults. The main outcome was blood pressure (BP). We conducted standard and IPD meta-analysis on pooled data. We accounted for clustering of patients within studies and the primary analysis used random-effects models. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed.

Results

Nine trials were included in the systematic review involving 3779 participants and 5 (n = 2612) contributed data to the IPD meta-analysis. Standard meta-analysis showed that the weighted mean differences are as follows: systolic blood pressure (SBP), −4.13 mm Hg (95% CI −11.07 to 2.81, p < 0.0001); diastolic blood pressure (DBP), −1.11 mm Hg (−1.91 to −0.31, p = 0.002); and body mass index (BMI), −0.32 (−0.49 to −0.16, p = 0.000). In the IPD meta-analysis, the mean difference are as follows: SBP, −1.3 mm Hg (−5.4 to 2.7, p = 0.5236); DBP, −0.8 mm Hg (−2.5 to 1.0, p = 0.3912); and BMI, −0.2 (−0.8 to 0.4, p = 0.5200) in the random-effects model. The impact on other risk factors is described, but there were insufficient data to conduct meta-analyses.

Conclusion

Mobile phone text-messaging interventions have modest impacts on BP and BMI. Simultaneous but small impacts on multiple risk factors are likely to be clinically relevant and improve outcome, but there are currently insufficient data in pooled analyses to examine the extent to which simultaneous reduction in multiple risk factors occurs.

### Telephone delivered interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality in people with HIV infection [^115ToLDL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is one of three Cochrane reviews examining the role of the telephone in HIV/AIDS services. Telephone interventions, delivered either by landline or mobile phone, may be useful in the management of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in many situations. Telephone delivered interventions have the potential to reduce costs, save time and facilitate more support for PLHIV.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of voice landline and mobile telephone delivered interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality in people with HIV infection.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed Central, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health, World Health Organisation's The Global Health Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We searched the following grey literature sources: Dissertation Abstracts International, Centre for Agriculture Bioscience International Direct Global Health database, The System for Information on Grey Literature Europe, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium database, Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Society, AIDS Educational Global Information System and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series studies comparing the effectiveness of telephone delivered interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality in persons with HIV infection versus in-person interventions or usual care, regardless of demographic characteristics and in all settings. Both mobile and landline telephone interventions were included, but mobile phone messaging interventions were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently searched, screened, assessed study quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes were change in behaviour, healthcare uptake or clinical outcomes. Secondary outcomes were appropriateness of the mode of communication, and whether underlying factors for change were altered. Meta-analyses, each of three studies, were performed for medication adherence and depressive symptoms. A narrative synthesis is presented for all other outcomes due to study heterogeneity.

Main Results

Out of 14 717 citations, 11 RCTs met the inclusion criteria (1381 participants). Six studies addressed outcomes relating to medication adherence, and there was some evidence from two studies that telephone interventions can improve adherence. A meta-analysis of three studies for which there was sufficient data showed no significant benefit (SMD 0.49, 95% CI -1.12 to 2.11). There was some evidence from a study of young substance abusing HIV positive persons of the efficacy of telephone interventions for reducing risky sexual behaviour, while a trial of older persons found no benefit. Three RCTs addressed virologic outcomes, and there is very little evidence that telephone interventions improved virologic outcomes. Five RCTs addressed outcomes relating to depressive and psychiatric symptoms, and showed some evidence that telephone interventions can be of benefit. Three of these studies which focussed on depressive symptoms were combined in a meta-analysis, which showed no significant benefit (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.21 95% CI).

Authors' Conclusions

Telephone voice interventions may have a role in improving medication adherence, reducing risky sexual behaviour, and reducing depressive and psychiatric symptoms, but current evidence is sparse, and further research is needed.

### Mobile phone text messaging to improve medication adherence in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112Lz5fH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide at least 100 million people are thought to have prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVD. Secondary CVD prevention is defined as action aimed to reduce the probability of recurrence of such events. Drug interventions have been shown to be cost-effective in reducing this risk and are recommended in international guidelines. However, adherence to recommended treatments remains sub-optimal. In order to influence non-adherence, there is a need to develop scalable and cost-effective behaviour-change interventions.

Objectives

To assess the effects of mobile phone text messaging in patients with established arterial occlusive events on adherence to treatment, fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science on Web of Science on 7 November 2016, and two clinical trial registers on 12 November 2016. We contacted authors of included studies for missing information and searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials with at least 50% of the participants with established arterial occlusive events. We included trials investigating interventions using short message service (SMS) or multimedia messaging service (MMS) with the aim to improve adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Eligible comparators were no intervention or other modes of communication.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In addition, we attempted to contact all authors on how the SMS were developed.

Main Results

We included seven trials (reported in 13 reports) with 1310 participants randomised. Follow-up ranged from one month to 12 months. Due to heterogeneity in the methods, population and outcome measures, we were unable to conduct meta-analysis on these studies. All seven studies reported on adherence, but using different methods and scales. Six out of seven trials showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence. Dale 2015a, reported significantly greater medication adherence score in the intervention group (Mean Difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.97; 123 participants randomised) at six months. Khonsari 2015 reported less adherence in the control group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18; 62 participants randomised) at eight weeks. Pandey 2014 (34 participants randomised) assessed medication adherence through self-reported logs with 90% adherence in the intervention group compared to 70% in the control group at 12 months. Park 2014a (90 participants randomised) reported a greater increase of the medication adherence score in the control group, but also measured adherence with an event monitoring system for a number of medications with adherence levels ranging from 84.1% adherence to 86.2% in the intervention group and 79.7% to 85.7% in the control group at 30 days. Quilici 2013, reported reduced odds of non-adherence in the intervention group (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.86, 521 participants randomised) at 30 days. Fang 2016, reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non-adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.40 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 280 patients randomised). Kamal 2015 reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85; 200 participants randomised). Khonsari 2015 was the only study to report fatal cardiovascular events and only reported two events, both in the control arm. No study reported on the other primary outcomes. No study reported repetitive thumb injury or road traffic crashes or other adverse events that were related to the intervention. Four authors replied to our questionnaire on SMS development. No study reported examining causes of non-adherence or provided SMS tailored to individual patient characteristics. The included studies were small, heterogeneous and included participants recruited directly after acute events. All studies were assessed as having high risk of bias across at least one domain. Most of the studies came from high-income countries, with two studies conducted in an upper middle-income country (China, Malaysia), and one study from a lower middle-income country (Pakistan). The quality of the evidence was found to be very low. There was no obvious conflicts of interest from authors, although only two declared their funding.

Authors' Conclusions

While the results of this systematic review are promising, there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of text message-based interventions for adherence to medications for secondary prevention of CVD. Sufficiently powered, high-quality randomised trials are needed, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

### Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments [^114a5KZs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Missed appointments are a major cause of inefficiency in healthcare delivery, with substantial monetary costs for the health system, leading to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients' forgetfulness is one of the main reasons for missed appointments, and reminders may help alleviate this problem. Modes of communicating reminders for appointments to patients include face-to-face communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, and mobile phone messaging. Mobile phone messaging applications such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) could provide an important, inexpensive delivery medium for reminders for healthcare appointments.

Objectives

To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments. Secondary objectives include assessment of patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation of the intervention; costs; and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We included studies assessing mobile phone messaging as reminders for healthcare appointments. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third author. Primary outcomes of interest were rate of attendance at healthcare appointments. We also considered health outcomes as a result of the intervention, patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. As the intervention characteristics and outcome measures were similar across included studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate an overall effect size.

Main Results

We included four randomised controlled trials involving 3547 participants. Three studies with moderate quality evidence showed that mobile text message reminders improved the rate of attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders (risk ratio (RR) 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.17)). One low quality study reported that mobile text message reminders with postal reminders, compared to postal reminders, improved rate of attendance at healthcare appointments (RR 1.10 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.19)). However, two studies with moderate quality of evidence showed that mobile phone text message reminders and phone call reminders had a similar impact on healthcare attendance (RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.03). The costs per attendance of mobile phone text message reminders were shown to be lower compared to phone call reminders. None of the included studies reported outcomes related to harms or adverse effects of the intervention, nor health outcomes or user perception of safety related to the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that mobile phone text message reminders are more effective than no reminders, and low quality evidence that text message reminders with postal reminders are more effective than postal reminders alone. Further, according to the moderate quality evidence we found, mobile phone text message reminders are as effective as phone call reminders. Overall, there is limited evidence on the effects of mobile phone text message reminders for appointment attendance, and further high-quality research is required to draw more robust conclusions.

### A systematic umbrella review and meta-meta-analysis of eHealth and mHealth interventions for improving lifestyle behaviours [^1174cbTQ]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Levels of evidence and grades for recommendationswere used to classify the overall level of evidence as grade A: consistent level 1 studies (i.e. systematic reviews of RCTs or individual RCTs); B: consistent level 2 (i.e. systematic reviews of cohort studies or individual cohort studies) or 3 studies (i.e. systematic reviews of case–control studies or individual case–control studies) or extrapolations from level 1 studies; C: level 4 studies (i.e. case series) or extrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies; or D: level 5 evidence (i.e. expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal) or troublingly inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level.

There were several variations to our pre-registered protocol. We were unable to complete the following planned subgroup analyses, due to insufficient data reported in the included meta-analyses: intervention based on a theoretical framework or theory (yes or no), number of behaviour change techniques, method of outcome assessment (self-report or objective), intervention length and time since follow-up (short-term versus longer term).

### Auditory changes in mobile users: is evidence forthcoming? [^116Kynde]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Genuine concerns are being raised as to the potential health risks posed by electromagnetic frequency exposure secondary to mobile phone usage. This study was undertaken to assess and compare potential changes in hearing function at the level of the inner ear and central auditory pathway due to chronic exposure to electromagnetic waves from both global system for mobile communications (GSM) and code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile phone usage.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Subjects and Methods

One hundred twenty-five subjects who were long-term mobile phone users (more than 1 year; 63 GSM and 62 CDMA) and 58 controls who had never used mobile phones underwent audiological investigations including pure tone audiometry (250–12 kHz), tympanometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), auditory brain responses (ABR), and middle latency responses (MLRs). The changes in various parameters were studied in mobile-using and non-mobile-using ears of both GSM and CDMA subjects and corresponding ears of the controls to ascertain the effects of electromagnetic exposure.

Results

GSM and CDMA users were found to be at a significantly higher risk of having DPOAE absent as compared with controls (P < .05). They were found to have higher speech frequency thresholds and lower MLR wave and Na and Pa amplitudes. More than 3 years of mobile phone usage emerged as a risk factor (P < .05). The damage done was bilateral, with the quantum of damage being the same for both GSM and CDMA.

Conclusion

Long-term and intensive GSM and CDMA mobile phone use may cause damage to cochlea as well as the auditory cortex.

### Effects of mobile phones on children's and adolescents' health: a commentary [^116eqGUG]. Child Development (2018). Low credibility.

The use of digital technology has grown rapidly during the last couple of decades. During use, mobile phones and cordless phones emit radiofrequency (RF) radiation. No previous generation has been exposed during childhood and adolescence to this kind of radiation. The brain is the main target organ for RF emissions from the handheld wireless phone. An evaluation of the scientific evidence on the brain tumor risk was made in May 2011 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer at World Health Organization. The scientific panel reached the conclusion that RF radiation from devices that emit nonionizing RF radiation in the frequency range 30 kHz-300 GHz is a Group 2B, that is, a "possible" human carcinogen. With respect to health implications of digital (wireless) technologies, it is of importance that neurological diseases, physiological addiction, cognition, sleep, and behavioral problems are considered in addition to cancer. Well-being needs to be carefully evaluated as an effect of changed behavior in children and adolescents through their interactions with modern digital technologies.

### Mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation [^114o2Gcs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Access to mobile phones continues to increase exponentially globally, outstripping access to fixed telephone lines, fixed computers and the Internet. Mobile phones are an appropriate and effective option for the delivery of smoking cessation support in some contexts. This review updates the evidence on the effectiveness of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions.

Objectives

To determine whether mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions increase smoking cessation in people who smoke and want to quit.

Search Methods

For the most recent update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in April 2015. We also searched the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio for current projects in the UK, and the ClinicalTrials.gov register for ongoing or recently completed studies. We searched through the reference lists of identified studies and attempted to contact the authors of ongoing studies. We applied no restrictions on language or publication date.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials. Participants were smokers of any age who wanted to quit. Studies were those examining any type of mobile phone-based intervention for smoking cessation. This included any intervention aimed at mobile phone users, based around delivery via mobile phone, and using any functions or applications that can be used or sent via a mobile phone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors extracted information on risk of bias and methodological details using a standardised form. We considered participants who dropped out of the trials or were lost to follow-up to be smoking. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each included study. Meta-analysis of the included studies used the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we presented a narrative summary and descriptive statistics.

Main Results

This updated search identified 12 studies with six-month smoking cessation outcomes, including seven studies completed since the previous review. The interventions were predominantly text messaging-based, although several paired text messaging with in-person visits or initial assessments. Two studies gave pre-paid mobile phones to low-income human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive populations - one solely for phone counselling, the other also included text messaging. One study used text messages to link to video messages. Control programmes varied widely. Studies were pooled according to outcomes - some providing measures of continuous abstinence or repeated measures of point prevalence; others only providing 7-day point prevalence abstinence. All 12 studies pooled using their most rigorous 26-week measures of abstinence provided an RR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.90; I² = 59%). Six studies verified quitting biochemically at six months (RR 1.83; 95% CI 1.54 to 2.19).

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence supports a beneficial impact of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions on six-month cessation outcomes. While all studies were good quality, the fact that those studies with biochemical verification of quitting status demonstrated an even higher chance of quitting further supports the positive findings. However, it should be noted that most included studies were of text message interventions in high-income countries with good tobacco control policies. Therefore, caution should be taken in generalising these results outside of this type of intervention and context.

### Effect of mobile telephone reminders on treatment outcome in HIV: evidence from a randomised controlled trial in India [^112y4eEM]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The current explosion in the use of mobile phone technology in healthcare coupled with decreasing costs of wireless communications worldwide has led to a panoply of promising mobile phone based interventions among patients with chronic conditions, including HIV infection. Systematic reviews acknowledge that mobile phone interventions can help improve specific health conditions, but they also underline the need for high quality clinical trials measuring outcomes in real world settings. Recent positive reports from Kenyaled a Cochrane review panel to conclude that mobile phone based reminder systems can be beneficial in HIV treatment. Recognising the promise of mobile phones in public health, as suggested by these early reports, the World Health Organization in its 2013 guidelines encourages national programmes to explore the scale up of mobile phone interventions. This approach, however, merits caution and a deeper examination of available evidence, particularly as conflicting trial results have been reported from other settings such as Cameroon and Brazil. The absence of a clear evidence base for scale up can limit the potential of this tool to translate into effective health outcomes.

With an estimated 2.5 million Indian people living with HIV infection, and an expanding ambulatory population receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART), there is a need in India to sustain treatment success. The appeal of mobile phones to enhance adherence to treatment was clear, but their implementation was limited by a lack of strong evidence to support their use in an Indian setting, as well as by inconsistent reports from other settings. We hypothesised that customised motivational low cost mobile phone reminders would enhance adherence to ART among Indian patients. This hypothesis, grounded in the social cognitive theory of planned behaviourwas based on an initial feasibility study on patients' perceptions of mobile phone remindersand a subsequent pilot study that demonstrated a beneficial effect on adherence up to six months after the mobile phone intervention was discontinued. We then tested our hypothesis using a rigorous randomised controlled trial design among HIV infected patients initiating ART in southern India.

### Effectiveness of holistic mobile health interventions on diet, and physical, and mental health outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114qEGwb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review and meta-analysis is reported as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022315166), and further details on the methodology are available here.

We searched six electronic databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, PsycINFO (via Ovid), Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) between January 1, 2011, and August 30, 2023. The initial search was conducted from January 1, 2021, to April 13, 2022, with an updated search carried out from April 13, 2022, to August 30, 2023. The decision to limit the review to starting in 2011 was primarily informed by the significant advancements in mobile health technology that coincided with the widespread adoption of smartphones and 4G connectivity. According to a report by the International Telecommunication Union, by the end of 2010, there were approximately 5 billion mobile phone subscriptions globally, and about 90% of the world's population had access to mobile networks. Moreover, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a report in 2011 focusing on mHealth, which helped establish the field as a legitimate avenue for health intervention studies.

The search strategy was based on the following topics: 1) mHealth applications; 2) PA; 3) diet; and 4) mental health. The full search strategy is published elsewhere. In addition, we searched the first 200 records on Google Scholar and manually browsed the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.

The selection criteria were guided by the population, intervention, comparator group, outcome, and study design (PICOS) framework. More details can be found here. Briefly, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs) if they 1) recruited either adults aged 18 years or older from the general population or those who were at risk of developing NCDs or mental disorders; 2) had content on PA, diet, and mental health in a single intervention; and 3) were delivered mainly via mHealth technologies (e.g. mobile applications (apps), short message service (SMS), and wearables).

### Mobile phone text-messaging interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (text2PreventCVD): systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^113kH36c]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and IPD meta-analysis and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and the Cochrane Collaboration reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. This review is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. The study protocol has been published previously.

Search strategy

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO (Ovid) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for reports published from 1 January 1990 to 1 July 2016 to identify RCTs of text-messaging interventions used for the prevention of CVD risk factors. The following Medical Subject Headings search terms were used: (1) intervention (text messaging, text messages, short message service (SMS), text message mobile phone, cellular phone, texting, SMS); (2) CVD (heart disease, coronary disease, BP, hypertension, lipids, cholesterol, cardiovascular risk factors, myocardial infarction, vascular, diabetes and obesity) and (3) study design (RCT). We also searched for ongoing, recently completed and unpublished clinical trials meeting the inclusion criteria described earlier from different trial registers and reference lists of selected studies, and reviewed grey literature for any other relevant studies. Consultation and contacts with experts in the field were made to help identify relevant studies.

Study eligibility

Full details of the methods used have been reported previously. In brief, studies were eligible if they were RCTs of a text-messaging intervention focused on CVD prevention (primary or secondary) with at least two behaviour change strategies, for example, physical activity and diet or BP lowering, smoking and cholesterol lowering; study duration was at least 6 months and 70% completed the follow-up of participants; study participants were adults, the sample size was larger than 30 people, and the control group received standard care. Reports published in any language were considered.

### Mobile phone text-messaging interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (text2PreventCVD): systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^113badPh]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

The global reach and ubiquity of mHealth interventions suggest they may be useful, but despite almost a decade of research, the evidence base remains limited. In this context, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of text-messaging interventions used for the prevention of CVD risk factors to generate robust evidence and to identify researchers active in this field. We established the Text2PreventCVD Trial Collaborators Group, a global network of researchers working on mHealth interventions in CVD prevention and management, with the goals of collaboration to facilitate the next generation of trials. In the current paper, the Text2PreventCVD Collaboration aimed to quantify the extent of improvement in cardiovascular risk factors with mobile phone text-messaging interventions using systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. Studies included needed to involve interventions that had the potential to impact on at least two measures of cardiovascular risk factors. The primary outcome designated for these analyses was systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the secondary outcomes included diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and body mass index (BMI).

### Mobile phone interventions to improve health outcomes among patients with chronic diseases: an umbrella review and evidence synthesis from 34 meta-analyses [^1128th93]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

Risk of bias within studies

Most meta-analyses (k = 30; 88%) used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to evaluate RCTs' risk of bias, although one (3%) used the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, and three (9%) did not evaluate the risk of bias (table 1). The appendix (p 3) presents a summary of bias assessment of the primary RCTs from meta-analyses that reported data (ie, 193/235 RCTs; 82%). Incorrect or insufficient masking of personnel and participants (n = 125, 53%), incorrect or insufficient masking of study outcome assessment (n = 52, 22%), and incomplete outcome data (n = 40, 17%) were the three areas with the highest risk of bias. The appendix (pp 38–46) presents available Cochrane Risk of Bias for the primary RCTs.

Risk of bias across studies

Of the 64 representative effect sizes, a total of ten evaluated publication bias (16%) in the corresponding analysis, in which nine (14%) of them reported no publication bias (eg, from Egger's test).

Representative effect sizes from individual studies

A total of 89 effect sizes were extracted from the 34 eligible meta-analyses (appendix pp 47–50). A total of 64 unique representative effect sizes were identified, including 31 standardised effect sizes and 33 unstandardised effect sizes. Table 2 presents these effect sizes along with corresponding 95% CIs, PICO categories, heterogeneity (I ²), publication bias, and strength of evidence per umbrella review methodology. Additionally, GRADE was reported when it was evaluated in the meta-analysis.

Moderators

We summarise the results from nine moderator tests that were done specific to a chronic disease in table 3. Conditions represented include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Significant moderators included sample characteristics (eg, age, baseline BMI, baseline HbA₁c, or Asian vs non-Asian population) and intervention characteristics (eg, study duration, dose, or SMS vs non-SMS delivery), although many were not consistently significant across meta-analyses or PICOs. Full details of all moderation tests are presented in the appendix (pp 51–53).

### Targeted client communication via mobile devices for improving sexual and reproductive health [^113RhN8R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The burden of poor sexual and reproductive health (SRH) worldwide is substantial, disproportionately affecting those living in low- and middle-income countries. Targeted client communication (TCC) delivered via mobile devices (MD) (TCCMD) may improve the health behaviours and service use important for sexual and reproductive health.

Objectives

To assess the effects of TCC via MD on adolescents' knowledge, and on adolescents' and adults' sexual and reproductive health behaviour, health service use, and health and well-being.

Search Methods

In July/August 2017, we searched five databases including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and Embase. We also searched two trial registries. A search update was carried out in July 2019 and potentially relevant studies are awaiting classification.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of TCC via MD to improve sexual and reproductive health behaviour, health service use, and health and well-being. Eligible comparators were standard care or no intervention, non-digital TCC, and digital non-targeted communication.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane, although data extraction and risk of bias assessments were carried out by one person only and cross-checked by a second. We have presented results separately for adult and adolescent populations, and for each comparison.

Main Results

We included 40 trials (27 among adult populations and 13 among adolescent populations) with a total of 26,854 participants. All but one of the trials among adolescent populations were conducted in high-income countries. Trials among adult populations were conducted in a range of high- to low-income countries. Among adolescents, nine interventions were delivered solely through text messages; four interventions tested text messages in combination with another communication channel, such as emails, multimedia messaging, or voice calls; and one intervention used voice calls alone. Among adults, 20 interventions were delivered through text messages; two through a combination of text messages and voice calls; and the rest were delivered through other channels such as voice calls, multimedia messaging, interactive voice response, and instant messaging services. Adolescent populations TCCMD versus standard care TCCMD may increase sexual health knowledge (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 1.71; low-certainty evidence). TCCMD may modestly increase contraception use (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.35; low-certainty evidence). The effects on condom use, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and health service use are uncertain due to very low-certainty evidence. The effects on abortion and STI rates are unknown due to lack of studies. TCCMD versus non-digital TCC (e.g. pamphlets) The effects of TCCMD on behaviour (contraception use, condom use, ART adherence), service use, health and wellbeing (abortion and STI rates) are unknown due to lack of studies for this comparison. TCCMD versus digital non-targeted communication The effects on sexual health knowledge, condom and contraceptive use are uncertain due to very low-certainty evidence. Interventions may increase health service use (attendance for STI/HIV testing, RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.40; low-certainty evidence). The intervention may be beneficial for reducing STI rates (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.33; low-certainty evidence), but the confidence interval encompasses both benefit and harm. The effects on abortion rates and on ART adherence are unknown due to lack of studies. We are uncertain whether TCCMD results in unintended consequences due to lack of evidence. Adult populations TCCMD versus standard care For health behaviours, TCCMD may modestly increase contraception use at 12 months (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.48) and may reduce repeat abortion (RR 0.68 95% CI 0.28 to 1.66), though the confidence interval encompasses benefit and harm (low-certainty evidence). The effect on condom use is uncertain. No study measured the impact of this intervention on STI rates. TCCMD may modestly increase ART adherence (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.32, low-certainty evidence, and standardised mean difference 0.44, 95% CI -0.14 to 1.02, low-certainty evidence). TCCMD may modestly increase health service utilisation (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; low-certainty evidence), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² = 85%), with mixed results according to type of service utilisation (i.e. attendance for STI testing; HIV treatment; voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC); VMMC post-operative visit; post-abortion care). For health and well-being outcomes, there may be little or no effect on CD4 count (mean difference 13.99, 95% CI -8.65 to 36.63; low-certainty evidence) and a slight reduction in virological failure (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; low-certainty evidence). TCCMD versus non-digital TCC No studies reported STI rates, condom use, ART adherence, abortion rates, or contraceptive use as outcomes for this comparison. TCCMD may modestly increase in service attendance overall (RR: 1.12, 95% CI 0.92–1.35, low certainty evidence), however the confidence interval encompasses benefit and harm. TCCMD versus digital non-targeted communication No studies reported STI rates, condom use, ART adherence, abortion rates, or contraceptive use as outcomes for this comparison. TCCMD may increase service utilisation overall (RR: 1.71, 95% CI 0.67–4.38, low certainty evidence), however the confidence interval encompasses benefit and harm and there was considerable heterogeneity (I² = 72%), with mixed results according to type of service utilisation (STI/HIV testing, and VMMC). Few studies reported on unintended consequences. One study reported that a participant withdrew from the intervention as they felt it compromised their undisclosed HIV status.

Authors' Conclusions

TCCMD may improve some outcomes but the evidence is of low certainty. The effect on most outcomes is uncertain/unknown due to very low certainty evidence or lack of evidence. High quality, adequately powered trials and cost effectiveness analyses are required to reliably ascertain the effects and relative benefits of TCC delivered by mobile devices. Given the sensitivity and stigma associated with sexual and reproductive health future studies should measure unintended consequences, such as partner violence or breaches of confidentiality.

### Synopsis of the 2020 U.S. VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of adult overweight and obesity [^114R1hGM]. Military Medicine (2021). High credibility.

VA/DoD adult overweight and obesity — technology-delivered lifestyle interventions: We recommend offering an in-person group or individual CI to patients with overweight or obesity for weight loss, and there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against offering a technology-delivered CI either as an adjunct or alternative to CI delivered in-person or by telephone. In a 2018 USPSTF systematic review, the MD in weight loss outcomes favoring the 12 technology-delivered interventions versus control was small (MD: -1.14 kg; 95% CI: -1.59 to -1.09) compared with the MD between CLI versus control for all 67 trials (-2.39 kg; 95% CI: -2.86 to -1.93). Seven of the 12 individual trials did not find a significant difference between intervention and minimal intervention or usual care control groups, with some positive results limited to specific subgroups and with face-to-face or other human interaction components reported in several trials. A 2019 SR of web-based digital health interventions conducted a meta-analysis of five RCTs and found a significant effect favoring active interventions on weight loss, though the quality rating of the SR was poor; none of the trials reported outcomes beyond nine months, and three of the five trials reported outcomes at four months or less. Another 2019 SR of mobile phone-delivered CLI included Twenty RCTs in adults with overweight or obesity; weight loss outcomes at 12 or 24 months were reported for only four mobile phone intervention conditions in three trials, and none of these produced significant effects versus controls, with the meta-analysis noted as flawed. Although the Work Group found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of technology as a primary means to deliver CLIs, they emphasize considering variation in patient values and preferences, efficiency of resource utilization, and potential reach of interventions.

### Mobile health applications in self-management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of their efficacy [^1126urdT]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mobile health applications are increasingly used in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to improve their self-management, nonetheless, without firm evidence of their efficacy. This meta-analysis was aimed to assess the efficacy of mobile health applications in supporting self-management as an intervention to reduce hospital admission rates and average days of hospitalization, etc. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science (SCI), Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for relevant articles published before November 14th, 2017. A total of 6 reports with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were finally included in this meta-analysis.

Results

Patients using mobile phone applications may have a lower risk for hospital admissions than those in the usual care group (risk ratio (RR) = 0.73, 95% CI [0.52, 1.04]). However, there was no significant difference in reducing the average days of hospitalization.

Conclusion

Self-management with mobile phone applications could reduce hospital admissions of patients with COPD.

Interventions for adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) are increasingly using mobile phones but may not effectively report evidence.

Objective

To assess strategies, findings, and quality of evidence on using mobile phones to improve ASRH by using the mHealth Evidence Reporting and Assessment (mERA) checklist recently published by the World Health Organization mHealth Technical Evidence Review Group.

Data Sources

Systematic searches of 8 databases for peer-reviewed studies published January 2000 through August 2014.

Study Selection

Eligible studies targeted adolescents ages 10 to 24 and provided results from mobile phone interventions designed to improve ASRH.

Data Extraction

Studies were evaluated according to the mERA checklist, covering essential mHealth criteria and methodological reporting criteria.

Results

Thirty-five articles met inclusion criteria. Studies reported on 28 programs operating at multiple levels of the health care system in 7 countries. Most programs (82%) used text messages. An average of 41% of essential mHealth criteria were met (range 14%-79%). An average of 82% of methodological reporting criteria were met (range 52%-100%). Evidence suggests that inclusion of text messaging in health promotion campaigns, sexually transmitted infection screening and follow-up, and medication adherence may lead to improved ASRH.

Limitations

Only 3 articles reported evidence from lower- or middle-income countries, so it is difficult to draw conclusions for these settings.

Conclusions

Evidence on mobile phone interventions for ASRH published in peer-reviewed journals reflects a high degree of quality in methods and reporting. In contrast, current reporting on essential mHealth criteria is insufficient for understanding, replicating, and scaling up mHealth interventions.

Flow diagram for study selection according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines

Study characteristics

The studies that were included in the systematic review are listed in Table 1. All of the eight eligible studies were published from 2005 to 2016. They included a total of 638 patients, 325 of whom were randomly assigned to intervention groups; 313 were assigned to control groups. A total of 578 patients (90.5%) completed the respective intervention studies, there were 293 people in the intervention group and 285 in the control group. A total of 602 people were analyzed. And, for the six references that calculated the sample size, the power was greater than 80%. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of loss to follow-up between the intervention group and the control group. Two studies were conducted in the United States, five in Europe, and one in Australia. The shortest study was 3 months in duration, and the longest was 12 months. Three studies had durations of 3–5 months, and five studies had durations longer than 6 months. In three studies, the intervention was only use mobile phone text messages, while the remainder used mobile phone applications.

### Birth and death notification via mobile devices: a mixed methods systematic review [^115qGCA1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ministries of health, donors, and other decision-makers are exploring how they can use mobile technologies to acquire accurate and timely statistics on births and deaths. These stakeholders have called for evidence-based guidance on this topic. This review was carried out to support World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on digital interventions for health system strengthening.

Objectives

Primary objective: To assess the effects of birth notification and death notification via a mobile device, compared to standard practice. Secondary objectives: To describe the range of strategies used to implement birth and death notification via mobile devices and identify factors influencing the implementation of birth and death notification via mobile devices.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Global Health Library, and POPLINE (August 2, 2019). We searched two trial registries (August 2, 2019). We also searched Epistemonikos for related systematic reviews and potentially eligible primary studies (August 27, 2019). We conducted a grey literature search using mHealthevidence.org (August 15, 2017) and issued a call for papers through popular digital health communities of practice. Finally, we conducted citation searches of included studies in Web of Science and Google Scholar (May 15, 2020). We searched for studies published after 2000 in any language. SELECTION CRITERIA: For the primary objective, we included individual and cluster-randomised trials; cross-over and stepped-wedge study designs; controlled before-after studies, provided they have at least two intervention sites and two control sites; and interrupted time series studies. For the secondary objectives, we included any study design, either quantitative, qualitative, or descriptive, that aimed to describe current strategies for birth and death notification via mobile devices; or to explore factors that influence the implementation of these strategies, including studies of acceptability or feasibility. For the primary objective, we included studies that compared birth and death notification via mobile devices with standard practice. For the secondary objectives, we included studies of birth and death notification via mobile device as long as we could extract data relevant to our secondary objectives. We included studies of all cadres of healthcare providers, including lay health workers; administrative, managerial, and supervisory staff; focal individuals at the village or community level; children whose births were being notified and their parents/caregivers; and individuals whose deaths were being notified and their relatives/caregivers.

Data Collection and Analysis

For the primary objective, two authors independently screened all records, extracted data from the included studies and assessed risk of bias. For the analyses of the primary objective, we reported means and proportions, where appropriate. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence and we prepared a 'Summary of Findings' table. For the secondary objectives, two authors screened all records, one author extracted data from the included studies and assessed methodological limitations using the WEIRD tool and a second author checked the data and assessments. We carried out a framework analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework to identify themes in the data. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach to assess our confidence in the evidence and we prepared a 'Summary of Qualitative Findings' table.

Main Results

For the primary objective, we included one study, which used a controlled before-after study design. The study was conducted in Lao People's Democratic Republic and assessed the effect of using mobile devices for birth notification on outcomes related to coverage and timeliness of Hepatitis B vaccination. However, we are uncertain of the effect of this approach on these outcomes because the certainty of this evidence was assessed as very low. The included study did not assess resource use or unintended consequences. For the primary objective, we did not identify any studies using mobile devices for death notification. For the secondary objective, we included 21 studies. All studies were conducted in low- or middle-income settings. They focussed on identification of births and deaths in rural, remote, or marginalised populations who are typically under-represented in civil registration processes or traditionally seen as having poor access to health services. The review identified several factors that could influence the implementation of birth-death notification via mobile device. These factors were tied to the health system, the person responsible for notifying, the community and families; and include: - Geographic barriers that could prevent people's access to birth-death notification and post-notification services - Access to health workers and other notifiers with enough training, supervision, support, and incentives - Monitoring systems that ensure the quality and timeliness of the birth and death data - Legal frameworks that allow births and deaths to be notified by mobile device and by different types of notifiers - Community awareness of the need to register births and deaths - Socio-cultural norms around birth and death - Government commitment - Cost to the system, to health workers and to families - Access to electricity and network connectivity, and compatibility with existing systems - Systems that protect data confidentiality We have low to moderate confidence in these findings. This was mainly because of concerns about methodological limitations and data adequacy.

Authors' Conclusions

We need more, well-designed studies of the effect of birth and death notification via mobile devices and on factors that may influence its implementation.

### Targeted client communication via mobile devices for improving sexual and reproductive health [^114AT6h5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

We decided whether to meta‐analyse data based on whether the included trials were similar enough in terms of participants, settings, intervention, comparison and outcome measures to ensure meaningful conclusions could be drawn from a statistically pooled result.

For studies that measured the same outcome at different time points, we extracted the outcome measured at the longest follow‐up time point. We had planned to categorise lengths of follow‐up as follows: short‐term follow‐up would be three months or less, moderate‐term follow‐up would be 3‐12 months and long‐term follow‐up would be more than 12 months. However, given the limited number of studies with the same aim, comparison, and outcome measure that could be pooled, we decided to pool outcomes across different lengths of follow‐up.

Due to the anticipated variability in the interventions of included studies, we used random‐effects models in our meta‐analyses. The primary meta‐analyses included all studies regardless of their risk of bias.

For continuous outcomes, we calculated MDs with 95% CIs. If more than one study measured the same continuous outcome using different tools, we calculated the SMDs and 95% CI using the inverse variance method in Review Manager 5. We calculated RR or OR with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes. For cluster RCTs where adjusted effect estimates (e.g. OR, RR) were presented, we combined these estimates using a generic inverse variance random‐effects model (Higgins 2011).

Where meta‐analyses were not possible, we presented results in a narrative format.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses for the objective outcomes of health status.

Income region (by World Bank income group – lower income, lower‐middle income, upper‐middle income, high‐income) (World Bank 2017)
Delivery mechanisms (i.e. mobile phone messaging only, mobile applications only, combined mobile phone messaging and application, combined application and other)

However, there was an insufficient number of studies reporting the same health status outcomes to conduct these subgroup analyses.

### Cellular phones and risk of brain tumors [^113cdZ5v]. CA (2001). Low credibility.

As cellular telephones are a relatively new technology, we do not yet have long-term follow-up on their possible biological effects. However, the lack of ionizing radiation and the low energy level emitted from cell phones and absorbed by human tissues make it unlikely that these devices cause cancer. Moreover, several well-designed epidemiologic studies find no consistent association between cell phone use and brain cancer. It is impossible to prove that any product or exposure is absolutely safe, especially in the absence of very long-term follow-up. Accordingly, the following summary from the Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health offers advice to people concerned about their risk: If there is a risk from these products — and at this point we do not know that there is — it is probably very small. But if people are concerned about avoiding even potential risks, there are simple steps they can take to do so. People who must conduct extended conversations in their cars every day could switch to a type of mobile phone that places more distance between their bodies and the source of the RF, since the exposure level drops off dramatically with distance. For example, they could switch to: a mobile phone in which the antenna is located outside the vehicle, a hand-held phone with a built-in antenna connected to a different antenna mounted on the outside of the car or built into a separate package, or a headset with a remote antenna to a mobile phone carried at the waist. Again the scientific data do not demonstrate that mobile phones are harmful. But if people are concerned about the radiofrequency energy from these products, taking the simple precautions outlined above can reduce any possible risk. In addition, people who are concerned might choose digital rather than analog telephones, since the former use lower RF levels.

### A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of the effects of digital health interventions on postpartum contraception use [^113eCEF5]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

Digital health interventions (DHI) have been used to enhance the uptake of postpartum contraception and reduce unmet contraception needs. We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness of DHI on postpartum contraceptive use and repeated pregnancy.

Method

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL and Cochrane CENTRAL (January 1990-July 2020). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of DHI promoting contraception among pregnant or postpartum women were included. Two researchers screened articles and extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias, certainty of evidence (CoE) and conducted meta-analyses following Cochrane guidance.

Results

Twelve trials with 5527women were included. Interventions were delivered by video (four trials), mobile phone counselling (three trials), short message services (SMS) (four trials) and computer (one trial). During pregnancy or the postpartum period, mobile phone counselling had an uncertain effect on the use of postpartum contraception (risk ratio (RR) 1.37, 95%CI 0.82 to 2.29, very low CoE); video-based education may moderately improve contraception use (RR 1.48, 95%CI 1.01 to 2.17, low CoE); while SMS education probably modestly increased contraception use (RR 1.12, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.23, moderate CoE). Mobile phone counselling probably increased long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) use (RR 4.23, 95%CI 3.01 to 5.93, moderate CoE). Both mobile phone counselling (RR 0.27, 95%CI 0.01 to 5.77, very low CoE) and videos (RR 1.25, 95%CI 0.24 to 6.53, very low CoE) had uncertain effects on repeated pregnancy.

Conclusions

During pregnancy or in the postpartum period, videos may moderately increase postpartum contraception use and SMS probably modestly increase postpartum contraception use. The effects of DHI on repeated pregnancy are uncertain. Further well-conducted RCTs of DHI would strengthen the evidence of effects on contraception use and pregnancy.

### Digital tracking, provider decision support systems, and targeted client communication via mobile devices to improve primary health care [^111h9Zp3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined using TCCs to improve health knowledge, behaviour, and outcomes (Free 2013; Gurol‐Urganci 2013; Vodopivec‐Jamsek 2012; Whittaker 2016). Much of the available evidence is of low or moderate quality and includes limited studies from low‐resource settings that are not conducted in primary healthcare settings. A systematic review of eight randomised trials assessed the effects of mobile phone messaging reminders on improving attendance at healthcare appointments. This review concluded that mobile phone text messaging reminders, similar to phone call reminders, were associated with increased attendance at healthcare appointments (Gurol‐Urganci 2013). Whittaker 2016 included 12 moderate to high‐quality studies and found a beneficial impact of mobile phone‐based smoking cessation interventions on six‐month cessation outcomes. Another systematic review of 75 controlled trials on the effectiveness of mobile technology‐based health behaviour change interventions and disease management interventions delivered to healthcare consumers suggested the benefits of text messaging for improving antiretroviral treatment adherence and smoking cessation (Free 2013). However, this review found limited evidence from LMICs and noted an overall lack of high‐quality trials. Two systematic reviews ‐ one focused on the use of TCC via mobile devices for the improvement of sexual and reproductive health, and the other for the improvement of maternal, neonatal, and child health ‐ documented uncertainty regarding the effects of TCC on improving related health outcomes, given low certainty and availability of such evidence (Palmer 2020a; Palmer 2020b). None of these reviews focused on interventions integrating TCCs with longitudinal digital health records.

This review assesses evidence on tracking systems accessible via mobile devices integrated with CDSSs and TCCs. Given the recent emergence of digital technologies for health, Ministries of Health, donors, and decision‐makers need evidence‐based guidance on the value of digital tools in strengthening health system gaps. In response to this global need, the World Health Organization is developing guidelines to inform investments in digital health approaches. This review on digital interventions that use combinations of CDSSs, TCCs, and electronic health records constitutes one of a suite of such reviews. The preliminary results of this review were used to directly inform WHO guidelines on the effectiveness of these strategies in addressing health system shortfalls (WHO 2019).

### Mobile health in the management of type 1 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RRSzp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

As an insulin-dependent disease, type 1 diabetes requires paying close attention to the glycemic control. Studies have shown that mobile health (mHealth) can improve the management of chronic diseases. However, the effectiveness of mHealth in controlling the glycemic control remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis using the available literature reporting findings on mHealth interventions, which may improve the management of type 1 diabetes.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature review of all studies in the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMbase databases that used mHealth (including mobile phones) in diabetes care and reported glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values as a measure of glycemic control. The fixed effects model was used for this meta-analysis.

Results

This study analyzed eight studies, which involved a total of 602 participants. In the meta-analysis, the fixed effects model showed a statistically significant decrease in the mean of HbA1c in the intervention group: -0.25 (95% confidence interval: -0.41, -0.09; P = 0.003, I² = 12%). Subgroup analyses indicated that the patient's age, the type of intervention, and the duration of the intervention influenced blood glucose control. Funnel plots showed no publication bias.

Conclusions

Mobile health interventions may be effective among patients with type 1 diabetes. A significant reduction in HbA1c levels was associated with adult age, the use of a mobile application, and the long-term duration of the intervention.

### Review of the evidence that transcranial electromagnetic treatment will be a safe and effective therapeutic against Alzheimer's disease [^115DBWAj]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

SECTION III: HUMAN STUDIES RELATED TO TEMT SAFETY AND EFFICACY

General health studies

Particularly since 2005, many studies in normal adults have investigated the safety of cell phone use (especially GSM 900 phones) on indices of general human health such as sleeplessness, fatigue, dizziness, digestive disturbances, concentration difficulties, blood cell profiles, blood pressure, or cognitive function. The single antenna of these commercially available devices is held close to the human head during use and their electromagnetic frequency of around 900 MHz and SAR levels of < 1.6 W/kg are close to those for any given antenna of the TEMT device that we have in clinical trials. In that only one antenna of the TEMT device is ON/active at any given time, the results of human studies investigating health effects of both short- and long-term GSM 900 cell phone use are especially pertinent to determining safety of our TEMT device. General health aspects of cell phone use will be considered first, followed by an analysis of the purported association between cell phones and brain cancers. It is important to note that this evaluation of human health effects of cell phones largely involves electromagnetic (RF) exposure from GSM 900 MHz cell phones, although some studies also included other cell phone technologies (e.g. GSM 1800/1900 MHz, UMTS). Obviously, GSM 900 cell phones are the closest in electromagnetic parameters to the TEMTdevice.

Valberg summarized findings of the World Health Organization's workshop on health issues potentially related to cell phone use and concluded that there is little support for adverse health effects from cell phones at or below levels established by international standards. Valberg underscored that the more recent, better-designed human studies are universally negative, particularly regarding cancer development. In a very comprehensive review, Krewski stated that, " All of the authoritative reviews completed within the last 2 years have concluded that there is no clear evidence of adverse health effects associated with radiofrequency fields ". In an update of their original report, Krewski and colleagues again found there was no clear evidence of adverse health effects associated with radiofrequency fields/cell phones. For the period 2000–2011, Moussa evaluated epidemiologic, systemic, and meta-analysis studies, and also found no consistent pattern for exposure to mobile phones being detrimental to health.

### Electromagnetic fields, 5G and health: what about the precautionary principle? [^111qG6kU]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

New fifth generation (5G) telecommunications systems, now being rolled out globally, have become the subject of a fierce controversy. Some health protection agencies and their scientific advisory committees have concluded that there is no conclusive scientific evidence of harm. Several recent reviews by independent scientists, however, suggest that there is significant uncertainty on this question, with rapidly emerging evidence of potentially harmful biological effects from radio frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposures, at the levels 5G roll-out will entail. This essay identifies four relevant sources of scientific uncertainty and concern: (1) lack of clarity about precisely what technology is included in 5G; (2) a rapidly accumulating body of laboratory studies documenting disruptive in vitro and in vivo effects of RF-EMFs-but one with many gaps in it; (3) an almost total lack (as yet) of high-quality epidemiological studies of adverse human health effects from 5G EMF exposure specifically, but rapidly emerging epidemiological evidence of such effects from past generations of RF-EMF exposure; (4) persistent allegations that some national telecommunications regulatory authorities do not base their RF-EMF safety policies on the latest science, related to unmanaged conflicts of interest. The author, an experienced epidemiologist, concludes that one cannot dismiss the growing health concerns about RF-EMFs, especially in an era when higher population levels of exposure are occurring widely, due to the spatially dense transmitters which 5G systems require. Based on the precautionary principle, the author echoes the calls of others for a moratorium on the further roll-out of 5G systems globally, pending more conclusive research on their safety.

### Evaluating the impact of penalising the use of mobile phones while driving on road traffic fatalities, serious injuries and mobile phone use: a systematic review [^113DueTi]. Injury Prevention (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A vast literature has demonstrated that using mobile phones while driving increases the risk of road traffic crashes. In response, policy-makers have introduced bans and harsher penalties on using mobile phones while driving. Even though emerging evidence suggests that such measures may reduce mobile phone use and crashes, the literature has not been systematically reviewed and synthesised.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of penalising mobile phone use while driving on road traffic fatalities, serious injuries and the prevalence of mobile phone use while driving.

Methods

We employed a comprehensive search strategy using electronic databases, websites, handsearching and other sources to locate studies evaluating legislation on mobile phone use while driving. Randomised controlled trials, interrupted time series', controlled before-after studies with control(s) not exposed to harsher sanctions and panel data designs were included if they measured the outcomes of fatalities, serious injuries or the prevalence of mobile phone use while driving. Eligible studies were critically appraised. Due to substantial heterogeneity, the results were synthesised narratively. The synthesis structured studies according to the type of legislation and outcome measure.

Results

Of the 7420 studies retrieved, 32 were included. The evidence on the effects of penalising mobile phone use while driving was weak, and somewhat inconsistent, but pointed to a potential decrease in the prevalence of mobile phone use and fatalities for all-driver primary enforcement hand-held bans and texting bans.

Conclusions

Preventing fatalities from risky driving practices may be helped by implementing harsher laws that penalise mobile phone use while driving.

### Mobile health interventions for improving health outcomes in youth: a meta-analysis [^113uoMcd]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Mobile health interventions are increasingly popular in pediatrics; however, it is unclear how effective these interventions are in changing health outcomes.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of mobile health interventions for improving health outcomes in youth 18 years or younger.

Data Sources

Studies published through November 30, 2016, were collected through PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Educational Resources Information Center, and PsychINFO. Backward and forward literature searches were conducted on articles meeting study inclusion criteria. Search terms included telemedicine, eHealth, mobile health, mHealth, app, and mobile application.

Study Selection

Search results were limited to infants, children, adolescents, or young adults when possible. Studies were included if quantitative methods were used to evaluate an application of mobile intervention technology in a primary or secondary capacity to promote or modify health behavior in youth 18 years or younger. Studies were excluded if the article was an unpublished dissertation or thesis, the mean age of participants was older than 18 years, the study did not assess a health behavior and disease outcome, or the article did not include sufficient statistics. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied by 2 independent coders with 20% overlap. Of 9773 unique articles, 36 articles (containing 37 unique studies with a total of 29 822 participants) met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Of 9773 unique articles, 36 articles (containing 37 unique studies) with a total of 29 822 participants met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes were calculated from statistical tests that could be converted to standardized mean differences. All aggregate effect sizes and moderator variables were tested using random-effects models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Change in health behavior or disease control.

Results

A total of 29 822 participants were included in the studies. In studies that reported sex, the total number of females was 11 226 (53.2%). Of those reporting age, the average was 11.35 years. The random effects aggregate effect size of mobile health interventions was significant (n = 37; Cohen d = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14–0.29). The random effects model indicated that providing mobile health intervention to a caregiver increased the strength of the intervention effect. Studies that involved caregivers in the intervention produced effect sizes (n = 16; Cohen d = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.18–0.39) larger than those that did not include caregivers (n = 21; Cohen d = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02–0.25). Other coded variables did not moderate study effect size.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mobile health interventions appear to be a viable health behavior change intervention modality for youth. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones, mobile health interventions offer promise in improving public health.

### Delivery arrangements for health systems in low-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews [^1146nSJ2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

E‐health

Mobile phone messaging for patients with long‐term illnesses

Mobile phone messaging for patients with long‐term illnesses, such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma, was compared to usual care in a review that included four studies (De Jongh 2012). Mobile phone messaging tools include medication reminders, supportive care messages, or communicating information with healthcare providers and receiving feedback from them. The review found that mobile phone messaging support probably improves medication adherence in people with hypertension (moderate‐certainty evidence).

Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments

A review compared the effects of mobile phone messaging for attendance at healthcare appointments to various other interventions, and included four studies (Gurol‐Urganci 2013). It found that mobile phone text message reminders probably increase attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders (moderate‐certainty evidence).

Mobile phone messaging to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy

A review of the effects of mobile phone messaging to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared these interventions to usual care and included three trials (Mbuagbaw 2013). The review found, firstly, that mobile phone text messages compared to standard care improves adherence to ART for up to 12 months (high‐certainty evidence) and may lead to little or no difference in mortality or loss to follow‐up to 12 months (low‐certainty evidence). Secondly, weekly text messages probably improve adherence compared to daily text messages; and interactive text messages probably improve adherence compared to non‐interactive text messages (moderate‐certainty evidence). All of the studies were conducted in low‐income countries in Africa.

Health information systems for managing the care of people living with HIV/AIDS

A review examined the effects of the setting of care and the organisation of care on medical, immunological/virological, psychosocial and economic outcomes for people living with HIV/AIDS (Handford 2006). The review included twenty‐eight studies, all conducted in high‐income countries. In relation to organisation of care, the review found that computer prompts for primary care providers probably hasten initiation of recommended treatments for patients with HIV/AIDS (moderate‐certainty evidence). Other effects of computer prompts and information systems are uncertain.

### Use of mobile phones and risk of brain tumours: update of Danish cohort study [^117PQEBV]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The number of mobile phone users is constantly increasing with more than five billion subscriptions worldwide in 2010. The widespread use of mobile phones has led to concerns regarding potential adverse health effects, particularly tumours of the central nervous system, of which the brain is the part most exposed to the radio frequency electromagnetic fields emitted by an operating mobile phone held to the ear. So far, the mechanism of potential non-thermal interaction between radio frequency electromagnetic fields and living systems is unknown. The results of the Interphone study, the largest international case-control study on this topic, generally suggest no increased risk of glioma or meningioma. For glioma, however, an increased risk (odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.89) was observed in 364 people with more than 1640 hours of cumulative use. Results for long term mobile phone users (≥ 10 years) remain scarce, and all epidemiological studies are based on few cases. In addition, most studies have been retrospective case-control studies with self reported data on mobile phone use, which are prone to bias, particularly random reporting bias and differential recall bias for cases and controls, which hampers the risk estimation and precludes firm conclusions.

The only cohort study investigating mobile phone use and cancer to date is a Danish nationwide study comparing cancer risk of all 420 095 people who had signed a mobile phone contract with a phone company (subscribers) from 1982 (the year such phones were introduced in Denmark) until 1995, with the corresponding risk in the rest of the adult population with follow-up to 1996and then 2002. The study found no evidence of any increased risk of brain or nervous system tumours or any cancer among mobile phone subscribers. There was, however, a decreased risk (standardised incidence ratio 0.66, 0.44 to 0.95) of developing a tumour of the brain or nervous system in people who had had a subscription for more than 10 years, but this result was based on only 28 cases. In addition, it was observed that male mobile phone subscribers were at a lower risk (standardised incidence ratio 0.88, 0.86 to 0.91) of developing tobacco related cancers. Additional investigations showed that early male subscribers probably constituted a unique subgroup of people with a higher income and therefore a potentially distinct risk profile, particularly lower tobacco consumption.

### Mobile phone text messaging and app-based interventions for smoking cessation [^11395AXX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Mobile phone-based smoking cessation support (mCessation) offers the opportunity to provide behavioural support to those who cannot or do not want face-to-face support. In addition, mCessation can be automated and therefore provided affordably even in resource-poor settings. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006, and previously updated in 2009 and 2012.

Objectives

To determine whether mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions increase smoking cessation rates in people who smoke.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, along with clinicaltrials.gov and the ICTRP. The date of the most recent searches was 29 October 2018.

Selection Criteria

Participants were smokers of any age. Eligible interventions were those testing any type of predominantly mobile phone-based programme (such as text messages (or smartphone app) for smoking cessation. We included randomised controlled trials with smoking cessation outcomes reported at at least six-month follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We performed both study eligibility checks and data extraction in duplicate. We performed meta-analyses of the most stringent measures of abstinence at six months' follow-up or longer, using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method, pooling studies with similar interventions and similar comparators to calculate risk ratios (RR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted analyses including all randomised (with dropouts counted as still smoking) and complete cases only.

Main Results

This review includes 26 studies (33,849 participants). Overall, we judged 13 studies to be at low risk of bias, three at high risk, and the remainder at unclear risk. Settings and recruitment procedures varied across studies, but most studies were conducted in high-income countries. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by inconsistency, that automated text messaging interventions were more effective than minimal smoking cessation support (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.00; I² = 71%; 13 studies, 14,133 participants). There was also moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that text messaging added to other smoking cessation interventions was more effective than the other smoking cessation interventions alone (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33; I² = 0%, 4 studies, 997 participants). Two studies comparing text messaging with other smoking cessation interventions, and three studies comparing high- and low-intensity messaging, did not show significant differences between groups (RR 0.92 95% CI 0.61 to 1.40; I² = 27%; 2 studies, 2238 participants; and RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; I² = 0%, 3 studies, 12,985 participants, respectively) but confidence intervals were wide in the former comparison. Five studies compared a smoking cessation smartphone app with lower-intensity smoking cessation support (either a lower-intensity app or non-app minimal support). We pooled the evidence and deemed it to be of very low certainty due to inconsistency and serious imprecision. It provided no evidence that smartphone apps improved the likelihood of smoking cessation (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.52; I² = 59%; 5 studies, 3079 participants). Other smartphone apps tested differed from the apps included in the analysis, as two used contingency management and one combined text messaging with an app, and so we did not pool them. Using complete case data as opposed to using data from all participants randomised did not substantially alter the findings.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate-certainty evidence that automated text message-based smoking cessation interventions result in greater quit rates than minimal smoking cessation support. There is moderate-certainty evidence of the benefit of text messaging interventions in addition to other smoking cessation support in comparison with that smoking cessation support alone. The evidence comparing smartphone apps with less intensive support was of very low certainty, and more randomised controlled trials are needed to test these interventions.

### Mobile phone text-messaging interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (text2PreventCVD): systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^1167hkUA]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Effects stratified by subgroup analysis

To further assess the impact of text messages, we performed an analysis based on participant characteristics. The moderators assessed were education (< 12 years vs ≥ 12 years), age (< 60 years vs ≥ 60 year) and gender (male vs female). There was no significant variation in the effectiveness of text message intervention by strata (see online supplementary table S3).

Study quality

We assessed the study quality as per Cochrane guidelines(see online supplementary table S4). All studies described a randomisation sequence generation technique that was at low risk of bias except one that had an unclear risk of bias. Three studies did not report allocation concealment and were categorised as unclear allocation concealment. Blinding of study participants was not possible due to the nature of intervention for any of the studies. Blinding of outcome assessments was not clearly described in four studies. Six studies were reported to have low incomplete outcome data, one with unclear outcome dataand one with high incomplete outcome data. All studies scored low in selective reporting and other bias, while only one study had unclear other bias. Overall, 7 (78%) studies were thought to be of high quality with a maximum of one unclear assessment. Publication bias could not be assessed as the number of trials was few.

Text message acceptability

Participant feedback on text-message acceptability was reported in seven studies(see online supplementary table S2). Most studies reported moderate to high levels of satisfaction with the text-messaging programme. Participants acknowledged text-message support as a useful and expressed desire to programme continuation. In one study, participants were willing to pay a small fee to receive the text-messaging programme. In one study, a small fraction (3%) of the participants felt that the messages were disturbing.

### Impact and efficacy of mobile health intervention in the management of diabetes and hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1116m6vz]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

Despite the growing interest regarding the implementation of various mHealth technologies, the long-term effects of such interventions remain unknown and will need to be tested in a more representative population over a longer time period.

### Can health information through mobile phones close the divide in health behaviours among the marginalised? An equity analysis of kilkari in madhya pradesh, India [^115DgZdB]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

By necessity, 'direct to beneficiary' mobile health communication programmes target those with phone access and will thus exclude the poorest and most marginalised. Even among those with access to phones, there is inequity among those who can be reached by mobile health interventions, while changes in health behaviours will vary depending on the subgroups exposed, and the type of health behaviour. In the case of Kilkari, women who did not have access to phones or were not registered in government tracking databases were not subscribed to the intervention. Unless the gender gap in mobile phone access is addressed, inequities in the population coverage and reach of Kilkari will persist. Among those enrolled in Kilkari, the programme's call retry algorithm bolstered efforts to reach the most marginalised but, overall cumulative exposure to content was still lower among the poorest, least educated and the most disadvantaged castes. Research indicates that exposure to Kilkari has helped improve levels of some but not all health behaviours across marginalised groups. Education appears to be a key enabler to help improve health behaviours among those exposed to Kilkari content. The study findings also highlight the need for programmes to understand their differential effects on equity through rigorous evaluative methodologies.

### Mobile phone use and risk of acoustic neuroma: results of the interphone case-control study in five north European countries [^114PLYU7]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

There is public concern that use of mobile phones could increase the risk of brain tumours. If such an effect exists, acoustic neuroma would be of particular concern because of the proximity of the acoustic nerve to the handset. We conducted, to a shared protocol, six population-based case-control studies in four Nordic countries and the UK to assess the risk of acoustic neuroma in relation to mobile phone use. Data were collected by personal interview from 678 cases of acoustic neuroma and 3553 controls. The risk of acoustic neuroma in relation to regular mobile phone use in the pooled data set was not raised (odds ratio (OR) = 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7–1.1). There was no association of risk with duration of use, lifetime cumulative hours of use or number of calls, for phone use overall or for analogue or digital phones separately. Risk of a tumour on the same side of the head as reported phone use was raised for use for 10 years or longer (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1–3.1). The study suggests that there is no substantial risk of acoustic neuroma in the first decade after starting mobile phone use. However, an increase in risk after longer term use or after a longer lag period could not be ruled out.

### Targeted client communication via mobile devices for improving maternal, neonatal, and child health [^112EHy8b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

We decided whether to meta‐analyse data based on whether the included trials were similar enough in terms of participants, settings, intervention, comparison, and outcome measures to ensure meaningful conclusions from a statistically pooled result.

For studies which measured the same outcome at different time points, we extracted the outcome measured at the longest follow‐up time point. We had planned to categorise lengths of follow‐up as follows: short‐term follow‐up: less than three months; moderate‐term follow‐up: three to 12 months; long‐term follow‐up: more than 12 months. However, given the limited number of studies with the same aim, comparison, and outcome measure that could be pooled, we decided to pool outcomes across different lengths of follow‐up.

Due to the anticipated variability in the interventions of included studies, we used random‐effects models for meta‐analysis. The primary meta‐analyses included all studies regardless of their score on the risk of bias assessment.

For continuous outcomes, we calculated MDs with 95% CIs. If more than one study measured the same continuous outcome using different tools, we calculated the SMD and 95% CI using the inverse variance method in Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2014). We calculated RR or OR with 95% Cl for dichotomous outcomes. For cluster‐RCTs that presented adjusted effect estimates (e.g. OR, RR), we combined these estimates with using generic inverse variance random‐effects (Higgins 2011).

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses for the objectively measured outcomes of health status:

income region (by World Bank income group: lower income, lower‐middle income, upper‐middle income, high income) (World Bank 2017);
delivery mechanisms (i.e. mobile phone messaging only, mobile apps only, combined mobile phone messaging and apps, combined apps and other).

However, there was an insufficient number of studies reporting the same health status outcomes to conduct these subgroup analyses.

### A new method to determine laterality of mobile telephone use in adolescents [^1137yQpT]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

As more children use mobile (cellular) telephones, public anxiety grows about the possible adverse health effects of radiofrequency (RF) exposure upon developing nervous systems. Most epidemiological studies investigating the health effects of mobile telephones have relied on self-reports from questionnaires. While there are some validation studies investigating the accuracy of self-reported mobile phone use in adults and adolescents, self-reported laterality of use has not been validated at any age. Although this study mainly sought to validate the accuracy of self-reported laterality of mobile telephone use in adolescents, investigation also covered number and duration of calls.

Methods

We monitored 455 calls in 30 students, mean age (SD) 14 (0.4) years. For 1 week, participants used hardware modified phones (HMPs) which logged dosimetric parameters such as laterality (side of head), date, number and duration of calls. These 'gold standard' measurements were compared with questionnaire self-reported laterality and estimated typical weekly phone use.

Results

Agreement between HMPs and self-reported laterality was modest (kappa = 0.3, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.6). Concordance between HMP measured and self-reported number of calls was fair (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.38, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.69), but poor for duration (ICC = 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.37) with wide limits of agreement for both.

Conclusions

These results suggest that adolescent self-reported laterality was of limited validity. Adolescent self-reported phone use by number and duration of calls was generally inaccurate but comparable to recent adult studies. Epidemiological studies of mobile phone use based on self-reported information may underestimate true associations with health effects.

### Use of mobile phones and risk of brain tumours: update of Danish cohort study [^11766h62]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and outlook

In conclusion, in this update of a nationwide study of mobile phone subscribers in Denmark we found no indication of an increased risk of tumours of the central nervous system. The extended follow-up allowed us to investigate effects in people who had used mobile phones for 10 years or more, and this long term use was not associated with higher risks of cancer. Furthermore, we found no increased risk in temporal glioma, which would be the most plausible tumour location if mobile phone use was a risk. As a small to moderate increase in risk for subgroups of heavy users or after even longer induction periods than 10–15 years cannot be ruled out, however, further studies with large study populations, where the potential for misclassification of exposure and selection bias is minimised, are warranted.

### Birth and death notification via mobile devices: a mixed methods systematic review [^116spfni]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

We identified only one study, focusing on birth notification, which met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in relation to the review's primary objective. Based on this study, we are uncertain about the impacts of birth notification via mobile devices as the certainty of the evidence is very low. No studies evaluating the effectiveness of death notification via mobile devices were eligible for inclusion in the review.

In relation to the review's secondary objectives, we identified a number of studies that helped us summarise factors that could influence the implementation of birth and death notification via mobile devices. These studies showed that a wide range of factors appear to influence the implementation of this approach, including issues tied to the health system and the notification system, the person responsible for notifying, the community, and the families involved.

All 21 studies of birth or death notification via mobile phones were from low‐ or middle‐income countries. This can probably be explained by the use of more robust health information and civil registration and vital statistics systems in high‐income countries, making it unnecessary to use mobile phones for birth and death notification.

Description of interventions

We found significant heterogeneity in the implementation of birth and death notification via mobile devices. Most studies used lay health workers, community informants, healthcare organisations, or families/individuals as notifiers of birth and death. The emphasis, in many cases, was on the use of simple technologies (e.g. basic phones, SMS or voice‐based notification), although we found examples of smartphone app‐based data collection for birth and death notification.

### Mobile phones improve antenatal care attendance in zanzibar: a cluster randomized controlled trial [^115MYfGy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Our findings are in line with the recent reviews concluding that there is moderate evidence that mobile phone text message reminders for health care appointments are more effective than no reminders and that text messaging can result in positive health behavior change. In 2013 Free et. al. assessed the effectiveness of mobile technology interventions delivered to health care consumers and found that text messaging interventions increased adherence to ART and smoking cessation and stated that high quality adequately powered trials are required to eveluate effects of objective outcomes. The most robust evidence is on the effectiveness of Short Message Service reminders increasing attendance to health care services. Two recent reviews found that SMS reminders increase the likelihood of attending clinic appointments. These reviews however included only a limited number of randomized controlled trials and all were from high and middle income countries. Hence, external validity for the developing world is limited. There is an increasing number of mHealth pilot projects in low-income countries, most of which have a disease specific focus on HIV/AIDS. The 2012 Lancet report of technologies for global health identified only nine randomised controlled trials for mHealth in low-income countries and the evidence for effectiveness remains weak. Within the use of mobile phones to improve reproductive health studies primarily indicate potential to expediting emergency obstetric referrals and improve knowledge and awareness. Our study has produced evidence of increased skilled delivery attendance amongst urban women benefiting from the wired mothers intervention (OR, 5.73; 95% CI, 1.51–21.81). Most of the women in our study felt that the intervention influenced their health seeking behavior and satisfaction with the service which is in line with other studies finding mobile phone applications for reproductive health well accepted by women and health workers. Further studies of interventions similar to ours are currently taking place in Ghana, for instance, and the evidence base is growing fast.

### Mobile phones improve antenatal care attendance in zanzibar: a cluster randomized controlled trial [^114ekvfT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The wired mothers' mobile phone intervention significantly increased the proportion of women receiving the recommended four antenatal care visits during pregnancy and there was a trend towards more women receiving preventive health services, more women attending antenatal care late in pregnancy and more women with antepartum complications identified and referred. Overall there is limited evidence on the effects of mobile phone text message reminders for appointment attendance and further high-quality research is required to draw more robust conclusions, particularly for developing countries within the field of sexual and reproductive health. This study is a contribution towards evidence-based approaches to make pregnancy and childbirth a safe event for both mother and child, and towards the achievement of the MDG 5 target indicator of antenatal care attendance.

### Delivery arrangements for health systems in low-income countries: an overview of systematic reviews [^115EZ8TA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Information and communication technology

E‐health

Mobile phone messaging for long‐term illnesses

A review that compared mobile phone messaging for patients with long‐term illnesses with usual care found that such messaging probably leads to little or no difference in people's knowledge about their diabetes, in adherence to diabetes medication in young people with diabetes, or in care plan adherence in people with asthma (moderate‐certainty evidence). Mobile phone messaging support for people living with diabetes probably leads to little or no difference in glycaemic control (moderate‐certainty evidence) and may lead to little or no difference in diabetes complications (low‐certainty evidence) (De Jongh 2012).

Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments

The effects of mobile phone messaging for attendance at healthcare appointments, compared to various other interventions, was assessed in one review (Gurol‐Urganci 2013). This found that mobile phone text message reminders probably lead to little or no difference in attendance at healthcare appointments compared to phone call reminders. However, the cost per text message and per attendance may be lower compared to the cost of mobile phone call reminders.

Delivery arrangements with undesirable effects

We did not find any delivery arrangements for which there was moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence of at least one outcome with an undesirable effect and no moderate‐ or high‐certainty evidence of desirable effects. However, only five reviews reported adverse effects (Dudley 2011; Martínez‐González 2014; Ngo 2013; Parker 2013; Wilson 2011), and one review did not find any studies reporting adverse effects (Van Lonkhuijzen 2012). Wilson 2011 reported undesirable effects on patient outcomes, and Dudley 2011 on access, coverage or utilisation, both with low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence. Dudley 2011 also found that integrating STI services into routine primary healthcare may decrease women's utilisation of these services and their attendance following referral (low certainty of the evidence). Ngo 2013 reported that using midlevel health professionals rather than doctors for abortion care with surgical aspiration probably leads to slightly more complications when compared to doctors (moderate‐certainty evidence).

Delivery arrangements with uncertain effects

For the following delivery arrangements, the certainty of the evidence was low or very low (or no studies were found) for all outcomes examined.

### Mobile phone base stations and adverse health effects: phase 1 of a population-based, cross-sectional study in Germany [^114X8raV]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this first phase of a cross-sectional study from Germany was to investigate whether proximity of residence to mobile phone base stations as well as risk perception is associated with health complaints.

Methods

The researchers conducted a population-based, multi-phase, cross-sectional study within the context of a large panel survey regularly carried out by a private research institute in Germany. In the initial phase, reported on in this paper, 30,047 persons from a total of 51,444 who took part in the nationwide survey also answered questions on how mobile phone base stations affected their health. A list of 38 health complaints was used. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify predictors of health complaints including proximity of residence to mobile phone base stations and risk perception.

Results

Of the 30,047 participants (response rate 58.6%), 18.7% of participants were concerned about adverse health effects of mobile phone base stations, while an additional 10.3% attributed their personal adverse health effects to the exposure from them. Participants who were concerned about or attributed adverse health effects to mobile phone base stations and those living in the vicinity of a mobile phone base station (500 m) reported slightly more health complaints than others.

Conclusions

A substantial proportion of the German population is concerned about adverse health effects caused by exposure from mobile phone base stations. The observed slightly higher prevalence of health complaints near base stations can not however be fully explained by attributions or concerns.

### Targeted client communication via mobile devices for improving maternal, neonatal, and child health [^116Sq7VU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Mobile device‐based interventions are of particular interest given their low‐cost and potential for widespread delivery, however, the current evidence base supporting their implementation for the improvement of maternal, newborn, and child health is limited. The most recent reviews concerned with the effectiveness of mobile device‐based interventions for maternal, newborn, or child health have been limited to studies conducted in low/middle‐income countries and have included non‐randomised controlled trials, which are prone to bias (Lee 2016). Broader reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of digital health interventions for healthcare consumers (e.g. Free 2013a) are in need of updating to consider the more recent emerging evidence in this field. Other reviews of relevance, concerned with preventive healthcare, reminders for appointment attendance, and self‐management of long‐term illnesses have focused specifically on SMS (short message service) and MMS (multimedia message service) mobile phone messaging (de Jongh 2012; Gurol‐Urganci 2013; Vodopivec‐Jamsek 2012), thereby excluding other phone‐based delivery mechanisms, such as voice calls, Interactive Voice Response (IVR), and mobile application delivered instant messages.

This review is one of two linked systematic reviews which were carried out to directly inform WHO guidelines on digital interventions for health system strengthening (WHO 2019). This review focuses on the effectiveness of TCC via mobile devices for maternal, newborn, and child health, and the other review examines the effectiveness of TCC via mobile devices for sexual and reproductive health (Palmer in preparation). Although the potential for mobile and digital technologies is acknowledged, there remains considerable demand from ministries of health, donors, and decision‐makers for evidence‐based guidance on the value of digital tools for improving health. In response to this global need for government decision‐makers, the WHO has developed a guideline on digital interventions for health system strengthening to inform government‐led investments. In combination, the current review, and the linked review focusing on sexual and reproductive health (Palmer in preparation) complement a qualitative evidence synthesis on the use of TCC for RMNCAH (Ames 2019); combined, these reviews aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact, acceptability, and implementation considerations for formulating guideline recommendations.

### Mobile applications for prematurity: a systematic review protocol [^111GQc3N]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Background

Premature birth is a global epidemic of significant public health concern. Counselling and education of pregnant women at risk of preterm birth or mothers with premature infants are essential to improve mother and infant health. Mobile applications are an increasingly popular tool among parents to receive health information and education. This study aims to evaluate the usages and the effects of a mobile application designed for premature births in order to improve health outcomes.

Methods

This review will include all studies of different designs which evaluated the use and impact of interventions provided via mobile applications on pregnant women at risk of preterm birth or mothers with premature infants in order to address all health outcomes. A combination of keywords and MeSH(Medical Subject Headings) terms is used in the search strategy. Literature databases including Scopus, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, ProQuest, CINAHL and Cochrane Library will be searched to May 2021. Furthermore, eligible studies will be chosen from the reference list of retrieved papers. Two researchers will independently review the retrieved citations to decide whether they meet the inclusion criteria. Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) V.2018 will be used to assess the quality of studies. Relevant data are collected in a data extraction form and analysed. Results are reported under the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Discussion

This systematic review will recognize and combine evidence about the usages and impact of mobile application interventions on the health improvement of pregnant women at risk of preterm birth or mothers with premature infants.

### A methodologic systematic review of mobile health behavior change randomized trials [^112tdvxF]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Mobile health helps providers offer accessible, affordable, tailored behavior change interventions. However, research assessing mobile health interventions may feature methodologic shortcomings and poor reporting. This review aims to summarize the characteristics, methods, and intervention reporting of RCTs evaluating mobile health behavior change interventions.

Evidence Acquisition

This was a methodologic systematic review of RCTs assessing mobile health behavior change interventions published in PubMed from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2018, in journals with the upper half of Impact Factors (Clarivate Analytics). Three reviewers independently extracted sample characteristics. Primary outcomes were classified as patient-important or not using definitions from the literature. Any non-patient-important outcomes were then reclassified by a panel of 3 patients. Intervention reporting was assessed by the mobile health Evidence Reporting and Assessment checklist. Data were analyzed in December 2018.

Evidence Synthesis

Most of the 231 included RCTs assessed text messaging (51%) or smartphone app (28%) interventions aiming to change nutrition and physical activity (36%) or treatment adherence (25%). Only 8% of RCTs had a patient-important primary outcome, follow-up of ≥ 6 months, and intent-to-treat analysis. Most primary outcomes were behavioral measures (60%). Follow-up was < 3 months in 29% of RCTs. Regarding reporting, 12 of the 16 checklist items were reported in less than half of RCTs (e.g., usability/content testing, 32%; data security, 13%).

Conclusions

Reports of RCTs assessing mobile health behavior change interventions lack information that would be useful for providers, including reporting of long-term intervention impact on patient-important primary outcomes and information needed for intervention replicability.

### Mobile phone use, exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic field, and brain tumour: a case-control study [^113bEpxd]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Four studies from the INTERPHONE study showed no increased overall risk of glioma or meningioma in relation to regular mobile phone use, although glioma risk increased non-significantly (OR = 2.20; 95% CI: 0.94–5.11) among long-term users (10 years or more), but no excess risk was found for temporal lobe tumours, considered to be exposed to the highest radio frequency (RF)–EMF. In a Swedish study, the OR for glioma on the same side as mobile phone use increased to 1.8 (95% CI: 0.8–3.9) among long-term (⩾10 years) mobile phone users, but the corresponding OR for glioma on the opposite side was found to decrease to 0.6 (95% CI: 0.3–1.4) among long-term users. In a UK study, the OR for glioma on the same side as mobile phone use was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.02–1.52), but for gliomas on the opposite side, it decreased significantly to 0.75 (95% CI: 0.61–0.93). In both studies, it was suggested that such 'complementary risks' above and below unity could reflect recall bias, in which glioma patients tended to recall that they used mobile phones on the same side as the tumour location simply because they knew where the tumour was. In summary, the findings to date on mobile phone use and glioma and meningioma risks are inconsistent.

Most studies of the non-thermal effects of RF–EMF indicate no direct DNA effects such as mutagenicity or genotoxicity of RF–EMF exposure in the range of 800–1900 MHz and an SAR of less than 2 W kg⁻¹. There is also little evidence for indirect DNA effects, including alterations in gene expression, cell proliferation, or apoptosis. Thus, laboratory studies do not support the possibility that mobile phone use increases the risk of brain tumours.

In conclusion, we observed no increase in overall risk of glioma or meningioma in relation to regular mobile phone use among our Japanese subjects.

### Effectivness of specific mobile health applications (mHealth-apps) in gestational diabtetes mellitus: a systematic review [^115MnqFx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and eligibility criteria

We performed a systematic search in Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science Core Collection databases based on the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)" guidelines. The search strategy included the following keywords: "smartphone" OR "mobile phone" OR "cell phone" OR "iOS" OR "android" AND "mobile application" OR "app" AND "gestational diabetes mellitus". For example, the strategy in PubMed was as follows: (("Diabetes, Gestational"[Mesh]) AND ((((("Smartphone"[Mesh]) OR ("Cell Phone"[Mesh])) OR ("mobile phone"[Title/Abstract])) OR (ios [Title/Abstract])) OR (android [Title/Abstract]))) AND ((app [Title/Abstract]) OR ("Mobile Applications"[Mesh])). We manually searched reference lists and Google Scholar to identify further studies.

We included studies that evaluated mHealth-Apps in GDM management compared to usual care (control group), and reported clinical parameters such as glycemic control, pregnancy, birth and neonatal outcomes. We involved peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials and clinical controlled trials. We have filtered the studies by year (January 2008 to November 2020) and by language (German and English). The studies were screened and selected by two independent reviewers. Moreover, we excluded poster, comments, study protocols, duplicates and studies addressing GDM diagnosis and prevention.

After removing duplicates, we scanned the titles and abstracts of the remaining studies, and reviewed the full texts.

Data extraction and analysis

We extracted author, year, design, intervention and control group, sample size, main findings related to the outcomes of interest, and significances. The results were structured by outcomes: glycemic control outcomes (1), pregnancy and birth related outcomes (2), and neonatal outcomes (3).

Risk of bias assessment

Risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool. The tool consists of the following components: selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding, data collection methods, and withdrawals. EPHPP is a validated instrument to assess studies with health-related topics and appropriate for quantitative intervention studies. The tool rates the study quality as strong, moderate or weak.

### Review of the evidence that transcranial electromagnetic treatment will be a safe and effective therapeutic against Alzheimer's disease [^111UktpY]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

The aforementioned studies, and others, have lead prominent health organizations in the U.S. to conclude that there is no clear evidence of adverse health effects associated with radiofrequency fields. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) states that, " The weight of the current scientific evidence has not conclusively linked cell phone use with any adverse health problems. " The FDA states that, "Studies reporting biological changes associated with radiofrequency energy have failed to be replicated and the majority of human epidemiologic studies have failed to show a relationship between RF exposure from cell phones and health problems". The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that scientific research as a whole does not support a statistically significant association between cell phone use and healtheffects.

Cognitive/physiologic studies

Regarding subjective symptoms and cognitive function, Kwon conducted an extensive review of studies evaluating behavioral and neurophysiological effects of cell phone use. They found no evidence that any subjective symptoms (sleeplessness, headache, dizziness, fatigue, etc.) were induced by cell phone use; such symptoms reported in supposed hypersensitive individuals are thus psychosomatic in nature. Moreover, in over 30 published papers (most of which involved GSM 900 phones), Kwon found no evidence that cell phone use resulted in any deleterious effects on cognitive function. Similarly, a meta-analysis performed by Barth et al. involving 17 studies found no significant effects of GSM 900 phone exposure on cognitive abilities, a conclusion echoed by an additional meta-analysis by Valentini involving 24 studies. To date, most controlled human studies reporting no deleterious cognitive effects of 900 MHz cell phone exposure have been "acute", single exposure (3–120 min) studies, with the exception of three studies involving daily exposure for 6–27 days. All of these studies showing no deleterious cognitive effects were exclusively in normal individuals (no AD or other neurologically-diseased subjects) and all of them involved unilateral RF exposure to only one hemisphere via a cell phone held next to the head.

### Targeted client communication via mobile devices for improving sexual and reproductive health [^11741N8s]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Mobile device‐based interventions are of particular interest, given their low cost and potential for widespread delivery. However, the current evidence base supporting their implementation for the improvement of SRH is limited. The most recent reviews concerned with the effectiveness of mobile device‐based interventions for SRH have included non‐randomised studies, which are prone to bias (Badawy 2017). Broader reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of digital health interventions for healthcare consumers (e.g. Free 2013) are in need of updating to consider the more recent emerging evidence in this field. Other reviews of relevance, concerned with preventive healthcare, reminders for appointment attendance, and self‐management of long‐term illnesses have focused specifically on short message service (SMS) and multimedia messaging service (MMS) mobile phone messaging (de Jongh 2012 Gurol‐Urganci 2013; Horvath 2012; Vodopivec‐Jamsek 2012), thereby excluding other phone‐based delivery mechanisms, such as voice calls, Interactive Voice Response (IVR), and mobile application delivered instant messages.

This review is one of two linked systematic reviews that were done to inform WHO Guidelines on digital interventions for health system strengthening (WHO 2019). This review focuses on the effectiveness of TCC delivered via mobile devices for SRH. In relation to 'reproductive health', this review is concerned with family planning. The second review examines the effectiveness of TCC delivered via mobile devices for maternal, new‐born, and child health (Palmer forthcoming). Although the potential for mobile and digital technologies is acknowledged, there remains considerable demand from ministries of health, donors and decision‐makers for evidence‐based guidance on the value of digital tools for improving health. In response to this need, WHO developed a guideline on digital interventions for health system strengthening to inform government‐led investments. In combination, the current review, and the linked review focusing on maternal, newborn, and child health (Palmer forthcoming) complement a qualitative evidence synthesis (Ames 2019) on the use of TCC for SRMNCAH. These reviews together aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the impact, acceptability, and implementation considerations for formulating guideline recommendations.

### Evaluation of immediate and 12-week effects of a smartphone sun-safety mobile application: a randomized clinical trial [^1113z2fA]. JAMA Dermatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Mobile applications on smartphones can communicate a large amount of personalized, real-time health information, including advice on skin cancer prevention, but their effectiveness may be affected by whether recipients can be convinced to use them.

Objective

To evaluate a smartphone mobile application (Solar Cell) delivering real-time advice about sun protection for a second time in a randomized clinical trial.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A previous trial conducted in 2012 used a randomized pretest-posttest design. For the present trial, we collected data from a volunteer sample of 202 adults 18 years or older who owned a smartphone. Participants were recruited nationwide through online promotions. Screening procedures and a 3-week run-in period were added to increase the use of the mobile application. We conducted follow-ups at 3 and 8 weeks after randomization to examine the immediate and the longer-term effects of the intervention.

Interventions

Use of the mobile application. The application gave feedback on sun protection (ie, sun-safety practices and the risk for sunburn) and alerted users to apply or to reapply sunscreen and to get out of the sun. The application also displayed the hourly UV Index and vitamin D production based on the forecast UV Index, time, and location.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Percentage of days with the use of sun protection, time spent outdoors in the midday sun (days and hours), and the number of sunburns in the last 3 months.

Results

Participants in the intervention group used wide-brimmed hats more at 7 weeks than control participants (23.8% vs 17.4%; F = 4.07; p = 0.045). Women who used the mobile application reported using all sun protection combined more than men (46.4% vs 43.3%; F = 1.49; p = 0.04), whereas men and older individuals reported less use of sunscreen (32.7% vs 35.5%; F = 5.36; p = 0.02) and hats (15.6% vs 17.9%; F = 4.72; p = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

The mobile application initially appeared to confer weak improvement of sun protection. Use of the mobile application was greater than in a previous trial and was associated with greater sun protection, especially among women. Strategies to increase the use of the mobile application are needed if the application is to be deployed effectively to the general adult population.

### Health disparities among deaf communities from Colombia: assessing communication, technology and healthcare access [^113ByupQ]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Smartphone use

The findings of this study underscore that technology is a key health indicator that impacts the health outcomes of the Deaf population. Research indicates that smartphones play a crucial role in facilitating communication among the Deaf community. Tailored mobile technologies for the Deaf are indispensable tools, enabling them to seamlessly integrate into society despite their disabilities. Our findings from the NQLS shed light on the relationship between mobile phone ownership, self-perception of health and functional difficulties among Deaf individuals. Surprisingly, the results revealed that owning a mobile phone was associated with better self-perceived health and increased functional difficulties within this population. This unexpected finding underscores the need for further investigation into the nuanced impacts of technology access on health perceptions among individuals with hearing impairments. It prompts critical reflection on the potential disparities in technology usage and its implications for health outcomes, highlighting the importance of addressing such disparities to ensure equitable access to healthcare resources and improve overall well-being within the Deaf community.

The analysis of both HSD and NQLS yields mixed evidence regarding the relationship between mobile phone use and functional difficulties in the Deaf population. HSD results indicate a significant positive correlation between having a phone and fewer difficulties in cognition and walking. Conversely, NQLS findings suggest a positive correlation between mobile phone use and increased functional difficulties across various domains. These contradictory results highlight the complexity of assessing the impact of mobile technology on health and functional abilities in the Deaf community. This inconsistency is not unique to the Deaf population. Research on the hearing population also presents conflicting findings regarding the effects of mobile phone use on mobility and cognition. For example, one study suggests that mobile phone use is associated with a 5% higher female physical mobility. However, another study among college students found a negative association between cell phone use and cardiorespiratory fitness, while yet another study indicates that mobile phone use does not affect mobility in young adults but may have a greater impact on older adults. Similarly, the cognitive effects of smartphones remain debated. While some studies report negative effects on attention and memory, the scientific literature is not yet mature enough to support definitive conclusions. Given these contradictions, our findings underscore the need for further research to better understand the role of mobile technology in shaping functional health outcomes for the Deaf population. Future studies should explore the specific ways in which mobile phone use may influence cognitive and physical function, considering factors such as accessibility, usage patterns and assistive technologies.

### Risk of brain tumours in relation to estimated RF dose from mobile phones: results from five interphone countries [^111AwAMr]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rapid increases in mobile phone use have generated concerns about possible health effects of exposure to radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields. A multinational case–control study, Interphone, aimed to evaluate the association of brain, acoustic nerve and parotid gland tumours with RF exposure from mobile phone use. Most epidemiological studies, including Interphone, have only reported risk in relation to mobile phone use history.

The relationship between RF energy absorbed at the tumour location and mobile phone use history is complex. In addition to amount of use, it depends on phone type, network properties, conditions of use and tumour location. Thus, Interphone attempted a systematic and detailed evaluation and quantification of factors thought to influence RF dose from mobile phones in different brain locations. This necessitated identification of probable determinants of RF Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) during protocol development and questionnaire design and collection and analysis of information to evaluate the importance of each factor. An algorithm was developed to evaluate total RF dose absorbed at specific locations in the brainand applied to Interphone study subjects in five countries to estimate RF dose at the tumour location. This paper presents the results of analysis of associations of glioma and meningioma risk with these dose estimates.

### Cellular phone use and brain tumor: a meta-analysis [^1164rYJq]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The dramatic increase in the use of cellular phones has generated concerns about potential adverse effects, especially the development of brain tumors. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effect of cellular phone use on the risk of brain tumor development.

Methods

We searched the literature using MEDLINE to locate case-control studies on cellular phone use and brain tumors. Odds ratios (ORs) for overall effect and stratified ORs associated with specific brain tumors, long-term use, and analog/digital phones were calculated for each study using its original data. A pooled estimator of each OR was then calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

Nine case-control studies containing 5,259 cases of primary brain tumors and 12,074 controls were included. All studies reported ORs according to brain tumor subtypes, and five provided ORs on patients with ≥ 10 years of follow up. Pooled analysis showed an overall OR of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81–0.99) for cellular phone use and brain tumor development. The pooled OR for long-term users of ≥ 10 years (5 studies) was 1.25 (95% CI 1.01–1.54). No increased risk was observed in analog or digital cellular phone users.

Conclusions

We found no overall increased risk of brain tumors among cellular phone users. The potential elevated risk of brain tumors after long-term cellular phone use awaits confirmation by future studies.

### Scientific evidence for cell phone safety… [^117HpGyF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The FDA's doctors, scientists and engineers continually monitor the scientific studies and public health data for evidence that radio frequency energy from cell phones could cause adverse health effects. If a credible risk is detected, the FDA will work closely with other federal partners to mitigate the risk. The gold standard for the assessment of risk to public health remains the data and information that is available from studying effects on humans. The currently available epidemiological studies, public health surveillance data, and supportive laboratory studies on cell phone radiation provide abundant evidence to support the FDA's determination. Epidemiological Studies and Public Health Surveillance Data As part of ongoing monitoring activities, the FDA analyzes published epidemiological studies for specific outcomes including brain and other tumors as well as for any evidence of other adverse events. No clear and consistent pattern has emerged from epidemiological studies.

Based on the evaluation of the currently available information, the FDA believes that the weight of the scientific evidence does not support an increase in health risks from radio frequency exposure from cell phone use at or below the radio frequency exposure limits set by the FCC. in brain and other nervous tissue cancer rates. decrease In Vivo Scientific Studies Published in vivo studies have yielded no clear evidence that radio frequency energy exposure at levels experienced by the public from cell phone use leads to tumorigenesis. In vivo animal studies assessing possible adverse or other effects of radio frequency energy are extremely challenging studies to design and undertake due to numerous confounding factors. The methodological flaws and weaknesses in many radio frequency energy exposure studies include:

- Exposed rats than the control group rats.

lived longer The design did not reflect the partial-body radio frequency exposure people receive from cell phone use and as noted by the NTP in their February 2018 press release: "The levels and duration of exposure to RFR were much greater than what people experience with even the highest level of cell phone use and exposed the rodents' whole bodies. So, these findings should not be directly extrapolated to human cell phone usage". In the monograph, the IARC committee stated that, "Time trends in cancer of the brain have not shown evidence of a trend that would indicate a promptly acting and powerful carcinogenic effect of mobile-phone use. " There are several more time trend papers that have been published since the 2013 IARC monograph. These newer time trend studies further demonstrate that while use of cell phones has risen rapidly, the incidence of brain cancer has not risen.

### Cell phones and cancer risk fact sheet-NCI… [^114P3qd2]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

What the study showed: Most published analyses from this study have shown no increases overall in brain or other central nervous system cancers related to higher amounts of cell phone use. One analysis showed a statistically significant, although small, increase in the risk of glioma among study participants who spent the most total time on cell phone calls. However, for a variety of reasons the researchers considered this finding inconclusive. Danish Cohort Study How the study was done: This cohort study linked billing information from more than 358, 000 cell phone subscribers with brain tumor incidence data from the Danish Cancer Registry. What the study showed: No association was observed between cell phone use and the incidence of glioma, meningioma, or acoustic neuroma, even among people who had been cell phone subscribers for 13 or more years.

Million Women Cohort Study How the study was done: This prospective cohort study conducted in the United Kingdom used data obtained from questionnaires that were completed by study participants. What the study showed: Self-reported cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of glioma, meningioma, or non-central nervous system tumors. Although the original published findings reported an association with an increased risk of acoustic neuroma, it was not observed with additional years of follow-up of the cohort. What the study showed: Among 264, 574 participants with a median follow-up of just over 7 years, the cumulative amount of mobile phone call-time was not associated with the risk of developing glioma, meningioma, or acoustic neuroma. No associations with cancer risk were seen in the heaviest mobile phone users or among among those with the longest history of mobile phone use.
- A population-based case–control study conducted in Connecticut found no association between cell phone use and the risk of thyroid cancer. What are the findings from studies of the human body. Researchers have carried out several kinds of studies to investigate possible effects of cell phone use on the human body. In 2011, two small studies were published that examined brain glucose metabolism in people after they had used cell phones. The results were inconsistent. One study showed increased glucose metabolism in the region of the brain close to the antenna compared with tissues on the opposite side of the brain; the other study found reduced glucose metabolism on the side of the brain where the phone was used.

### Do cell phones pose a health hazard? [^115nhZwo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Some people are concerned that radio frequency energy from cell phones will cause cancer or other serious health hazards. Based on the evaluation of the currently available information, the FDA believes that the weight of scientific evidence has not linked exposure to radio frequency energy from cell phone use with any health problems at or below the radio frequency exposure limits set by the FCC. Key points:

- Cell phones emit low levels of radio frequency energy, a type of non-ionizing radiation.
- The available scientific data on exposure to radio frequency energy show no categorical proof of any adverse biological effects other than tissue heating.
- Public health data show no association between exposure to radio frequency energy from cell phone use and health problems. Cell Phones and Radio Frequency Energy Cell phones emit low levels of non-ionizing radiation when in use. The type of radiation emitted by cell phones is also referred to as radio frequency energy.

As stated by the National Cancer Institute, "there is currently no consistent evidence that non-ionizing radiation increases cancer risk in humans. The only consistently recognized biological effect of radiofrequency radiation in humans is heating. " See Radio Frequency Energy and Cell Phones for the basics on radio frequency energy and non-ionizing radiation. Scientific Consensus on Cell Phone Safety Scientific studies: The FDA's physicians, scientists, and engineers regularly analyze scientific studies and publications for evidence of health effects of exposure to radio frequency energy from cell phones. The weight of nearly 30 years of scientific evidence has not linked exposure to radio frequency energy from use of cell phones to health problems, such as cancer. Public health data: The FDA also monitors and analyzes public health data on cancer rates in the U. S. population.

The data clearly demonstrate no widespread rise in brain and other nervous system cancers in the last 30 years despite the enormous increase in cell phone use during this period. In fact, the rate of brain and other nervous system cancers diagnosed in United States has decreased for the last 15 years or so. on Radio Frequency Fields Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, European Union: Final opinion on potential health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields International Agency for Research on Cancer: Non-ionizing Radiation, Part 2: Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields National Toxicology Program: Cell Phone Radio Frequency Radiation See Scientific Evidence for Cell Phone Safety for more details.

### Children and teens and cell phones… [^111n4E2F]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Current scientific evidence does not show a danger to any users of cell phones from radio frequency energy, including children and teenagers. There are also simple steps that anyone, including children and teenagers, can take if they would like to reduce RF exposure.
- Reduce the amount of time spent using the cell phone.
- Use speaker mode, head phones, or ear buds to place more distance between the head and the cell phone.
- Avoid making calls when the signal is weak as this causes cell phones to boost RF transmission power.
- Consider texting rather than talking — but don't text while driving. A large epidemiological study of the effects of cell phones in young adults aged between 10 and 24 was completed across 14 countries in Europe.

The case-controlled study was conducted "to evaluate whether wireless phone use and extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields) increases risk of brain tumours in young people". The subjects were between age 10 and 24 and the vast majority were described as regular cell phone users. The study concluded that there was no evidence of a link between cell phone use and brain tumors in young people.
