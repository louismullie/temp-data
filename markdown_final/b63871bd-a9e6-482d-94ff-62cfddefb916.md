## Question

how about a steroid inhaler for the same situation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether increasing the dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) at the first sign of an asthma exacerbation reduces the need for rescue oral corticosteroids or hospitalization, and how this compares with other strategies like as-needed ICS-formoterol or systemic steroids in acute care settings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the exact intervention being evaluated. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence comparing increased versus stable ICS doses for home management. Next, I will review guideline positions and reconcile any apparent discrepancies. After that, I should examine alternative strategies such as as-needed ICS-formoterol and ED-based high-dose ICS. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight safety considerations and uncertainties that might change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and intervention. The question centers on patients with persistent asthma who are already on maintenance ICS and experience a worsening of symptoms at home; the proposed action is to temporarily increase the ICS dose as part of a self-managed action plan to prevent progression and avoid oral corticosteroids or emergency care, which is distinct from ED-based therapy or as-needed ICS-only strategies in patients not on controllers [^115mUwa7].

> Now, I should verify the best available evidence. The 2022 Cochrane review of nine randomized trials including 1,774 participants found that increasing the ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation did not significantly reduce the odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids compared with keeping the dose stable (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76–1.25; moderate-quality evidence), and results were similar in the subset who actually initiated the study inhaler, with no clear benefit on unscheduled care or duration of exacerbation; importantly, point estimates for adverse events favored keeping the dose stable, though confidence intervals were wide and imprecise [^115mUwa7] [^115z1egX].

> Wait, let me verify whether larger fold-increases or earlier initiation might have helped. The Cochrane authors conducted subgroup analyses by age, timing, baseline dose, smoking, and fold increase and still found no statistically significant benefit, and they explicitly note that the included trials reflect evolving practice but do not support a benefit from simply increasing ICS dose during home-managed exacerbations; this aligns with earlier iterations of the same review and with a practice parameter noting that doubling ICS has repeatedly failed to show benefit, whereas quadrupling has shown signals in some studies but remains controversial and not consistently reproducible [^115mUwa7] [^115z1egX] [^111o8dnF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about guidelines. I initially thought GINA might endorse increasing ICS dose for home exacerbations, but wait, I should double-check the current recommendations. GINA 2024 emphasizes written action plans and timely escalation, including oral corticosteroids for moderate–severe exacerbations, and it supports as-needed ICS-formoterol strategies to reduce severe exacerbations; it does not recommend routine ICS dose escalation for home management of exacerbations in patients already on maintenance ICS, and it highlights that evidence for high-dose ICS in the ED is strongest when systemic steroids are not given, which is a different context than home dose escalation [^115qmiYJ] [^115vEybj].

> Next, I should review alternative strategies that do show benefit. As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol (single maintenance and reliever therapy, SMART/MART) reduces severe exacerbations and oral steroid use compared with SABA-only regimens and performs at least as well as daily ICS in mild asthma, with the advantage of delivering anti-inflammatory therapy precisely when symptoms flare; this is mechanistically and pragmatically distinct from simply increasing maintenance ICS dose during worsening symptoms and is supported by multiple RCTs and meta-analyses as well as contemporary guidelines [^115qmiYJ] [^1148QtHg] [^117HXHUH].

> I will now examine the acute care setting, because the role of ICS there differs. In the ED, high-dose ICS given early can reduce hospitalizations, particularly in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids, but when systemic steroids are already given, the incremental benefit of add-on ICS is uncertain and conflicting; importantly, this ED signal does not translate into a recommendation to escalate maintenance ICS at home for exacerbation prevention, and guidelines still prioritize systemic corticosteroids for moderate–severe exacerbations with structured follow-up and ICS optimization after discharge [^115vEybj] [^111MAa9d] [^1117x8e1].

> Let me consider safety and practical issues. Increasing ICS dose transiently is generally safe, but local adverse effects like dysphonia and oropharyngeal candida increase with higher doses, and systemic effects, while uncommon with short courses, can occur with very high cumulative exposure; moreover, the Cochrane review's adverse event point estimates favored keeping the dose stable, reinforcing that escalation is not risk-free and may not be justified without proven benefit in this setting [^115J25Eu] [^115mUwa7].

> But wait, what if the patient is on very low-dose ICS or has a specific phenotype. The Cochrane evidence base largely reflects mild to moderate asthma on maintenance ICS, and subgroup signals for very large fold-increases or specific triggers like viral infections remain hypothesis-generating rather than definitive; until stronger, consistent data emerge, individualized decisions should be cautious, with close follow-up and attention to adherence and inhaler technique rather than reflex dose escalation during home exacerbations [^115mUwa7] [^112gXV5Y].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I should confirm the bottom line. For patients with persistent asthma already on maintenance ICS who develop worsening symptoms at home, increasing the ICS dose has not been shown to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids or unscheduled care in high-quality randomized trials, whereas as-needed ICS-formoterol strategies and timely systemic corticosteroids for more severe exacerbations have supportive evidence and guideline endorsement; therefore, prioritize action plans that include appropriate reliever therapy, early oral steroids when indicated, and optimization of controller therapy after the episode, reserving ICS dose escalation for selected scenarios with explicit monitoring and shared decision-making [^115mUwa7] [^115qmiYJ].

A steroid inhaler (ICS) is **not sufficient alone** for acute asthma exacerbations because it does not provide rapid bronchodilation or immediate symptom relief [^114wujcb]. ICS are for long-term control and should be continued or started during exacerbations, but **systemic corticosteroids are required** for moderate-to-severe attacks to reduce relapse and hospitalization risk [^1117x8e1] [^11765Qen]. In mild exacerbations, **as-needed ICS-formoterol** can reduce severe events and oral steroid use, but it is not a substitute for systemic steroids when symptoms are moderate or severe [^115qmiYJ] [^1148QtHg]. Always use SABA for rapid relief and follow a written action plan with early medical review if symptoms persist [^1164RQb6].

---

## Pharmacological properties of steroid inhalers

Steroid inhalers deliver corticosteroids directly to the airways, **reducing airway inflammation** and hyperresponsiveness. They are primarily used for long-term control of persistent asthma and are effective in preventing exacerbations when used regularly [^116VTNaw]. However, their onset of action is relatively slow, typically requiring several days to weeks to achieve optimal therapeutic effect [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence for steroid inhalers in acute asthma exacerbations

Recent clinical evidence and guidelines indicate that steroid inhalers alone are **not sufficient** to manage acute asthma exacerbations effectively. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines emphasize that systemic corticosteroids are essential in the management of moderate-to-severe exacerbations, as they significantly reduce the risk of relapse, hospitalization, and recurrence of symptoms [^1117x8e1] [^11765Qen]. Systemic corticosteroids, administered orally or intravenously, have a rapid onset of action (within 4–6 hours) and are effective in reducing airway inflammation and improving lung function during acute exacerbations [^116KTsTS]. In contrast, steroid inhalers alone **do not provide immediate relief** of acute symptoms and are not recommended as standalone therapy for acute exacerbations [^116YxUPz].

---

## Limitations of steroid inhalers in acute asthma exacerbations

Steroid inhalers have several limitations when used alone in acute asthma exacerbations:

- **Delayed onset of action**: Steroid inhalers require several days to weeks to achieve therapeutic effect, making them unsuitable for immediate relief of acute symptoms [^notfound].

- **Lack of bronchodilation**: Steroid inhalers do not provide rapid bronchodilation, which is essential during acute exacerbations characterized by bronchospasm and airway obstruction [^112aeXjo].

- **Insufficient evidence**: Clinical studies have not demonstrated that steroid inhalers alone are effective in managing acute asthma exacerbations without the concurrent use of systemic corticosteroids [^111MAa9d].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from GINA and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) provide clear recommendations regarding the use of steroid inhalers in acute asthma exacerbations:

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Systemic corticosteroids are recommended for moderate-to-severe exacerbations, as they significantly reduce the risk of relapse, hospitalization, and recurrence of symptoms [^1117x8e1] [^11765Qen].

- **Combination therapy**: Steroid inhalers may be used in combination with systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators to provide additional anti-inflammatory effect and improve long-term control of asthma symptoms [^115vEybj].

- **As-needed ICS-formoterol**: Recent guidelines suggest that as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol may be beneficial in mild asthma exacerbations, reducing the risk of severe exacerbations and oral corticosteroid use. However, this approach is not a substitute for systemic corticosteroids in moderate-to-severe exacerbations [^115qmiYJ] [^116KTsTS].

---

## Clinical scenarios where steroid inhalers may be beneficial

While steroid inhalers alone are not sufficient for acute exacerbations, they may be beneficial in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Mild exacerbations**: In patients with mild asthma exacerbations, as-needed ICS-formoterol may reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and oral corticosteroid use [^115qmiYJ] [^1148QtHg].

- **Maintenance therapy**: Steroid inhalers are essential for long-term control of asthma, reducing the frequency and severity of exacerbations when used regularly [^116VTNaw].

- **Combination therapy**: Steroid inhalers may be used in combination with systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators to provide additional anti-inflammatory effect and improve long-term control of asthma symptoms [^115vEybj].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of steroid inhalers

Steroid inhalers are generally considered safe when used appropriately. Potential risks and side effects include:

- **Local side effects**: Hoarseness, oral thrush, and dysphonia may occur with prolonged use or improper inhaler technique [^115J25Eu].

- **Systemic side effects**: Prolonged use of high-dose steroid inhalers may lead to systemic corticosteroid effects, such as adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, and growth suppression in children [^114n91U1].

- **Increased risk of pneumonia**: Long-term use of high-dose steroid inhalers has been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia, particularly in elderly patients [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Steroid inhalers alone are **not sufficient** to manage acute asthma exacerbations effectively. Systemic corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of treatment for moderate-to-severe exacerbations, as they provide rapid anti-inflammatory effects and significantly reduce the risk of relapse and hospitalization [^1117x8e1] [^11765Qen]. Steroid inhalers may be used in combination with systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators to provide additional anti-inflammatory effect and improve long-term control of asthma symptoms [^115vEybj]. As-needed ICS-formoterol may be beneficial in mild exacerbations, but it is not a substitute for systemic corticosteroids in moderate-to-severe exacerbations [^115qmiYJ] [^1148QtHg].

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115mUwa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^112MC3M8]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### Inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers in the acute treatment of asthma exacerbations [^112DWuMk]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation has a considerable impact on patients' quality of life and constitutes a challenging condition for primary health-care providers. Severe exacerbations are also an important cause of hospital admissions and require high costs. Despite this, a widely accepted definition is still lacking; etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms are still incompletely defined. Although the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene modifiers in preventing mild to moderate asthma exacerbation is well recognized, their role within the context of an asthma action plan in general practice and in home-based early intervention for acute exacerbations is still controversial. Although systemic corticosteroids (CS) are standard care for severe exacerbation in the emergency department's (ED) management of asthma, published evidence suggests that high doses of ICS may be beneficial in the ED. The additive benefit of ICS when used with systemic CS is still debated. Data on leukotriene modifiers in the management of asthma exacerbation are limited. However, therapeutic strategies of this emergency including ICS and leukotriene modifiers seem logical and may be suitable, at least in certain patient groups. The availability of different drugs, active on different targets, can potentially contribute to a better management of asthma exacerbations.

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### "As-needed" inhaled corticosteroids for patients with asthma [^1148QtHg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Prevention of severe asthma exacerbations is a primary management goal for asthma across the severity spectrum. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) decrease the risk of asthma exacerbations, but patient adherence to ICS-containing medications as a daily maintenance therapy is poor, and many patients overuse short-acting beta 2 -agonist relievers; both are associated with increased risk of severe exacerbations and death. Airway inflammation also varies over time, influenced by exposures such as viral infections and allergen. As-needed ICS strategies, in which patients receive ICSs (or additional ICSs, if already taking controller therapy) whenever they take their reliever inhaler, empower patients to adjust their ICS intake in response to symptom fluctuation. These strategies can improve asthma morbidity outcomes, particularly by reducing severe exacerbations and reducing the risk of adverse effects of oral corticosteroids. In this review, the evidence for combination ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler, ICS and short-acting beta 2 -agonists in separate inhalers, and combination ICS-albuterol in a single inhaler is presented, along with practical considerations, evidence gaps, and implications for clinical practice for each strategy, presented by level of asthma severity and age group. Improving access to such strategies on a global scale is imperative to improve asthma outcomes and achieve equity across populations.

### Interventions to improve adherence to inhaled steroids for asthma [^1166zNBb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite its proven efficacy in improving symptoms and reducing exacerbations, many patients with asthma are not fully adherent to their steroid inhaler. Suboptimal adherence leads to poorer clinical outcomes and increased health service utilisation, and has been identified as a contributing factor to a third of asthma deaths in the UK. Reasons for non-adherence vary, and a variety of interventions have been proposed to help people improve treatment adherence.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions intended to improve adherence to inhaled corticosteroids among people with asthma.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent searches on 18 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cluster randomised controlled trials of any duration conducted in any setting. We included studies reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only and unpublished data. We included trials of adults and children with asthma and a current prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (as monotherapy or in combination with a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA)). Eligible trials compared an intervention primarily aimed at improving adherence to ICS versus usual care or an alternative intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the searches, extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included studies and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were adherence to ICS, exacerbations requiring at least oral corticosteroids and asthma control. We graded results and presented evidence in 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios, and continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences, all using a random-effects model. We described skewed data narratively. We made no a priori assumptions about how trials would be categorised but conducted meta-analyses only if treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense.

Main Results

We included 39 parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults and children with asthma, 28 of which (n = 16,303) contributed data to at least one meta-analysis. Follow-up ranged from two months to two years (median six months), and trials were conducted mainly in high-income countries. Most studies reported some measure of adherence to ICS and a variety of other outcomes such as quality of life and asthma control. Studies generally were at low or unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of biases associated with blinding. We considered around half the studies to be at high risk for attrition bias and selective outcome reporting. We classified studies into four comparisons: adherence education versus control (20 studies); electronic trackers or reminders versus control (11 studies); simplified drug regimens versus usual drug regimens (four studies); and school-based directly observed therapy (three studies). Two studies are described separately. All pooled results for adherence education, electronic trackers or reminders and simplified regimens showed better adherence than controls. Analyses limited to studies using objective measures revealed that adherence education showed a benefit of 20 percentage points over control (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.52 to 32.74; five studies; low-quality evidence); electronic trackers or reminders led to better adherence of 19 percentage points (95% CI 14.47 to 25.26; six studies; moderate-quality evidence); and simplified regimens led to better adherence of 4 percentage points (95% CI 1.88 to 6.16; three studies; moderate-quality evidence). Our confidence in the evidence was reduced by risk of bias and inconsistency. Improvements in adherence were not consistently translated into observable benefit for clinical outcomes in our pooled analyses. None of the intervention types showed clear benefit for our primary clinical outcomes - exacerbations requiring an oral corticosteroid (OCS) (evidence of very low to low quality) and asthma control (evidence of low to moderate quality); nor for our secondary outcomes - unscheduled visits (evidence of very low to moderate quality) and quality of life (evidence of low to moderate quality). However, some individual studies reported observed benefits for OCS and use of healthcare services. Most school or work absence data were skewed and were difficult to interpret (evidence of low quality, when graded), and most studies did not specifically measure or report adverse events. Studies investigating the possible benefit of administering ICS at school did not measure adherence, exacerbations requiring OCS, asthma control or adverse events. One study showed fewer unscheduled visits, and another found no differences; data could not be combined.

Authors' Conclusions

Pooled results suggest that a variety of interventions can improve adherence. The clinical relevance of this improvement, highlighted by uncertain and inconsistent impact on clinical outcomes such as quality of life and asthma control, is less clear. We have low to moderate confidence in these findings owing to concerns about risk of bias and inconsistency. Future studies would benefit from predefining an evidence-based 'cut-off' for acceptable adherence and using objective adherence measures and validated tools and questionnaires. When possible, covert monitoring and some form of blinding or active control may help disentangle effects of the intervention from effects of inclusion in an adherence trial.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^115z1egX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations or "attacks" during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans may advocate doubling the dose of inhaled steroids in the early stages of an asthma exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as part of a patient-initiated action plan for home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to March 2016. We handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared increased versus stable doses of ICS for home management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies of children or adults with persistent asthma who were receiving daily maintenance ICS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data. We contacted authors of RCTs for additional information.

Main Results

This review update added three new studies including 419 participants to the review. In total, we identified eight RCTs, most of which were at low risk of bias, involving 1669 participants with mild to moderate asthma. We included three paediatric (n = 422) and five adult (n = 1247) studies; six were parallel-group trials and two had a cross-over design. All but one study followed participants for six months to one year. Allowed maintenance doses of ICS varied in adult and paediatric studies, as did use of concomitant medications and doses of ICS initiated during exacerbations. Investigators gave participants a study inhaler containing additional ICS or placebo to be started as part of an action plan for treatment of exacerbations. The odds of treatment failure, defined as the need for oral corticosteroids, were not significantly reduced among those randomised to increased ICS compared with those taking their usual stable maintenance dose (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.18; participants = 1520; studies = 7). When we analysed only people who actually took their study inhaler for an exacerbation, we found much variation between study results but the evidence did not show a significant benefit of increasing ICS dose (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; participants = 766; studies = 7). The odds of having an unscheduled physician visit (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.41; participants = 931; studies = 3) or acute visit (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.98; participants = 450; studies = 3) were not significantly reduced by an increased versus stable dose of ICS, and evidence was insufficient to permit assessment of impact on the duration of exacerbation; our ability to draw conclusions from these outcomes was limited by the number of studies reporting these events and by the number of events included in the analyses. The odds of serious events (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; participants = 394; studies = 2) and non-serious events, such as oral irritation, headaches and changes in appetite (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; participants = 142; studies = 2), were neither increased nor decreased significantly by increased versus stable doses of ICS during an exacerbation. Too few studies are available to allow firm conclusions on the basis of subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, doses used, smoking history and the fold increase of ICS on the magnitude of effect; yet, effect size appears similar in children and adults.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence does not support increasing the dose of ICS as part of a self initiated action plan to treat exacerbations in adults and children with mild to moderate asthma. Increased ICS dose is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids for the exacerbation, or of having adverse events, compared with a stable ICS dose. Wide confidence intervals for several outcomes mean we cannot rule out possible benefits of this approach.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for the prevention of asthma exacerbations [^116VTNaw]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide an overview of the risk factors and mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbations and the role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in preventing exacerbations.

Data Sources

Queries for asthma exacerbations and ICSs were conducted using PubMed, searching for primary articles and reviews.

Study Selections

Studies written in English, with a focus on well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials.

Results

Asthma exacerbations remain a major source of morbidity, with future exacerbations most likely among patients with previous exacerbations and among those with peripheral blood eosinophilia. Exacerbations are often triggered by viral respiratory tract infections, but recent evidence supports nonviral triggers as well. In terms of exacerbation prevention, several approaches to ICS therapy have been found to be effective, including intermittent high-dose ICS without use of background controller in preschool children with recurrent episodic wheezing, intermittent high-dose ICS without use of background controller in adults with mild asthma, and as-needed ICS dosing whenever rescue treatment is needed among children, adolescents, and adults with mild asthma not receiving daily controller therapy.

Conclusion

ICSs are highly effective in preventing exacerbations of asthma. Multiple dosing strategies have been found to reduce exacerbation risk, allowing for a personalization of approaches based on individual patient phenotypes and preferences.

### Inhaled budesonide in the management of acute worsenings and exacerbations of asthma: a review of the evidence [^113fCEr7]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The use of systemic corticosteroids, together with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy, has become established for the management of acute asthma. These agents are undoubtedly effective, but are also associated with problems such as metabolic adverse effects. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) offer potential benefit in the acute setting because they are delivered directly to the airways. They are also likely to reduce systemic exposure, which would lead in turn to reductions in rates of unwanted systemic effects. In order to evaluate the role of budesonide in the management of acute asthma exacerbations we conducted a review of the literature and critically evaluated the rationale for the use of ICS in general in this setting. Trials in adults and children requiring treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma have shown clinical and/or spirometric benefit for budesonide when delivered via nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or aerosol in the emergency department, hospital and follow-up settings. The efficacy seems to benefit from high doses given repeatedly during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation. These acute effects are likely to be linked to the drug's distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The current evidence base revealed encouraging results regarding the efficacy of the ICS budesonide in patients with wheeze and acute worsening of asthma. Future studies should focus on the efficacy of these agents in more severe asthma worsenings.

### Are inhaled corticosteroids effective for acute exacerbations of asthma in children? [^1148qzha]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

If started early and at high doses, the acute use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) provides modest benefit in patients with mild exacerbations of asthma. In more severe exacerbations, oral corticosteroids are significantly more effective in preventing hospitalizations and improving lung function. We conclude that ICS should not be used routinely to treat acute exacerbations.

### A review of the role of inhaled corticosteroids in the treatment of acute asthma [^111TjPaE]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids (CSs) are generally accepted as treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma. In contrast, inhaled corticosteroids (ICs) have been used for the long-term management of asthma but are not widely accepted for the treatment of asthma exacerbations. The onset of action of ICs in acute asthma begins in 1 hour. In patients with mild to moderate exacerbation, administration of high-dose ICs may decrease the need for hospital admission and the number of symptomatic days.

### Mechanisms and management of asthma exacerbations [^116BXVwX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute asthma remains an important medical emergency, the most frequent cause of acute admissions in children and a major source of morbidity for adults with asthma. In all ages with asthma, the presence of exacerbations is an important defining characteristic of asthma severity. In this review, we assess the epidemiology of acute asthma, the triggers of acute exacerbations, and the mechanisms that underlie these exacerbations. We also assess current treatments that prevent exacerbations, with an emphasis on the role of type 2 airway inflammation in the context of acute exacerbations and the novel treatments that effectively target this. Finally we review current management strategies of the exacerbations themselves.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^116LH4cE]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### Acute asthma exacerbations: management strategies [^115sLYex]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration in baseline symptoms or lung function, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Asthma action plans help patients triage and manage symptoms at home. In patients 12 years and older, home management includes an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol combination for those who are not using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler for maintenance, or a short-acting beta2 agonist for those using an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta2 agonist inhaler that does not include formoterol. In children four to 11 years of age, an inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol inhaler, up to eight puffs daily, can be used to reduce the risk of exacerbations and need for oral corticosteroids. In the office setting, it is important to assess exacerbation severity and begin a short-acting beta2 agonist and oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations, with repeated doses of the short-acting beta2 agonist every 20 minutes for one hour and oral corticosteroids. Patients with severe exacerbations should be transferred to an acute care facility and treated with oxygen, frequent administration of a short-acting beta2 agonist, and corticosteroids. The addition of a short-acting muscarinic antagonist and magnesium sulfate infusion has been associated with fewer hospitalizations. Patients needing admission to the hospital require continued monitoring and systemic therapy similar to treatments used in the emergency department. Improvement in symptoms and forced expiratory volume in one second or peak expiratory flow to 60% to 80% of predicted values helps determine appropriateness for discharge. The addition of inhaled corticosteroids, consideration of stepping up asthma maintenance therapy, close follow-up, and education on asthma action plans are important next steps to prevent future exacerbations.

### Interventions to improve inhaler technique for people with asthma [^111CTPna]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common chronic disease worldwide. Inhalers are often prescribed to help control asthma symptoms, improve quality of life and reduce the risk of exacerbations or flare-ups. However, evidence suggests that many people with asthma do not use their inhaler correctly. It is therefore important to evaluate whether interventions aimed specifically at improving technique are effective and safe, and whether use of these interventions translates into improved clinical outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the impact of interventions to improve inhaler technique on clinical outcomes and safety in adults and children with asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains records compiled from multiple electronic and handsearched resources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent search on 23 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included studies comparing a group of adults or children with asthma receiving an inhaler technique intervention versus a group receiving a control or alternative intervention. We included parallel and cluster-randomised trials of any duration conducted in any setting, and planned to include only the first phase of any cross-over trials identified. We included studies reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the search results for eligible studies. We extracted outcome data, assessed risk of bias in duplicate and resolved discrepancies by involving another review author. We grouped studies making similar comparisons by consensus (e.g. all those comparing enhanced inhaler technique education vs usual care) and conducted meta-analyses only if treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios, and continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences, all with random-effects models. We described skewed data narratively. We graded the results and presented evidence in 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison. Primary outcomes were inhaler technique, asthma control and exacerbations requiring at least oral corticosteroids (OCS).

Main Results

This review includes 29 parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 2210), although not all reported relevant or useable data. All participants had asthma, and follow-up ranged from 2 to 26 weeks. Most studies were at low or unclear risk of selection and attrition biases and at high risk for biases associated with blinding. We considered most of the evidence to be of low quality owing to these biases and to imprecision in the estimates of effect. We classified studies into three comparisons: enhanced face-to-face training session(s), multi-media-delivered inhaler training (e.g. DVD, computer app or game) and technique feedback devices. Differences between interventions, populations and outcome measures limited quantitative analyses, particularly for exacerbations, adverse events, unscheduled visits to a healthcare provider and absenteeism from work or school. Enhanced inhaler technique education and multi-media training improved technique in most studies immediately after the intervention and at follow-up, although the variety of checklists used meant that this was difficult to assess reliably. For both adults and children, how and when inhaler technique was assessed appeared to affect whether inhaler technique improved and by how much. Analyses of the numbers of people who demonstrated correct or 'good enough' technique were generally more useful than checklist scores. Adult studies of enhanced education showed benefit when this metric was used at 2 to 26 weeks' follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83 to 13.65; 258 participants; three studies; 31 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 69 (95% CI 45 to 86) in the education group; moderate-quality evidence). A similar result was seen in studies looking at feedback devices at four weeks' follow-up (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.87 to 12.33; 97 participants; one study; 51 per 100 with correct technique in the control group compared with 83 (95% CI 66 to 93) in the feedback group; low-quality evidence). However, the benefit of multi-media training for adults even immediately after the intervention was uncertain (OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 5.50; 164 participants; two studies; I² = 49%; 30 per 100 in the control group with correct technique compared with 47 (95% CI 26 to 70) in the multi-media group; moderate-quality evidence). Evidence tended to be less clear for children, usually because results were based on fewer and smaller studies. Some studies did not report exacerbations in a way that allowed meta-analysis; others provided inconclusive results. Inhaler technique interventions provided some benefit for asthma control and quality of life but generally did not lead to consistent or important clinical benefits for adults or children. Confidence intervals included no difference or did not reach a threshold that could be considered clinically important. Responder analyses sometimes showed improvement among more people in the intervention groups, even though the mean difference between groups was small. We found no evidence about harms.

Authors' Conclusions

Although interventions to improve inhaler technique may work in some circumstances, the variety of interventions and measurement methods used hampered our ability to perform meta-analyses and led to low to moderate confidence in our findings. Most included studies did not report important improvement in clinical outcomes. Guidelines consistently recommend that clinicians check regularly the inhaler technique of their patients; what is not clear is how clinicians can most effectively intervene if they find a patient's technique to be inadequate, and whether such interventions will have a discernible impact on clinical outcomes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179T5GD]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma — Although there is a strong emphasis on minimizing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use to reduce long-term cumulative adverse effects, OCS are essential in management of acute severe asthma, and the occurrence of any severe exacerbation should be a prompt to assess the patient thoroughly, optimize their asthma treatment, and consider referral for expert advice to reduce the risk of another exacerbation occurring; evidence about use of dexamethasone has been updated based on the latest evidence.

### Long-acting beta (2)-agonists in the management of asthma exacerbations [^116Ly2C4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity in the United States. Although long-acting beta2-agonists have a defined role in maintenance therapy, their potential use in exacerbations remains largely undetermined. This paper reviews recent literature on long-acting beta2-agonists in the context of the management of acute asthma.

Recent Findings

Although clinical experience with long-acting beta2-agonists now approaches 20 years, their applicability in asthma exacerbations has only recently been explored. Formoterol, with a rapid onset of action similar to albuterol, has already been approved in Europe as a reliever medication and there are emerging data to support its use in the outpatient management of mild exacerbations of asthma. Salmeterol added to conventional therapy has been found to be safe and potentially beneficial in patients hospitalized for an exacerbation.

Summary

Long-acting beta2-agonists have proved to be useful in the chronic management of asthma and the prevention of exacerbations. Recent data suggest a role for patient-guided management using adjustable dosing of long-acting beta2-agonists with inhaled corticosteroids during periods of worsening asthma. Further research to evaluate the potential role of long-acting beta2-agonists in the management of acute asthma is needed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1164RQb6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children: an overview of cochrane reviews [^1119mi5A]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management.

Objectives

Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 -agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta 2 -agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.

### Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma [^1144JMme]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma The use of inhaled corticosteroids may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED).

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group register. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched. The search is considered updated to February of 2003.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs or quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented with acute asthma to the ED or its equivalent, and were treated with inhaled corticosteroids or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper.

Main Results

Eight trials were selected for inclusion, but data were not available for one of them. In the seven usable trials, (4 adult, 3 paediatric), a total of 376 patients were studied (191 with inhaled corticosteroids, 185 without). Patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.57). This benefit was evident in the subgroup of patients not receiving concomitant systemic steroids (OR 0.21; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.53). Patients receiving concomitant systemic steroids showed a similar, but non-significant, trend towards reduced admissions compared to placebo treatment (OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.12). Patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids also demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flows (PEFR WMD: 8%; 95% CI: 3, 13%) and forced expiratory volumes (FEV1 WMD: 5%; 95% CI: 0.4, 10%). The treatment was well tolerated, with few reported adverse side effects. A secondary analysis compared inhaled corticosteroids alone vs systemic steroids alone; in the four trials included, there was significant heterogeneity between the study results for admission rates which precluded meaningful pooling of the study results.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Inhaled steroids reduced admission rates in patients with acute asthma, but it is unclear if there is a benefit of inhaled corticosteroids when used in addition to systemic corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence that inhaled corticosteroids result in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence that inhaled corticosteroids alone are as effective as systemic steroids. Further research is needed to clarify if there is a benefit of inhaled corticosteroids when used in addition to systemic steroids.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^113nbzEA]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care clinicians play a key role in asthma and asthma exacerbation management worldwide because most patients with asthma are treated in primary care settings. The high burden of asthma exacerbations persists and important practice gaps remain, despite continual advances in asthma care. Lack of primary care-specific guidance, uncontrolled asthma, incomplete assessment of exacerbation and asthma control history, and reliance on systemic corticosteroids or short-acting beta 2 -agonist-only therapy are challenges clinicians face today with asthma care. Evidence supports the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) + fast-acting bronchodilator treatments when used as needed in response to symptoms to improve asthma control and reduce rates of exacerbations, and the symptoms that occur leading up to an asthma exacerbation provide a window of opportunity to intervene with ICS. Incorporating patient perspectives and preferences when designing asthma regimens will help patients be more engaged in their therapy and may contribute to improved adherence and outcomes. This expert consensus contains 10 Best Practice Advice Points from a panel of primary care clinicians and a patient representative, formed in collaboration with the International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG), a clinically led charitable organization that works locally and globally in primary care to improve respiratory health. The panel met virtually and developed a series of best practice statements, which were drafted and subsequently voted on to obtain consensus. Primary care clinicians globally are encouraged to review and adapt these best practice advice points on preventing and managing asthma exacerbations to their local practice patterns to enhance asthma care within their practice.

### Asthma self-management: It's not one size fits all [^115K8pkL]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Asthma exacerbations are a significant cause of health care use and mortality. Home management strategies may be effective in managing many exacerbations before presentation to a health care institution. This article focuses on the variety of options available to patients and providers to choose from as they customize an asthma self-management plan. Literature regarding short-acting bronchodilators is reviewed along with studies on more controversial therapies, such as use of home oral steroids, inhaled corticosteroid and beta agonist combination therapy, and macrolides in acute asthma exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115vEybj]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

### Are acute asthma presentations to the emergency department an opportunity for optimising long-term management? A qualitative study on beliefs and behaviours of healthcare professionals [^114ZXAuE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, asthma exacerbations lead to approximately 110 000 ambulance callouts, 120 000 emergency department (ED) visits, 60 000 hospital admissions and 200 000 bed days per year. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the cornerstone of preventative asthma management; however, a systematic review has shown adherence to be low, between 22% and 63%. Poor adherence could contribute to 24% of exacerbations and 60% of asthma-related hospitalisation. It is common for people to take only symptom-relieving short-acting beta agonist (SABA) medication and to use this too frequently.

The Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines recommend a combined inhaler containing ICS/formoterol (such as Symbicort, Fostair, DuoResp and Luforbec), taken either 'as needed', which is known as 'anti-inflammatory reliever' (AIR) therapy or taken both regularly as a preventer and 'as needed', which is known as a 'maintenance and reliever therapy' (MART) regime, in preference to SABA alone or separate ICS and SABA inhalers. This applies to adolescents and adults with asthma, across the range of asthma severities. National guidelines now also advise this approach. This reflects concerns about the risks of SABA overuse (associated with severe exacerbation riskand potential benefits of providing ICS during reliever inhaler use). Overuse of SABA relievers with underprescribing of ICS inhalers is also associated with a greater risk of hospital admission. Problematically, SABA prescription alone potentially reinforces erroneous beliefs that reliever inhalers are more important than preventers. ICS/formoterol inhalers take advantage of the patient's instinct to take medication when symptoms present but have the advantage of concurrently providing anti-inflammatory steroid for improved longer term clinical outcomes.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-short-acting β-agonist, or short-acting β-agonist), and a short course of oral corticosteroids in the discharge medications. Do not prescribe short-acting β-agonist-only treatment. Review inhaler technique and adherence before discharge. Advise patients to use their reliever inhaler only as needed rather than routinely.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1144behQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-", "medium-", and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma [^111MAa9d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of ICS for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified controlled clinical trials from the Cochrane Airways Group specialised register of controlled trials. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched. The latest search was September 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients presented to the ED or its equivalent with acute asthma, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. There were three different types of studies that were included in this review: 1) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with no systemic corticosteroids given to either treatment group, 2) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with systemic corticosteroids given to both treatment groups, and 3) studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroids. For the analysis, the first two types of studies were included as separate subgroups in the primary analysis (ICS vs. placebo), while the third type of study was included in the secondary analysis (ICS vs. systemic corticosteroid).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two review authors if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model was used for sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I(2)) statistics.

Main Results

Twenty trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analysis (13 paediatric, seven adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 12 studies; 960 patients) and heterogeneity (I(2) = 27%) was modest. This represents a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per 100 patients treated with ICS in comparison with placebo. Subgroup analysis of hospital admissions based on concomitant systemic corticosteroid use revealed that both subgroups indicated benefit from ICS in reducing hospital admissions (ICS and systemic corticosteroid versus systemic corticosteroid: OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 5 studies; N = 433; ICS versus placebo: OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 7 studies; N = 527). However, there was moderate heterogeneity in the subgroup using ICS in addition to systemic steroids (I(2) = 52%). Patients receiving ICS demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF: MD 7%; 95% CI 3% to 11%) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1): MD 6%; 95% CI 2% to 10%) at three to four hours post treatment). Only a small number of studies reported these outcomes such that they could be included in the meta-analysis and most of the studies in this comparison did not administer systemic corticosteroids to either treatment group. There was no evidence of significant adverse effects from ICS treatment with regard to tremor or nausea and vomiting. In the secondary analysis of studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroid alone, heterogeneity among the studies complicated pooling of data or drawing reliable conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

ICS therapy reduces hospital admissions in patients with acute asthma who are not treated with oral or intravenous corticosteroids. They may also reduce admissions when they are used in addition to systemic corticosteroids; however, the most recent evidence is conflicting. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma in addition to systemic corticosteroids. Also, there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy can be used in place of systemic corticosteroid therapy when treating acute asthma. Further research is needed to clarify the most appropriate drug dosage and delivery device, and to define which patients are most likely to benefit from ICS therapy. Use of similar measures and reporting methods of lung function, and a common, validated, clinical score would be helpful in future versions of this meta-analysis.

### Why arent't we doing better in asthma: time for personalised medicine? [^115pXrmu]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

After decades of improvement, asthma outcomes have stalled. Mortality, hospitalisations, exacerbations and symptom control remain sub-optimal. In controlled trials, most patients gain high levels of control, but in 'real-life' routine clinical practice most patients do not. Avoidable factors are found in most asthma deaths and hospital admissions. This perspective paper considers and contextualises the factors underlying poor asthma outcomes, and it suggests approaches that could improve the situation. Factors discussed include severe, therapy-resistant disease and the role of new and upcoming pharmacological therapies in improving outcomes. These are likely to be beneficial when targeted on patients with severe disease and discrete phenotypic characteristics, identified through biomarkers. However, for the majority of patients treated in the community, they are unlikely to be used widely, and better use of current therapy classes will be more important. Non-adherence with regular inhaled corticosteroid treatment and over-use of rescue bronchodilators are common, and many patients have poor inhaler technique. Self-management is frequently poor, particularly in those with psychosocial disadvantages and co-morbidities. Communication between clinicians and patients is sometimes poor, with failure to detect avoidable poor control and non-adherence, and failure to provide the necessary information and education to support efficient self-management. Strategies for improving monitoring and clinician-patient interactions to allow personalised treatment are considered. These strategies have the potential to allow individual patient needs to be recognised and efficient targeting of the variety of effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that we possess, which has the potential to improve both individual and population outcomes.

### Use of inhaled / nebulised ipratropium bromide in addition to standard first-line treatment with inhaled / nebulised short-acting beta 2-agonist and systemic steroid in the management of acute asthma exacerbations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1165AuhZ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of inhaled/nebulised ipratropium bromide (IB) in asthma is unclear.

Aims

To assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled/nebulised IB for asthma management in children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science until July 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and followed international guidelines for reporting systematic reviews. Outcomes included morbidity, escalation of care, length of hospital stay, mortality, adverse events and lung function.

Results

We included 24 studies (total participants n = 3238). The hospitalisation rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95%CI 0.70 to 1.00, I ² 30%), hospital stay in hours (MD 1.75, 95%CI -0.87 to 4.36, I ² 15%) and paediatric intensive care (PICU) admission (RR 0.91, 95%CI 0.35 to 2.32, I ² 0%) were similar. The hospitalisation rate was lower in patients who received IB nebuliser (RR 0.76, 95%CI 0.64 to 0.90, I ² 0%). The asthma severity score was significantly better in the IB group (MD -0.38, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.12, I 2 59%). No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

This review found high-certainty evidence that the IB nebuliser leads to a lower hospitalisation rate. However, when inhaled/nebulised IBs were analysed together, the hospitalisation rate was similar, with moderate certainty evidence. IB improved asthma clinical scores, with low certainty evidence. No difference was reported in other prespecified outcomes. Considering the current evidence and safety profile, inhaled/nebulised IB needs to be considered as an additional treatment for acute asthma exacerbation.

### Emergency physician practice and steroid use in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma [^111LHSFw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This study seeks to determine patterns of emergency physician (EP) practice regarding steroid use in the management of acute asthma attacks in the emergency department (ED), and to compare practices of academic and private practice EPs. Two hundred eight questionnaires were mailed to academic and private practice EPs. The survey requested information regarding the preferred initial route (oral or intravenous) for steroid administration; the initial dose of steroid; the preferred steroid regimen for outpatient management; and whether or not inhaled steroids were routinely prescribed at the time of discharge. The overall response rate was 74%; 91% for the academic EPs and 56% for private practice EPs. Sixty-five percent (99/143) of all EPs used the intravenous route for their initial dose of steroids. A significantly greater percentage of private practice EPs (45/58 or 78%) used intravenous steroids compared with academic EPs (54/95 or 57%; p = 0.009). A total of 41% (63/153) of EPs used a tapering steroid regime for outpatient therapy; a significantly greater percentage (34/58 or 59%; p = 0.0006) of private practice EPs used a tapering regimen of steroids compared with academic EPs (29/95 or 31%). A total of 32%(31) academic and 34% (20) private practice EPs prescribed inhaled steroids as part of their routine discharge instructions. Emergency physician practice patterns regarding initial steroid route of administration and dose, and outpatient-dosing regimens are variable. Only a minority of EPs prescribe steroid metered dose inhalers as part of their outpatient management of asthma.

### Asthma evaluation and management [^114V2FDA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory illness with acute exacerbations, which often is encountered in the ED setting. Knowledge of the presentation and treatment of asthma is crucial for any physician treating patients with this disease. Beta-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy continue to be the mainstay of emergency therapy despite advances in newer medications. Proper attention to long-term treatment of asthma and aggressive treatment of acute exacerbations should help reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115sPaLx]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting, systemic corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that there is no need to taper the dose of oral corticosteroids, either in the short term or over several weeks, in patients on maintenance ICSs.

### Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma [^115D4m9D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma The use of ICS may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of ICS for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED).

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from the Cochrane Airways Review Group register. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs or quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients presented with acute asthma to the ED or its equivalent, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper.

Main Results

Seven trials were selected for inclusion, but data were not available for one of them. In the six usable trials, (4 adult, 2 paediatric), a total of 352 patients were studied (179 ICS, 173 non-ICS treated). Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.64). This benefit was confined to patients not receiving concomitant systemic steroids (CS). Patients receiving concomitant CS showed a similar, but non-significant, trend towards reduced admissions compared to placebo treatment (OR 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18, 1.14). Patients receiving ICS also demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flows (PEFR WMD: 8%; 95% CI: 3, 13%) and forced expiratory volumes (FEV1 WMD: 5%; 95% CI: 0.4, 10%). The treatment was well tolerated, with few reported adverse side effects. A secondary analysis compared ICS alone vs CS alone; in the four trials included, there was significant heterogeneity between the study results for admission rates which precluded meaningful pooling of the study results.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Inhaled steroids reduced admission rates in patients with acute asthma, but it is unclear if there is a benefit of ICS when used in addition to systemic corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence that ICS alone is as effective as CS. Further research is needed to clarify if there is a benefit of ICS when used in addition to CS.

### Effect of corticosteroids on exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116YxUPz]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Periodic exacerbations of disease severity, which may lead to hospitalization, are a characteristic feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), becoming more prevalent as disease severity increases. Oral corticosteroids increase the rate of resolution of these episodes in both diseases. Inhaled corticosteroids are much less effective at conventional doses and are not recommended as a primary treatment for exacerbations of either disease. Maintenance therapy with inhaled corticosteroids significantly reduces the chance that a further exacerbation will occur in asthma. In general, increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids are more effective than placebo therapy in preventing exacerbations, at least until patients become persistently symptomatic and regular users of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Thereafter, the gains from doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy are modest and generally inferior to those that result from adding other antiinflammatory or bronchodilator agents to the treatment regime. The reduction in the incidence of exacerbations with inhaled corticosteroids, compared with placebo, ranges from 15 to 20% in COPD versus almost 50% in severe asthma. However, given the impact of exacerbations on overall quality of life in COPD, even this modest reduction is likely to be clinically important.

Follow-up

Arrange early follow-up after any exacerbation, regardless of where it was managed:

- Review the patient's symptom control and risk factors for further exacerbations.
- Prescribe/continue ICS-containing controller therapy (preferably MART with ICS–formoterol) to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. If already taking controller therapy, continue increased doses for 2–4 weeks.
- Provide a written asthma action plan and, where relevant, advice about avoiding exacerbation triggers.
- Check inhaler technique and adherence.

Asthma outcomes after an ED presentation for acute asthma are significantly improved by comprehensive intervention programs that include optimal controller management, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education (self-monitoring, written action plan, and regular review).

Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma or who have repeat presentations to acute care settings. Follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent ED visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111MY3VB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial treatment for safety and clinical efficacy — For asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential, either alone or in combination with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not treat with LABA and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without ICS. For patients with features of both asthma and COPD, treat as asthma; ICS-containing therapy is important to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not give LABA and/or LAMA alone without ICS. For COPD, treat according to current recommendations from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), i.e., initial treatment with LAMA and LABA, plus as-needed SABA.

### COVID-19, asthma, and inhaled corticosteroids: another beneficial effect of inhaled corticosteroids? [^115kHeTo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a real pandemic. After a median incubation period of 5 days, the disease occurs in different stages, inducing upper and lower airway responses in mild disease (80–90% of patients) and progressing to bilateral pneumonia in severe disease (10–20%). A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring mechanical ventilation on intensive care. COVID-19 patients with preexisting comorbid conditions such as chronic respiratory diseases have worse disease outcomes, including a higher incidence of the need for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality. However, it remains to be further investigated how preexisting chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and their treatment might modify the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of COVID-19. Approximately 300 million individuals worldwide have asthma. Considering that a significant proportion of individuals with asthma is confronted with COVID-19, it is crucial to understand which asthma patients are particularly at risk and how inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — the cornerstone of asthma treatment — may influence morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. Long-term treatment with systemic corticosteroids (e.g. in transplant patients) is immunosuppressive, increasing the risk and severity of viral infections. Because of the potential risk for worse disease outcomes, the World Health Organization does not recommend systemic corticosteroid treatment in COVID-19, unless if indicated for other reasons such as acute asthma or COPD exacerbations requiring a short course of oral corticosteroids. These recommendations have caused doubt and uncertainty among patients with asthma and physicians on whether ICS therapy should be maintained during this pandemic. However, withdrawal of ICS treatment puts asthma patients at risk of severe exacerbations. A recent meta-analysis on COVID-19 outcomes in patients with chronic respiratory diseases using ICS concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to abandon the well-established ICS treatment in asthma. There is thus an urgent need to elucidate demographic and clinical characteristics that determine disease outcomes of COVID-19 in asthma, to investigate the impact of ICS and to unravel the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116aZEEc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116KTsTS]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — systemic corticosteroids — Systemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be utilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years (Evidence A). Where possible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation. Use of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms, the exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS, or the patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS. For route of delivery, oral administration is as effective as intravenous, the oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less invasive and less expensive, and OCS require at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement.

### The availability, cost, and affordability of essential medicines for asthma and COPD in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review [^1169yBwL]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

In contrast to ICSs, systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisolone or hydrocortisone, needed to manage exacerbations of asthma and COPD, were more widely available and more affordable. Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat other conditions, which might influence availability. They are associated with substantial adverse effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, and pneumonia. Therefore, preventing exacerbations, and reducing the need for systemic steroids is important. The over-reliance on inhaled SABAs and underuse of ICSs are of global concern because of their negative effect on asthma control and mortality. The Global Initiative for Asthma now recommends that all adolescents and adults with asthma should always receive ICSs in addition to SABAs and ideally an ICS-LABA combination inhaler. Under-use of other long-acting treatments has also been described; for example, in observational studies of COPD patients in Latin America. Raising awareness of the importance and cost-effectiveness of effective long-term treatment for these respiratory diseases is crucial. Policy makers, health-care providers, and local communities all have an important role to play in ensuring that people living with asthma and COPD get effective treatment to prevent life-threatening acute attacks and minimise long-term lung damage.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114wujcb]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists (SABA) — Currently, inhaled salbutamol (albuterol) is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management, and the most cost-effective and efficient delivery is by pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with a spacer (Evidence A). Systematic reviews of intermittent versus continuous SABA in acute asthma provide conflicting results, use of nebulizers can disseminate aerosols and potentially contribute to spread of respiratory viral infections, and current evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous beta2 agonist in most patients with severe asthma exacerbations (Evidence A).

### Wrong inhalation technique is associated to poor asthma clinical outcomes. is there room for improvement? [^113pQvhE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The long-term goals of asthma management are to control symptoms and to reduce the risk of exacerbations. Inhaled medication is the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment for asthma; therefore, good inhalation technique is the key for asthma management. However, up to 70% of asthma patients do not use their inhalers correctly. There is evidence on how poor inhalation technique is associated to poor asthma control. The purpose of this review is to present the most recent research in this field to help clinicians understand the importance of proper inhalers use and the possible interventions to optimize patients' inhalation technique.

Recent Findings

New evidence on how poor inhaler technique and specific critical errors are significantly associated to poor asthma control and exacerbations and how this negative impact could be improved by optimizing device selection, enhancing shared decision-making and giving more importance to education, both for patients and healthcare professionals. New devices and additional tools might help patients to achieve the correct inhaler technique and could form the basis of simplified educational interventions.

Summary

There is an urgent need for specific interventions including new educational strategies to minimize the negative effects of wrong inhalation technique in asthma clinical outcomes.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management — reviewing response and post-exacerbation follow-up: Patients should see their doctor immediately or go to an acute care unit if their asthma continues to deteriorate despite following their written asthma action plan, or if their asthma suddenly worsens, and after a self-managed exacerbation patients should see their primary care healthcare provider for a semi-urgent review within 1–2 weeks, preferably before ceasing oral corticosteroids if prescribed, for assessment of symptom control and additional risk factors for exacerbations and to identify the potential cause.

Box 9–5 — discharge medications after acute care for asthma advises to initiate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment if not already being taken; for adults/adolescents, maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS–formoterol (MART) is preferred and, for adults/adolescents, start MART at Step 4 on discharge; if prescribing an ICS regimen with short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) reliever, step the maintenance dose up for 2–4 weeks and emphasize adherence and inhaler technique. To reduce relapse risk, prescribe at least a 5–7 day course of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for adults (prednisolone or equivalent 40–50 mg/day) and 3–5 days for children (1–2 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 40 mg/day) (Evidence A); review progress before ceasing OCS, and if the OCS is dexamethasone, treatment is only for total 1–2 days, with switching to prednisolone considered if there is failure of resolution or relapse of symptoms.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (oral corticosteroids), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day or equivalent up to a maximum of 50 mg/day, usually for 5–7 days in adult patients, and 1–2 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 40 mg/day, usually for 3–5 days in pediatric patients aged 6–11 years) for moderate or severe exacerbations, especially if the patient is deteriorating or has not responded to increased reliever and/or maintenance ICS-containing medications before presenting.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^11765Qen]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department visits annually. Between 12–16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation and this review examines the evidence for using systemic corticosteroids to improve outcomes after discharge from the ED.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register was searched using the terms: a) Asthma OR Wheez* b) Glucocorticoid OR Steroid* AND c) Exacerbat* OR Relapse* OR Emerg*. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to determine if unpublished studies which met the inclusion criteria were available. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials were eligible for selection. Studies were included in this review if they dealt with the outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations using glucocorticoids at discharge and reported either relapse rate or PFTs. Two independent reviewers first identified potentially relevant studies and then selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Agreement was assessed using kappa (k) statistics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers; authors were contacted to verify the extracted data and clarify missing information. When author contact was unsuccessful, missing data were estimated from graphs where possible. Sensitivity, sub-group and overall analyses were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager.

Main Results

A search that yielded 229 references identified 169 (73%) original publications. Reviewers identified 8 studies for potential inclusion (k = 0.76); 18 references were added by searching publication reference lists and contact with authors. Of these 26 articles, a total of 7 were included in the overview. Two studies used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (odds ratio (OR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17, 0.73). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (OR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta-agonists (weighted mean difference (WMD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI: -5.5, -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI: -0.47, 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.44) in the first 7–10 days, while rarely reported, showed no differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. It appears that IM corticosteroids are similarly efficacious to a 7–10 day tapering course of oral agents. From these results, as few as 13 patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an acute exacerbation of asthma significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care and decreases beta-agonist use without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular corticosteroids appear as effective as oral agents.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114P8mxx]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to oral corticosteroids, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to offer add-on low-dose oral corticosteroids - ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent - as a last resort in selected adult patients with severe asthma with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with step 5 treatment and after exclusion of other contributory factors and other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable,
recognizing that maintenance oral corticosteroids are often associated with substantial cumulative side effects.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in obstructive airway disease [^114pHVQC]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids play an important role in the management of obstructive airway disease, by suppressing airway inflammation that is central to the pathophysiology of these conditions. In asthma there is strong clinical evidence supporting the use of inhaled corticosteroids in mild, moderate, and severe persistent asthma to improve lung function, reduce exacerbations, and prevent death. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inhaled corticosteroids improve symptoms, reduce frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations, and should be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation who have persistent symptoms despite optimal bronchodilator therapy. Though the adverse effects of corticosteroids are less when given via inhalation than when given systemically, nevertheless, the adverse effects are important and need to be considered. Newer inhaled corticosteroids with better pharmacologic properties are being developed and will probably be available in the near future.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^111o8dnF]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Yellow zone asthma — ICS dose escalation evidence indicates that several recent randomized controlled studies have failed to demonstrate that doubling doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in those already receiving ICS therapy is effective, whereas the EPR3 guidelines state that the preliminary evidence suggests that quadrupling the dose of an ICS for 7 days, starting at the first appearance of worsening symptoms, can prevent exacerbations. In a randomized trial, 208 patients at least 16 years old with current asthma stabilized on an ICS (200–1,000 μg of beclomethasone) were randomized to placebo or a quadrupled ICS dose, with intervention criteria of worsening asthma control, onset of an upper respiratory tract infection (RTI), peak expiratory flow (PEF) decrease by 15% on 2 consecutive days, or PEF decrease by 30% on 1 day; OCS-requiring exacerbations occurred in Eighteen of 197 (9%) versus 29 of 203 (14%), yielding a risk ratio of 0.64 (95% confidence limits 0.37 — 1.11, P = 0.11), and per-protocol analysis showed a risk ratio of 0.43 for requiring an OCS.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^114hLwH7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma (age 12 years and older) — the Expert Panel conditionally recommends two Step 2 options: either daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly; the recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years, and the Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence. For implementation, individuals aged 12 years and older with a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy and regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred; one studied approach is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed, administered sequentially in two separate inhalers. Individuals can initiate intermittent therapy at home but should receive regular follow-up, and clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations, with side effects equally infrequent; shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting, SABAs, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that delivery of short-acting β-agonists via a pressurized-metered dose inhaler and spacer or a dry-powdered inhaler leads to a similar improvement in lung function as delivery via nebulizer,
although the most cost-effective route of delivery is pressurized-metered dose inhaler and spacer.

### Intermittent versus daily inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma in children and adults [^111xgFUq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended mainstay of treatment in children and adults with persistent asthma. However, often, ICS are used intermittently by patients or recommended by physicians to be used only at the onset of exacerbations.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent versus daily ICS in the management of children and adults with persistent asthma and preschool-aged children suspected of persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and the ClinicalTrials.gov web site up to October 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus daily ICS in children and adults with persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of patients with one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was the number of patients with serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and inflammatory markers. Equivalence was assumed if the risk ratio (RR) estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were between 0.9 and 1.1. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons. The four paediatric trials (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32; the large confidence interval translates into a risk of exacerbations in the intermittent ICS group varying between 17% and 25%, assuming a 19% risk with daily ICS). Age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03). Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue β2-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64). There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals. In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, there was low quality evidence that intermittent and daily ICS strategies were similarly effective in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events. The strength of the evidence means that we cannot currently assume equivalence between the two options. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone. Clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

### Intermittent inhaled corticosteroid therapy versus placebo for persistent asthma in children and adults [^116dG2fF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

International guidelines advocate using daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the management of children and adults with persistent asthma. However, in real world clinical settings, these medicines are often used at irregular intervals by patients. Recent evidence suggests that the use of intermittent ICS, with treatment initiated at the time of early symptoms, may still have benefits for reducing the severity of an asthma exacerbation.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent ICS versus placebo in the management of children and adults diagnosed with, or suspected to have, symptoms of mild persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), the ClinicalTrials.gov website and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal in March 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus placebo in children and adults with symptoms of persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the risk of asthma exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, and withdrawal rates. Quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Six trials (representing 490 preschool children, 145 school-aged children and 240 adults) met the inclusion criteria. Study durations were 12 to 52 weeks. Results for preschool children were presented in a separate analysis as this represents a distinct clinical condition, not necessarily related to the development of long term asthma. There was a reduction in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids in older children (145 participants, odds ratio (OR) 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 1.12, low quality evidence) and adults with asthma (240 participants, OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.95, low quality evidence). These analyses were each based on the findings of a single study. No group difference was observed in the risk of serious adverse health events (385 participants; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.14 to 7.25, moderate quality evidence). Compared to the placebo group, there was an insufficient number of participants to make firm conclusions whether the intermittent ICS group displayed any reduction in the rate of hospitalisations, day time and night time symptoms scores, or adverse events. Lung function tests reported by a single study favoured the use of ICS. There was no significant group difference in growth rate of children, or overall withdrawals. In preschool children with frequent wheezing episodes, the use of intermittent ICS at the onset of early symptoms reduced the likelihood of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids by half (490 participants; OR: 0.48; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73, moderate quality evidence with minimal heterogeneity). Intermittent therapy was associated with fewer serious adverse events (439 participants; OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.02, low quality evidence). There was no significant difference in hospitalisations or in a single study measuring parent perceived quality of life. However, intermittent therapy was associated with improvements in both day time and night time symptoms. There was no increase in the rates of withdrawals, and overall and treatment-specific adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with mild persistent asthma, two studies have shown that the use of intermittent ICS at the time of exacerbation reduced the chances of needing oral corticosteroids by half. This result is statistically significant if we assume that the effect size is the same for each study population (fixed effects model), but is not statistically significant when using a random effects model. However, the paucity of published evidence limits our conclusions towards the 'as-needed' use of this medication. The small number of studies and participants were the major reasons for downgrading the overall quality of the findings. A corresponding result was found in preschool children with wheeze. In this age group, an improvement in day time and night time asthma symptoms score and parental perceived quality of life of children similarly favoured the ICS group. However, there was no statistical difference in hospitalisation rates in any group. This treatment was not associated with any significant increase in adverse events. There was no growth suppression noted with the use of intermittent ICS in either preschool or school-aged children. Considering the limited number of available studies, we emphasise the need for more randomised controlled studies in order to confirm these findings.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112gXV5Y]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Follow up after an acute exacerbation — discharge medications and review: Discharge medications should include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-SABA or SABA) and a short course of OCS; SABA-only treatment is not recommended. Inhaler technique and adherence should be reviewed before discharge, patients should be advised to use their reliever inhaler only as-needed, and a follow-up appointment should be arranged for about 2–7 days later depending on context. At the review visit, assess whether the flare-up has resolved and whether OCS can be ceased, assess symptom control and risk factors, explore the potential cause, and review or provide a written asthma action plan. Maintenance ICS-containing treatment can generally be stepped back to pre-exacerbation levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation; however, if the exacerbation was preceded by symptoms suggestive of chronically poorly controlled asthma and inhaler technique and adherence are good, a step up in treatment may be indicated.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: the evidence base [^115hpsKm]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

In long-term management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a number of medications improve pulmonary function test results. The long-term clinical benefits of those drugs would seem intuitive, but there is very little strong evidence that long-term outcomes in COPD are substantially affected by those drugs. Nevertheless, symptom improvement such as dyspnea reduction is certainly strong reason to use those agents. The 2 most compelling bodies of evidence in stable COPD are for oxygen therapy in the chronically hypoxemic patient and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea. Inhaled corticosteroids also appear to be useful in patients at risk for frequent exacerbations. In acute exacerbations, the rationale for therapy comes in part from the large body of literature regarding acute asthma therapy. Bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroids both seem to reduce the severity and the duration of exacerbations. Moreover, routine antibiotic use seems beneficial, and the role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with patients suffering impending respiratory failure from acute COPD exacerbations is well supported by the literature.

New approaches to using approved medications for treatment of mild pediatric asthma — several inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-based strategies are endorsed by the NAEPP guideline and GINA statement, and low-dose ICS is effective in controlling symptoms in children; in the 5- to 44-year age group, ICS reduced hospitalization risk by 31% in those who used at least one canister of ICS during each of the four quarters of the year, there was a progressive decline in mortality risk with increasing ICS use with a decrease of more than 50% with the use of more than six ICS canisters annually, low-dose ICS reduced the risk of a serious exacerbation (admission, emergency treatment, or death) by 41%, and severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids were reduced by 0.48 in children and adults with 0 or 1 symptom day per week alongside higher prebronchodilator lung function and more symptom-free days.

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) — As a last resort, add-on low-dose OCS (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent) may be considered for some adults with severe asthma (Evidence D), but maintenance OCS is often associated with substantial cumulative side effects (Evidence A). It should only be considered for adults with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with Step 5 treatment, and after exclusion of other contributory factors and trial of other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable. Patients should be counseled about potential side-effects, and they should be assessed and monitored for risk of adrenal suppression and corticosteroid-induced side effects.

### Effects of corticosteroids on lung function in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116c2buF]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Both oral and inhaled corticosteroids have clinically significant effects on symptoms, exacerbations, health status, and lung function in asthma, and to a lesser extent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Change in FEV(1) does not correlate well with functional tests in COPD and may not be the best measure of response to treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids may be beneficial when added to a beta-agonist for treatment of acute asthma, and the efficacy of oral corticosteroids in this setting is well established. Oral corticosteroids inconsistently improve lung function in stable outpatients with COPD. Individual inhaled corticosteroids do not have a marked effect, but the combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol and the combination of budesonide plus formoterol seem to improve FEV(1) over treatment with the individual components. In addition, there is convincing evidence for the use of systemic corticosteroids during acute exacerbations of COPD. Some evidence suggests that patients with COPD who respond to corticosteroids have eosinophilic inflammation and other attributes of an asthma phenotype.

### Nebulized inhaled corticosteroids in asthma treatment in children 5 years or younger: a systematic review and global expert analysis [^112wxYnX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Although nebulized corticosteroids (NebCSs) are a key treatment option for young children with asthma or viral-induced wheezing (VIW), there are no uniform recommendations on their best use. This systematic review aimed to clarify the role of NebCSs in children 5 years or younger for the management of acute asthma exacerbations, asthma maintenance therapy, and the treatment of VIW. Electronic databases were used to identify relevant English language articles with no date restrictions. Studies reporting efficacy data in children 5 years or younger, with a double-blind, placebo- or open-controlled, randomized design, and inclusion of 40 or more participants (no lower patient limit for VIW) were included. Ten articles on asthma exacerbation, 9 on asthma maintenance, and 7 on VIW were identified. Results showed NebCSs to be at least as efficacious as oral corticosteroids in the emergency room for the management of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. In asthma maintenance, nebulized budesonide, the agent of focus in all trials analyzed, significantly reduced the risk of further asthma exacerbations compared with placebo, cromolyn sodium, and montelukast. Intermittent NebCS treatment of VIW was as effective as continuous daily treatment. In summary, NebCSs are effective and well tolerated in patients 5 years or younger for the management of acute and chronic asthma.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider adding a short course of oral corticosteroids (40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults/adolescents; 0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum 40 mg/day, for 3–5 days for children) for severe exacerbations, such as peak expiratory flow or FEV1 < 60% personal best or predicted, or if not responding to above treatment over 2–3 days. Prefer morning dosing after first dose to minimize insomnia. Advise patients about potential adverse effects. Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for < 2 weeks.

Management of Exacerbations in a Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess exacerbation severity from the patient's mental state, degree of dyspnea, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and lung function (PEF or spirometry) while starting treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler and spacer) and controlled flow oxygen (sufficient flow to maintain oxygen saturation at 93–95% for adults; 94–98% for children 6–11 yr), if available (Figure 5). Controlled oxygen therapy is associated with lower mortality and better outcomes than high-concentration (100%) oxygen therapy.

Figure 5.
Management of asthma exacerbations in primary care (adults, adolescents, children 6–11 yr). SABA doses are for albuterol. Reproduced by permission from Reference(Box 4–3). PEF = peak expiratory flow; pMDI = pressurized metered-dose inhaler; SABA = short-acting β 2 -agonist.

Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility if there are signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care, particularly if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest. During transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen, and systemic corticosteroids.

Repeated administration of albuterol (up to 4–10 puffs every 20 min for the first hour) is effective for rapidly reversing airflow limitation. Avoid nebulization except for life-threatening asthma; delivery of rapid-acting β 2 -agonist via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler and spacer or via a dry-powder inhaler is as effective in patients with moderately severe acute asthma and avoids the risk of disseminating infectious particles. Current evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous β 2 -agonists in patients with severe asthma exacerbations.

### Combination formoterol and budesonide as maintenance and reliever therapy versus current best practice (including inhaled steroid maintenance), for chronic asthma in adults and children [^117HXHUH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Traditionally inhaled treatment for asthma has used separate preventer and reliever therapies. The combination of formoterol and budesonide in one inhaler has made possible a single inhaler for both prevention and relief of symptoms (single inhaler therapy or SiT).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of budesonide and formoterol in a single inhaler for maintenance and reliever therapy in asthma compared with maintenance with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (alone or as part of current best practice) and any reliever therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register in February 2013.

Selection Criteria

Parallel, randomised controlled trials of 12 weeks or longer in adults and children with chronic asthma. Studies had to assess the combination of formoterol and budesonide as SiT, against a control group that received inhaled steroids and a separate reliever inhaler.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 13 trials involving 13,152 adults and one of the trials also involved 224 children (which have been separately reported). All studies were sponsored by the manufacturer of the SiT inhaler. We considered the nine studies assessing SiT against best practice to be at a low risk of selection bias, but a high risk of detection bias as they were unblinded. In adults whose asthma was not well-controlled on ICS, the reduction in hospital admission with SiT did not reach statistical significance (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.44, eight trials, N = 8841, low quality evidence due to risk of detection bias in open studies and imprecision). The rates of hospital admission were low; for every 1000 people treated with current best practice six would experience a hospital admission over six months compared with between three and eight treated with SiT. The odds of experiencing exacerbations needing treatment with oral steroids were lower with SiT compared with control (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.98, eight trials, N = 8841, moderate quality evidence due to risk of detection bias). For every 100 adults treated with current best practice over six months, seven required a course of oral steroids, whilst for SiT there would be six (95% CI 5 to 7). The small reduction in time to first severe exacerbation needing medical intervention was not statistically significant (hazard ratio (HR) 0.94; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04, five trials, N = 7355). Most trials demonstrated a reduction in the mean total daily dose of ICS with SiT (mean reduction was based on self-reported data from patient diaries and ranged from 107 to 385 µg/day). Withdrawals due to adverse events were more common in people treated with SiT (OR 2.85; 95% CI 1.89 to 4.30, moderate quality evidence due to risk of detection bias). Three studies including 4209 adults compared SiT with higher dose budesonide maintenance and terbutaline for symptom relief. The studies were considered as low risk of bias. The run-in for these studies involved withdrawal of LABA, and patients were recruited who were symptomatic during run-in. The reduction in the odds of hospitalisation with SiT compared with higher dose ICS did not reach statistical significance (Peto OR; 0.56; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.09, moderate quality evidence due to imprecision). Fewer patients on SiT needed a course of oral corticosteroids (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.64, high quality evidence). For every 100 adults treated with ICS over 11 months, 18 required a course of oral steroids, whilst for SiT there would be 11 (95% CI 9 to 12). Withdrawals due to adverse events were more common in people treated with SiT (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.93, high quality evidence). One study included children (N = 224), in which SiT was compared with higher dose budesonide. There was a significant reduction in participants who needed an increase in their inhaled steroids with SiT, but there were only two hospitalisations for asthma and no separate data on courses of oral corticosteroids. Less inhaled and oral corticosteroids were used in the SiT group and the annual height gain was also 1 cm greater in the SiT group, (95% CI 0.3 cm to 1.7 cm). The results for fatal serious adverse events were too rare to rule out either treatment being harmful. There was no significant difference found in non-fatal serious adverse events for any of the comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Single inhaler therapy has now been demonstrated to reduce exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids against current best practice strategies and against a fixed higher dose of inhaled steroids. The strength of evidence that SiT reduces hospitalisation against these same treatments is weak. There were more discontinuations due to adverse events on SiT compared to current best practice, but no significant differences in serious adverse events. Our confidence in these conclusions is limited by the open-label design of the trials, and by the unknown adherence to treatment in the current best practice arms of the trials. Single inhaler therapy can reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations needing oral corticosteroids in comparison with fixed dose maintenance ICS and separate relief medication. The reduced odds of exacerbations with SiT compared with higher dose ICS should be viewed in the context of the possible impact of LABA withdrawal during study run-in. This may have made the study populations more likely to respond to SiT. Single inhaler therapy is not currently licensed for children under 18 years of age in the United Kingdom and there is currently very little research evidence for this approach in children or adolescents.

Asthma pharmacotherapy — minimizing adverse effects of medication — Reduce the potential for local and/or systemic side-effects of inhaled medications by ensuring correct inhaler technique; reminding patients to rinse and spit out after using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and, after good asthma control has been maintained for 3 months; finding each patient's minimum effective dose of ICS-containing therapy (the lowest dose that will, in conjunction with an action plan, maintain good symptom control and minimize exacerbations); and checking for drug interactions particularly with cytochrome P450 inhibitors.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^112qZJF3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — Implementation guidance (use, safety, and counseling for LAMA): The Expert Panel makes suggestions that a LAMA can be used as an add-on to ICS therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled asthma as part of Step 4 therapy, but add-on LABA therapy has a more favorable benefit-harm profile; individuals at risk of urinary retention and those who have glaucoma should not receive LAMA therapy; the small increase in the potential risk of harms from a LAMA may outweigh its benefits in some individuals, particularly in Blacks; LAMA treatment requires appropriate use of specific inhaler devices and clinicians should teach individuals with asthma how to use these devices appropriately; when clinicians prescribe LAMA therapy, they should prescribe this medication for long-term asthma control in the ambulatory setting and that LAMA therapy does not have a role in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma in the ambulatory, emergency department, or inpatient settings; and clinicians should confirm the asthma diagnosis and address factors that often contribute to uncontrolled asthma before considering intensifying therapy by adding a LAMA.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116BoBTa]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma inhaler device selection — shared decision-making emphasizes that multiple inhaler types are available ("pMDIs, dry-powder inhalers (DPIs), mist inhalers and nebulizers") but availability may be limited by country, and training in correct use is important; access to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing inhalers and environmental considerations (including manufacturing, recycling, and pMDI propellants, which are most commonly used worldwide) are highlighted. Selecting the right inhaler for the individual patient is described as crucial to reduce symptom burden and to reduce the need for emergency health care and hospitalization, which have greater environmental impacts than pMDIs. Box 5–1 outlines collaborative questions and steps: identify the right class of medication (consider exacerbation risk reduction, symptom control, adverse effects), review which inhalers are available to the patient (consider local availability, access, number of inhalers, and cost to patient), assess which inhalers the patient can use correctly after training ("Test technique often"), compare environmental impact (consider manufacturing, propellant for pMDIs, and potential for recycling), and conduct follow-up to confirm satisfaction with medications and inhalers, aiming for "optimal inhaler selection" that is "safest and best for the patient and for the planet".

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^111SBV4V]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1135kseN]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids during exacerbation — dosing and effects in children: For children not previously on ICS, an initial dose of ICS twice the low daily dose may be given and continued for a few weeks or months; some studies have used high-dose ICS (1600 mcg/day, preferably divided into four doses over the day and given for 5–10 days) as this may reduce the need for OCS, but addition of ICS to standard care (including OCS) does not reduce risk of hospitalization while reducing length of stay and acute asthma scores in children in the emergency department, and the potential for side-effects with high-dose ICS should be considered with close monitoring. For those children already on ICS, doubling the dose was not effective in a small study of mild-moderate exacerbations in children aged 6–14 years, nor was quintupling the dose in children aged 5–11 years with good adherence; this approach should be reserved mainly for individual cases and should always involve regular follow-up and monitoring of adverse effects.

### Prospective, placebo-controlled trial of 5 vs 10 days of oral prednisolone in acute adult asthma [^113Uxxwd]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral steroid treatment in the management of acute adult asthma is unclear. We prospectively studied the effect of 5 vs. 10 days of oral prednisolone in patients with acute asthma requiring hospital admission.

Methods

Each patient received 40 mg of enteric-coated prednisolone daily for 5 days, followed by 5 days of 40 mg prednisolone daily (n = 24) or placebo (n = 20). All were given their usual inhaled asthma therapy including inhaled corticosteroids. Patients kept PEF and symptom diaries for 21 days.

Results

For the 5-day treatment group mean (95% CI) early morning PEF was 6 (-47,+36) l/min lower to day 21 (P = 0.78). There was no evidence of differences in other PEF measures (morning post-bronchodilator, evening or worst of day). One patient in each group had an exacerbation requiring further oral steroids during the 21-day observation period. Asthma symptom scores were worse in the 5-day group on days 6–21 but the significance of this finding was uncertain, as a difference had emerged by day 5 (prior to trial entry).

Conclusions

It may be possible to reduce the standard steroid course to 5 days in acute adult asthma, provided all patients receive inhaled steroids and a personal asthma management plan.

Step 4 — Continue controller treatment and refer for expert assessment — when the Step 3 approach of doubling the initial dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) fails to achieve and maintain good asthma control, the guideline states to "carefully reassess inhaler technique and medication adherence", address environmental factors, and reconsider the diagnosis; as "the best treatment for this population has not been established", "options to consider, with specialist advice, are" to further increase the dose of ICS "for a few weeks", add leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) with counseling on neuropsychiatric adverse effects, add long-acting beta agonist (LABA) in combination with ICS based on data "in children ≥ 4 years of age", add "a low dose of oral corticosteroid (for a few weeks only)", or add "intermittent high-dose ICS at onset of respiratory illnesses" when exacerbations are the main problem, with monitoring for side-effects and re-evaluating the need for additional controller treatment at each visit.

### Emerging complexity in the biomarkers of exacerbation-prone asthma [^1142kGMV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

During the past years, maintenance treatment with controller drugs such as inhaled steroids and, in particular, new biologics have shown clinically significant efficacy in suppressing exacerbation rates in patients with asthma. This has substantially changed asthma management from being a largely reactive approach during acute episodes toward being a more prophylactic strategy. The success in suppressing exacerbations in patients with asthma is remarkable, as these emerging events are predominantly caused by unanticipated respiratory (rhino)virus infections. The biological pathways leading to an acute asthma episode are extremely complex, involving an array of pathogen–host interactions at the degree of the virus, the airway microbiome, the innate and adaptive immune responses, a broad spectrum of inflammatory mechanisms, and multiple elements of airway narrowing. The real questions are "Which biological pathways are predominating in patients with frequent exacerbations, and can any predictive biomarkers be delineated?"

In this issue of the Journal, Peters and colleagues (pp.) present a prospective follow-up study focused on these questions with two aims: first, to identify clinical and biological variables that are associated with exacerbation-prone asthma and, second, to build a biomarker prediction model for exacerbation rates. The strength of the study certainly includes the longitudinal design of the well-characterized SARP-3 (Severe Asthma Research Program-3) population. By using an acute episode requiring ≥ 3 days of systemic steroids as their definition of an exacerbation, the authors classified 21% of patients as being exacerbation prone, 41% as being exacerbation resistant, and 38% as having intermittent exacerbations during 3 years of prospective follow-up.

As expected, prior exacerbations turned out to increase the probability of subsequent exacerbations, and the observed exacerbation rates were also associated with older age, female sex, higher body mass index, worse asthma symptoms, lower spirometric function, higher doses of inhaled steroids, more frequent gastroesophageal reflux, nasal polyposis, diabetes, hypertension, depression, and oral-steroid treatment. This confirms and extends the findings of early cross-sectional studies. Interestingly, when examining cellular and molecular factors, it appeared that circulating white blood cells, neutrophils, and IL-6 concentrations were highest in the exacerbation-prone patients, whereas eosinophil counts (in blood or sputum) and exhaled nitric oxide did not differ according to exacerbation rate.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113PWQWx]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of asthma exacerbations in a primary care or acute care facility calls to assess severity from dyspnea, respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and lung function while starting SABA and oxygen therapy, with infection control procedures followed. Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility for signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest; during transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen and systemic corticosteroids. Start treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] and spacer), early oral corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen if available; review response of symptoms, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour, and give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment. Do not routinely request a chest X-ray, and do not routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations. Decide about hospitalization based on clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.

Overview.

GRADE is an internationally accepted framework for determining the quality or certainty of evidence and the direction and strength of recommendations based on this evidence. A guideline methodologist not involved in the development of the systematic reviews for this update provided training on GRADE methodology to the Expert Panel and ongoing support and consultation throughout the project. The Expert Panel used the GRADE approach to review the evidence, create evidence profiles for critical and important outcomes, develop EtD tables, and write recommendation statements.

Prioritization and rating of asthma outcomes.

The Expert Panel discussed asthma outcomes of potential interest and rated the relative importance of each outcome for clinical decision making using the GRADE approach. During this process, the Expert Panel reviewed the definitions of the outcomes in each of the systematic review reports. The outcomes deemed critical to assess for making recommendations across all topic areas were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and asthma-related quality of life.

The Expert Panel assessed additional outcomes for specific key questions when these outcomes were relevant to the topic or when data for the three critical outcomes were not available. For example, in some instances, the systematic review reports identified limited or not adequate data on the effect of the interventions listed in the key questions on specific critical outcomes (eg, asthma control). In such cases, the Expert Panel considered available data on a related outcome (eg, asthma symptoms), even though validated outcome instruments were not used in studies or were not available. In this example, the Expert Panel confirmed asthma symptoms as an important outcome based on responses from the focus groups. The Expert Panel then used data on this important outcome to create the evidence profiles and EtD tables for the intervention, based on the available evidence.

After prioritizing the outcomes, the Expert Panel used established thresholds for determining significant improvement, also known as the minimally important difference (MID), for asthma control and asthma-related quality-of-life measures. These MID criteria are listed in Table IB. – For outcomes with no MID established in the literature, such as exacerbations, the Expert Panel reached consensuson clinically important differences that were based in part on a review of effect sizes in RCTs in the literature and on their judgments regarding the clinical relevance of a given change. In keeping with the recommendations from the Asthma Outcomes Workshop (2012), treatment with systemic (oral and parenteral) corticosteroids, asthma-specific emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were included as core outcome measures for exacerbations. The Expert Panel also included studies that used composite measures of systemic corticosteroids, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations.

### Addition of inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists to inhaled steroids as first line therapy for persistent asthma in steroid-naive adults and children [^111xo1FL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Consensus statements recommend the addition of long-acting inhaled ss2-agonists (LABA) only in asthmatic patients who are inadequately controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). It is not uncommon for some patients to be commenced on ICS and LABA together as initial therapy.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of combining inhaled corticosteroids with long-acting ss2-agonists (ICS+LABA) with inhaled corticosteroids alone (ICS alone) in steroid-naive children and adults with persistent asthma. We assessed two protocols: (1) LABA + ICS versus a similar dose of ICS (comparison 1) and (2) LABA + ICS versus a higher dose of ICS (comparison 2).

Search Strategy

We identified randomised controlled trials through electronic database searches (May 2008).

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing ICS + LABA with ICS alone in children and adults with asthma who had no inhaled corticosteroids in the preceding 28 days prior to enrolment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Each author assessed studies independently for risk of bias and extracted data. We obtained confirmation from the trialists when possible. The primary endpoint was rate of patients with one or more asthma exacerbations requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids. Results are expressed as relative risks (RR) for dichotomous data and as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous data.

Main Results

Twenty-eight study comparisons drawn from 27 trials (22 adult; five paediatric) met the review entry criteria (8050 participants). Baseline data from the studies indicated that trial populations had moderate or mild airway obstruction (FEV1 ≥ 65% predicted), and that they were symptomatic prior to randomisation. In comparison 1, the combination of ICS and LABA was not associated with a significantly lower risk of patients with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.47) or requiring hospital admissions (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.09 to 1.65) compared to a similar dose of ICS alone. The combination of LABA and ICS led to a significantly greater improvement from baseline in FEV1 (0.12 L/sec; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.17), in symptoms (SMD -0.26; 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14) and in rescue ss2-agonist use (-0.41 puffs/day; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.09) compared with a similar dose of ICS alone. There was no significant group difference in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.15; 95% CI 0.64 to 2.09), any adverse events (RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09), study withdrawals (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.11), or withdrawals due to poor asthma control (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.41). In comparison 2, the combination of LABA and ICS was associated with a higher risk of patients requiring oral corticosteroids (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1 to 1.53) and study withdrawal (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.59) than a higher dose of ICS alone. For every 100 patients treated over 43 weeks, nine patients using a higher dose ICS compared to 11 (95% CI 9 to 14) on LABA and ICS suffered one or more exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids. There was a high level of statistical heterogeneity for FEV1 and morning peak flow. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of serious adverse events. Due to insufficient data we could not aggregate results for hospital admission, symptoms and other outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

In steroid-naive patients with mild to moderate airway obstruction, the combination of ICS and LABA does not significantly reduce the risk of patients with exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids over that achieved with a similar dose of ICS alone. However, it significantly improves lung function, reduces symptoms and marginally decreases rescue ss2-agonist use. Initiation of a higher dose of ICS is more effective at reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring rescue systemic corticosteroids, and of withdrawals, than combination therapy. Although children appeared to respond similarly to adults, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding combination therapy in steroid-naive children, given the small number of children contributing data.

Managing Exacerbations in Children 5 Years and Younger

Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms, increased coughing (especially at night), lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impaired daily activities including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication.

Managing Exacerbations at Home

Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an impending exacerbation, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required. Initial treatment at home is with inhaled SABA, with review after 1 hour or earlier. If inhaled SABA is needed more often than every 3 hours or for > 24 hours, treatment by a health provider is needed on the same day. Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to initial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children younger than 1 year.

Rationale

Most children with wheezing due to asthma respond to SABA. There is insufficient evidence for parent-initiated OCS in this age group. Preemptive, episodic, parent-initiated high-dose nebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent virally triggered wheezing, but there are no long-term studies, and there is a high risk of side effects; it should only be considered if the clinician is confident that it will be used appropriately and that the child will be monitored closely for side effects.

Managing Exacerbations in Primary Care or Acute Care Facility

Assess the severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2–6 puffs every 20 min for first hour) and controlled oxygen to maintain a saturation of 94–98%. Arrange immediate transfer to a hospital if the child shows no response to inhaled SABA within 1–2 hours, is unable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate > 40/min or is cyanosed, has oxygen saturation < 92% on room air, or cannot be safely cared for at home.

For children attending an ED or admitted to hospital with asthma, consider systemic corticosteroids: oral prednisone/prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/d for up to 5 days (maximum of 20 mg/d for children 0–2 years and 30 mg/d for children 3–5 yr) or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/d for 2 days.

Inhaled corticosteroid dose categories and monitoring: The table of low, medium and high doses of various inhaled corticosteroids, alone or in combination with LABA, does not imply potency equivalence; if switching from a 'medium' dose of one inhaled corticosteroid to a 'medium' dose of another, this may represent a decrease or increase in potency with risks of instability or adverse effects, and after any change of treatment or inhaler device, patients should be monitored to ensure stability.

### Bronchodilatory effect of inhaled budesonide / formoterol and budesonide / salbutamol in acute asthma: a double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^111vfA5c]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

The results of our study and other studies suggest that formoterol has rapid bronchodilator action similar to salbutamol or terbutaline and possibly can be used as rescue drug for acute exacerbations in children. We had earlier compared bronchodilator action of two long acting beta agonists (formoterol and salmeterol) at 60 min in a randomized controlled trial and observed similar improvement in FEV1. In this study, no comparisons were done in first 10 min of administration of the drugs. International guidelines recommend against monotherapy with LABA in the management of asthma.

However, there are few concerns regarding long-term, frequent use of LABAs. The extent of tolerance to β-adrenoceptor agonists is dependent on the dose and duration of treatment. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in adults by Haney and Hancox assessed tolerance to the bronchodilator action of salbutamol during ongoing treatment with long-acting beta-agonist. They concluded that the bronchodilator response to salbutamol was significantly reduced in patients taking formoterol. Clinically relevant tolerance to rescue beta-agonist treatment may occur in patients treated with long-acting beta-agonists. Therefore, it is important to document that repeated doses of formoterol as rescue drugs will not affect response to treatment in acute exacerbation of asthma.

A systematic review evaluated the effects of the combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids versus a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids on the risk of asthma exacerbations. The authors concluded that combination of LABA and ICS was more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ICS in adolescents and adults; in children there was no significant reduction, but rather a trend towards an increased risk of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions was observed. Hence, the issue of safety in children on long term use is yet to be resolved.

The strength of our study was that it was a double blind, randomized controlled trial with adequate sample size. We enrolled children with mild acute exacerbation of asthma. We used metered dose inhalers to deliver single dose (two actuations of MDI for each drug) as these devices are commonly used in the management of asthma. Unlike previous studies, we used a combination of ICS and formoterol. Clinical and spirometric parameters were monitored as early as 1-min post administration of the drug and frequent observations at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min were done.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^111eSM5A]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Yellow zone interventions — potential interventions include repetitive use of inhaled short-acting β agonist (SABA) via metered dose inhaler or nebulizer, scheduled step-up of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and symptom-driven controller with reliever therapy (dynamic dosing or adjustable maintenance dosing [AMD]). The regular scheduled use of SABA as the sole treatment for symptoms in the yellow zone is discouraged because it does not consistently prevent progression to the red zone and might increase the risk of progression. Patients who are treated with daily ICS therapy can be advised to increase their total 24-hour ICS dose, for example, by 4-fold, and while the EPR2 guidelines had recommended doubling the dose of ICS, EPR3 discouraged the use of doubling ICS doses and mentioned that "preliminary evidence indicates that quadrupling the dose of an ICS for 7 days, starting at the first appearance of worsening symptoms, may prevent exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids". Methods for dynamic dosing include separate use of reliever (SABA) and controller inhalers in combination or use of single inhalers that contain a reliever (SABA or quick-onset long-acting β agonists [LABA] such as formoterol) and a controller used for symptom relief with accompanying escalation in controller therapy; although the 2 approaches are effective, a single inhaler with formoterol as the reliever and controller (AMD) is more convenient and has been widely studied and used in other countries. A recent evidence-based review demonstrated that the AMD strategy can decrease exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS) compared with current best-practice strategies, although the authors do not recommend use of this approach in children and adolescents younger than 18 years because large-scale studies have not been conducted in this age group.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115qmiYJ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol — evidence and key findings for mild asthma (Steps 1–2): Use for symptom relief in adults and adolescents is supported by four randomized controlled trials and by systematic review and meta-analysis; the two largest studies were double-blind and two were pragmatic open-label. A large double-blind study found a 64% reduction in severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS) compared with SABA-only treatment, and a Cochrane meta-analysis reported reductions of 55% for severe exacerbations requiring OCS and 65% for emergency department visits or hospitalizations versus SABA alone. Two large double-blind studies showed as-needed budesonide-formoterol was non-inferior for severe exacerbations compared with regular ICS, and two open-label randomized controlled trials found it was superior to maintenance ICS in reducing severe exacerbations. Additional findings were that in all four studies the strategy was associated with a substantially lower average ICS dose than maintenance low-dose ICS, clinical outcomes were similar in adolescents as in adults, a post hoc analysis showed that a day with > 2 doses reduced the short-term (21 day) risk versus as needed terbutaline alone, and no new safety signals were seen.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and one important outcome (rescue medication use) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 9 is in EtD Table XIII in Appendix B.

Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence, compared SABA alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief. This treatment resulted in a 33% relative risk (RR) reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Two of these three trials assessed growth but found different effects on this outcome. Ducharme et alfound a 5% lower gain in height and weight in study participants receiving intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily at onset of a respiratory tract infection for up to 10 days) than in participants receiving a placebo. The authors noted a significant correlation between the cumulative dose of fluticasone and changes in height. In contrast, Bacharier et aldid not find an effect on linear growth of budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) in comparison with placebo in children with an "identified respiratory tract illness". Whether these differences in growth effects were due to differences in drugs, doses, duration of treatment, or other factors is not clear.

Rationale and discussion

The main comparator for which data are available is SABA-only therapy. The demonstrated efficacy but conflicting data regarding the effect of a short course of a daily ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy on growth led the Expert Panel to develop a conditional recommendation for this therapy starting at the on set of an apparent respiratory tract infection for children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing. Although one study that compared short ICS courses with regular daily ICS treatment showed no differences in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids with moderate certainty of evidence, the Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison because this study was not adequately powered to demonstrate equivalence. No studies produced robust data on comparisons of intermittent ICS use with no treatment or a nonpharmacologic therapy.

Question 4.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of intermittent ICS compared to ICS controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

Recommendation 10: In individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends either daily low-dose ICS and as needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Steroid inhaler laryngitis… [^115J25Eu]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

The dosage was increased to 440 µg twice daily less than 1 month later. The patient subsequently developed hoarseness and throat clearing in addition to his cough. He did admit to some heartburn. Laryngeal examination revealed diffuse glottic erythema, granularity and leukoplakia of the vocal cords, and pale, thickened interarytenoid mucosa. Steroid inhalers are the first line of treatment for RAD of all severity. It has long been known that one of the most common adverse effects of inhaled steroid therapy is irritation of the upper aerodigestive tract. Common symptoms include pharyngitis, hoarseness, throat clearing, and cough. These symptoms occur with all steroid inhalant preparations, and appear to be dose related. 6, 8, 9, 12 It is likely that the steroid, not the propellant, is responsible for the local adverse effects in the laryngopharynx.

Babu and Samuel8 evaluated the upper aerodigestive tracts of 48 consecutive patients who were receiving inhaled steroid therapy. While 20% of patients admitted to voice changes, 46% had "congested erythematous vocal cords" on examination, and 8. 5% were reported to have adductor palsies, with vocal cord bowing. Only after the patients discontinued using the steroid inhaler did they have complete resolution of their throat symptoms, especially their hoarseness. Adequate treatment of severe SIL requires cessation of steroid inhaler therapy, if possible, and aggressive treatment of underlying LPR, if present. Mild symptoms of SIL with mild vocal cord changes were adequately treated with cessation of their inhaled steroid therapy. It is likely that most patients with mild symptoms of SIL do not seek medical attention for their laryngopharyngeal symptoms.

Steroid inhaler laryngitis is a distinct clinical entity with symptoms localized to the upper aerodigestive tract, including hoarseness, throat clearing, and cough. Laryngeal findings can range from minimal to severe. Patients with severe laryngeal changes are more likely to have significant LPR coexistent with SIL. Adequate treatment involves cessation or reduction of inhaled steroid therapy and treatment of underlying LPR, if present. The otolaryngologist needs to be able to recognize this condition and be familiar with its treatment. Any workup of dysphonia requires a thorough history of inhaler use.

### Adrenal suppression by aerosol… [^114n91U1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

LINDER WR. Adrenal Suppression by Aerosol: Steroid Inhalation. Arch Intern Med. 1964; 113: 655–656. doi: 10.1001/archinte.1964.00280110035006 Because of the beneficial and often lifesaving effects of hydrocortisone and its analogues in the treatment of bronchial asthma, a number of attempts have been made to use these steroids by inhalation. 1–8 In the main, the reasons for this approach were twofold: the large proportion of the dose that can be delivered to the site of the desired action in the tracheobronchial tree, and a theoretical consideration that inhalation steroids should have minimal systemic effect. There is little reason to doubt that the first of these reasons has been achieved. However, in review of the literature the second aim of affording minimal systemic absorption has not been reasonably proved. The purpose of this study was to determine whether steroids introduced by inhalation technique have a significant systemic absorption.

The product tested was a new inhalant containing dexamethasone, isoproterenol, and an inert propellant. Materials and Methods Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Inhaled steroid use and asthma control in patients with… [^1115HpBe]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Can patients with mild persistent asthma safely decrease or eliminate inhaled steroids and still maintain adequate asthma control. Andrea: Inhaled steroids remain the standard of care for patients with mild persistent asthma, 1 yet there are concerns about the safety of long-term use, particularly in children. Additionally, many patients with mild asthma only use their controller medications intermittently. Is it possible to safely decrease the use of inhaled steroids, or change the inhaled steroids to a nonsteroidal controller medication, and still maintain adequate asthma control. Treatment failure was defined as hospitalization or urgent visit related to asthma, use of systemic corticosteroids, open-label introduction of additional inhaled corticosteroids, use of 10 or more puffs of albuterol over 48 hours, FEV 1 of at least 20 percent below baseline, or peak expiratory flow rate of less than 35 percent of baseline.

This is especially important given the FDA Public Health Advisory on long-acting beta 2 agonists. It specifically recommends against the addition of these agents in patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low to moderate doses of inhaled steroids because of the increased risk of severe asthma episodes and death. 3 Low to moderate dosing of fluticasone is 88 to 440 mcg daily in adults.

1. **Mark**: Remember to classify and treat patients with asthma according to the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines. 1 Inhaled steroids are still the mainstay of treatment for persistent asthma. Further, I'd hesitate to add a long-acting beta 2 agonist to a regimen just to decrease inhaled steroid use because there is a broad dosing range for low to moderate steroid use; leukotriene inhibitors are available for patients who do not tolerate inhaled steroids; and there is concern about the safety of long-acting beta 2 agonists.

Main Points Use the 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines to appropriately classify and treat patients with asthma to improve asthma outcomes. Avoid adding long-acting beta 2agonists in patients with mild or moderate asthma unless they are failing treatment with low to moderate doses of inhaled steroids. Inhaled steroids are the preferred anti-inflammatory in asthma. Leukotriene inhibitors are an option for those patients who are unable to comply with inhaled steroid use.

### Steroid inhalers increase fracture risk in COPD… [^1134e99R]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question: Does the use of inhaled corticosteroids in typical doses increase the long-term risk of fracture. Bottom Line: The use of inhaled corticosteroids as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in older adults increases the fracture risk somewhat, with a number needed to treat to harm of 83 over 3 years. This must be balanced against a number needed to treat of 6 per year to prevent exacerbations. Reference: Loke YK, Cavallazzi R, Singh S. Risk of fractures with inhaled corticosteroids in COPD: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Thorax 2011; 66: 699–708. Study Design: Systematic Review Funding Source: Government.

Setting: Outpatient Synopsis: Previous studies have been mixed regarding the effect of inhaled corticosteroids like budesonide and fluticasone on bone density, and individual trials have been underpowered to look at the patient-oriented outcome of fractures. These authors did a careful search to identify all randomized trials and observational studies comparing a group of patients with COPD who received a corticosteroid with a group of similar patients who did not. This included placebo-controlled studies, and studies where both groups also received another drug, such as a long-acting beta agonist. The authors identified 16 randomized controlled trials with 17, 513 patients, as well as 7 large cross-sectional or nested case-control studies with approximately 69, 000 patients. The RCTs ranged from 24 weeks to 156 weeks in duration, with patient age means in the 60s.

Allocation concealment and randomization methodology were adequate for approximately half the studies and unclear in the rest. A single large 3-year clinical trial with 3088 patients dominated the results, accounting for a majority of fractures. The relative risk for any fracture was 1. 27 in the RCTs, with a 95% confidence interval from

1. 01 to 1. 58, and a number needed to treat to harm of 83 over 3 years. The observational studies found similar results.
