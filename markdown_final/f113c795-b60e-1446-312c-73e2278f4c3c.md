## Question

Does flaxseed affect muscle hypertrophy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether flaxseed affects muscle hypertrophy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes direct evidence for hypertrophy outcomes in humans. Then, I should verify whether any of the provided studies actually measured muscle size or fiber hypertrophy with flaxseed. Next, I will examine indirect or mechanistic plausibility, including omega-3s, protein content, and anti-inflammatory effects. After that, I should review broader nutrition–exercise literature to contextualize expectations. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and outline practical implications and knowledge gaps.

> Let me first confirm the core question and the evidentiary bar. Muscle hypertrophy refers to an increase in muscle fiber cross-sectional area or whole-muscle size, typically assessed by imaging or biopsy in research settings, and the most relevant evidence would be randomized controlled trials in humans that directly measured hypertrophy with flaxseed versus control, ideally alongside resistance training. Wait, let me verify whether any of the included studies meet that bar before drawing conclusions.

> I will now examine the provided literature for direct hypertrophy outcomes. Hold on, I should verify study endpoints carefully: the flaxseed meta-analyses and RCTs in this set focus on cardiometabolic outcomes — blood pressure, lipids, glycemia, weight/BMI, and inflammatory markers — not on muscle size or fiber hypertrophy. None report muscle cross-sectional area, fiber hypertrophy, or appendicular lean mass changes attributable to flaxseed, so there is no direct evidence here to claim a hypertrophy effect from flaxseed in humans [^dc05b572] [^44ec1e25] [^4aaee256] [^e8b634dc].

> Next, I should review indirect or mechanistic plausibility. Flaxseed is rich in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 precursor, and has anti-inflammatory effects that could theoretically modulate muscle protein synthesis or recovery. Let me consider whether ALA conversion to EPA/DHA and downstream effects could influence hypertrophy; however, conversion is inefficient in humans, and the clinical literature linking long-chain omega-3s to hypertrophy is mixed and often context-dependent, with stronger signals for recovery or anti-catabolic effects in some populations rather than direct hypertrophy augmentation in healthy, trained adults [^notfound] [^609aeb99] [^423c5915].

> But wait, what if the protein content of flaxseed contributes meaningfully to muscle protein synthesis? Flaxseed contains about 18–20% protein, but the provided evidence base does not test flaxseed as a protein source for RET-induced hypertrophy. I should double-check the protein supplementation literature: when protein is supplemented during resistance training, benefits on lean mass accretion are modest on average and highly dependent on baseline protein intake, age, and training status; moreover, plant proteins can support hypertrophy when total protein and per-meal leucine thresholds are met, but flaxseed has not been isolated as a superior protein source in this context in the available evidence [^6657e910] [^40ef4af0] [^1df3c538].

> I need to ensure I am not overlooking any niche or special populations. Some meta-analyses in older adults suggest that multi-ingredient or protein-containing supplements can augment resistance training gains, but these effects are inconsistent and often small; importantly, the flaxseed studies in this set did not target older adults or measure muscle outcomes, so extrapolation would be speculative. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — without direct hypertrophy endpoints, any claim for flaxseed would be inference from general nutrition principles rather than trial data [^2de478a5] [^8e4d4428].

> Let me synthesize the evidence quality. Direct evidence: none. Indirect evidence: plausible but unproven, given low conversion of ALA to EPA/DHA and the absence of flaxseed-specific hypertrophy trials. Mechanistic rationale: weak-to-moderate, with anti-inflammatory effects that might aid recovery but no demonstrated translation to greater hypertrophy in humans. Overall, the certainty that flaxseed enhances hypertrophy is very low based on this corpus, and any effect, if present, is likely small and context-dependent.

> I should confirm practical implications and safety. Flaxseed can be included as part of a balanced diet for its cardiovascular and metabolic benefits, but it should not be relied upon as a primary strategy to increase muscle size. Standard hypertrophy principles remain foundational: progressive resistance training, adequate total protein intake (about 1.2–2.0 g/kg/day depending on age and training status), and per-meal protein distribution with sufficient leucine are the evidence-based levers. If flaxseed is used, it can contribute omega-3s, fiber, and some protein, but expectations for muscle growth should be modest and secondary to training and total protein adequacy [^6657e910] [^1df3c538].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations and next steps. The absence of flaxseed-specific hypertrophy trials is a key gap. Future research should directly test flaxseed or flaxseed oil alongside resistance training with validated hypertrophy endpoints, control for total protein and fatty acid intake, and consider population-specific effects such as in older adults or those with low omega-3 status. Until such data exist, clinicians should avoid overstating hypertrophy claims for flaxseed and emphasize established training and nutrition strategies for muscle growth.

There is **no direct evidence** that flaxseed supplementation enhances muscle hypertrophy in humans. While flaxseed's omega-3s and anti-inflammatory effects may theoretically support muscle protein synthesis and recovery, clinical trials have not tested hypertrophy outcomes. The only available human data show flaxseed improves metabolic and inflammatory markers [^609aeb99] [^e8b634dc] without demonstrating gains in muscle mass or size. Therefore, flaxseed should not be considered a hypertrophy supplement; prioritize resistance training and adequate protein intake for muscle growth [^9ddb8f01] [^6657e910].

---

## Nutritional composition of flaxseed relevant to muscle hypertrophy

Flaxseed is rich in nutrients that could theoretically influence muscle hypertrophy:

- **Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)**: An omega-3 fatty acid that may have anti-inflammatory properties and could potentially influence muscle protein synthesis [^0ae51f03].

- **Lignans**: Phytoestrogens with antioxidant properties that may modulate inflammation and oxidative stress [^notfound].

- **Protein**: Flaxseed contains approximately 18% protein, providing essential amino acids necessary for muscle repair and growth [^9ed44e21].

- **Fiber**: High fiber content may influence nutrient absorption and metabolism, potentially impacting muscle growth indirectly [^0c092060].

---

## Mechanisms potentially influencing muscle hypertrophy

Several mechanisms have been proposed by which flaxseed could influence muscle hypertrophy:

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Chronic inflammation can impair muscle protein synthesis. Flaxseed's omega-3 fatty acids and lignans may reduce inflammation, potentially supporting muscle growth [^609aeb99].

- **Enhanced muscle protein synthesis**: Omega-3 fatty acids may stimulate muscle protein synthesis by activating the mTOR pathway, although evidence is limited and primarily from in vitro or animal studies [^notfound].

- **Improved insulin sensitivity**: Flaxseed may enhance insulin sensitivity, potentially improving nutrient delivery to muscles and supporting hypertrophy [^notfound].

---

## Evidence from human studies

Despite theoretical mechanisms, **human evidence directly linking flaxseed to muscle hypertrophy is lacking**. Most studies have focused on metabolic outcomes, cardiovascular health, and inflammatory markers rather than muscle mass or hypertrophy. For example:

- **Metabolic effects**: Flaxseed supplementation has been shown to improve lipid profiles, reduce blood pressure, and enhance glycemic control, but these studies did not assess muscle hypertrophy outcomes [^c9fd7f19] [^dc05b572] [^e8b634dc].

- **Inflammatory markers**: Flaxseed has been shown to reduce inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which could theoretically support muscle growth, but direct evidence is absent [^609aeb99] [^39ea9f85].

- **Weight management**: Some studies have explored flaxseed's role in weight loss and body composition, but none have specifically demonstrated increased muscle mass or hypertrophy [^c18f643f] [^4aaee256].

---

## Comparison with other supplements

Compared with established supplements such as whey protein, creatine, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), **flaxseed lacks direct evidence** for enhancing muscle hypertrophy. Whey protein and creatine have extensive evidence supporting their efficacy in increasing muscle mass and strength, whereas flaxseed does not [^6657e910] [^5f3cd17c].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

Several limitations and gaps exist in the current research regarding flaxseed and muscle hypertrophy:

- **Lack of direct studies**: No randomized controlled trials have specifically investigated the effects of flaxseed supplementation on muscle hypertrophy in humans.

- **Indirect evidence**: Most available evidence is indirect, focusing on metabolic and inflammatory outcomes rather than muscle mass or hypertrophy.

- **Dose and duration**: Optimal dosing and duration of flaxseed supplementation for muscle hypertrophy remain unknown.

- **Population specificity**: Studies have not specifically targeted athletes or individuals engaged in resistance training, limiting applicability to hypertrophy contexts.

---

## Practical implications and recommendations

Given the current evidence, **flaxseed should not be considered a primary supplement** for muscle hypertrophy. Individuals aiming to increase muscle mass should prioritize:

- **Resistance training**: Engage in regular, progressive resistance training to stimulate muscle growth [^9ddb8f01].

- **Adequate protein intake**: Ensure sufficient protein intake (approximately 1.6–2.2 g/kg body weight per day) from high-quality sources [^6657e910].

- **Established supplements**: Consider evidence-based supplements such as whey protein, creatine, and BCAAs to support muscle growth [^5f3cd17c].

Flaxseed may be included in the diet for its general health benefits, including cardiovascular and anti-inflammatory effects, but **should not be relied upon** for muscle hypertrophy.

---

## Conclusion and future research directions

In summary, there is **no direct evidence** that flaxseed supplementation enhances muscle hypertrophy in humans. While theoretical mechanisms exist, clinical trials have not demonstrated significant gains in muscle mass or size. Future research should include randomized controlled trials specifically investigating flaxseed's effects on muscle hypertrophy, considering factors such as dosage, duration, and population specificity. Until such evidence is available, flaxseed should not be considered a primary supplement for muscle hypertrophy.

### Can flaxseed supplementation alleviate blood pressure in patients with metabolic diseases? Evaluating the strength of evidence using a meta-analysis and GRADE approach [^dc05b572]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Many clinical trials indicate that flaxseed supplementation may exhibit a significant antihypertensive effect, although the findings are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was conducted to provide a more accurate assessment of the impact of flaxseed supplementation on blood pressure in patients with metabolic diseases.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search of international databases, such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central, with data collection continuing until July 2024. We employed a random-effects model for calculating weighted mean differences (WMDs) to ensure robust analysis.

Results

Meta-analysis of 18 trials (comprising 22 treatment arms) with 1,209 participants revealed significant reductions in both systolic (WMD: -4.30 mmHg; 95% CI: -6.64 to -1.96, p < 0.001; I² = 95.2%, p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD = -2.50 mmHg; 95% CI: -3.88, -1.12, p < 0.001; I² = 95.0%, p < 0.001) following flaxseed supplementation. More significant effects on SBP and DBP were found in trials with an intervention duration of 10–20 weeks, whole flaxseed, subjects with BMI 25–30 kg/m², and in patients with hypertension.

Conclusion

Flaxseed products have been shown to lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels significantly. Together with traditional medicine, flaxseed may be an effective supplement for hypertension treatment.

### Impact of fatty acids on obesity-associated diseases and radical weight reduction [^0ae51f03]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, the number of people with obesity throughout the world has almost tripled since 1975. Obesity was once considered a problem of rich and intensively developing countries, but it is now thought to affect people with low and medium socioeconomic status. In individuals with obesity, the amount of energy supplied is much higher than the body's need, which results in excessive fat accumulation due to hypertrophy and/or adipocyte hyperplasia. An energy imbalance results from taking in more calories than is required for body health and function. Every year, the percentage of overweight people increases due to the popularity of consuming foods high in fat and carbohydrates. Undoubtedly, body weight is also significantly influenced by eating habits, e.g. overeating, too long or too short breaks between meals, and eating to relieve negative emotions or anxiety. In addition, people who have limited physical activity tend to gain weight. Their volume of lipid droplets in skeletal muscle is increased. Lower rates of triglyceride turnover, diminished oxidative enzyme activity, and lipid oxidation are also observed. These mechanisms lead to adipose tissue retention. The energy contained in dietary fat comes mainly from saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids. The most common SFA are palmitic and stearic acid, which are usually consumed in the diet in excessive amounts. A recommended intake for these acids has not yet been established, nor has an upper safe dietary level. SFA are considered to adversely affect human health, because any increase in their content carries the risk of coronary heart disease or an increased concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Fatty acids are stored in lipid droplets within adipocytes in the form of triglycerides. Excess fatty acid accumulation leads to an increase in mature adipocyte size. Hypertrophic adipocytes tend to be insulin resistant. This results in greater lipolysis with less lipogenesis. Thus, increased fatty acid flux away from adipose tissue represents a key feature in the pathophysiology of the metabolic complications in obese individuals, such as poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. MUFAs coexist with SFA in foods, especially in animal products. The most important food sources of MUFA are olive oil, animal fats (oleic acid, myristoleic, and palmitoleic acids) and rapeseed oil (erucic acid). PUFA constitute an important group of human nutrients. Unlike SFA, not all PUFA can be synthesized by human and animal tissues. This is due to a lack of special enzyme systems (Δ 12 -desaturase and Δ 15 -desaturase) which would insert unsaturated bonds in positions 3 and 6 of the carbon chain. In animal tissues, it is only possible to remodel such chains and produce other polyunsaturated acid chains from them. Therefore, linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) belong to the so-called EFAs (essential unsaturated fatty acids) and they must be derived from dietary sources. Unsaturated fatty acids are irreplaceable in young organisms for proper growth and development processes and contribute to the maintenance of good health throughout life. They have a role in building cellular membranes throughout the body and stimulate multiple signaling events in various tissues, mainly via eicosanoids derived from them and via direct effects on gene expression. Moreover, studies have shown anti-inflammatory properties for long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), which directly modulate the activity of the key pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. EPA and DHA have established cardiovascular benefits. Fatty acids in serum cholesteryl esters regulate cholesterol homeostasis by participating in the transport and oxidation of cholesterol. For example, n-3 PUFA reduce endogenous triglyceride synthesis and enhance the blood clearance of triglyceride-rich particles, stimulate the inhibition of lipogenesis, promote fat oxidation and reduce fat deposition, thereby counteracting obesity and dyslipidemia. Omega‑3 fatty acids may also reduce insulin resistance, which is of importance in diabetes prevention. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess fatty acid profile in relation to obesity, obesity-associated diseases, and weight reduction. We considered that an investigation in obese individuals might be important in determining an individual's risk of developing lipid and carbohydrate disturbances and might also provide useful information about the role of selected fatty acids in metabolic alterations, inflammation, and maintaining weight loss. We verified also the influence of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene variant (Taq1B) on fatty acid contents. It is speculated that variations in the CETP gene may modulate the effects of dietary components on metabolic traits and individuals homozygous for the B2 genotype have higher HDL-C concentrations and reduced risk of the metabolic syndrome than those with the B1 homozygous genotype. In the present study, chemometric approach has been proposed as an objective method for the evaluation and data interpretation of large data sets of fatty acid share in serum samples of three groups of patients (individuals with obesity, with obesity and co-existing dyslipidemia, and with obesity and co-existing diabetes).

3.2.4 Impact of flaxseed supplementation on hs‐CRP

As shown in Figure 3H, the random‐effects meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model of three trials showed that there was a significant reduction in hs‐CRP levels (WMD = −1.35 mg/L; 95% CI: −1.93, −0.77, p < .01; I² = 11.04%), following supplementation with flaxseed products.

3.3 Publication bias

There was no significant indication of publication bias in Egger's linear regression test for trials examining the impact of flaxseed supplementation on FBS (p = .73), TG (p = .95), TC (p = .23), HDL‐c (p = .98), LDL‐c (p = .94), weight (p = .14), and hs‐CRP (p = .21) levels. With respect to BMI, we found significant publication bias (p = .03). However, after conducting a trim‐and‐fill sensitivity analysis including censored studies, we found that the pooled WMD for BMI remained unchanged. Visual examination of the funnel plots, shown in Figure S2, found no evidence of possible publication bias.

3.4 Certainty of evidence

Table 2 presents the certainty of the evidence pertaining to the outcomes obtained by employing a revised GRADE method. The certainty of the evidence was deemed to be low for the three outcomes and very low for the five other outcomes that were taken into account. The primary factors that resulted in downgrading the certainty of the evidence included bias, indirectness, and imprecision.

### The effect of flaxseed supplementation on anthropometric indices, blood pressure, and lipid profile in diabetic patients: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^4aaee256]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Numerous clinical studies have suggested that flaxseed supplementation may be effective in diabetic patients, but the findings are controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of flaxseed on blood pressure, anthropometry, and lipid profile parameters in diabetic patients.

Methods

PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase databases, and Google Scholar were searched until June 2024. A random-effects model was utilized to analyze standardized mean differences (SMDs).

Results

Meta-analysis of 16 trials with 1136 participants indicated significant improvements in weight (SMD: 0.81; 95% CI: 1.54 to -0.09, p = 0.028; I² = 88.7%, p < 0.001), waist circumference (SMD: 1.54; 95% CI: 2.77 to -0.31, p = 0.002; I² = 85.3%, p < 0.001), and triglyceride (SMD: 0.56; 95% CI: 1.02 to -0.10, p = 0.016; I² = 87.4%, p < 0.001), but not BMI (SMD: 0.63; 95% CI: 1.28 to 0.02, p = 0.058; I² = 87.9%, p = 0.005), systolic blood pressure (SMD: 0.50; 95% CI: 1.25, 0.25, p = 0.193; I² = 87.6%, p < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (SMD: 0.74; 95% CI: 1.51, 0.03, p = 0.060; I² = 88.1%, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (SMD: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.99 to 0.12, p = 0.128; I² = 93.6%, p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (SMD: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.70, p = 0.830; I² = 96.3%, p < 0.001), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (SMD: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.46, p = 0.673; I² = 87.2%, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Flaxseed supplementation effectively reduces anthropometric indices and triglyceride levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes but does not suggest any benefit on blood pressure and other lipid profile parameters. Therefore, conducting more extensive, well-designed trials to validate these findings is crucial.

3.2.2 Impact of flaxseed supplementation on lipid profiles

Flaxseed supplementation did not have a noticeable impact on TG (WMD = −12.27 mg/dL; 95% CI: −27.44, 2.91, p = .11; I² = 59.59%), TC (WMD = −2.72 mg/dL; 95% CI: −11.31, 5.87, p = .53; I² = 0.0%), LDL‐c (WMD = 0.12 mg/dL; 95% CI: −6.74, 6.98, p = .97; I² = 5.69%), and HDL‐c levels (WMD = 0.80 mg/dL; 95% CI: −1.34, 2.94, p = .46; I² = 26.97%) according to the four‐trial random‐effects meta‐analysis compared with controls in patients with CAD (Figure 3B–E).

Based on the significant heterogeneity in TG levels between studies (p = .06, I² = 59.59%), we conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify the source of heterogeneity by excluding each study individually. After removing the study conducted by Talari et al.we observed a reduction in interstudy heterogeneity to I² = 37%. Moreover, flaxseed supplementation had a noticeable impact on TG levels (WMD = −18.39 mg/dL; 95% CI: −35.02, −1.75) after excluding this particular trial (Figure S1).

3.2.3 Impact of flaxseed supplementation on weight loss

There was no significant effect of flaxseed supplementation on weight (WMD = −0.05 kg; 95% CI: −0.39, 0.28, p = .75; I² = 0.0%) and BMI (WMD = 0.01 kg/m²; 95% CI: −0.11, 0.12, p = .88; I² = 0.0%) according to the pooled results using the random‐effects model from five trials in patients with CAD (Figure 3F, G).

### An evidence-based narrative review of mechanisms of resistance exercise-induced human skeletal muscle hypertrophy [^9ddb8f01]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Skeletal muscle plays a critical role in physical function and metabolic health. Muscle is a highly adaptable tissue that responds to resistance exercise (RE; loading) by hypertrophying, or during muscle disuse, RE mitigates muscle loss. Resistance exercise training (RET)–induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a product of external (e.g. RE programming, diet, some supplements) and internal variables (e.g. mechanotransduction, ribosomes, gene expression, satellite cells activity). RE is undeniably the most potent nonpharmacological external variable to stimulate the activation/suppression of internal variables linked to muscular hypertrophy or countering disuse-induced muscle loss. Here, we posit that despite considerable research on the impact of external variables on RET and hypertrophy, internal variables (i.e. inherent skeletal muscle biology) are dominant in regulating the extent of hypertrophy in response to external stimuli. Thus, identifying the key internal skeletal muscle–derived variables that mediate the translation of external RE variables will be pivotal to determining the most effective strategies for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in healthy persons. Such work will aid in enhancing function in clinical populations, slowing functional decline, and promoting physical mobility. We provide up-to-date, evidence-based perspectives of the mechanisms regulating RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.

### A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults [^40ef4af0]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Resistance exercise training (RET) in combination with dietary protein supplementation is a common practice, in athletes and recreational exercisers alike, with the aim of enhancing RET-induced gains in muscle mass and strength. Recognised as a potent antisarcopenic stimulus, protein supplementation has also been advocated for ageing persons participating in RET. Despite a large volume of work in this area, narrative reviewsand even meta-analysesyield conflicting results as to the actual effectiveness of protein supplementation to enhance RET-mediated gains in muscle mass and strength. This lack of agreement on the efficacy of protein supplementationis likely due to the use of divergent study inclusion criteria and inclusion of subjects with differing: ages, training statuses, total protein intakes, protein sources and protein doses. Thus, an evidence-based answer to the main question of the efficacy of protein supplementation, while previously reported, now appears to be controversial.

We conducted a meta-analysis that was more inclusive in nature than previous meta-analysesto provide a broad, systematic and evidence-based assessment on whether protein supplementation can augment changes in relevant RET outcomes. We used meta-regression to evaluate the impact of important potentially mediating covariates that were decided a priori to the meta-analysis. The present meta-analysis includes more than double the number of studies and participants than the largest published comprehensive meta-analysis on protein supplementation during RET to date.

We also undertook an additional rational, mechanism-based analysis that had the aim of answering the following question: is there a protein intake beyond which protein supplementation ceases to provide a measurable benefit in increasing muscle mass during RET? To answer this question, we recognised that the process of muscle protein synthesis (MPS), as the primary determinant of muscle hypertrophy, shows a saturable dose-response relationship with increasing protein intake. Since measures of MPS show good agreement with hypertrophywe theorised that the effect of daily protein intake on RET-induced changes in muscle mass would show a dose-responsive relationship but that this would ultimately plateau.

### Effectiveness of flaxseed consumption and fasting mimicking diet on anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, and hepatic features in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): a randomized controlled clinical trial [^9f388008]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our data indicate that the combination of FMD with flaxseed consumption is not superior to any of these interventions alone in the management of MASLD. Further research with different duration, larger sample size, and different forms of flaxseed (oil and whole seed) are needed to find the optimum dosage and duration of the supplementation.

### Effects of flaxseed supplementation on weight loss, lipid profiles, glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^8493bb60]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

The findings showed that flaxseed intake had a positive impact on the reduction of TG, FBS, and hs‐CRP levels in patients with CAD. This finding suggests that flaxseed consumption may significantly mitigate the overall risk factors associated with CAD. Future research should focus on designing large, long‐term trials that minimize bias and adhere to current reporting criteria for clinical trials. Additionally, it is important to assess whether any positive effects are sustained over time. Further RCTs are needed to investigate the effects of flaxseed supplementation on other cardiovascular consequences, such as stroke and myocardial infarction.

### Vegetarian dietary patterns for adults: a position paper of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [^1df3c538]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2025). High credibility.

Protein, muscle, and bone health in adults following plant-based diets — plant proteins can adequately support muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in active young adults, with older adults potentially requiring higher protein intakes, and there does not appear to be a detriment to MPS nor hypertrophy and strength outcomes when plant-protein ingestion achieves at least 1.5 g protein/kg/day.

### Muscle fiber hypertrophy and myonuclei addition: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a2dc43ff]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The myonuclear domain theory postulates that myonuclei are added to muscle fibers when increases in fiber cross-sectional area (i.e., hypertrophy) are ≥ 26%. However, recent studies have reported increased myonuclear content with lower levels (e.g., 12%) of muscle fiber hypertrophy.

Purpose

This study aimed to determine whether a muscle fiber hypertrophy "threshold" is required to drive the addition of new myonuclei to existing muscle fibers.

Methods

Studies of resistance training endurance training with or without nutrient (i.e., protein) supplementation and steroid administration with measures of muscle fiber hypertrophy and myonuclei number as primary or secondary outcomes were considered. Twenty-seven studies incorporating 62 treatment groups and 903 subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analyses.

Results

Muscle fiber hypertrophy of ≤ 10% induces increases in myonuclear content, although a significantly higher number of myonuclei are observed when muscle hypertrophy is ~22%. Additional analyses showed that age, sex, and muscle fiber type do not influence muscle fiber hypertrophy or myonuclei addition.

Conclusions

Although a more consistent myonuclei addition occurs when muscle fiber hypertrophy is > 22%, our results challenge the concept of a muscle hypertrophy threshold as significant myonuclei addition occurs with lower muscle hypertrophy (i.e., < 10%).

2.3 Data extraction

Two authors (M. A. and M. M.) independently extracted the following items from the eligible articles: first author's name, study location, publication year, main features of participants, sample size of participants in the flaxseed oil and placebo groups, duration and dosage of intervention, study type, intervention type, placebo type, baseline dietary intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate, and total fat in the intervention and placebo groups; the mean and SD for fasting blood glucose (FBS), lipid profiles (total cholesterol [TC], low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL‐c], triglycerides [TG], and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL‐c]), weight loss (weight and body mass index [BMI]), and inflammatory biomarkers (hs‐CRP) at baseline and the end of intervention in both the intervention and placebo groups. We only considered the outcomes in at least three clinical trials. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third author (M. R.).

2.4 Risk of bias (RoB) assessment

Applying the Cochrane RoB tool, the quality of the included articles was systematically as described elsewhere. Finally, as shown in Figure 1, the RoB in each trial was judged as low (green), high (red), or unclear (yellow).

2.5 Certainty of evidence assessment

The evaluation of the evidence for outcomes was carried out utilizing the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This process was led by two independent investigators, O. K. and M. A. who evaluated the certainty of the body of evidence based on criteria such as the presence of RoB, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and evidence of publication bias.

### Combination therapy of flaxseed and hesperidin enhances the effectiveness of lifestyle modification in cardiovascular risk control in prediabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^9e530cd1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes (PD) are nowadays serious health problems all over the world and are usually accompanied with other metabolic disorders such as obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular diseases, mainly due to insulin resistance.

The prevalence of people with prediabetes in the world is reported to be more than 25%, all of whom are at risk for diabetes and its complications. In addition to preclinical impaired glucose regulation, changes in insulin production, secretion from the pancreatic β-cells and its function in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver are some of the prominent hallmarks of pre-diabetes and T2DM. Lifestyle modifications (LSM) including increasing exercise and optimizing dietary composition have been proposed as a therapeutic and preventive strategy for PD. However, it has been shown that even though lifestyle modification strategies are adapted, many people with pre-diabetes will progress to T2DM.

Flaxseed and hesperidin may improve cardiovascular health due to their numerous attributes. Hesperidin and flaxseed have emerged as promising phyto-therapeutic agents, which may exert potential benefits on health mainly through improving the antioxidant status, and providing adequate fiber and omega-3, respectively. The therapeutic effects of these two compounds on metabolic dysregulation in PD can be attributed to their powerful biological properties on improving glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance.

Recently, several studies have shown anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties of hesperidin and flaxseed. Intake of omega-3 fatty acids and fiber, both of which are compounds of flaxseed, can contribute to reducing the risk of metabolic abnormalities. Beneficial effects of flaxseed on lowering plasma glucose in patients with diabetes as well as metabolic syndrome have been reported. Similar effects have been obtained with the consumption of flax lignan. Although hesperidin exerts many health benefits, its effects on blood glucose have been inconsistent in various studies, as in four studies, no effect was detected and in one study, blood sugar was reduced.

Although the beneficial effects of flaxseed and hesperidin on cardiometabolic risk factors have been shown previously, no study has evaluated the effects of their combinations on pre-diabetic patients. Considering lack of data on such combination therapies in patients with PD, we aimed to investigate whether patients following LSM program along with supplementing with 30 g milled brown flaxseed and one g hesperidin per day, would have better metabolic parameters compared with those who just follow the LSM program.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^b749ce86]. AND (2020). High credibility.

CKD: LC n-3 PUFA supplementation — risks, monitoring, and implementation. Adverse effects of capsule-based supplementation may lead to gastrointestinal side effects like stomach upset and eructation; theoretical risks like bleeding have not been borne out in clinical trials, and there is no need to routinely monitor dietary LC n-3 PUFA intake other than in the context of general dietary counselling. The clinical impact of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with CKD was challenging to assess due to short study durations, modest sample sizes, and heterogeneity; furthermore, baseline LC n-3 PUFA levels were not typically used to target populations that would most benefit, and benefits may be inversely related to baseline blood or tissue concentrations. LC n-3 PUFA supplementation considerations will differ depending on whether the intervention is diet-based or capsule-based; for dietary interventions, if the goal is to raise α-linolenic acid, supplementation should focus on soybean, flaxseed, and canola oils as well as meat and dairy products, whereas if the goal is to raise EPA or DHA, the primary dietary sources must be sardine, mackerel, salmon and other high-content marine-based foods; potential limitations include relatively high cost and difficulty in achieving high daily intake.

Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) — evidence summary: Thirty-five RCTs studied the impact of LC n-3 PUFA supplementation in adults with CKD 2-5D and kidney transplant; Twenty-four of these studies included patients receiving MHD, 1 study included PD, and most used fish oil with some using flaxseed oil or ground flaxseed. For all-cause mortality, 3 RCTs demonstrated no improvement in mortality with supplementation. Doses studied included 1.4 g/d of EPA + 0.96 g/d of DHA, 1.62 g/d of EPA + 1.08 g/d of DHA, and 0.77 g/d of EPA + 0.64 g/d of DHA over 1–2 years, with combined sample size n = 264. Two well-designed but modestly sized trials in MHD (combined n = 351) reported mixed results: 4 g/d of fish oil (1.6 g/d of EPA and 0.8 g/d of DHA) for 12 months versus corn oil–based placebo lowered the cardiovascular event rate (relative risk, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.20–0.85]; P = 0.02) and improved cardiovascular event–free survival (relative risk, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.19–0.96]; P = 0.04) but did not change the number of patients with 1 or more events (relative risk, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.55–1.09]; P = 0.15).

### Effects of flaxseed supplementation on weight loss, lipid profiles, glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^3ed624bf]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations that require attention. Initially, the absence of data in the included RCTs prevented the measurement of other well‐known risk factors for coronary heart disease, such as inflammatory markers. It is also important to consider the impact of confounding parameters, such as lifestyle factors and genetic background, on the effectiveness of flaxseed supplements, as well as their formulation. The relatively short intervention period and small sample size are acknowledged as the limitations of this study. However, it is worth noting that this is the first meta‐analysis to assess the effects of flaxseed administration on FBS, hs‐CRP, body weight loss, and lipid parameters in patients with CAD. Furthermore, efforts were made to minimize bias and heterogeneity in the review process through a comprehensive literature search and sensitivity analysis.

### Effect of flaxseed supplementation on markers of inflammation and endothelial function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^609aeb99]. Cytokine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The rationale for the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of flaxseed supplementation on important adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines in adults.

Methods

We conducted searches of published literature in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases from inception until May 2019. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which investigated the effects of flaxseed supplementation on the circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) were included in our analysis. Results were summarized using weighted mean differences (WMDs) by random-effects model.

Results

Forty eligible RCTs, including 2520 participants were identified. The results of the meta-analysis revealed flaxseed supplementation reduced the concentrations of CRP (WMD = -0.387 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.653, -0.121, p = 0.004), IL-6 (WMD = -0.154 pg/Ml; 95% CI: -0.299, -0.010, p = 0.036), and VCAM-1 (WMD = -22.809 ng/ml; 95% CI: -41.498, -4.120, p = 0.017) but had no significant effect on TNF-α (WMD = -0.077 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.317, 0.163, p = 0.530), ICAM-1 (WMD = -8.610 ng/ml; 95% CI: -21.936, 4.716, p = 0.205), and E-selectin (WMD = -1.427 ng/ml; 95% CI: -4.074, 1.22, p = 0.291).

Conclusions

These findings showed that flaxseed supplementation may improve some circulating concentrations of specific adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines. However, well-designed trials are needed to confirm the range of non-significant and/or equivocal findings.

The antidyslipidemic effects of flaxseed have been attributed to multiple mechanisms. Flaxseed, a rich source of ALA and secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, has been demonstrated to have antidyslipidemic properties. ALA undergoes conversion into long‐chain omega‐3 fatty acids and promotes cholesterol efflux from the macrophages. Its high polyphenol content may also contribute to its hypolipaemic effects. The high fiber content of flaxseed exerts antidyslipidemic effects by promoting satiety, reducing caloric intake, and reducing food transit time.

Askarpour et al.investigated the effects of flaxseed supplementation on proinflammatory markers and endothelial function in an overall population. A significant decrease in circulating CRP levels was observed in 35 RCTs, which is consistent with the findings of this study. In fact, a subgroup analysis conducted by the researchers showed that flaxseed significantly lowered CRP levels in unhealthy or overweight subjects. These effects were observed in RCTs that were given whole flaxseed or lignan supplements for more than 12 weeks. In contrast, another meta‐analysis did not find any significant beneficial effects of flaxseed or its derived products (such as lignans or flaxseed oil) on CRP levels in the general population. There have been several reported mechanisms to account for flaxseeds' ability to reduce inflammation. One such mechanism is the presence of ALA, a PUFA‐omega‐3 fatty acid found abundantly in flaxseeds. Long‐chain omega‐3 fatty acids, which are recognized to have anti‐inflammatory qualities, can be produced from ALA. ALA may not exert the same impacts on inflammation. Furthermore, the amount of fiber present in flaxseed may contribute to its ability to protect against inflammation by producing short‐chain fatty acids, such as propionate, acetate, and butyrate, which can reduce the activity of certain proinflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue. The discrepancies in the findings could be attributed to other factors, such as dietary components, lifestyle choices, or the genetic factors of the participants. Furthermore, various bioactive components found in flaxseed oil and flaxseed, as well as differences in production methods, compound stability, storage conditions, and the use of whole flaxseed or its derivatives, could affect bioavailability and subsequently affect the response of adhesion molecules and inflammatory markers.

### Effects of supplement timing and resistance exercise on skeletal muscle hypertrophy [^deb9072f]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Some studies report greater muscle hypertrophy during resistance exercise (RE) training from supplement timing (i.e., the strategic consumption of protein and carbohydrate before and/or after each workout). However, no studies have examined whether this strategy provides greater muscle hypertrophy or strength development compared with supplementation at other times during the day. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of supplement timing compared with supplementation in the hours not close to the workout on muscle-fiber hypertrophy, strength, and body composition during a 10-wk RE program.

Methods

In a single-blind, randomized protocol, resistance-trained males were matched for strength and placed into one of two groups; the PRE-POST group consumed a supplement (1 g × kg⁻¹ body weight) containing protein/creatine/glucose immediately before and after RE. The MOR-EVE group consumed the same dose of the same supplement in the morning and late evening. All assessments were completed the week before and after 10 wk of structured, supervised RE training. Assessments included strength (1RM, three exercises), body composition (DEXA), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies for determination of muscle fiber type (I, IIa, IIx), cross-sectional area (CSA), contractile protein, creatine (Cr), and glycogen content.

Results

PRE-POST demonstrated a greater (P < 0.05) increase in lean body mass and 1RM strength in two of three assessments. The changes in body composition were supported by a greater (P < 0.05) increase in CSA of the type II fibers and contractile protein content. PRE-POST supplementation also resulted in higher muscle Cr and glycogen values after the training program (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Supplement timing represents a simple but effective strategy that enhances the adaptations desired from RE-training.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect on human strength and endurance after resistance training and supplementation of vicia faba protein hydrolysate compared with placebo [^2e91bf37]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

VFH and resistance training significantly improved leg strength and muscular endurance in healthy untrained men and women over 56 days. While leg strength improved in both groups, significantly greater gains were observed in those supplemented with VFH. Changes in physical performance were supported by the modulation of myokines associated with metabolic and muscle function. Clinical and functional observations were supported by qualitative questionnaires, showing an improved self-assessed change in health (online supplemental file 10). VFH has been shown previously to support muscle recovery and repair. Given the effects of VFH peptides on the phosphorylation of S6, reduction in atrophy-associated genes and inflammation, we hypothesised that VFH may not only improve recovery, but also enhance performance.

Resistance training-induced strength gains can be attributed to muscular adaptation, characterised by hypertrophy and neural adaptations which stimulate agonistic muscles and increase peak force. The exercise programme significantly improved leg strength in both groups (p < 0.001). This is consistent with published findings describing the effects of an 8- week training programme on significant increases in 1RM tests. However, the VFH group showed additive effects on strength which were significantly greater compared with placebo (day 28; p = 0.045, day 56; 0.05, respectively). Gains may be supported by myokine analysis whereby significant fold increases were observed in IL-6, which, given its role in the promotion of satellite cell proliferation and differentiation, may have contributed to hypertrophy and physical conditioning. Upper body strength improved in both groups; however, no significant difference was observed with VFH supplementation. This may be explained by biomechanical differences and muscle mass disparity whereby quadriceps have greater potential for hypertrophy compared with upper body muscles.

Lateral thigh thickness

There was a significant difference between groups in improvements in vastus lateralis thickness, and strong evidence in favor of both a group effect and pretest effect over the null (P = 0.006; BF 10 = 63.87; Table 1; Figure 3 D). Post hoc comparisons showed a significant difference between one and five sets (Table 1). There was strong evidence in favor of five sets compared to one set (BF 10 = 38.14) and weak evidence in favor of three sets compared with one set (BF 10 = 1.42) and five sets compared to three sets (BF 10 = 2.25).

Diet

There were no significant differences between groups in changes in self-reported kilocalorie or macronutrient intake (Table 1). There was positive evidence in favor of baseline differences in self-reported kilocalorie intake (BF 10 = 10.26; Table 1), but only weak evidence in favor of baseline differences in self-reported macronutrient intake (1 < BF 10 < 3, Table 2).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Search results and characteristics of included trails

The literature search yielded 531 reports. After removing duplicate articles (n = 318), 420 articles were left, 113 of which were disqualified based on their titles and abstracts. Finally, the full texts of 17 pertinent papers were retrieved for evaluation in accordance with the inclusion eligibility criteria. Eleven of these were omitted for the following reasons: not measuring the outcomes of interest (n = 4), performed with other study designs (n = 1), not population with CAD (n = 5), and not controlled for flaxseed/flaxseed oil (n = 1). Finally, six clinical trials, that were published between 2017 and 2022 were selected for the current meta‐analysis. Figure 2 shows the step‐by‐step process used to identify and select included articles.

Figure 2
Flowchart of study identification and selection process.

Overall, 309 participants were randomized and completed the study period, of which 153 were randomly allocated to the flaxseed supplementation group and 156 to the placebo group in the six included clinical trials. FBS and hs‐CRP levels were investigated in three trials, lipid profiles in four, and weight and BMI in five. The intervention lasted between 10 and 24 weeks, and all the included trials used a parallel study design. Table 1 summarizes the general features of the six trials.

3.2.1 Impact of flaxseed supplementation on FBS

With respect to the effects of flaxseed supplementation on FBS levels in patients with CAD, a meta‐analysis using a random‐effects model of three included trials revealed a significant decrease in this parameter following flaxseed treatment (WMD = −8.35 mg/dL; 95% CI: −15.01, −1.69, p = .01), following flaxseed treatment, with an insignificant statistical heterogeneity among trials (p = .72, I² = 0.0%) (Figure 3A).

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^8ec5d8d6]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Muscle protein synthesis through protein intake in older adults should be maximized with consideration of the frequency, distribution, and other nutritional components, such as creatine, vitamins, and fatty acids. It is recommended that older adults consume ≥ 0.4 g/kg per meal and 1.2–1.6 g/kg per day to induce muscle protein synthesis saturation to thus support muscle function. Among the included studies, most studies provided 10.1 g–25 g protein once a day or 20 g ~ 35 g protein 3 times a week on the days exercise was performed, which could not take into account frequency and distribution. A previous review showed that multi-ingredient protein supplements have the potential to increase the benefits of resistance training, but there were no differences in the effects on muscle mass and strength between multi-ingredient protein and single protein. The impact of multiple nutrients is unclear, but there are complex interactions between food components inducing potential synergistic effects. Thus, nutritional interventions involving dietary modifications with various and balanced nutrients or whole food approaches rather than a single specific nutrient can be effective in improving muscle mass and function. Among the 25 RCTs, three provided multinutrients that were arbitrarily defined as containing three or more nutrients. Of the three studies, only one used a whole-diet approach. The number of studies was too small to verify the effect of the whole-food or whole-diet approach.

2.6 Statistical analysis

STATA 16.0 (Stata Corp.) and Review Manager 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration) were used for all the statistical analyses. To quantify the effects of flaxseed oil on the changes in the following outcomes, data were pooled and the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI was utilized. (1) FBS, (2) TG, (3) TC, (4) LDL‐c, (5) HDL‐c, (6, 7) weight, (8) BMI, and (9) hs‐CRP. The effect size (ES) was determined using the mean change (SD). The DerSimoniane‐Laird technique with a random‐effects model was used for the ES meta‐analysis. The existence of significant interstudy heterogeneity among trials was assessed using Cochran's Q test (p < .1) and I² test (> 50%). Sensitivity analysis was carried out using the leave‐one‐out technique to determine the source of heterogeneity after removing the trials individually. Egger's linear regression tests and funnel plots were applied to evaluate evidence of potential publication bias across studies.

Also, a significant decrease in TNF-α indicates that supplementation with hesperidin and flaxseed in comparison with LSM alone (− 6.5 vs − 1.9 pg/mL) was observed (P = 0.015).

Adverse events and compliance

Patients were instructed to return any unused supplements at every follow up visit. None of the patients had missed more than 10% of the supplements. Also, no complication or serious side effects were observed during the study among the participants that could be attributed to intervention.

### Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect on human strength and endurance after resistance training and supplementation of vicia faba protein hydrolysate compared with placebo [^fd5f333c]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2025). High credibility.

Strength improvements in the VFH group were accompanied by improvements in muscular endurance with 2 times and 1.7 times the change in repetitions performed on the leg extension and on the bench press, respectively, compared with placebo. While the training programme was designed primarily for strength, 87% of the VFH group experienced enhanced leg endurance vs 69% in the placebo group with a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.54) suggesting sustained efficacy of VFH, and a role in recovery. This is further supported by the significant fold increases and large effect sizes in myokines including FSTL-1, which increases energy through lipolysis during exercise; fractalkine, which regulates beta cell function; apelin, which helps modulate atrophy; and FABP3, which supports mitochondrial function. Significant fold decreases were observed in GDF-15, a stress-related marker of ageing, associated with sarcopenia and mitochondrial myopathy. Plomgaard et al have described the role of GDF-15 in metabolic signalling and shown that energy deprivation is linked with prolonged elevation in plasma, suggesting that the reduction induced by VFH may be supportive of enhanced endurance and recovery. Supplements including caffeine and sodium bicarbonate have been shown to enhance endurance; however, side effects, such as gastrointestinal issues, have limited their use and overshadowed the benefits. Contrastingly, no adverse events were reported with 2.4 g/day of VFH indicating good tolerability during long-term use. Early strength gains often result first from neural efficiency, followed by increases in muscle mass which drive additional strength changes after neuromuscular adaptations plateau. The strength improvements, muscular co-ordination and force generation in the VFH group may have, therefore, contributed to enhanced strength in the absence of increased mass or changes in circumference measurements. The training programme may have also influenced strength over hypertrophy, with more progressive overloads, higher repetitions and recovery time often required for growth. Other potential confounding factors may have included fitness and body composition, variability in adaptation to exercise, weight selection and hormonal responses.

Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Although benefits of flaxseed, and fasting mimicking diet (FMD), per se, have been shown in managing MASLD risk factors, the benefit of combining the two is not clear. Therefore, the aim of this controlled clinical trial was to investigate the effect of the combination of FMD and flaxseed consumption compared to either of these interventions for the treatment of patients with MASLD.

### The effect of a multi-ingredient supplement on resistance training-induced adaptations [^0daf2661]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Resistance exercise training (RET) induces muscle hypertrophy that, when combined with co-temporal protein ingestion, is enhanced. However, fewer studies have been conducted when RET is combined with multi-ingredient supplements.

Purpose

We aimed to determine the effect of a high-quality multi-ingredient nutritional supplement (SUPP) versus an isonitrogenous (lower protein quality), isoenergetic placebo (PL) on RET-induced gains in lean body mass (LBM), muscle thickness, and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA). We hypothesized that RET-induced gains in LBM and muscle CSA would be greater in SUPP versus PL.

Methods

In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, 26 (13 male, 13 female) healthy young adults (mean ± SD, 22 ± 2 yr) were randomized to either the SUPP group (n = 13; 20 g whey protein, 2 g leucine, 2.5 g creatine monohydrate, 300 mg calcium citrate, 1000 IU vitamin D) or the PL group (n = 13; 20 g collagen peptides, 1.4 g alanine, 0.6 g glycine) groups, ingesting their respective supplements twice daily. Measurements were obtained before and after a 10-wk linear progressive RET program.

Results

Greater increases in LBM were observed for SUPP versus PL (SUPP: +4.1 ± 1.3 kg, PL: +2.8 ± 1.7 kg, P < 0.05). No additive effect of the supplement could be detected on vastus lateralis muscle CSA, but SUPP did result in increased biceps brachii muscle CSA and thickness (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

We conclude that when combined with RET, the consumption of SUPP increased LBM and upper-body CSA and thickness to a greater extent than to that observed in the PL group of healthy young adults.

### Protein supplementation does not affect myogenic adaptations to resistance training [^c5d40197]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). Low credibility.

It has been proposed that protein supplementation during resistance exercise training enhances muscle hypertrophy. The degree of hypertrophy during training is controlled in part through the activation of satellite cells and myonuclear accretion.

Purpose

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of protein supplementation (and the type of protein) during traditional resistance training on myofiber cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition.

Methods

Healthy young men participated in supervised whole-body progressive resistance training 3 d·wk for 12 wk. Participants were randomized to one of three groups ingesting a daily 22-g macronutrient dose of soy-dairy protein blend (PB, n = 22), whey protein isolate (WP, n = 15), or an isocaloric maltodextrin placebo (MDP, n = 17). Lean mass, vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition were assessed before and after resistance training.

Results

PB and the pooled protein treatments (PB + WP = PRO) exhibited a greater whole-body lean mass %change compared with MDP (P = 0.057 for PB) and (P = 0.050 for PRO), respectively. All treatments demonstrated similar leg muscle hypertrophy and vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area (P < 0.05). Increases in myosin heavy chain I and II myofiber satellite cell content and myonuclei content were also detected after exercise training (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Protein supplementation during resistance training has a modest effect on whole-body lean mass as compared with exercise training without protein supplementation, and there was no effect on any outcome between protein supplement types (blend vs whey). However, protein supplementation did not enhance resistance exercise-induced increases in myofiber hypertrophy, satellite cell content, or myonuclear addition in young healthy men. We propose that as long as protein intake is adequate during muscle overload, the adaptations in muscle growth and function will not be influenced by protein supplementation.

### Effects of flaxseed supplementation on weight loss, lipid profiles, glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c18f643f]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The results of the study indicated that there was no substantial impact on body weight and BMI between the two groups when consuming flaxseed. Pan et al.conducted a meta‐analysis that revealed that whole flaxseed, rather than flaxseed oil, had a notable impact on weight and BMI reduction. This effect is likely due to the abundant fiber content in flaxseed, which aids in controlling energy intake and enhancing satiety. However, the outcomes did not demonstrate statistical significance in investigations in which flaxseed oil supplementation (four trials) was administered instead of flaxseed (one trial). The specific mechanism by which flaxseed exerts its antiobesity effects remains unclear. Current evidence suggests that the bioactive components of flaxseed oil, particularly ALA, may play a role in reducing obesity. Furthermore, flaxseed oil is rich in various unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic and eicosadienoic acids, along with ALA, all of which possess antiobesity properties. The variations in the obtained results could be explained by several factors, including variations in the duration and dosage of the intervention, type of flaxseed oil and ALA sources used, differences in dietary intake, clinical condition of the participants, and levels of physical activity.

The impacts of flaxseed and flaxseed oil on FBS have been evaluated in a restricted range of studies. A meta‐analysis found that while whole flaxseed had a significant impact on improving glycemic control in the general population, lignan extract and flaxseed oil did not have the same effect. This finding was consistent with that of the present meta‐analysis. However, other RCTs have not demonstrated a significant reduction in FBS levels following flaxseed supplementation. More extensive trials are necessary to fully understand the effects of flaxseed on the glycemic profile of individuals with CAD.

Although reports on the positive impacts of flaxseed on human health have been documented, concerns exist within certain populations, particularly pregnant women. However, animal studies have demonstrated that exposure to estrogen during the neonatal stage can lead to a decrease in sperm production. Therefore, the consumption of flaxseed, especially over a prolonged period, should be approached with caution by pregnant women and men of reproductive age, particularly in cases of chronic consumption.

### Potent antihypertensive action of dietary flaxseed in hypertensive patients [^b6907fc9]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Flaxseed contains ω-3 fatty acids, lignans, and fiber that together may provide benefits to patients with cardiovascular disease. Animal work identified that patients with peripheral artery disease may particularly benefit from dietary supplementation with flaxseed. Hypertension is commonly associated with peripheral artery disease. The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of daily ingestion of flaxseed on systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in peripheral artery disease patients. In this prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, patients (110 in total) ingested a variety of foods that contained 30 g of milled flaxseed or placebo each day over 6 months. Plasma levels of the ω-3 fatty acid α-linolenic acid and enterolignans increased 2- to 50-fold in the flaxseed-fed group but did not increase significantly in the placebo group. Patient body weights were not significantly different between the 2 groups at any time. SBP was ≈ 10 mm Hg lower, and DBP was ≈ 7 mm Hg lower in the flaxseed group compared with placebo after 6 months. Patients who entered the trial with a SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg at baseline obtained a significant reduction of 15 mm Hg in SBP and 7 mm Hg in DBP from flaxseed ingestion. The antihypertensive effect was achieved selectively in hypertensive patients. Circulating α-linolenic acid levels correlated with SBP and DBP, and lignan levels correlated with changes in DBP. In summary, flaxseed induced one of the most potent antihypertensive effects achieved by a dietary intervention.

### Effects of flaxseed supplementation on weight loss, lipid profiles, glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6a034786]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The present meta‐analysis investigated the efficacy of flaxseed on anthropometric, glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory indices in individuals with CAD. The pooled results indicated that 10–24 weeks of supplementation with flaxseed or flaxseed oil had considerable therapeutic effects on glucose, hs‐CRP, and TG levels in individuals with CAD.

Dyslipidemia is a condition that increases the risk for atherosclerosis and CAD, resulting in numerous fatalities globally. We observed a notable decrease in circulating TG levels, suggesting the potential cardioprotective properties of flaxseed oil. However, no alterations were observed in the other lipid parameters. Previous studies have presented varying outcomes regarding the impact of flaxseed supplementation on lipid profiles. A comprehensive meta‐analysis by Hadi et al.including 62 RCTs, showed that flaxseed supplementation may improve blood levels of TC, TG, and LDL‐C, but not HDL‐c, in various healthy and unhealthy subjects, indicating that it may delay the development of heart disease. In addition, Masjedi et al.also conducted a meta‐analysis to determine the impact of flaxseed on blood levels of lipid markers in healthy and dyslipidemic individuals, demonstrating the same results as those obtained by Hadi et al. Similarly, Dodin et al.conducted a study that found that the daily consumption of 40 g of flaxseed led to improved lipid factor levels in healthy menopausal women after 12 months. However, another study indicated that the lipid profile did not exhibit any reduction after a 6‐week period of consuming 15 mL/day of ALA flaxseed oil when compared to the consumption of olive oil during the same duration. Interestingly, another RCT also demonstrated the opposite effect of flaxseed supplementation on TG (an increase of 12.0% from baseline to 8 weeks following intervention) in elderly subjects. The changes in lipid profiles observed in this study may be attributed to several factors, including the consumption of flaxseed or flaxseed oil, variations in absorption efficiency among participants, adherence to the prescribed diet, and individual characteristics such as genetic background, lifestyle choices, age, and sex. Moreover, it is worth noting that the absence of a substantial impact of flaxseed oil on lipid profiles, as observed in the current meta‐analysis, may be partially attributed to the majority of participants having normal initial levels of these measures. This could potentially be attributed to prior statin therapy administration. The positive effects of flaxseed oil on lipid metabolism may be related to its ability to enhance lipid balance within the adipose tissue‐liver axis and promote fatty acid β‐oxidation. Furthermore, flaxseed oil has been shown to reduce lipogenesis, resulting in decreased TG levels.

### Effects of flaxseed supplementation on weight loss, lipid profiles, glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bb9fb113]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Numerous studies have been conducted on flaxseed, but the results have been inconsistent with respect to its effects on glycemic and lipid profiles, weight loss, and inflammatory markers. Some studies have found positive effects, while others have not. Because of these inconsistent findings and the absence of a comprehensive meta‐analysis specifically focusing on patients with CAD, we aimed to incorporate all existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy of flaxseed/flaxseed oil supplementation on glycemic and lipid profiles, body weight loss, and high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP) in patients with CAD.

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^67202ed5]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

Electronic databases and the reference lists of related studies were searched by two investigators. First, for the electronic search, MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase were searched for articles published prior to July 2020 by entering the following combinations of keywords: ("nutrition" OR "food" OR "diet") OR ("exercise" OR "resistance training") AND "aged" AND ("muscle mass" or "skeletal muscle" OR "muscle strength" OR "physical performance" OR "physical functional performance" OR "walking speed" OR "gait speed"). Second, the reference lists of related studies were searched to identify additional articles. The searches were limited to articles published in the English language, studies involving humans, and RCTs. Only peer-reviewed articles were included, and gray literature such as dissertations, proceedings, and government reports was excluded.

### An omega-3 fatty acid-enriched diet prevents skeletal muscle lesions in a hamster model of dystrophy [^38ac6e96]. The American Journal of Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Currently, despite well-known mutational causes, a universal treatment for neuromuscular disorders is still lacking, and current therapeutic efforts are mainly restricted to symptomatic treatments. In the present study, δ-sarcoglycan-null dystrophic hamsters were fed a diet enriched in flaxseed-derived ω3 α-linolenic fatty acid from weaning until death. α-linolenic fatty acid precluded the dystrophic degeneration of muscle morphology and function. In fact, in dystrophic animals fed flaxseed-derived α-linolenic fatty acid, the histological appearance of the muscular tissue was improved, the proliferation of interstitial cells was decreased, and the myogenic differentiation originated new myocytes to repair the injured muscle. In addition, muscle myofibers were larger and cell membrane integrity was preserved, as witnessed by the correct localization of α-, β-, and γ-sarcoglycans and α-dystroglycan. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic accumulation of both β-catenin and caveolin-3 was abolished in dystrophic hamster muscle fed α-linolenic fatty acid versus control animals fed standard diet, while α-myosin heavy chain was expressed at nearly physiological levels. These findings, obtained by dietary intervention only, introduce a novel concept that provides evidence that the modulation of the plasmalemma lipid profile could represent an efficacious strategy to ameliorate human muscular dystrophy.

### Dietary flaxseed reduces central aortic blood pressure without cardiac involvement but through changes in plasma oxylipins [^5c4ea24d]. Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In the year-long FlaxPAD clinical trial (Flaxseed for Peripheral Artery Disease), dietary flaxseed generated a powerful reduction in brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with peripheral artery disease. Oxylipins were implicated as potential mechanistic mediators. However, the ability of flaxseed to impact central aortic hypertension, arterial stiffness, or cardiac performance was not investigated. Additionally, the relationship between central blood pressure (cBP) and oxylipins was not elucidated. Therefore, radial tonometry and pulse wave analysis were used to measure cBP and cardiac function in the FlaxPAD population (n = 62). Plasma oxylipins were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In patients with high blood pressure at baseline, the average decrease in central systolic and diastolic blood pressures versus placebo was 10 and 6 mmHg, respectively. Flaxseed did not significantly impact augmentation index or other cardiac function indices. Alternatively, the data support several specific oxylipins as potential mediators in the antihypertensive properties of flaxseed. For example, every 1 nmol/L increase in plasma 16-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid increased the odds of higher central systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 12- and 9-fold, respectively. Every 1 nmol/L increase in plasma thromboxane B2 and 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid increased the odds of higher cBP by 33- and 9-fold, respectively. Flaxseed induced a decrease in many oxylipins, which corresponded with a reduced risk of elevated cBP. These data extend the antihypertensive properties of flaxseed to cBP without cardiac involvement but rather through oxylipins. This study provides further support for oxylipins as therapeutic targets in hypertension.

### Effects of flaxseed supplementation on weight loss, lipid profiles, glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^566eb368]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Search and studies section

The current meta‐analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analysis guidelines (Table S1). Clinical trials published from the beginning to June 2023 were identified using a systematic search of online resources, including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. We used the Patient, Intervention, Comparison Group, Outcome, and Study Design framework to identify studies that met our criteria, including RCTs with either a crossover or parallel design among patients with CADs, reported the effects of flaxseed consumption on weight loss, lipid profiles, glucose, and hs‐CRP as the primary outcomes in both the intervention and placebo groups, and were published in the English language without a time restriction. The following medical subject headings, subject terms, and keywords were applied to retrieve potentially relevant articles: ("flaxseed oil" OR "flaxseed" OR "linseed" OR "lignin" OR "Linum sitatissimum" OR "L. usitatissimum" AND "supplementation" OR "intake" OR "administration") and ("CAD" OR "coronary artery disease" OR "coronary heart disease" OR "coronary disease" "OR "CHD" OR "coronary arteriosclerosis" OR "coronary arteriosclerosis") and ("randomized controlled trial" OR "randomized clinical trial" OR "RCT" OR "controlled clinical trial" OR "randomized" OR "intervention studies" OR "controlled trial" OR "random" OR "trial" OR "clinical trial"). The reference lists of the selected articles and previous reviews were manually checked to increase the sensitivity of our search strategy.

2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

To incorporate RCTs into the study, the authors established certain criteria for inclusion and exclusion. (1) Articles with either a crossover or parallel design; (2) human clinical trials that investigated the effects of flaxseed/flaxseed oil on glucose and lipid profiles, weight loss, and inflammation biomarkers in patients with CAD, and sufficient data reported on mean changes of at least one of the studied outcomes with standard error, standard deviation (SD), or related 95% confidence interval (CI) at baseline and the end of intervention in both groups. Nonclinical studies, trials without a control group, and trials with insufficient information on the intervention and control groups were excluded.

### Mechanisms of muscle atrophy and hypertrophy: implications in health and disease [^c28b83ab]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Concluding remarks

Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate the loss of muscle mass in disease. The lack of any efficient drug that counteracts muscle loss suggests that our view of the mechanistic insights that control atrophying muscle is still limited and needs further exploration.

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^41a7617f]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Study selection

The inclusion criteria for this systematic review were as follows: (a) studies including community-dwelling healthy older adults aged 60 years or above; (b) those including experimental groups that underwent resistance training and nutritional interventions; (c) those including comparison groups that underwent resistance training alone with or without a nutritional placebo supplement; (d) studies that reported the outcome measures of muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical functional performance; and (e) randomized controlled parallel-group trials with at least one arm. We set the age of 60 years or above, the age at which the activity level can decrease after retirement and the loss of muscle strength accelerates. We included only studies in healthy subjects to reduce the level of heterogeneity between studies. We accepted the various authors' own definitions of 'healthy'. The experimental interventions included any form of resistance training and nutritional (dietary) interventions that involved repeated practice during standardized programs for the purpose of enhancing muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function. Nutritional interventions were defined as those that provided at least one nutrient through nutritional supplementation or whole food to obtain biologically beneficial effects. There was no minimum duration of follow-up. However, all included trials had to report outcomes at a minimum of one time point after the completion of the intervention.

Articles were excluded if (a) the participants had malignant tumors, severe chronic diseases, or levels of frailty and sarcopenia that limited their physical activity, diet, and level of independence in daily life; (b) the study was conducted in an animal model; (c) the experimental intervention was combined with any other form of interventions, such as medication and hormone therapy; (d) the nutritional intervention was designed for calorie intake reduction and weight loss; (e) the study evaluated the effectiveness of experimental interventions by only examining inflammatory factors or biological markers related to muscle synthesis; or (f) the study had a non-RCT design, such as case reports or cohort studies, without a comparison group.

Studies were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria by two independent researchers; these researchers screened the studies according to the titles and abstracts of all studies and then reviewed the full texts of the remaining studies. Disagreements between researchers were resolved by discussion.

### Effectiveness of flaxseed consumption and fasting mimicking diet on anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, and hepatic features in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): a randomized controlled clinical trial [^4b8d315c]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

Although benefits of flaxseed and fasting mimicking diet (FMD), each alone, have been shown in the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the benefit of combining the two is not clear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the combination of FMD and flaxseed supplementation on surrogate measures of MASLD.

Methods

The present study was conducted as a randomized, parallel, open-label controlled clinical trial on a hundred patients with MASLD for 12weeks. Eligible participants were assigned to four groups including control group (lifestyle modification recommendations); flaxseed group (30g/day of flaxseed powder consumption); FMD group (16h of fasting per day), and combination of FMD with flaxseed. Changes in anthropometric parameters, serum levels of lipids, glycemic measures, High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and liver enzymes, and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis by transient elastography were assessed.

Results

Serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose and insulin, hs-CRP and liver enzymes decreased in all intervention groups. Hepatic steatosis score decreased in the intervention groups, but not significantly in comparison to the control group. Hepatic fibrosis score decreased significantly in the intervention groups compared to control.

Conclusion

Our data indicate that the combination of FMD with flaxseed consumption is not superior to either of the interventions alone in the management of MASLD.

### Effects of flaxseed supplementation on weight loss, lipid profiles, glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in patients with coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^0048360c]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of flaxseed supplementation on weight loss, lipid profiles, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and glucose levels in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). A systematic search was performed using various online databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) until June 2023. To evaluate heterogeneity among the selected studies, the Q-test and I² statistics were employed. Data were combined using either a fixed- or random-effects model and presented as a weighted mean difference (WMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Of the 428 citations, six RCTs were included. The pooled results did not show significant changes in the WMD of lipid factors (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol) following flaxseed intake. However, after performing a sensitivity analysis to determine the source of heterogeneity, flaxseed supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in TG levels (WMD = -18.39mg/dL; 95% CI: -35.02, -1.75). Moreover, no significant differences were observed in either weight or BMI following flaxseed intake. However, the circulating levels of fasting blood glucose (WMD = -8.35mg/dL; 95% CI: -15.01, -1.69, p = .01) and hs-CRP (WMD = -1.35mg/L; 95% CI: -1.93, -0.77, p < .01) significantly decreased after the intervention. Flaxseed supplementation was associated with lowering FBS, hs-CRP, and TG levels but did not affect weight loss parameters and other lipid markers in CAD.

### Screening for lipid disorders in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^357a3b99]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF multifactorial dyslipidemia treatment evidence shows no qualifying drug trials; four fair- to good-quality nonpharmacologic trials (n = 1008) were identified. Two behavioral counseling trials (n = 934) with dietary interventions produced a 3- to 6-mg/dL statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-C with improved dietary intake vs control, but these findings did not persist at longer follow-up. Two small supplement trials (n = 74) of flaxseed and fish oil did not improve lipid outcomes at 4 to 8 weeks.

### Effectiveness of flaxseed consumption and fasting mimicking diet on anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, and hepatic features in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): a randomized controlled clinical trial [^9ed44e21]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of 25% in general population. The annual economic burden of MASLD in the United States is estimated to be 103 billion dollars. MASLD has a wide pathological spectrum, from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis with varying degrees of fibrosis, to cirrhosis that may progress to liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Currently, no definitive medical treatment has been found for MASLD, while current studies suggest that the best treatment approach for MASLD is weight loss, which requires a combination of dietary modification and exercise to achieve and maintain this goal. Besides the restriction of energy intake, some dietary interventions have shown promising effects on disease amelioration, or prevention.

Flaxseed with the Latin name of Linum usitatissimum is known as a functional food due to its beneficial nutritional properties. In addition to omega-3, flaxseed has high fiber content, lignan, highly digestible protein, antioxidants and various phytoestrogens, which has made this seed an effective compound in the management of MASLD. Suppression of hepatic glycolytic and lipogenic genes, stimulation of fatty acid oxidation, improvement of insulin sensitivity are among the benefits of flaxseed.

According to recent findings, the time of food consumption is an important factor besides the diet composition and the amount of energy intake in preventing obesity and its complications. Over the last decade, various fasting diets have been proposed. Time-restricted feeding (TRF), one of the most common of these diets, is a type of intermittent fasting that provides opportunities to eat at specific times during the day. For instance the 16:8 model includes an 8 h eating period followed by a 16 h fasting period. The key feature of this diet is the so-called "metabolic switch", which refers to the body's preferential use of fatty acids and ketones derived from fatty acids instead of glucose from glycogenolysis. This switch occurs when liver glycogen stores are depleted (usually after 12 h of fasting) and subsequently lipolysis of adipose tissue increases, which results in weight loss, decreased insulin resistance, and lower blood glucose levels.

### Do multi-ingredient protein supplements augment resistance training-induced gains in skeletal muscle mass and strength? A systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 trials [^5f3cd17c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of multi-ingredient protein (MIP) supplements on resistance exercise training (RT)-induced gains in muscle mass and strength compared with protein-only (PRO) or placebo supplementation.

Data Sources

Systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials with interventions including RT ≥ 6 weeks in duration and a MIP supplement.

Design

Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to determine the effect of supplementation on fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass, one-repetition maximum (1RM) upper body and 1RM lower body muscular strength. Subgroup analyses compared the efficacy of MIP supplementation relative to training status and chronological age.

Results

The most common MIP supplements included protein with creatine (n = 17) or vitamin D (n = 10). Data from 35 trials with 1387 participants showed significant (p < 0.05) increases in FFM (0.80kg (95% CI 0.44 to 1.15)), 1RM lower body (4.22kg (95% CI 0.79 to 7.64)) and 1RM upper body (2.56kg (95% CI 0.79 to 4.33)) where a supplement was compared with all non-MIP supplemented conditions (means (95%CI)). Subgroup analyses indicated a greater effect of MIP supplements compared with all non-MIP supplements on FFM in untrained (0.95kg (95% CI 0.51 to 1.39), p < 0.0001) and older participants (0.77kg (95% CI 0.11 to 1.43), p = 0.02); taking MIP supplements was also associated with gains in 1RM upper body (1.56kg (95% CI 0.80 to 2.33), p = 0.01) in older adults.

Summary/Conclusions

When MIP supplements were combined with resistance exercise training, there were greater gains in FFM and strength in healthy adults than in counterparts who were supplemented with non-MIP. MIP supplements were not superior when directly compared with PRO supplements. The magnitude of effect of MIP supplements was greater (in absolute values) in untrained and elderly individuals undertaking RT than it was in trained individuals and in younger people.

### Combination therapy of flaxseed and hesperidin enhances the effectiveness of lifestyle modification in cardiovascular risk control in prediabetes: a randomized controlled trial [^e7734d44]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, incorporating 30 g of brown flaxseed and one-gram hesperidin into a healthy diet along with increasing physical activity seems reasonable and valuable to reduce risk of cardiometabolic abnormalities through ameliorating insulin resistance, lowering blood pressure, improving glycemic control, modifying lipid profile, and reduction of inflammation.

### The problem of muscle hypertrophy: revisited [^3f164a8f]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

In this paper we revisit a topic originally discussed in 1955, namely the lack of direct evidence that muscle hypertrophy from exercise plays an important role in increasing strength. To this day, long-term adaptations in strength are thought to be primarily contingent on changes in muscle size. Given this assumption, there has been considerable attention placed on programs designed to allow for maximization of both muscle size and strength. However, the conclusion that a change in muscle size affects a change in strength is surprisingly based on little evidence. We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training, yet divergent results in strength.

### Time-restricted feeding plus resistance training in active females: a randomized trial [^4120a312]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

In the present investigation, adherence to TRF did not attenuate FFM accretion, skeletal muscle hypertrophy, or improvements in muscular performance. Differential effects on FM (CD: +2% relative to baseline; TRF: −2% to −4%; TRF HMB: −4% to −7%) were only observed in the PP analysis, with significant reductions in FM and BF% in TRF HMB at W8. It has been recognized that longitudinal data are needed to elucidate the impact of the daily distribution of protein intake on adaptations to RT. As IF necessitates prolonged periods without stimulation of muscle protein synthesis and suppression of muscle protein breakdown via dietary amino acids, it represents an opportunity to investigate this question. The present results reveal no detrimental effects on RT adaptations of limiting all protein and other nutrient intake to ∼7.5 h/d compared with ∼13 h/d. In the context of IF, it has also been questioned whether implementation of modified fasting periods to allow ingestion of selected amino acids or their metabolites may be beneficial for lean mass maintenance or accretion, particularly in active individuals. The branched-chain amino acid leucine is known to stimulate protein synthesis through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and produces metabolites that may modulate its physiological effects. Due to its ability to stimulate muscle protein synthesis and attenuate muscle proteolysis, it has been hypothesized that the leucine metabolite HMB may exert favorable effects on body composition and performance in exercising and/or energy-restricted individuals. However, previous investigations of supplemental HMB in active populations have produced mixed results, and a recent meta-analysis in athletes revealed no definitive advantages for body composition or muscular performance. The present investigation may be the first trial to directly examine the influence of supplementation with a leucine metabolite during IF and does not reveal distinct benefits of HMB supplementation.

### Protein supplementation does not augment adaptations to endurance exercise training [^1c7a05d6]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Muscular strength and endurance

The effects of the 12-wk intervention on muscular strength are presented in Table 3. A significant time–treatment interaction (P = 0.015) was detected for maximal isometric torque, which can be explained by marginal increase over time in PLA group (7 ± 29 N·m) along with a marginal decrease in the PRO group (−10 ± 21 N·m). Maximal voluntary isokinetic contraction of the knee extensors showed an increase over time at a velocity of 180°·s −1 (P = 0.017), but not at a velocity of 90°·s −1 (P = 0.65), without any differences between treatment (time–treatment interactions, P > 0.58 for all).

Muscular endurance, defined as the total work performed during 30 reciprocal isokinetic contractions, increased by 6% (time effect, P < 0.0001), with no difference between treatments (PLA, 3268 ± 609 to 3438 ± 666 kJ; PRO, 3203 ± 451 to 3384 ± 462 kJ; time–treatment interaction, P = 0.84; Fig. 2 B).

Estimated mean differences between interventions and effect sizes for muscular strength and endurance are presented (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2, Estimated Mean Differences and Effect Sizes for Performance Outcomes and Body Mass).

Body composition

Body composition data are presented in Table 1. Although whole-body lean mass (LM) did not change over time (P = 0.097), a significant increase in leg LM was observed (time effect, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2 C). The increase in leg LM in the PRO group (0.5 ± 0.7 kg) tended to be greater when compared with the PLA group (0.2 ± 0.6 kg), although this finding did not reach statistical significance (time–treatment interaction, P = 0.073). In line, the increase in leg LM showed a small to moderate effect size (ES 0.49) in favor of protein supplementation (Supplemental Digital Content 2, Estimated Mean Differences and Effect Sizes for Performance Outcomes and Body Mass).

There was a significant decrease in total fat mass over time (P = 0.002), with no differences between PLA and PRO (−0.7 ± 1.4 and − 0.4 ± 1.2 kg, respectively; time–treatment interaction, P = 0.43).

### Meta-analysis of the effects of flaxseed interventions on blood lipids [^c9fd7f19]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Several clinical trials have investigated the effects of flaxseed and flaxseed-derived products (flaxseed oil or lignans) on blood lipids; however, the findings have been inconsistent.

Objective

We aimed to identify and quantify the effectiveness of flaxseed and its derivatives on blood lipid profiles.

Design

A comprehensive literature search was performed on the basis of English reports of randomized controlled trials of flaxseed or its derivatives on lipid profiles in adults, which were published from January 1990 to October 2008. Attempts also were made to access unpublished data. Study quality was assessed by using the Jadad score, and a meta-analysis was conducted.

Results

Twenty-eight studies were included. Flaxseed interventions reduced total and LDL cholesterol by 0.10 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.20, 0.00 mmol/L) and 0.08 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.16, 0.00 mmol/L), respectively; significant reductions were observed with whole flaxseed (-0.21 and -0.16 mmol/L, respectively) and lignan (-0.28 and -0.16 mmol/L, respectively) supplements but not with flaxseed oil. The cholesterol-lowering effects were more apparent in females (particularly postmenopausal women), individuals with high initial cholesterol concentrations, and studies with higher Jadad scores. No significant changes were found in the concentrations of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.

Conclusions

Flaxseed significantly reduced circulating total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, but the changes were dependent on the type of intervention, sex, and initial lipid profiles of the subjects. Further studies are needed to determine the efficiency of flaxseed on lipid profiles in men and premenopausal women and to explore its potential benefits on other cardiometabolic risk factors and prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Overfeeding polyunsaturated fat compared with saturated fat does not differentially influence lean tissue accumulation in individuals with overweight: a randomized controlled trial [^53aebb3e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Fatty acids may influence lean tissue volume and skeletal muscle function. We previously reported in young lean participants that overfeeding PUFA compared with SFA induced greater lean tissue accumulation despite similar weight gain.

Objectives

In a double-blind randomized controlled trial, we aimed to investigate if the differential effects of overfeeding SFA and PUFA on lean tissue accumulation could be replicated in individuals with overweight and identify potential determinants. Further, using substitution models, we investigated associations between SFA and PUFA concentrations with lean tissue volume in a large population-based sample (UK Biobank).

Methods

Sixty-one males and females with overweight [BMI (kg/m²): 27.3 (interquartile range (IQR), 25.4–29.3); age: 43 (IQR, 36–48)] were overfed SFA (palm oil) or n-6 (ω-6) PUFA (sunflower oil) for 8 wk. Lean tissue was assessed by MRI. We had access to n = 13,849 participants with data on diet, covariates, and MRI measurements of lean tissue, as well as 9119 participants with data on circulating fatty acids in the UK Biobank.

Results

Body weight gain mean (SD) was similar in PUFA (2.01 ± 1.90 kg) and SFA (2.31 ± 1.38 kg) groups. Lean tissue increased to a similar extent [0.54 ± 0.93 L and 0.67 ± 1.21 L for PUFA and SFA groups, respectively, with a difference between groups of 0.07 (-0.21, 0.35)]. We observed no differential effects on circulating amino acids, myostatin, or IL-15 and no clear determinants of lean tissue accumulation. Similar nonsignificant results for SFA and PUFA were observed in UK Biobank, but circulating fatty acids demonstrated ambiguous and sex-dependent associations.

Conclusions

Overfeeding SFA or PUFA does not differentially affect lean tissue accumulation during 8 wk in individuals with overweight. A lack of dietary fat type-specific effects on lean tissue is supported by specified substitution models in a large population-based cohort consuming their habitual diet. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov identifier as NCT02211612.

### Effectiveness of flaxseed consumption and fasting mimicking diet on anthropometric measures, biochemical parameters, and hepatic features in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): a randomized controlled clinical trial [^12c52fe6]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Recruitment and eligibility screening

The adult patients with MASLD, who referred to the Liver and Gastroenterology Clinics in Tehran were recruited. Liver steatosis was assessed using transient elastography (Echosens, Paris, France), and patients with grade 2 or higher steatosis (CAP score ≥ 263) were included in the study. Patients with MASLD due to alcohol consumption (> 10 g/d in women and > 20 g/d in men) or hepatitis B or C were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were: professional athletes, pregnant or breastfeeding women, those taking anti-inflammatory medications or any other drugs known to affect liver function (even herbal preparations), the presence of gastrointestinal, cardiac, renal, pulmonary, autoimmune, thyroid diseases and severe metabolic abnormalities, and those who have previously had weight loss surgery or are on a weight loss program.

### Supplementation with flaxseed alters estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women to a greater extent than does supplementation with an equal amount of soy [^a1304e1e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Phytoestrogens, which are abundant in flaxseed and soy, have chemical structures resembling those of endogenous estrogens and have been shown to exert hormonal effects, thereby affecting chronic diseases.

Objective

We compared the effects of consuming equal amounts of flaxseed or soy on estrogen metabolism and biochemical markers of bone metabolism in postmenopausal women.

Design

In a parallel design, the diet of postmenopausal women (n = 46) was supplemented with either a placebo, soy (25 g soy flour), or flaxseed (25 g ground flaxseed) muffin for 16 wk. Blood and 24-h urine samples were collected at baseline and at the endpoint. Urine samples were analyzed for phytoestrogens, estrogen metabolites (2-hydroxyestrone, 16alpha-hydroxyestrone), and serum hormones (estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate). Serum and urine samples were also analyzed for biochemical markers of bone metabolism.

Results

Urinary concentrations of 2-hydroxyestrone, but not of 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, increased significantly in the flaxseed group (P = 0.05). In the flaxseed group, the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16alpha-hydroxyestrone was positively correlated with urinary lignan excretion (r = 0.579, P = 0.02). In the soy and placebo groups, no significant correlation was observed. No significant change in serum hormones or biochemical markers of bone metabolism was observed within or between the treatment groups.

Conclusions

Supplementation with flaxseed modifies urinary estrogen metabolite excretion to a greater extent than does supplementation with an equal amount of soy. This modification by flaxseed is associated with an increase in urinary lignan excretion. Despite the shift in estrogen metabolism to favor the less biologically active estrogens, a negative effect on bone cell metabolism was not observed.

### The effect of multi-ingredient protein versus collagen supplementation on satellite cell properties in males and females [^7ed43c31]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Skeletal muscle satellite cells (SC) contribute to the adaptive process of resistance exercise training (RET) and may be influenced by nutritional supplementation. However, little research exists on the impact of multi-ingredient supplementation on the SC response to RET.

Purpose

We tested the effect of a multi-ingredient supplement (MIS) including whey protein, creatine, leucine, calcium citrate, and vitamin D on SC content and activity as well as myonuclear accretion, SC and myonuclear domain compared with a collagen control (COL) throughout a 10-wk RET program.

Methods

Twenty-six participants underwent a 10-wk linear RET program while consuming either the MIS or COL supplement twice daily. Muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis at baseline and 48 h after a bout of damaging exercise, before and after RET. Muscle tissue was analyzed for SC and myonuclear content, domain, acute SC activation, and fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA).

Results

MIS resulted in a greater increase in type II fCSA following 10 wk of RET (effect size (ES) = 0.89) but not myonuclear accretion or SC content. Change in myonuclei per fiber was positively correlated with type I and II and total fiber hypertrophy in the COL group only, indicating a robust independent effect of MIS on fCSA. Myonuclear domain increased similarly in both groups, whereas SC domain remained unchanged following RET. SC activation was similar between groups for all fiber types in the untrained state but showed a trend toward greater increases with MIS after RET (ES = 0.70).

Conclusions

SC responses to acute damaging exercise and long-term RET are predominantly similar in MIS and COL groups. However, MIS can induce greater increases in type II fCSA with RET and potentially SC activation following damage in the trained state.

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^8044d460]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Effects of resistance training and nutritional interventions compared with those of resistance training only on muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical functional performance

The effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for individual studies and all studies are shown in Fig. 3. The results of the meta-analysis showed no significant effects on lean body mass (n = 12, MD 0.13, 95% CI − 0.75 to 1.02), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (n = 6, MD -0.01, 95% CI − 0.26 to 0.24), hand grip strength (n = 8, SMD 0.08, 95% CI − 0.11 to 0.27), knee extension strength (n = 15, SMD 0.09, 95% CI − 0.04 to 0.23), the chair stand test results (n = 7, MD -0.13, 95% CI − 0.43 to 0.17), or the timed up-and-go test results (n = 6, MD 0.02, 95% CI − 0.16 to 0.20). The I² values for all outcomes except lean body mass were zero, indicating that heterogeneity might not be important for these outcomes and that lean body mass might represent moderate heterogeneity (I² = 35%).

### Controlled flax interventions for the improvement of menopausal symptoms and postmenopausal bone health: a systematic review [^723d5af9]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Concerns regarding hormone therapy safety have led to interest in the use of phytoestrogens for a variety of menopause-related health complaints. Recent meta-analyses concerning soy and postmenopausal bone mineral density, flax and serum cholesterol indicate that significant benefits may be achieved in postmenopausal women. This study aimed to systematically review controlled flax interventions that had reported on menopausal symptoms and bone health in perimenopausal/postmenopausal women. A general search strategy was used to interrogate the Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, and SciFinder databases. Of 64 initial articles retrieved, we included 11 distinct interventions using flax without cotreatment. Interventions considering hot flush frequency/severity (five studies) and menopausal index scores (five studies) reported improvements from baseline with both flax and control treatments, with no significant difference between groups. There was little evidence to suggest that flax consumption alters circulating sex hormones, but flaxseed intervention increased the urinary 2α-hydroxyestrone/16α-hydroxyestrone ratio, which has been associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. Few studies considered bone mineral density (two studies) or markers of bone turnover (three studies). Flaxseed is currently not indicated for the alleviation of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. A paucity of appropriate randomized controlled trials means that the effects of flax intervention on postmenopausal bone mineral density are inconclusive.

### Effects of whey isolate, creatine, and resistance training on muscle hypertrophy [^f6cb33a4]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

Studies that have attributed gains in lean body mass to dietary supplementation during resistance exercise (RE) training have not reported these changes alongside adaptations at the cellular and subcellular levels. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two popular supplements — whey protein (WP) and creatine monohydrate (CrM) (both separately and in combination) — on body composition, muscle strength, fiber-specific hypertrophy (i.e., type I, IIa, IIx), and contractile protein accrual during RE training.

Methods

In a double-blind randomized protocol, resistance-trained males were matched for strength and placed into one of four groups: creatine/carbohydrate (CrCHO), creatine/whey protein (CrWP), WP only, or carbohydrate only (CHO) (1.5 g × kg⁻¹ body weight per day). All assessments were completed the week before and after an 11-wk structured, supervised RE program. Assessments included strength (1RM, three exercises), body composition (DEXA), and vastus lateralis muscle biopsies for determination of muscle fiber type (I, IIa, IIx), cross-sectional area (CSA), contractile protein, and creatine (Cr) content.

Results

Supplementation with CrCHO, WP, and CrWP resulted in significantly greater (P < 0.05) 1RM strength improvements (three of three assessments) and muscle hypertrophy compared with CHO. Up to 76% of the strength improvements in the squat could be attributed to hypertrophy of muscle involved in this exercise. However, the hypertrophy responses within these groups varied at the three levels assessed (i.e., changes in lean mass, fiber-specific hypertrophy, and contractile protein content).

Conclusions

Although WP and/or CrM seem to promote greater strength gains and muscle morphology during RE training, the hypertrophy responses within the groups varied. These differences in skeletal muscle morphology may have important implications for various populations and, therefore, warrant further investigation.

### Benefits of krill oil supplementation during alternate-day fasting in adults with overweight and obesity: a randomized trial [^0402efac]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Obesity, a major global public health issue, is characterized by excessive fat accumulation and is linked to various adverse health outcomes, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal issues. One of the solutions to the pandemic of overweight and obesity is diet‐induced weight loss, with a systematic review and meta‐analysis highlighting that these interventions result in significant weight loss of on average around 4–5 kg. This level of weight loss results in improvements in cardiovascular risk factors.

However, diet‐induced weight loss leads to reductions in both fat mass and fat‐free mass (FFM), with about 25%–30% of body mass loss attributed to the decrease in FFM. This decline in FFM is primarily associated with reduced muscle mass, potentially leading to diminished muscle strength. As muscle also has an important metabolic role, this reduction in FFM and muscle mass could potentially have adverse effects on metabolic health. Therefore, although individuals living with overweight and obesity will benefit from body mass loss, strategies to attenuate the loss of FFM and muscle mass need to be developed.

There is some evidence reported that supplementation with long‐chain n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn‐3 PUFA), in the absence of other dietary or exercise interventions, can impact body composition by reducing body fat and increasing FFM and improve tight muscle volume, handgrip strength (HGS), and time to conduct the chair rising test (CRT). The beneficial impact of LCn‐3 PUFA on body composition and muscle function can be attributed to several mechanisms, such as increasing muscle protein synthesis, enhancing mitochondrial content and function, and exerting anti‐inflammatory effects. Some studies report that LCn‐3 PUFA during caloric restriction did not affect fat mass and FFM, while others suggest that LCn‐3 PUFA during caloric restriction attenuated the reduction in FFM. However, most of these studies utilized bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) techniques for measuring changes in FFM, which have multiple limitations. On top of this, none of these studies assesses the effect of supplementation with LCn‐3 PUFA during diet‐induced weight loss on the parameters of muscle function. Furthermore, given that body weight loss and EPA and DHA supplementation are both associated with reductions in inflammatory markers, it can be expected that LCn‐3 PUFA supplementation during body weight loss may positively influence muscle function by exerting a more pronounced anti‐inflammatory effect compared to body weight loss alone. Thus, further investigation is warranted.

### Equivalent hypertrophy and strength gains in β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate-or leucine-supplemented men [^1a4b931b]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Muscle thickness and CSA was assessed using ultrasound, which has been shown to be a reliable alternative to magnetic resonance imaging. The whey+HMB and whey+leu groups in our study demonstrated an approximately 5% increase in MT, which is in line with a previous 12-wk RT study. In contrast to our results, Lowery et al. observed approximately three times greater increase in quadriceps MT of (7.8 ± 0.4 mm) in participants supplemented 3 g HMB-FA + 400 mg ATP relative to a placebo group (2.4 ± 0.7 mm). The only other investigation to report such dramatic increases in MT was from the same study in a group receiving HMB-FA alone.

There is no consensus on the ability of HMB to augment RT-induced muscle strength. Some trials report no effect, a trivial effect, or considerable effect of HMB to augment muscle mass and strength with RT. Previous work demonstrated significantly greater increases in total strength (3 times) for participants supplemented with HMB-FA (77 ± 18 kg) and HMB + ATP (96 ± 8 kg) compared with placebo (25 ± 22 kg). However, using the same training program as used previously, we observed similar increases in total strength for whey+HMB (70 ± 21 kg) and whey+leu (80 ± 40 kg). After overreaching, both whey+HMB and whey+leu experienced similar decrements in total strength (−0.5% ± 3% and −2% ± 5%) and subsequent recovery (5% ± 2% and 6% ± 5%). In addition, after overreaching, the whey+HMB group experienced decrements in peak power that were, surprisingly, not observed in the whey+leu group indicating a superior ability of Whey+Leu to protect against declines in performance when overreaching. Again, our results are in sharp contrast with previous investigations in which HMB markedly attenuated the declines in muscle strength and power after overreaching. Our data indicate that HMB and Leu have a similar ability to augment RT-induced strength gains, attenuate decrements in strength after overreaching, and facilitate recovery of strength during a taper.

### Protein supplementation before and after exercise does not further augment skeletal muscle hypertrophy after resistance training in elderly men [^f04dbdb3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Considerable discrepancy exists in the literature on the proposed benefits of protein supplementation on the adaptive response of skeletal muscle to resistance-type exercise training in the elderly.

Objective

The objective was to assess the benefits of timed protein supplementation on the increase in muscle mass and strength during prolonged resistance-type exercise training in healthy elderly men who habitually consume adequate amounts of dietary protein.

Design

Healthy elderly men (n = 26) aged 72 ± 2 y were randomly assigned to a progressive, 12-wk resistance-type exercise training program with (protein group) or without (placebo group) protein provided before and immediately after each exercise session (3 sessions/wk, 20 g protein/session). One-repetition maximum (1RM) tests were performed regularly to ensure a progressive workload during the intervention. Muscle hypertrophy was assessed at the whole-body (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), limb (computed tomography), and muscle fiber (biopsy) level.

Results

The 1RM strength increased approximately 25–35% in both groups (P < 0.001). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography scans showed similar increases in leg muscle mass (6 ± 1% in both groups; P < 0.001) and in the quadriceps (9 ± 1% in both groups), from 75.9 ± 3.7 and 73.8 ± 3.2 to 82.4 ± 3.9 and 80.0 ± 3.0 cm² in the placebo and protein groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Muscle fiber hypertrophy was greater in type II (placebo: 28 ± 6%; protein: 29 ± 4%) than in type I (placebo: 5 ± 4%; protein: 13 ± 6%) fibers, but the difference between groups was not significant.

Conclusion

Timed protein supplementation immediately before and after exercise does not further augment the increase in skeletal muscle mass and strength after prolonged resistance-type exercise training in healthy elderly men who habitually consume adequate amounts of dietary protein. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00744094.

### No difference between spray dried milk and native whey supplementation with strength training [^4fde4133]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Participant characteristics and compliance

There were no significant differences in participant characteristics between the milk and native whey groups at the beginning of the study (Table 1). Participants attended an average of 35.8 ± 0.5 and 35.4 ± 1.2 sessions in the native whey and milk group, respectively. The total load (repetitions × sets × kg × sessions) lifted during the 12-wk intervention was 390,000 ± 110,000 kg and 400,000 ± 95,000 kg in the milk and native whey group, respectively (P = 0.72). The self-reported compliance to the supplementation was 94.8% ± 2.5% and 96.4% ± 1.9% in the milk and native whey group, respectively. The total energy intake and protein [g·(kg body mass)⁻¹·d⁻¹] increased in during the intervention, with no differences between groups (Table 3). The milk group had a shift toward a greater energy percent (E%) from carbohydrates during the intervention and had a significantly higher E% from carbohydrates and lower E% from fat than the native whey groups.

TABLE 3
Daily energy and macronutrient intake before and during the intervention.

Muscle hypertrophy and strength

All measures of total body and whole muscle growth increased by 5% to 12% in both groups, with no differences between groups (Table 1). Type II fiber CSA increased in both groups (milk, P = 0.024; native whey, P = 0.022; Table 1). Whereas, type I fiber area increased only in the milk group, but there were no significant differences between groups for any of the measures of muscle growth. The number of nuclei per muscle fiber also increased to a similar extent in both groups (Table 1). During the 12-wk training period, both the milk and native whey group increased 1RM in leg press and bench press (Table 1). The magnitude of strength gain did not differ between groups.

### Bioavailability of α-linolenic acid from flaxseed diets as a function of the age of the subject [^e367b95d]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary flaxseed may have beneficial cardiovascular effects. An aged population has a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, but they may react differently to flaxseed in the diet.

Objective

To investigate the response, over a period of 4 weeks, of subjects aged 18–29 or 45–69 years to a diet containing the same amount of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (6 g) introduced in the form of ground flaxseed (30 g) or flaxseed oil.

Results

All subjects who received flaxseed oil showed a significant increase in plasma ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) concentrations over the course of this study. Subjects who received ground flaxseed in the 18-29-year-old group showed a statistically significant increase in their plasma ALA levels, and although there was a trend in the same direction for the 45-69-year-old subjects, this did not achieve statistical significance. The diets induced no major changes in platelet aggregation, plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in any of the groups. Younger subjects showed a decrease in triglyceride (TG) values compared with older subjects. There were no significant side effects that caused compliancy issues.

Conclusion

Subject age does not seem to be a major determining factor in influencing ALA absorption from a flaxseed-supplemented diet nor in the metabolism of ALA to EPA in the groups fed flaxseed oil. Concerns about side effects in older subjects administered a higher fiber load in a flaxseed-supplemented diet are not justified. However, younger but not older subjects showed a beneficial decrease in circulating TGs due to flaxseed supplementation.

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^e2952997]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Two independent researchers extracted key data from the included articles in a standardized Excel sheet, and the results were cross checked. For each article, data about (a) the article, including the authors, year of publication, and country; (b) characteristics of the study population, including the number of participants, mean age, sex, health status, and attrition rate; (c) characteristics of the experimental intervention, including the contents of resistance training, contents of nutritional intervention, delivery mode, amount, frequency and duration of intervention, and treatment for comparison group; and (d) outcome evaluation, including the follow-up period and the method of measurement. As the aim of the study was to compare the effects of the combination of resistance training and nutritional interventions with those of resistance training alone on muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, when more than two groups were present, only the data we intended to compare were recorded.

Assessment of risk of Bias

Methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane's risk of bias 2 (RoB2) tool by two independent researchers. The RoB2 tool consists of five domains: the randomization process, deviation from intended intervention, missing outcome data, measurement of outcome, and selection of the reported result. The risk of bias for each domain is evaluated as "low risk", "some concerns", or "high risk" by an algorithm with several signaling questions. Overall, "low risk of bias" was recorded when the study was judged to have a low risk of bias for all domains, "some concerns" was recorded when the study was judged to have some concerns in at least one domain, and "high risk of bias" was recorded when the study was judged to have a high risk of bias in at least one domain. This process was carried out by two independent researchers, and inconsistencies were resolved through discussion.

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^d32bb071]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare the effect sizes, 95% CIs, and I 2 values by excluding two studies that provided some nutrients to control groups. There were no significant differences in lean body mass (n = 11, MD 0.20, 95% CI − 0.74 to 1.14), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (n = 5, MD 0.09, 95% CI − 0.23 to 0.40), hand grip strength (n = 7, MD 0.08, 95% CI − 0.12 to 0.28), knee extension strength (n = 14, MD 0.10, 95% CI − 0.04 to 0.24), chair stand test results (n = 7, MD -0.13, 95% CI − 0.43 to 0.17), or timed up-and-go test results (n = 4, MD 0.01, 95% CI − 0.18 to 0.20). The I² values for all outcomes except for lean body mass were zero, indicating that heterogeneity might not be important for these outcomes and that lean body mass might have moderate heterogeneity (I² = 40%).

Certainty of evidence

There were six outcomes to compare the quality of evidence for resistance training combined a nutritional intervention compared to resistance training alone for muscle function. The hand grip strength and chair stand test were of moderate certainty. The other outcomes were low. The GRADE summary of the findings is shown in Additional file 2.

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^8e4d4428]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

As the levels of variability in muscle mass and functional measurements are quite high in older adults, it is hard to obtain adequate statistical power to verify differences between groups in many studies on nutritional interventions. This meta-analysis showed that nutritional interventions have no additional effect on body composition, muscle strength, or physical function when combined with resistance training. Only creatine showed synergistic effects with resistance training on muscle mass. The enhanced effect of nutritional interventions for unhealthy older adults, such as frail, sarcopenic, or nutritionally deficient older adults, needs to be investigated in future studies. The long-term effects of nutrition on muscle function also need to be studied. In addition, additional studies should be conducted to identify the dietary parameters that maximize nutritional effects on muscle protein synthesis, including dose, frequency, distribution, and recipes that take into account interactions with other nutrients. Health-promoting interventions such as exercise and diet are important for at-risk older adults to prevent clinically evident disability. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a comprehensive synthesis of the experimental results available to date for health practitioners and researchers to establish intervention strategies or public health policies.

### Use of performance-enhancing substances [^ef35c6df]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary of PES mechanisms and effects — claims are often unsubstantiated, and training yields substantial gains: Initial claims of performance enhancement are often based on single or poorly designed studies and are commonly debunked, with evidence not supporting earlier benefits. Typical strength gains of approximately 30% are reported in youth resistance training programs of 8 to 20 weeks' duration; currently available and legal supplements cannot rival this rate, and PESs are not "shortcuts" and cannot compensate for poor training and nutrition.

### Resistance training load effects on muscle hypertrophy and strength gain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^f6564c21]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

Resistance training load effects on muscle hypertrophy

Thirty-five comparisons were undertaken on muscle hypertrophy involving 24 studies The results from the consistency network meta-analysis provided no differences in muscle hypertrophy between high- and low-load, moderate- and low-load, or high- and moderate-load resistance training (P = 0.113–0.469; Table 2 and Fig. 3). The heterogeneity was I² = 0%. Furthermore, no differences between the loads were observed in the subgroup analysis involving the best-quality studies (number of comparisons = 16, I² = 0%, P = 0.871–0.995; Table 2). Although the results of the consistency model indicate that moderate-load (84.5%) and high-load resistance training (75.8%) are the best load for muscle hypertrophy in overall and high-quality subgroup analyses, respectively, the ES values were unlikely to be considered meaningful (small ES: range, −0.09 to 0.15). The inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons was not significant in the network analysis for all studies (Q = 6.2, P = 0.103) or in the subgroup analysis (Q = 0.3, P = 0.957), as well as in the node-splitting analysis across comparisons between load groups (all studies: P = 0.424–0.914; best-quality studies: P = 0.615–0.760). No publication bias was identified after the inspection of funnel plots asymmetry by Egger's test (P = 0.497–0.909).

### Influence of eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation on lean body mass in cancer cachexia [^730292f9]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this short review is to discuss the potential causes for the discrepancy in results between previous EPA supplementation studies, and examine these causes in relation with more recent clinical studies. Understanding the limitations of current studies and discrepancies throughout the literature is fundamental for proceeding with future studies.

Although the focus of this review is the effect of EPA on LBM, EPA may also independently improve function and physical activity. Although a full discussion on these outcomes is beyond the scope of this review, there is a relationship between muscle mass, strength and function, and it is likely that improvements in LBM also reflect improvements in muscle function.

### Influence of eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation on lean body mass in cancer cachexia [^9a49b973]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Timing of intervention with EPA

An international panel of experts on cachexia recently developed a classification system, which recognises that cachexia occurs across a continuum, varying in severity and stage: (1) pre-cachexia: early clinical or metabolic signs of cachexia, low-grade weight loss, which may progress to cachexia, (2) cachexia: weight loss > 5% in the last 6 months or a combination of > 2% weight loss with low muscle or low BMI, and (3) refractory cachexia: occurs close to death due to rapidly progressing disease, which is unresponsive to anti-cancer therapy. In refractory cachexia, accelerated loss of tissues amounting to deficits of more than 4 kg of both muscle and adipose tissue have been reported. It is unlikely that these deficits can be overcome, and it has been suggested that anti-cachexia therapy should be diverted away from the end of life when the burden of intervention likely outweighs any benefits. Thus, it is critical that research looks to interventions that can be initiated during the pre-cachexia stage, with the aim of preventing deleterious losses of muscle.

### Influence of eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation on lean body mass in cancer cachexia [^0bdfa256]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Cancer cachexia is characterised by a progressive loss of muscle, resulting in functional impairment and shorter survival. Eicosapentaenoic acid, an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid found in fish, has been studied for its role as an anti-cachexia therapy. Initial results of eicosapentaenoic supplementation in advanced cancer were promising with improvements in lean body mass (LBM), appetite and quality of life. However, subsequent larger phase III clinical trials reported minimal benefits of supplementation. Recently, several studies have used different study designs, which may provide insight on the effectiveness of eicosapentaenoic in cancer cachexia and also on potential sources of divergent results in previous trials. This review examines the potential benefit of eicosapentaenoic supplementation on LBM and discusses limitations with current studies to identify methods which may aid in progressing the research of future clinical trials.

### Reduced muscular fatigue after a 12-week leucine-rich amino acid supplementation combined with moderate training in elderly: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial [^3193249d]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Although the mechanisms leading to age-related muscle loss are likely numerous, a disproportionate ratio of muscle protein breakdown compared with muscle protein synthesis is believed to have high relevance. There is evidence that an increased availability of protein or amino acids can shift the metabolism towards anabolism and particularly enhance muscle protein synthesis in young and older subjects. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine in particular, may be responsible for the amino-acid-induced stimulation of muscle protein synthesis. Leucine appears to play a key role in the regulation of muscle protein synthesis, and most notable effects on amino -acid metabolism in the skeletal muscle have been observed for leucine. One site for leucine action is a kinase in the insulin signalling cascade previously identified as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which has a central role in the regulation of protein synthesis. Leucine also stimulates activation of a second initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4G through an mTOR-independent kinase. Additionally, leucine seems to play a role in decreasing the protein degradation rate. Strength training and activity are very important in preventing age-related muscle loss due to its influence on muscle mass and protein synthesis. For initiation of muscle protein synthesis and hypertrophy, a complementary, appropriate nutrition that is rich in protein, especially BCAAs, is also important to support training effects and may positively influence the protein synthesis to protein degradation ratio. The whole-body protein synthesis declines from birth to old age. High-protein meals have been shown not to enhance the myofibrillar synthesisbut amino acids alone to stimulate muscle protein anabolism in younger and older people. As skeletal muscle mass is responsive to changes in physical activity, reduced activity in older people participates to the complex progress of sarcopenia. If exercise, which positively influences protein homeostasis, is combined with an increased uptake of BCAAs, especially leucine, it could be beneficial in maintaining muscle mass and muscle function and prevent sarcopenia.

Little and Phillips proposed three stimulants of protein synthesis: Leucine, Insulin and resistance training. A combination of resistance exercise with dietary intake of leucine-enriched amino acids should therefore present the most effective strategy to promote a beneficial relation between protein synthesis and degradation. Due to the role of leucine in the protein synthesis pathway and the muscle degradation mechanism, the focus of interest lies in its influence on muscle building and in its potential for supporting regeneration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 12-week leucine-rich amino acid supplementation in combination with moderate training in elderly participants.

### Protein supplementation during resistance-type exercise training in the elderly [^910135a6]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Resistance training has been well established as an effective treatment strategy to increase skeletal muscle mass and strength in the elderly. We assessed whether dietary protein supplementation can further augment the adaptive response to prolonged resistance-type exercise training in healthy elderly men and women.

Methods

Healthy elderly men (n = 31, 70 ± 1 yr) and women (n = 29, 70 ± 1 yr) were randomly assigned to a progressive, 24-wk resistance-type exercise training program with or without additional protein supplementation (15 g·d-1). Muscle hypertrophy was assessed on a whole-body Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), limb (computed tomography), and muscle fiber (biopsy) level. Strength was assessed regularly by 1-repetition maximum (RM) strength testing. Functional capacity was assessed with a sit-to-stand and handgrip test.

Results

One-RM strength increased by 45% ± 6% versus 40% ± 3% (women) and 41% ± 4% versus 44% ± 3% (men) in the placebo versus protein group, respectively (P < 0.001), with no differences between groups. Leg muscle mass (women, 4% ± 1% vs 3% ± 1%; men, 3% ± 1% vs 3% ± 1%) and quadriceps cross-sectional area (women, 9% ± 1% vs 9% ± 1%; men, 9% ± 1% vs 10% ± 1%) increased similarly in the placebo versus protein groups (P < 0.001). Type II muscle fiber size increased over time in both placebo and protein groups (25% ± 13% vs 30% ± 9% and 23% ± 12% vs 22% ± 10% in the women and men, respectively). Sit-to-stand improved by 18% ± 2% and 19% ± 2% in women and men, respectively (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Prolonged resistance-type exercise training increases skeletal muscle mass and strength, augments functional capacity, improves glycemia and lipidemia, and reduces blood pressure in healthy elderly men and women. Additional protein supplementation (15 g·d-1) does not further increase muscle mass, strength, and/or functional capacity.

### Equivalent hypertrophy and strength gains in β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate-or leucine-supplemented men [^b222ca68]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Maximal Strength

In response to 12 wk of RT, 1-RM strength for squat, bench press and deadlift increased (P < 0.01). There was an increase posttraining in squat 1-RM for Whey+HMB (33 ± 10 kg) and Whey+Leu (35 ± 17 kg, Table 3). The increase in bench press 1-RM was similar for whey+HMB (11 ± 5 kg) and whey+leu (11 ± 7 kg, Table 3). The increase in deadlift 1-RM for whey+HMB (25 ± 12 kg) was similar to whey+leu (34 ± 22 kg, Table 3). There were no significant differences in any 1-RM strength test from baseline to week 12 between for whey+HMB and whey+leu (P > 0.05). After 12 wk of training, there was a significant increase in total strength for whey+HMB (70 ± 21 kg) and whey+leu (80 ± 40 kg) with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.41). Upon completion of week 1 to week 8 (phase 1), both groups experienced similar changes in squat 1-RM (21 ± 11 kg and 27 ± 11 kg, P = 0.24), bench press (10 ± 4 kg and 10 ± 5 kg, P = 0.89), and deadlift (18 ± 7 kg and 25 ± 19 kg, P = 0.22) for whey+HMB and whey+leu, respectively. Upon completion of phase 2 (overreaching), both groups experienced similar changes in squat (3 ± 7 kg and − 2 ± 9 kg, P = 0.24), bench press (−2 ± 4 kg and − 1 ± 3 kg, P = 0.43), and deadlift (−2 ± 8 kg and − 6 ± 11 kg, P = 0.15), whey+HMB and whey+leu, respectively. The decrement in total strength after week 8 to week 10 (overreaching) was 1 ± 12 kg for whey+HMB and 8 ± 19 kg for whey+leu. (P = 0.29). After a 2-wk taper (Phase 3), total 1-RM strength recovered similarly between groups (P = 0.25) from overreaching: whey+HMB (20 ± 9 kg) and whey+leu (28 ± 22 kg). There was a significant increase in total 1-RM strength from (week 8 to week 12) with no difference in whey+HMB (21 ± 10 kg) and whey+leu (18 ± 18 kg, P = 0.59).

### A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults [^e95bc79f]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Meta-regression

In an effort to understand the sources of heterogeneity meta-regressions were performed on 1RM, FFM and fibre CSA because they were statistically significant, had considerable unexplained heterogeneity (I²) and had a sufficient number of studies (≥ 10). Meta-regression was used instead of subgroup analyses to allow for the use of continuous covariates and to allow for the inclusion of more than one covariate at a time. Four covariates were chosen a priori to be included in our meta-regression: baseline protein intake (g/kg/day), postexercise protein dose (g), chronological age and training status because there is evidence that baseline protein intake, protein dose, ageand training statuscould influence the efficacy of protein supplementation; summarised here. These covariates were meta-regressed individually and together in a random-effects meta-regression model using Stata (StataCorp. 2011. Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station, Texas, USA). The random-effects meta-regression used residual restricted maximum likelihood to measure between-study variance (τ 2) with a Knapp-Hartung modification as recommended. When all four covariates were analysed together permutation tests were performed (n = 1000) to address the issue of multiple testing by calculating adjusted p values. Additional covariates were identified and individually analysed post hoc to further explore the unexplained variance of the effect of protein supplementation during RET on changes in 1RM and FFM. Continuous covariates were: MD in the change in protein intake (g/day), MD in the total relative protein intake (g/kg/day), number of repetitions/set, number of sets/exercise, number of exercises/session, number of sessions/week, number of weeks and total RET volume in kg: repetitions/set × sets/exercise × exercises/session × sessions/week × intervention duration in weeks. Categorical variables were: protein supplement source (whey vs soy), sex (male vs female), type (dietary-supplement vs RET-supplement), whole-body RET (whole-body RET vs not whole-body RET) and RET supervision (supervised vs not supervised). Protein supplement source was limited to soy and whey because there were few study groups that were provided either a casein (n = 3) or pea (n = 1) protein supplement exclusively.

### An evidence-based narrative review of mechanisms of resistance exercise-induced human skeletal muscle hypertrophy [^0f442267]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2022). Medium credibility.

Skeletal muscle plays a critical role in physical function, athletic performance, and metabolic health, and low muscle mass is associated with greater mortality in healthy adults and adults with comorbidities. The regulation of skeletal muscle mass is influenced by several variables that can broadly be categorized into external or internal system variables. Resistance exercise training (RET) is the most potent nonpharmacological external means of increasing skeletal muscle mass and is an external system variable. In contrast, internal variables are inherent systemic or, more often, local (within the muscle) biological processes that mechanistically underpin hypertrophy in response to external stimuli like RET (Fig. 1). An important question is to what extent manipulation of external variables influences internal variable responses to affect the outcome — hypertrophy. In our view, identifying the key skeletal muscle molecular targets activated by resistance exercise (RE) that, with repetition, will underpin RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is critical.

### The effects of flaxseed dietary supplement on lipid profile, bone mineral density, and symptoms in menopausal women: a randomized, double-blind, wheat germ placebo-controlled clinical trial [^b2c3ffc5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Phytoestrogens are increasingly incorporated into the diet of menopausal women. However, there are limited data on the efficacy of flaxseed on the consequences of estrogen deficiency in menopausal women. The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of flaxseed incorporation into the diet of healthy menopausal women. One hundred and ninety-nine menopausal women were randomly assigned to consume 40 g flaxseed/d (n = 101) or wheat germ placebo (n = 98) for 12 months. At baseline and at month 12, serum levels of lipids, bone mineral density (BMD), and menopausal symptoms were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed under the intention to treat principle. Flaxseed reduced serum total (-0.20 ± 0.51 mmol/liter; P = 0.012) and high-density lipoprotein (-0.08 ± 0.24 mmol/liter; P = 0.031) cholesterol concentrations compared with wheat germ placebo. BMD did not differ significantly between the two arms. Both flaxseed and wheat germ reduced (P < 0.0001) the severity scores of menopausal symptoms, but no statistical difference was found between the two arms. Our findings suggest that 1-yr incorporation of flaxseed into the diet produced a favorable, but not clinically significant, effect on blood cholesterol and caused no significant change in BMD or symptoms in healthy menopausal women.

### The effect of flaxseed supplementation in processed foods on serum fatty acids and enterolactone [^dc039ad0]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose was to study the effects of flaxseed supplementation as a part of daily diet on serum lipids, fatty acids and plasma enterolactone.

Design

Eighty volunteers participated in this clinical nutrition study which was carried out in a controlled, double-blind and cross-over manner. The subjects were randomized to diet sequences AB or BA. Diet A meals contained 1.3 g/100 g ground flaxseed and 5 g/100 g flaxseed oil. Also 3–4 g/100 of inulin and wheat fiber was added. AB diet with non-supplemented foods served as control. Test subjects were on both diets for 4 weeks separated by a 4-week wash-out period. Fifteen test subjects continued an open part of the study for 4 additional months.

Interventions

The dietary intake, basic blood values, serum lipids, fatty acids and enterolactone were measured at baseline, after both intervention periods and during the open study, at baseline and after 2 and 4 months. Serum thiocyanate and blood cadmium were controlled after both intervention periods.

Results

The percentage of flaxseed supplemented test food out of total dietary intake was 20% of energy. The test food contained significantly higher amounts of fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and especially alpha-linolenic acid than the control food. No significant changes were observed in the basic laboratory values or in blood lipids. There was a significant increase in serum alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid. Serum enterolactone concentration was doubled during flaxseed supplementation. Serum thiocyanate and blood cadmium values did not exceed reference values and there was no difference between the diets.

Conclusions

In this study we were able to show that, by adding ground flaxseed and flaxseed oil to one or two daily meals, it is possible to obtain significant effects on serum levels of enterolactone and alpha-linolenic acid.

Sponsorship

The study was sponsored by the National Technology Agency of Finland (Tekes).

### Fatty acid composition of skeletal muscle reflects dietary fat composition in humans [^e45fe7b2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

It is still unknown whether the fatty acid composition of human skeletal muscle lipids is directly influenced by the fat composition of the diet.

Objective

We investigated whether the fatty acid composition of the diet is reflected in the fatty acid profile of skeletal muscle phospholipids and triacylglycerols.

Design

Thirty-two healthy adults (25 men and 7 women) included in a larger controlled, multicenter dietary study were randomly assigned to diets containing a high proportion of either saturated fatty acids (SFAs) [total fat, 36% of energy; SFAs, 18% of energy; monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), 10% of energy] or MUFAs (total fat, 35% of energy; SFAs, 9% of energy; MUFAs, 19% of energy) for 3 mo. Within each diet group, there was a second random assignment to supplementation with fish oil capsules [containing 3.6 g n-3 fatty acids/d; 2.4 g eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3)] or placebo. A muscle biopsy sample was taken from the vastus lateralis muscle after the diet period. Parallel analyses of diet and supplementation effects were performed.

Results

The proportions of myristic (14:0), pentadecanoic (15:0), heptadecanoic (17:0), and palmitoleic (16:1n-7) acids in the skeletal muscle phospholipids were higher and the proportion of oleic acid (18:1n-9) was lower in the SFA group than in the MUFA group. The proportion of total n-3 fatty acids in the muscle phospholipids was approximately 2.5 times higher, with a 5 times higher proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3), in subjects supplemented with n-3 fatty acids than in those given placebo. Similar differences were observed in the skeletal muscle triacylglycerols.

Conclusion

The fatty acid composition of skeletal muscle lipids reflects the fatty acid composition of the diet in healthy men and women.

### Equivalent hypertrophy and strength gains in β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate-or leucine-supplemented men [^2b9eeac6]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2019). Medium credibility.

Ingestion of proteins with high leucine content during resistance training (RT) can augment hypertrophy. Some data suggest that a leucine metabolite, β-hydroxy, β-methylbutyrate (HMB), is substantially more anabolically efficacious than leucine.

Purpose

We aimed to test whether supplementation with HMB versus leucine, added to whey protein, would result in differential muscle hypertrophy and strength gains in young men performing RT.

Methods

Twenty-six resistance-trained men (23 ± 2 yr) performed 12 wk of RT with three phases. Phase 1: 8 wk of periodized RT (three training sessions per week). Phase 2: 2 wk overreaching period (five sessions per week). Phase 3: 2 wk taper (three sessions per week). Participants were randomly assigned to twice daily ingestion of: whey protein (25 g) plus HMB (1.5 g) (whey+HMB; n = 13) or whey protein (25 g) plus leucine (1.5 g) (whey+leu; n = 13). Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed before and after RT. Measures of fat- and bone-free mass, vastus lateralis (VL) muscle thickness and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) (both by ultrasound), muscle fiber CSA, and 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) strength tests were determined.

Results

We observed increases in fat- and bone-free mass, VL muscle thickness, muscle CSA and fiber type CSA and 1-RM strength with no differences between groups at any phase. We observed no differences between groups or time-group interactions in hormone concentrations at any phase of the RT program.

Conclusions

β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate added to whey did not result in greater increases in any measure of muscle mass, strength, or hormonal concentration compared to leucine added to whey. Our results show that HMB is no more effective in stimulating RT-induced hypertrophy and strength gains than leucine.

### Examining guidelines and new evidence in oncology nutrition: a position paper on gaps and opportunities in multimodal approaches to improve patient care [^4539112f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Nutrition therapy is essential in cancer care

Nutrition intervention encompasses nutrition counseling and education, oral nutritional supplements (ONS), and enteral and/or parenteral nutrition support, as appropriate for each individual case. Healthcare providers should proactively identify early indicators of malnutrition risk in their patients (e.g. anorexia and reduced food intake) and intervene with additional protein and energy before cachexia develops, rather than reactively doing so when patients become severely depleted (i.e. refractory cachexia). Intervening early and throughout treatment may help to improve nutrition status and, ultimately, quality and length of life. Nutrition societies recommend intervening early to support an adequate intake during and after treatment that is based on a patient's total energy and protein needs (Supplementary Table 3 and Fig. 2), disease status, current intake, lifestyle, and food preferences. Several RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses involving patients with different tumor types and undergoing various anticancer treatments have shown that nutrition therapy improves weight status, energy and protein intakes, treatment tolerance, and survival and reduces nutrition impact symptoms, hospital readmissions, and mortality. While not all evidence supporting oncology nutrition is based on RCTs, the body of evidence is substantial and should not be dismissed. This is an important consideration given the frequency of non-evidence-based medical practice in oncology, which has been reported to occur in 33% of patients.

Fig. 2
Expert energy and protein recommendations for patients with cancer

Specific nutrients may have important roles in improving nutrition status while mitigating metabolic changes and the consequential decline in muscle mass and physical function in patients with cancer. One example is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a long-chain omega-3 fatty acid (ω–3) found in fish oil, with some current guidelines recommending EPA or fish oil supplementation to stabilize or improve appetite, and increase food intake, muscle mass, and body weight in patients with cachexia and/or advanced cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (n = 1350) demonstrated consuming high-protein ONS enriched with ω–3 fatty acids was associated with improved body weight, attenuated lean mass loss, and improved selected domains of quality of life among patients receiving chemotherapy.

### Temporal response of angiogenesis and hypertrophy to resistance training in young men [^eaffb209]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2018). Low credibility.

Although endurance exercise training promotes angiogenesis and improves metabolic health, the effect of resistance training on this process is less well defined. We hypothesized that capillarization would increase proportionally, and concurrently, with muscle fiber hypertrophy in response to resistance training in young men.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized control trial, 36 men (22 ± 1 yr) were randomized to placebo or protein supplementation, and participated in 12 wk of resistance training. Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected before and after 2, 4, 8, and 12 wk of training. Immunohistochemistry assessed fiber type-specific size and capillarization. Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assessed proteins involved in the molecular regulation of angiogenesis.

Results

Resistance training effectively increased Type I (15% ± 4%; P < 0.01) and Type II fiber cross-sectional area (28% ± 5%; P < 0.0001), an effect that tended to be further enhanced with protein supplementation in Type II fibers (P = 0.078). Capillary-to-fiber ratio significantly increased in Type I (P = 0.001) and II (P = 0.015) fibers after 12 wk of resistance exercise training and was evident after only 2 wk. Capillary-to-fiber perimeter exchange index increased in the Type I fibers only (P = 0.054) after 12 wk of training. Training resulted in a reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA. A (P = 0.008), while vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (P = 0.016), hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (P = 0.016), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (P = 0.01) increased in both groups. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α protein content was higher in the protein group (main group effect, P = 0.02), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase content demonstrated a divergent relationship (time-group interaction, P = 0.049).

Conclusions

This study presents novel evidence that microvascular adaptations and the molecular pathways involved are elevated after 2 wk of a 12-wk resistance training program. Increases in muscle fiber cross-sectional area are effectively matched by the changes in the microvasculature, providing further support for resistance training programs to optimize metabolic health.

### A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults [^6657e910]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We performed a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression to determine if dietary protein supplementation augments resistance exercise training (RET)-induced gains in muscle mass and strength.

Data Sources

A systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL and SportDiscus.

Eligibility Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials with RET ≥ 6weeks in duration and dietary protein supplementation.

Design

Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions with four a priori determined covariates. Two-phase break point analysis was used to determine the relationship between total protein intake and changes in fat-free mass (FFM).

Results

Data from 49 studies with 1863 participants showed that dietary protein supplementation significantly (all p < 0.05) increased changes (means (95% CI)) in: strength-one-repetition-maximum (2.49kg (0.64, 4.33)), FFM (0.30kg (0.09, 0.52)) and muscle size-muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA; 310µm² (51, 570)) and mid-femur CSA (7.2mm² (0.20, 14.30)) during periods of prolonged RET. The impact of protein supplementation on gains in FFM was reduced with increasing age (-0.01kg (-0.02,-0.00), p = 0.002) and was more effective in resistance-trained individuals (0.75kg (0.09, 1.40), p = 0.03). Protein supplementation beyond total protein intakes of 1.62g/kg/day resulted in no further RET-induced gains in FFM.

Summary/Conclusion

Dietary protein supplementation significantly enhanced changes in muscle strength and size during prolonged RET in healthy adults. Increasing age reduces and training experience increases the efficacy of protein supplementation during RET. With protein supplementation, protein intakes at amounts greater than ~1.6g/kg/day do not further contribute RET-induced gains in FFM.

### Protein interventions augment the effect of resistance exercise on appendicular lean mass and handgrip strength in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^2de478a5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Increased protein intake is suggested as a strategy to slow or reverse the loss of muscle mass and strength observed in sarcopenia, but results from studies that directly tested this possibility have been inconsistent.

Objectives

We assessed the evidence on the effects of whole protein supplementation or higher-protein diets, without the use of amino acids or supplements known to stimulate hypertrophy, alone or in combination with resistance exercise (RE) interventions, on lean body mass (LBM) and strength in older adults.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases from January 1990 to July 2021. Randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of protein supplementation and/or higher-protein dietary interventions in older adults (mean age ≥ 50 y) on total LBM, appendicular lean mass (ALM), and handgrip (HG) and knee extension (KE) strength were included.

Results

Twenty-eight studies were identified. In pooled analysis, compared with lower protein controls, protein supplementation did not have a significant positive effect on total LBM [weighted mean difference in change (WMD): 0.34; 95% CI: -0.21, 0.89; I² = 90.01%], ALM (WMD: 0.4; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.81; I² = 90.38%), HG strength (WMD: 0.69; 95% CI: -0.69, 2.06; I² = 94.52%), or KE strength (WMD: 1.88; 95% CI: -0.6, 4.35; I² = 95.35%). However, in interventions that used also RE, statistically significant positive effects of protein were observed for ALM (WMD: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.03, 1.05; I2 = 89.76%) and HG (WMD: 1.71; 95% CI: 0.12, 3.30; I2 = 88.71%). Meta-regression revealed no significant association between age, per-meal protein dose, duration, and baseline protein intake with change in any outcome. Subgroup analysis revealed the statistically significant effects on ALM occurred only in sarcopenic/frail populations (WMD: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.25; I2 = 79.0%). Most studies (n = 22) had some risk of bias.

Conclusions

In older adults performing RE, increased protein intake leads to greater ALM and HG strength compared with lower protein controls. Without RE, protein has no additional benefit on changes in total LBM, ALM, or HG strength.

### Resistance training load effects on muscle hypertrophy and strength gain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c7b2e6f4]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

The mean exercise intervention duration was 8.9 ± 2.1 wk, with an average of 24.6 ± 7.5 sessions (range, 16–48). Most of the studies undertook a between-subject experimental design (22 of 28, or 78.6%) and prescribed the resistance training program by repetitions maximum (18 of 28, or 64.3%; Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content 2, characteristics of included studies). Regarding the assessments, muscle hypertrophy was assessed for the lower limbs in 15 studies (.), followed by 8 studies assessing the upper limbs and 5 studies assessing the whole body (e.g. dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), whereas lower-body muscle strength was assessed in 20 studies (.), followed by 12 studies assessing upper-body muscle strength, all using the 1-RM test. Eighteen studies reported the total volume performed during the intervention The number of studies among the resistance training loads for muscle hypertrophy and muscle strength is shown in the network geometry (Fig. 2, panels A and B, respectively).

### Long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and exercise-induced muscle damage: EPA or DHA? [^423c5915]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may enhance recovery from exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). However, it is unclear if the effects are due to EPA, DHA, or both. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effect of EPA + DHA, EPA, and DHA compared with placebo (PL) on muscular recovery.

Methods

Thirty males were randomized to 4 g·d⁻¹ EPA + DHA (n = 8), EPA (n = 8), DHA (n = 7), or PL (n = 7). After 7-wk supplementation, a downhill running (20 min, 70% V̇O₂max, −16% gradient) plus jumping lunges (5 × 20 reps, 2-min rest intervals) muscle damage protocol was performed. Indices of muscle damage, soreness, muscle function, and inflammation were measured at baseline and throughout recovery. The omega-3 index (O3i; %EPA + %DHA in erythrocytes) was used to track tissue EPA and DHA status.

Results

After supplementation, the O3i was significantly higher than PL in all experimental groups (P < 0.001). Leg press performance was lower in the PL group at 24 h compared with EPA (P = 0.019) and at 72 h for EPA (P = 0.004) and DHA (P = 0.046). Compared with PL, muscle soreness was lower in the DHA (P = 0.015) and EPA (P = 0.027) groups at 48 h. Albeit nonsignificant, EPA + DHA tended to attenuate muscle soreness (d = 1.37) and leg strength decrements (d = 0.75) compared with PL. Jump performance and power metrics improved more rapidly in the EPA and DHA groups (time effects: P < 0.001). Measures of inflammation, range of motion, and muscle swelling were similar between groups (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Compared with PL, 4 g·d⁻¹ of EPA or DHA for 52 d improves certain aspects of recovery from EIMD. EPA + DHA did not clearly enhance recovery. Equivalent dosing of EPA + DHA may blunt the performance effects observed in EPA or DHA alone.

### Resistance training load effects on muscle hypertrophy and strength gain: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^054fb8e2]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

There are three important findings from our systematic review and network meta-analysis of the dose–response relationship between resistance training load and gains in muscle hypertrophy and strength. First, in untrained and recreationally trained individuals (i.e. not strength athletes), muscle hypertrophy gains are likely to be similar regardless of resistance training load when performed to volitional failure over relatively short periods of intervention. In line with the physiological adaptation principle of diminishing returns, untrained participants exhibit greater muscle hypertrophy compared with those with even modest prior experience in resistance training. Furthermore, undertaking more resistance training sessions provides superior muscle size gains in those with previous training experience. Second, effects on muscle strength are load dependent, with higher loads resulting in greater gains over the relatively short interventions reviewed. Finally, the results for muscle hypertrophy and strength were maintained even when only the higher-quality studies were considered, that is, studies with less risk of bias. Therefore, although improvements in muscle hypertrophy seem to be load independent for untrained and recreationally trained individuals, muscle strength increases are superior with high-load resistance training programs of short duration.

### Effect of flaxseed consumption on flow-mediated dilation and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized controlled trial [^39ea9f85]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Available data indicate a possible beneficial effect of flaxseed on cardiovascular disease, but limited studies have evaluated the effects of flaxseed on endothelial dysfunction and biomarkers of inflammation in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of flaxseed consumption on flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and inflammatory markers in CAD patients.

Subjects/Method

In this randomized controlled parallel trial, 50 patients with CAD of both genders were randomly allocated to 12 weeks consumption of flaxseed (30g/day) or usual care control. Before and after the intervention, changes in brachial FMD and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukine-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured.

Results

Forty-four participants (aged 56.43 ± 8.21 years; BMI 26.65 ± 2.44kg/m 2) completed the study. No significant weight change was observed in either group. Compared to control (n = 23), flaxseed consumption (n = 21) was associated with improved FMD (mean of change from baseline was 5.1 vs -0.55%; p = 0.001 for the flaxseed and control, respectively). When compared to control, flaxseed consumption was associated with reduced inflammatory markers (mean of change from baseline for hs-CRP was -1.18 and -0.3mg/L, p = 0.003; for IL-6 was -7.65 and -0.77pg/mL, p = 0.017; for TNF-α was -34.73 and -2.18pg/mL p = 0.001 in flaxseed and control, respectively).

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that by adding flaxseed to diet of CAD patients, it is possible to improve FMD and plasma levels of inflammatory markers.

### Does the combination of resistance training and a nutritional intervention have a synergic effect on muscle mass, strength, and physical function in older adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^c0833437]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Nutrient-dense foods that ensure sufficient intake of energy, protein and micronutrients are important to prevent frailty and sarcopenia and promote physical activity. However, to date, the optimal type of nutritional intervention or supplementation for the prevention of frailty and sarcopenia is unclear. This study was conducted to compare the synergistic effect of nutritional interventions combined with resistance training with that of resistance training alone. This study can provide insight into resource optimization and strategies to prevent frailty and sarcopenia.

This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that there were no additional effects of nutritional interventions when combined with resistance training on muscle mass, strength, or physical function. Of note, in two studies, the control conditions included some nutrients that have biological benefits, which likely reduced the calculated effect size when the data for the control conditions were pooled. However, the findings of the sensitivity analysis showed little possibility of blunted effects. One of the possible reasons for this lack of significant results is that the analysis included studies of healthy older adults who might not have nutrient deficiencies with the usual diets. Healthy diets provide a broad range of micronutrients and bioactive nonnutrients as well as macronutrients that might not be included in the experimental supplements in trials. In addition, since diets are patterned, isolating the effects of individual experimental supplements might not be possible without controlling for the usual diet. Thus, the effects of nutritional interventions might be blunted among older adults who habitually consume sufficient nutrients. However, in previous studies that provided vitamin D-deficient and mobility-limited older adults with a protein mixture containing 20 g protein, 800 IU vitamin D, 350 mg calcium, and other minerals once a day for 6 months with an exercise program, there were no differences in muscle function parameters such as leg strength, gait speed, and short physical performance battery between this group and the exercise-only control group except in muscle density. In another study that also provided sarcopenic older adults who had low protein intake with multinutrient supplements containing 21 g protein, 800 IU vitamin D and other nutrients once a day for 3 months with an exercise program, there were no differences between the two groups, although both groups exhibited improved muscle function. It is necessary to additionally consider the dose of the nutrient and duration of intervention and monitor dietary energy intake. Despite the lack of evidence, greater benefits of resistance training along with nutritional supplementation are expected in older adults who already have poor muscle function or habitually have low nutrient intake.

### IOC consensus statement: dietary supplements and the high-performance athlete [^bb833455]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of many of the supplements targeted at athletes, however, is largely absent. There seems to be little incentive for those selling supplements to invest the substantial sums needed to undertake detailed scientific evaluation of their products. Even where some evidence does exist, it may not be relevant to the high-performance athlete because of limitations in the study design (such as the specificity of the exercise tests), the study population or the context of use. Failure to verify the composition of the supplements used may also give misleading results. It seems sensible to exercise caution when using supplements, as any compound that has the potential to enhance health or exercise performance by altering physiological function must also have the potential for adverse effects in some individuals. Athletes should see good evidence of a performance or other benefit, and should be confident that it will not be harmful to health, before accepting the financial cost and the health or performance risks associated with any supplement. Finally, the athlete should be sure, if supplements or sports foods are to be used, that they have undertaken due diligence to source products that are at low risk of containing prohibited substances.

### Effect of protein and amino acids supplements on muscle strength and physical performance: a scoping review of randomized controlled trials [^866a0e80]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Protein and amino acid supplementation is an effective intervention that significantly enhances physical function and reduces frailty and sarcopenia in older adults. This scoping review aims to map and synthesize the available evidence on the effects of various types of protein and amino acid supplementation in this population. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a literature search to identify clinical trials examining the effects of protein and amino acid supplementation, with or without physical exercise, on muscle strength, physical performance, and body composition in healthy, frail, or sarcopenic older adults. Our analysis of 80 trials with a total of 5290 participants examines the evidence for the effectiveness of protein supplementation in enhancing muscle strength and body composition. Whey protein, creatine, milk protein, leucine, essential amino acids, and soy protein were the most used types of protein, and our findings indicate that whey protein, creatine, and milk protein yield the best results when used in conjunction with resistance training. Additionally, leucine and milk protein have shown the potential to enhance body composition even without concurrent resistance training. In conclusion, studies on the effectiveness of whey protein in improving muscle strength and body composition in older adults with resistance training are inconsistent. More research is required to explore the potential benefits of soy and leucine-enriched supplements. Protein supplementation's impact on physical performance remains inconclusive. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of protein types and supplementation on muscle-related parameters in older adults.
