## Question

Hypertension first line treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for first-line pharmacologic therapy for hypertension, including which drug classes to choose, when to use monotherapy versus combination therapy, and how to individualize by stage, comorbidities, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that blood pressure lowering itself drives most of the benefit. Then, I should verify which drug classes are truly first-line and why. Next, I will examine the evidence for thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, and calcium channel blockers, and clarify where beta-blockers fit. After that, I need to check when to start with monotherapy versus initial combination therapy, including single-pill combinations. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring and titration, and resistant hypertension strategies, and I will double-check any conflicting data points before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: the magnitude of blood pressure reduction is the primary determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction, and class effects beyond BP lowering are generally modest, so I should prioritize getting BP to target rather than fixating on a specific drug class, while still aligning choices with comorbidities and tolerability [^115V4yM2] [^117DKjSW].

> I need to verify which drug classes are universally recommended as first-line. Across contemporary guidelines, four classes consistently appear: thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs; beta-blockers are generally not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension but remain important for compelling indications such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or arrhythmia control [^113u9ZD3] [^111kNc8j] [^1143TDMX] [^117E9Ho2].

> Now, let me examine thiazide diuretics, especially low-dose regimens. High-quality evidence shows first-line low-dose thiazides reduce mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease, and total cardiovascular events versus control, and head-to-head data suggest they may outperform or match other classes for some outcomes; chlorthalidone and indapamide are preferred over hydrochlorothiazide when feasible due to potency and duration, though I should confirm that recent pragmatic data did not show superiority of switching from HCTZ to chlorthalidone for MACE, which tempers assumptions about class substitution benefits [^115FQHjS] [^114VRfqY] [^111zxsTh] [^1143TDMX].

> Next, I should review ACE inhibitors and ARBs. These RAS blockers reduce mortality, stroke, and coronary events in placebo-controlled trials and are broadly effective across diverse populations; they are particularly advantageous in diabetes with albuminuria or CKD, and ARBs are often better tolerated than ACE inhibitors in patients prone to cough, though I need to ensure I never combine an ACE inhibitor and an ARB because of harm [^115FQHjS] [^116y1erM] [^112J4jTd] [^112n9Y4e].

> I will now examine calcium channel blockers, especially dihydropyridines like amlodipine. CCBs are effective first-line agents with favorable adherence profiles and particular utility in older adults with isolated systolic hypertension; compared with some classes, CCBs may increase heart failure events but reduce stroke, so I should balance these tradeoffs and consider pairing CCBs with a RAS blocker to blunt neurohormonal activation and enhance BP control [^117HF4AY] [^113u9ZD3] [^114ramc6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about beta-blockers. I initially thought they were broadly first-line, but wait, I should double-check the contemporary stance: modern guidelines restrict beta-blockers to compelling indications such as HFrEF, post-MI, angina, or tachyarrhythmias because they are less effective at preventing stroke and have more adverse effects than the four principal classes in uncomplicated hypertension; observational and meta-analytic data reinforce higher stroke risk and inferior outcomes relative to thiazides, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs [^111kNc8j] [^114HskhJ] [^114NbSxd].

> Next, I should review when to start with monotherapy versus initial combination therapy. For stage 1 hypertension, starting with a single first-line agent and titrating or adding a second agent is reasonable; for stage 2 hypertension, initiating two first-line agents, ideally as a single-pill combination, is recommended to accelerate control and improve adherence; I need to ensure I avoid starting triple therapy initially unless the patient is very high risk and BP is markedly elevated, and I should confirm that SPCs are preferred whenever feasible to simplify regimens and enhance persistence [^114xvW8W] [^111kNc8j] [^111rJjTU] [^112XTFfx].

> Let me consider special populations and tailoring. In Black patients, thiazide diuretics or CCBs are preferred initially due to lower renin physiology and better BP response; in patients with diabetes and CKD, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are prioritized for renal protection; in older or frail adults, I should start gently and consider monotherapy if SBP is only modestly elevated; in pregnancy, methyldopa, nifedipine, or labetalol are appropriate, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs must be avoided [^115hsw1Z] [^111ma83f] [^116v5PnZ] [^112n9Y4e].

> I should confirm practical implementation details. Start at low doses and titrate every 2–4 weeks toward target BP, reassess adherence and adverse effects at each visit, and if dual therapy fails, move to a three-drug SPC comprising a RAS blocker, a CCB, and a thiazide-like diuretic; if BP remains uncontrolled on optimal triple therapy, evaluate for resistant hypertension and secondary causes, and add spironolactone if eGFR is at least 45 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116iPpfD] [^1158pLpV] [^117BqjS3].

> But wait, what about the strength of evidence for initial combination therapy on hard outcomes. I need to check this carefully: randomized outcome data directly comparing initial combination therapy versus monotherapy are limited and imprecise, so the strong recommendation for initial dual therapy in stage 2 hypertension rests on faster BP control, higher likelihood of achieving targets, and improved adherence with SPCs rather than definitive mortality differences in head-to-head trials; this means I should frame the combination-first approach as evidence-informed practice rather than outcome-proven superiority [^115Q3UvG] [^113i4TjW] [^112eUZf7].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For most patients without compelling indications, choose among thiazide-like diuretics, a dihydropyridine CCB, or a RAS blocker based on comorbidity, demographics, cost, and tolerability; in stage 2 hypertension, start two complementary agents as an SPC; in stage 1 hypertension, start one agent and escalate promptly if targets are not met; throughout, prioritize BP lowering to contemporary targets, monitor for adverse effects such as hypokalemia with thiazides, edema with CCBs, and cough or angioedema with ACE inhibitors, and avoid harmful combinations like dual RAS blockade [^111kNc8j] [^113Xz66w] [^112hnaWA] [^112J4jTd].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with high-credibility guidance. The consistent cross-guideline message is that thiazide-like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and dihydropyridine CCBs are appropriate first-line choices, beta-blockers are reserved for compelling indications, and initial combination therapy is preferred in stage 2 hypertension to achieve faster, more reliable control and improve adherence, with SPCs as the preferred formulation whenever available [^113u9ZD3] [^111kNc8j] [^111rJjTU].

---

First-line therapy for hypertension should be tailored to patient-specific factors, but **thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers are all acceptable first-line options** [^113u9ZD3] [^116GyidC]. Thiazide-like diuretics (especially chlorthalidone or indapamide) are preferred for most patients due to strong evidence of cardiovascular risk reduction [^113u9ZD3] [^114VRfqY]. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred for patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or proteinuria [^116y1erM] [^112n9Y4e]. Calcium channel blockers are preferred for older adults, Black patients, or those with isolated systolic hypertension [^notfound] [^115jzTRA]. Beta-blockers are not first-line unless there is a compelling indication such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or arrhythmia [^114HskhJ] [^113wcFJf]. Combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension or when BP is ≥ 20/10 mmHg above target, ideally as a single-pill combination to improve adherence [^113mCBSz] [^112FXV7A].

## First-line antihypertensive drug classes

Current guidelines recommend **four major drug classes** as first-line therapy:

| **Drug class** | **Examples** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics | - Chlorthalidone <br/> - Indapamide <br/> - Hydrochlorothiazide | - Preferred first-line for most patients <br/> - Strong evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction [^114VRfqY] [^115FQHjS] |
| Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) | - Lisinopril <br/> - Enalapril <br/> - Ramipril | - Preferred for diabetes, CKD, or proteinuria <br/> - Reduce cardiovascular events [^116y1erM] [^115FQHjS] |
| Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan <br/> - Irbesartan | - Alternative to ACE inhibitors <br/> - Preferred for diabetes, CKD, or proteinuria [^116y1erM] [^113wcFJf] |
| Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) | - Amlodipine <br/> - Diltiazem <br/> - Verapamil | - Preferred for older adults, Black patients, or isolated systolic hypertension [^111ZK52c] [^115vXdik] |

---

Beta-blockers are **not recommended as first-line therapy** unless there is a compelling indication such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or arrhythmia [^114HskhJ] [^117E9Ho2].

---

## Evidence supporting first-line therapy choices

- **Thiazide diuretics**: Strong evidence supports thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy, demonstrating significant reductions in cardiovascular events, stroke, and mortality [^114VRfqY] [^115FQHjS].
- **ACE inhibitors and ARBs**: Particularly beneficial for patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or proteinuria, reducing cardiovascular events and slowing renal disease progression [^111ma83f] [^116y1erM].
- **Calcium channel blockers**: Effective in older adults, Black patients, and those with isolated systolic hypertension, providing significant cardiovascular risk reduction [^111ZK52c] [^117HF4AY].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing first-line therapy selection

- **Age**: Younger patients (< 55 years) may benefit more from ACE inhibitors or ARBs, while older patients (≥ 55 years) may benefit more from thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers [^111ZK52c] [^115vXdik].
- **Ethnicity**: Black patients may respond better to thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers due to lower renin levels [^111ZK52c] [^115vXdik].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease significantly influence the choice of first-line therapy [^111ma83f] [^116y1erM].
- **Pregnancy**: Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are preferred antihypertensive agents during pregnancy.

---

## Role of combination therapy

Combination therapy is **recommended for patients with stage 2 hypertension** (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg) or when BP is ≥ 20/10 mmHg above target. Single-pill combinations are preferred to improve adherence and achieve faster BP control [^113mCBSz] [^1152SN5v] [^1165rPnZ].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications are **recommended for all patients with hypertension**, including:

- Weight loss
- Dietary sodium restriction
- Increased physical activity
- Alcohol moderation
- Smoking cessation

These modifications enhance the effectiveness of pharmacological therapy and are **essential components of hypertension management** [^116gfPwC] [^117DKjSW].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Regular monitoring of BP and adjustment of therapy are **essential** to achieve target BP levels. If BP remains uncontrolled, **treatment should be intensified** by increasing the dose, adding another antihypertensive agent, or switching to a different drug class [^116iPpfD] [^114BoaGX].

---

First-line therapy for hypertension should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, with thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and calcium channel blockers as the primary options. Combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension or when BP is significantly above target, and lifestyle modifications are essential for all patients.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^115FQHjS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2009. Sustained moderate to severe elevations in resting blood pressure leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review attempted to answer that question.

Objectives

To quantify the mortality and morbidity effects from different first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides (low-dose and high-dose), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and alpha-blockers, compared to placebo or no treatment. Secondary objectives: when different antihypertensive drug classes are used as the first-line drug, to quantify the blood pressure lowering effect and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse drug effects, compared to placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials (RCT) of at least one year duration, comparing one of six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment, in adult patients with blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg at baseline. The majority (over 70%) of the patients in the treatment group were taking the drug class of interest after one year. We included trials with both hypertensive and normotensive patients in this review if the majority (over 70%) of patients had elevated blood pressure, or the trial separately reported outcome data on patients with elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), total cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. We used a fixed-effect model to to combine dichotomous outcomes across trials and calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). We presented blood pressure data as mean difference (MD) with 99% CI.

Main Results

The 2017 updated search failed to identify any new trials. The original review identified 24 trials with 28 active treatment arms, including 58,040 patients. We found no RCTs for ARBs or alpha-blockers. These results are mostly applicable to adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. The mean age of participants was 56 years, and mean duration of follow-up was three to five years. High-quality evidence showed that first-line low-dose thiazides reduced mortality (11.0% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97); total CVS (12.9% with control versus 9.0% with treatment; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), stroke (6.2% with control versus 4.2% with treatment; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77), and coronary heart disease (3.9% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.84). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line high-dose thiazides reduced stroke (1.9% with control versus 0.9% with treatment; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61) and total CVS (5.1% with control versus 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.82), but did not reduce mortality (3.1% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.05), or coronary heart disease (2.7% with control versus 2.7% with treatment; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.20). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line beta-blockers did not reduce mortality (6.2% with control versus 6.0% with treatment; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.07) or coronary heart disease (4.4% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.03), but reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 2.8% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.97) and total CVS (7.6% with control versus 6.8% with treatment; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98). Low- to moderate-quality evidence showed that first-line ACE inhibitors reduced mortality (13.6% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95), stroke (6.0% with control versus 3.9% with treatment; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.82), coronary heart disease (13.5% with control versus 11.0% with treatment; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94), and total CVS (20.1% with control versus 15.3% with treatment; RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). Low-quality evidence showed that first-line calcium channel blockers reduced stroke (3.4% with control versus 1.9% with treatment; RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.84) and total CVS (8.0% with control versus 5.7% with treatment; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.87), but not coronary heart disease (3.1% with control versus 2.4% with treatment; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.09), or mortality (6.0% with control versus 5.1% with treatment; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09). There was low-quality evidence that withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with first-line low-dose thiazides (5.0% with control versus 11.3% with treatment; RR 2.38, 95% CI 2.06 to 2.75), high-dose thiazides (2.2% with control versus 9.8% with treatment; RR 4.48, 95% CI 3.83 to 5.24), and beta-blockers (3.1% with control versus 14.4% with treatment; RR 4.59, 95% CI 4.11 to 5.13). No data for these outcomes were available for first-line ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers. The blood pressure data were not used to assess the effect of the different classes of drugs as the data were heterogeneous, and the number of drugs used in the trials differed.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduced all morbidity and mortality outcomes in adult patients with moderate to severe primary hypertension. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence was of lower quality. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers were inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^115XyoWN]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on a large amount of data, which shows that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reducing cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping the therapeutic strategies as simple as possible and fostering adherence and persistence. As this approach constitutes a big shift from the stepped-care approaches that have been dominant for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we will discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation. We will also offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review answers that question.

Primary Objective

To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane clinical trial register, using standard search strategy of the hypertension review group with additional terms.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of at least one year duration comparing one of 6 major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment. More than 70% of people must have BP > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

Main Results

Of 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95) and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (11 RCTs) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85, 1.20). Beta-blockers (5 RCTs) reduced stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72, 0.97) and CVS (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81, 0.98) but not CHD (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78, 1.03) or mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86, 1.07). ACE inhibitors (3 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.95), stroke (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52–0.82), CHD (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and CVS (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67–0.85). Calcium-channel blocker (1 RCT) reduced stroke (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41, 0.84) and CVS (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57, 0.87) but not CHD (RR 0.77 95% CI 0.55, 1.09) or mortality (RR 0.86 95% CI 0.68, 1.09). No RCTs were found for ARBs or alpha-blockers.

Authors' Conclusions

First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. First-line ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and first-line beta-blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^115x2qQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015. Renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors include angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors. They are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for people with diabetes because of postulated advantages for reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use for hypertension, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in people with hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least six months follow-up in people with elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

This update includes three new RCTs, totaling 45 in all, involving 66,625 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large RCTs at low risk for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalizations, total cardiovascular (CV) events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalization), and end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.90, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.2%), and that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, absolute risk increase (ARI) 0.7%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs did not differ for all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09); total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02); and total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate-certainty evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line thiazides did not differ for all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07); total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11); and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01). Low-certainty evidence suggests they did not differ for ESRF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Low-certainty evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line beta-blockers did not differ for all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01); HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18); and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27). Blood pressure comparisons between first-line RAS inhibitors and other first-line classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. There is no information about non-fatal serious adverse events, as none of the trials reported this outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

All-cause death is similar for first-line RAS inhibitors and first-line CCBs, thiazides and beta-blockers. There are, however, differences for some morbidity outcomes. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. First-line CCBs increased HF but decreased stroke compared to first-line RAS inhibitors. The magnitude of the increase in HF exceeded the decrease in stroke. Low-quality evidence suggests that first-line RAS inhibitors reduced stroke and total CV events compared to first-line beta-blockers. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes.

### First-line diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs for hypertension [^114VRfqY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Different first-line drug classes for patients with hypertension are often assumed to have similar effectiveness with respect to reducing mortality and morbidity outcomes, and lowering blood pressure. First-line low-dose thiazide diuretics have been previously shown to have the best mortality and morbidity evidence when compared with placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons of thiazides with other blood pressure-lowering drug classes would demonstrate whether there are important differences.

Objectives

To compare the effects of first-line diuretic drugs with other individual first-line classes of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity, and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with hypertension. Secondary objectives included assessments of the need for added drugs, drug switching, and blood pressure-lowering.

Search Methods

Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registers to March 2021. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. A top-up search of the Specialized Register was carried out in June 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomized active comparator trials of at least one year's duration were included. Trials had a clearly defined intervention arm of a first-line diuretic (thiazide, thiazide-like, or loop diuretic) compared to another first-line drug class: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, or other antihypertensive drug classes. Studies had to include clearly defined mortality and morbidity outcomes (serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure, and withdrawals due to adverse effects).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 26 comparator arms randomizing over 90,000 participants. The findings are relevant to first-line use of drug classes in older male and female hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 75) with multiple co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. First-line thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were compared with beta-blockers (six trials), calcium channel blockers (eight trials), ACE inhibitors (five trials), and alpha-adrenergic blockers (three trials); other comparators included angiotensin II receptor blockers, aliskiren (a direct renin inhibitor), and clonidine (a centrally acting drug). Only three studies reported data for total serious adverse events: two studies compared diuretics with calcium channel blockers and one with a direct renin inhibitor. Compared to first-line beta-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.10; 5 trials, 18,241 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (5.4% versus 4.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.6%, moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), CHD (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), or heart failure (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.19; 1 trial, 6569 participants; low-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (10.1% versus 7.9%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85; 5 trials, 18,501 participants; ARR 2.2%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line calcium channel blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 7 trials, 35,417 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24; 2 trials, 7204 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (14.3% versus 13.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty) or CHD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (4.4% versus 3.2%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.82; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.2%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (7.6% versus 6.2%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88; 7 trials, 33,908 participants; ARR 1.4%; low-certainty). Compared to first-line ACE inhibitors, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 3 trials, 30,961 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.02; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce stroke slightly (4.7% versus 4.1%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; ARR 0.6%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; moderate-certainty) or heart failure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 2 trials, 30,392 participants; moderate-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (3.9% versus 2.9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84; 3 trials, 25,254 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line alpha-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (12.1% versus 9.0%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 3.1%; moderate-certainty) and stroke (2.7% versus 2.3%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 0.4%; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (5.4% versus 2.8%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.58; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; ARR 2.6%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (1.3% versus 0.9%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; 3 trials, 24,772 participants; ARR 0.4%; low-certainty). For the other drug classes, data were insufficient. No antihypertensive drug class demonstrated any clinically important advantages over first-line thiazides.

Authors' Conclusions

When used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, thiazides and thiazide-like drugs likely do not change total mortality and likely decrease some morbidity outcomes such as cardiovascular events and withdrawals due to adverse effects, when compared to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha-blockers.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients on the basis of postulated advantages for the reduction of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We included 42 studies, involving 65,733 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large studies at a low risk of bias for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, total cardiovascular (CV) events (consisted of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalizations), and ESRF. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90, ARR 1.2%), and moderate quality evidence that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, ARI 0.7%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence), total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence). The results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; moderate quality evidence), and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). Results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, we found low quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and low quality evidence that they decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Our analyses do not exclude potentially important differences between first-line RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; low quality evidence), HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; low quality evidence), and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; low quality evidence). Blood pressure comparisons between RAS inhibitors and other classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. In the protocol, we identified non-fatal serious adverse events (SAE) as a primary outcome. However, when we extracted the data from included studies, none of them reported total SAE in a manner that could be used in the review. Therefore, there is no information about SAE in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause mortality is similar when first-line RAS inhibitors are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line RAS inhibitors was low and the lower risk of total CV events and stroke seen with RAS inhibitors may change with the publication of additional trials. Compared with first-line CCBs, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced HF but increased stroke. The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes.

### Should a diuretic always be the first choice in patients with essential hypertension? The case for no [^116VJVx3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

A more extensive use of diuretics as first-line drug for the treatment of hypertensive patients has been recommended on the basis of the results of the recent Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial, yet diuretics have numerous drawbacks that may limit their undisputed ability to lower BP. These include the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with the attending negative cardiovascular effects that ensue from this activation and several metabolic alterations, namely those in glucose, lipid, and potassium metabolism. Numerous mechanistic as well as interventional trials indicate that these limitations of diuretics can adversely affect the clinical outcome of patients and their compliance to treatment and consequently the cost of therapy. In addition, there are a number of clinical conditions in which the diuretics are admittedly contraindicated as first-line drugs. Thus, the emphasis should be on obtaining optimal BP control rather on the drug used to achieve it.

### Calcium channel blockers versus other classes of drugs for hypertension [^117HF4AY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review published in 2010. While calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are often recommended as a first-line drug to treat hypertension, the effect of CCBs on the prevention of cardiovascular events, as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes, is still debated.

Objectives

To determine whether CCBs used as first-line therapy for hypertension are different from other classes of antihypertensive drugs in reducing the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events.

Search Methods

For this updated review, the Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to 1 September 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted the authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work and checked the references of published studies to identify additional trials. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing first-line CCBs with other antihypertensive classes, with at least 100 randomised hypertensive participants and a follow-up of at least two years.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias, and entered the data for analysis. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

This update contains five new trials. We included a total of 23 RCTs (18 dihydropyridines, 4 non-dihydropyridines, 1 not specified) with 153,849 participants with hypertension. All-cause mortality was not different between first-line CCBs and any other antihypertensive classes. As compared to diuretics, CCBs probably increased major cardiovascular events (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.09, P = 0.03) and increased congestive heart failure events (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.51, moderate-certainty evidence). As compared to beta-blockers, CCBs reduced the following outcomes: major cardiovascular events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.92), stroke (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.88, moderate-certainty evidence), and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99, low-certainty evidence). As compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, CCBs reduced stroke (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99, low-certainty evidence) and increased congestive heart failure (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.28, low-certainty evidence). As compared to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), CCBs reduced myocardial infarction (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94, moderate-certainty evidence) and increased congestive heart failure (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.36, low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

For the treatment of hypertension, there is moderate certainty evidence that diuretics reduce major cardiovascular events and congestive heart failure more than CCBs. There is low to moderate certainty evidence that CCBs probably reduce major cardiovascular events more than beta-blockers. There is low to moderate certainty evidence that CCBs reduced stroke when compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and reduced myocardial infarction when compared to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), but increased congestive heart failure when compared to ACE inhibitors and ARBs. Many of the differences found in the current review are not robust, and further trials might change the conclusions. More well-designed RCTs studying the mortality and morbidity of individuals taking CCBs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different comorbidities such as diabetes.

### First-line β-blocker use for hypertension in the veterans health administration [^114HskhJ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Guideline recommendations regarding β-blocker use for first-line treatment of high blood pressure (BP) have changed significantly over the past 3 decades. In the 1980s and 1990s, several placebo-controlled trials demonstrated their efficacy to prevent adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, leading to first-line endorsement alongside thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (hereafter, thiazides) in the Sixth and Seventh Reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC6 and JNC7, respectively). This changed in 2014 with the Eighth JNC Report (JNC8) recommending β-blockers as first-line only for patients with "compelling indications" supported by strong evidence of benefit. In the absence of such compelling indications, β-blockers were relegated to second-line therapy after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARB), thiazides, and calcium channel blockers (CCB). This shift was based on trials and meta-analyses suggesting inferior stroke and mortality as well as higher discontinuation rates from adverse effects. Similar recommendations appeared in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) BP guidelines and were reinforced in the 2024 AHA/American Stroke Association Guideline for the Primary Prevention of Stroke. In contrast, the 2018 and 2023 updates of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines supported first-line β-blocker use for uncomplicated hypertension, citing their efficacy compared with placebo in lowering BP and preventing CVD.

The quality of hypertension care for US veterans has been a major focus of the Veterans Health Administration (VA), the largest integrated health care system in the US. The Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in 2004, 2014, and 2020 conformed with the recommendations outlined in the JNC7, JNC8, and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. However, in our recent analyses, we identified that β-blockers are prescribed as first-line hypertension treatment in approximately 20% of veterans who do not have a compelling indication, although this trend decreased over the 20-year study. To improve evidence-based prescribing of β-blockers for treatment of high BP, we sought to investigate the clinical factors associated with β-blocker use in a cohort of veterans initiating treatment for high BP over 23 years.

### Fixed-drug combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension [^113HmGzx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

As combinations of drugs from different classes that have synergistic or additive effect and properties to cancel out each others' untoward hemodynamic and metabolic effects become more and more widely used, their use as first-line therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients is growing in popularity as well. The possibility to begin therapy with a fixed 2-drug combination may be preferable to starting with monotherapy followed by upward titration and addition of other agents. More and more combinations are coming out on the market and proving their effectiveness in randomized controlled trials and in large multicenter studies. One suggestion is the "polypill", a fixed combination of multiple agents that address various components of the metabolic syndrome and coexisting common risk factors in both high-risk patients with conditions requiring polypharmacy, and in healthy asymptomatic individuals.

### Are there meaningful differences in blood pressure control with current antihypertensive agents? [^111usRUX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and small reductions in blood pressure can have a substantial impact on outcome. Effective control of hypertension per se is important in reducing morbidity and mortality, but there is growing evidence that the class of drug used in treatment may affect patient outcomes. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial provided evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), agents that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), are particularly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in a wide range of patients. These beneficial effects of ACEI may be independent of antihypertensive effect. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are the newest class of antihypertensive drug to enter clinical use. By blocking the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, ARB achieve more complete blockade of the RAS than ACEI. The ARB also have a substantially better side effect profile than ACEI, and early evidence suggests that ARB are beneficial in combating hypertension-related target organ damage. These favorable characteristics suggest that ARB should be considered as first-line treatment for hypertension. Based on comparative antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan, a new ARB, may represent a significant addition to this drug class.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^117BqjS3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### Standardized treatment protocols for hypertension: global availability, characteristics, and alignment with the hypertension guideline recommendations [^112YM6UM]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension control is suboptimal globally. Implementing evidence-based, simple, standardized treatment protocols (STPs) has been instrumental in effectively and efficiently improving treatment and control of hypertension. We aimed to identify, characterize, and critically appraise hypertension STPs.

Methods

We defined STP as a series of steps for the pharmacological treatment of primary hypertension, with information on target population, BP threshold for treatment initiation, target BP, specific drugs/classes/doses, and follow-up frequency. STPs for adult patients were identified from the websites of relevant health organizations, Google search, and through expert consultations (until July 2023). STPs for secondary, gestational, or malignant hypertension or those that were templates/samples were excluded. Included STPs were critically appraised using HEARTS in the Americas Checklist for hypertension management in primary care and compared with the 2021 WHO hypertension management guideline recommendations.

Results

Fifty STPs were identified. All STPs had a stepwise treatment approach, involved guideline-recommended first-line drugs, and 98% consisted of at least four steps. Majority (54%) recommended monotherapy with calcium channel blockers as first-line treatment. Only 44% STPs recommended treatment initiation with combination therapy, and 16% recommended single-pill combinations. Most (62%) had dose-intensification as the second step. Most (74%) STPs did not provide complete dosing information. Only one STP mentioned a target time for achieving BP control. On average, STPs scored a performance of 68% on the HEARTS Checklist.

Conclusion

Several STPs are available globally; however, most of them have enormous scope for improvement through interventions aimed at alignment with the latest evidence-based guidelines and multistakeholder engagement.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^115vXdik]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are indispensable drugs in the treatment of hypertension, their role as first-line or even second-line drugs is a provoking debate.

The European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) guidelines recommend that thiazide diuretics should be considered as suitable as β-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment.

Another European position, endorsed by the British Hypertension Society, is that diuretics and calcium channel blockers should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients aged ≥ 55 years or black patients of any age, whereas ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers in the case of intolerance to ACE inhibitors) should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients younger than 55 years of age.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC VII) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that thiazide diuretics should be preferred drugs in "most" hypertensive patients, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes.

The present review does not intend to negate the important role of diuretics in certain groups of patients (blacks, salt-sensitive patients, concomitant heart failure) or to underestimate their role in multiple-drug combinations in patients with resistant hypertension. The main argument that will be discussed is the place of diuretics as first-line drugs or add-on drugs in the context of the available antihypertensive armamentarium.

The pro side of the controversy will argue that diuretics should remain the preferred drugs for initial treatment in many hypertensive patients, whereas the cons side will contend that emerging evidence from outcome-based studies is casting doubt on the role of these drugs as first-line and even second-line antihypertensive treatment.

EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF HYPERTENSION GUIDELINES

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' Committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the XX century, updated versions of the guidelines document have been prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies. The first guideline document prepared by European Societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH together with the European Society of Cardiology jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013 and 2018, the latter being as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in the worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering to the readers elements of novelties. These include, for example, the thresholds and targets of the blood pressure-lowering intervention, the relevance of out-of-office blood pressure measurements, the modern quantification of cardiovascular risk, the greater use of organ damage measures, the upgrading of beta-blocking drugs to the level of major antihypertensive agents and the wider choice of drug combination between major drugs, with confirmation of their strategic role as first-line and subsequent treatment in the majority of patients. Finally, emphasis has been given to the treatment strategies based on renal denervation, particularly but not exclusively in drug-resistant hypertension, and to the patient's follow-up modalities, including the careful assessment of nonadherence as a fundamental barrier to the long-term blood pressure control.

Finally, given the importance of primary care providers in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the hypertensive state, ESH has decided to provide a novel concise format of the guidelines, the so called '2024 Clinical Practice Guidelines', for implementation into current clinical practice. The four pillars of these practice guidelines include the accurate diagnostic approach, the assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk profile, the careful selection of the treatment strategy and the long-term evaluation of the blood pressure response.

### Comparative analysis of first-line antihypertensive treatment classes [^1122MqMj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The best first-line monotherapy for hypertension remains uncertain, as current guidelines suggest that thiazides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are appropriate in the absence of specific comorbidities. We aimed to compare the outcomes of first-line antihypertensive classes in a real-life setting with a long follow-up period.

Methods

This nationwide retrospective new-user cohort study included patients insured by the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. We included patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension between 2008 and 2021 who initiated treatment with a single first-line drug for hypertension. Outcomes were assessed with and without propensity score matching for confounding factors. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, or heart failure (HF).

Results

A total of 97,639 patients initiated antihypertensive treatment with a single drug as first-line therapy. The most commonly prescribed class was ACEis/ARBs (66,717, 68.3%), followed by CCBs (15,922, 16.3%), beta-blockers (BBs, 12,869, 13.2%), and thiazides (2,131, 2.2%). For the primary outcome, the hazard ratios (HRs) for BBs, CCBs, and ACEis/ARBs were 1.44 (95% CI 1.25–1.66), 1.10 (95% CI 0.96–1.27), and 1.13 (95% CI 0.99–1.29), respectively, when compared to thiazides.

Conclusion

When initiating pharmacotherapy for hypertension with a single drug, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers were associated with similar risk of MI, ACS, stroke, or HF when compared to thiazides, while beta-blockers were associated with increased risk.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^111ZK52c]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects more than one in four adults globally and is a major modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Internationally, guideline based approaches to pharmacotherapy for hypertension have been adopted to simplify clinical practice and improve blood pressure control. Although some evidence suggests that the effectiveness of drug treatment for hypertension does not differ across the general population, guideline recommendations hinge on the understanding that the effect of these drugs differs among specific subpopulations.

In the United Kingdom (UK), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) as first line treatment for hypertension in people younger than 55, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for people without diabetes aged 55 and older, replacing CCB with thiazides for those with drug intolerance. The presence of an age based recommendation is unique among major international guidelines for hypertension treatment, and is based on differences in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system with age. Since this threshold was introduced in the first iteration of NICE hypertension guidance in 2004, the evidence base for hypertension treatment in older age, including the use and safety of ACEI/ARB drugs in older populations has evolved.

Furthermore, in NICE guidelines, use of CCB or thiazides is recommended as first line treatment for black people of African or Caribbean ethnic origin (referred to in this article as black people to reflect diversity). The same drugs are recommended, after consideration of comorbidities, in international guidelines. The pathophysiology of hypertension in this population has been thought to differ importantly from people of white heritage; lower levels of renin result in a reduced response to hypertension drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system such as ACEI/ARB. However, treatment recommendations based on historical categorisations of ethnicity have recently been criticised, because ethnicity can be considered a social construct rather than a biological one, and the proportion of people with mixed ethnic heritage has increased.

Contemporary routine care is characterised by an increasingly older, more ethnically diverse and multi-morbid population. For people initiating hypertension drugs, it is not known whether current age and ethnicity based treatment recommendations translate to greater blood pressure reductions in these settings.

Comparison with the literature and other studies

NICE guidelines recommend ACEI/ARB as the first line treatment for hypertension for those younger than 55. This age threshold, currently absent in international guidelines, is based on the idea that hypertension in younger people is more commonly characterised by high renin levels. The age cut-off point in NICE guidelines is supported by studies limited by small sample size (< 60 people)and short follow-up periods (< 6 weeks), restricted to menand geographical location, and including unpublished data. To support drug recommendations in those aged 55 years and older, three trials are cited in the NICE guidance although none show clear effect modification by age (usually categorised as age < 60/ > 60 or < 65/ > 65) for any included clinical outcome. Our age stratified results are in line with a meta-analysis of 31 trials including more than 190 000 patients, which showed no difference in blood pressure reduction or cardiovascular events for any hypertension drug class between patients aged younger or older than 65. Our result of no difference in effectiveness between CCB and ACEI/ARB in new users aged 55 and older also accords with the results of a randomised study that examined effectiveness of first line treatment for lowering blood pressure between people aged younger than 55 and those aged 55 and older.

Since first including 55 years as the age threshold in NICE guidance (CG18) in 2004, the literature has evolved to capture older populations with subgroup analyses based on older ages (comparison threshold at age 75) or subgroups defined by frailty. In our subgroup analyses, greater reductions in blood pressure were found for CCB versus ACEI/ARB use only in those aged 75 and older. This finding could reflect an increased prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension in this subgroup (57% for age ≥ 75 v 40% for age ≥ 55 in our data), for which CCB might be more effective. Although our results suggested no clear benefit in blood pressure reductions for CCB compared with ACEI/ARB in people aged 55 and older, the range of side effects might be as important as drug effectiveness in considering which hypertension drug class to prescribe. This decision is particularly important in older patients whose higher prevalence of comorbidities such as advanced chronic kidney disease could favour the use of CCB.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^115xcWg5]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the largest single contributor to the global burden of disease, affecting an estimated 1.39 billion people worldwide. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can aid in the effective management of this common condition, however, inconsistencies exist between CPGs, and the extent of this is unknown. Understanding the differences in CPG recommendations across income settings may provide an important means of understanding some of the global variations in clinical outcomes related to hypertension.

Aims

This study aims to analyse the variation between hypertension CPGs globally. It aims to assess the variation in three areas: diagnostic threshold and staging, treatment and target blood pressure (BP) recommendations in hypertension.

Methods

A search was conducted on the MEDLINE repository to identify national and international hypertension CPGs from 2010 to May 2020. An additional country-specific grey-literature search was conducted for all countries and territories of the world as identified by the World Bank. Data describing the diagnosis, staging, treatment and target blood pressure were extracted from CPGs, and variations between CPGs for these domains were analysed.

Results

Forty-eight CPGs from across all World Bank income settings were selected for analysis. Ninety-six per cent of guidelines defined hypertension as a clinic-based BP of ≥ 140/90mmHg, and 87% of guidelines recommended a target BP of < 140/90mmHg. In the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, eight different first-step, 17 different second-step and six different third-step drug recommendations were observed. Low-income countries preferentially recommended diuretics (63%) in the first-step treatment, whilst high-income countries offered more choice between antihypertensive classes. Forty-four per cent of guidelines, of which 71% were from higher-income contexts recommended initiating treatment with dual-drug therapy at BP 160/100mmHg or higher.

Conclusion

This study found that CPGs remained largely consistent in the definition, staging and target BP recommendations for hypertension. Extensive variation was observed in treatment recommendations, particularly for second-line therapy. Variation existed between income settings; low-income countries prescribed cheaper drugs, offered less clinician choice in medications and initiated dual therapy at later stages than higher-income countries. Future research exploring the underlying drivers of this variation may improve outcomes for hypertensive patients across clinical contexts.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pharmacotherapy in advanced disease — Non-responders to acute vasoreactivity testing, or responders who remain in (or progress to) WHO-FC III should be considered candidates for treatment with either an ERA or a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, or a prostanoid. As head-to-head comparisons among different compounds are not available, no evidence-based first-line treatment can be proposed, and some experts still use first-line i.v. epoprostenol in WHO-FC III patients because of its survival benefits. For WHO-FC IV, continuous i.v. epoprostenol is recommended as first-line therapy; although ambrisentan, bosentan, and sildenafil are approved in WHO-FC IV patients in the United States, most experts consider these treatments as a second line in severely ill patients. In WHO-FC IV patients, initial combination therapy should also be considered. In the case of inadequate clinical response, sequential combination therapy should be considered; combinations can include either an ERA plus a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, or a prostanoid plus an ERA, or a prostanoid plus a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, and in expert centres triple combination therapy is considered. For inadequate responders despite optimal therapy or where treatments are unavailable, BAS and/or lung transplantation are indicated and should be performed only in experienced centres.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^114ramc6]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Role in combination therapy for HTN

While thus far amlodipine has shown to be non-inferior to many other anti-HTN therapies, the focus on HTN treatment seems to be shifting more towards combination therapy. Less than 50% of patients with stage I or II HTN are adequately controlled with monotherapy, and thus initial treatment for HTN in the majority of patients will require two agents. The classical approach to treating HTN where one first-line agent is maximised before another is added may be flawed since this is a multifactorial disease often occurring with a number of comorbidities. Many studies show that individuals with more CV risk factors generally need more anti-HTN agents to successfully manage their BP. Combination therapy using different mechanisms can lead to more effective BP lowering. In addition, combination therapies block counter-regulatory mechanisms that often limit the efficacy of monotherapy. Furthermore, using multiple agents to lower doses may reduce side effects, and thus improve patient compliance.

The issue arises as to which fixed combinations provide the most benefits. Thiazides in combination with ACEIs or ARBs have synergistic BP-lowering activity, whereas thiazides and BBs have deleterious effects on the metabolic profile. CCBs are powerful vasodilators but can result in renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, thus an ACEI or ARB counteracts this mechanism and leads to enhanced antihypertensive effect. Growing evidence from trial data also shows that CCBs with ACEIs or ARBs may provide the best long-term outcomes.

The ACCOMPLISH trial was a randomised, controlled trial in which 11 506 patients with HTN with high risk for adverse CV events were assigned amlodipine+benazepril versus HCTZ+benazepril. The primary end point was the composite of CV death or major adverse CV events. The amlodipine+benazepril combination was superior to the HCTZ+benazepril for lowering CV death and adverse events (figure 1).

Introduction

Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease with a major associated risk for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with hypertension require more than one antihypertensive agent to achieve and maintain guideline-recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. Identifying the most appropriate combination therapy for each patient based on individual risk factors and comorbidities is important for risk management. Increasingly, single-pill combinations (SPCs) containing two or more antihypertensive agents with complementary mechanisms of action are available. These offer potential advantages, including simplification of treatment regimens, more convenient drug administration and reduced healthcare costs. Evidence from meta-analyses has shown that the use of antihypertensive SPCs compared with corresponding free-drug combinations is associated with significantly greater rates of treatment adherence to medication and potential advantages in terms of BP improvements and adverse effects. A large retrospective database study of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB) in two-drug SPCs has also shown greater levels of adherence compared with the corresponding free-pill ARB/CCB regimens. Treatment adherence is an important issue for a chronic disease such as hypertension, with improvements in adherence expected to result in better long-term clinical outcomes, including reduced CV and renal morbidity/mortality. This review will consider the choice of agents for combination therapy using two-drug SPCs and the rationale for using particular combinations in patients with hypertension and renal impairment.

Why should early combination therapy be considered?

Worldwide guidelines recommend combination therapy as a first-line treatment option for hypertension likely not to be controlled on monotherapy (e.g. 20/10 mmHg above target BP) because of evidence showing that only a minority of patients will achieve and maintain BP goals on monotherapy. The recent re-appraisal of the European guidelines also recommended the preferential use of SPCs to improve adherence.

There are a number of compelling reasons why early combination therapy should be used in patients with hypertension (Table 1), including lack of efficacy with monotherapy, greater BP control and attenuation of side effects associated with monotherapeutic treatment. In addition, hypertensive patients with comorbidities, such as renal disease, might benefit from additional effects of multiple antihypertensive agents, beyond those related to BP lowering.

### Two-drug combinations as first-step antihypertensive treatment [^112eUZf7]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) control in patients with hypertension is variable worldwide, and in general, it results largely unsatisfactory. Factors responsible for this phenomenon include insufficient national cardiovascular healthcare policies for prevention, poor patient compliance with prescribed treatment schedules, and the reluctance of physicians to modify treatment strategies when BP is still elevated, that is, the so-called therapeutic inertia. A further important factor favoring poor BP control is the limited use of combination drug treatment, despite evidence of its superior ability to control BP in patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension. In addition, combination treatment allows to achieve BP control more easily (and more quickly) as compared with monotherapy. This article, after briefly examining the main features of BP control, will review the importance in the treatment of hypertension of the drug combination strategy, based on the recommendations of the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines. Empahsis will be given to the drug combination treatment as first step of the antihypertensive therapeutic intervention. The potential drawbacks and barriers to combination drug treatment as initial therapeutic strategy will also be briefly discussed.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to prioritize BP lowering over the selection of specific antihypertensive drug classes because treatment benefit largely originates from BP reduction.

### Single pill combination therapy for hypertension: new evidence and new challenges: combination therapy for hypertension [^116DkB2F]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) continues to be one of the most important risk factors for major cardiovascular events and mortality. The global prevalence of hypertension is approximately 30% among adults over 20 years old. Cardiovascular risk stratification is crucial to determine the most appropriate pharmacological therapeutic strategy for hypertensive patients. Despite the many scales to stratify risk, none is perfect and represents weighted mathematical models to determine risk at 10 years. Reports have identified numerous limitations, and the challenge persists. A practical way to determine CV risk is the clinical approach based on 1) the number of risk factors, 2) the degree of elevation of blood pressure, 3) the presence of target organ damage/DM/CKD, and 4) a history of major cardiovascular events. Currently, it is recommended to start with dual therapy in a single pill (either ACE inhibitors or ARB2 + dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic); however, many patients could need to start with triple therapy (low or standard doses) if they belong to the high- or very high-risk group with elevation grade 2 or 3 of blood pressure. This article discusses this topic and establishes some practical recommendations for the physician of first contact.

### Cost-effectiveness analyses of antihypertensive medicines: a systematic review [^115jzTRA]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adultsrecommends several possible medicine classes for initial treatment of hypertension. TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes are recommended as the initial choice of antihypertensive medicines for non–African-American patients and for patients with diabetes. For African-American patients TDs and CCBs are recommended, and for patients with chronic kidney disease, ACEIs and ARBs are recommended. Prescribers may consider adding another medicine from TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes for the second step, and then β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, or others for the third step. Similarly, several medicine classes are recommended for first-line therapy in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline for hypertension. The recommended initial treatment option is ACEIs or low-cost ARBs for patients aged < 55 years, CCBs for those aged ≥ 55 years or African American, and TD if CCBs are not suitable; β-blockers are not a preferred initial therapy. The second-line therapy is dual therapy of ACEs or ARBs with a CCB for most patients. The third-line therapy is the use of three medicines, including ACE or ARB with a CCB, and a TD, if required. Because several pharmacologic treatment options can be used for the first-line therapy, it is important to evaluate which medicines are more cost effective among those options.

The evidence from pharmacoeconomic evaluations can provide valuable information for decision makers in setting public health priorities. Many pharmacoeconomic studies of antihypertensive medicines conducted in recent years have found control of hypertension to be cost effective. Several systematic reviews of these studies also have been published, but their focus has been on a specific medicine, such as irbesartan, or medicine class, such as ACEIs or ARBs. Thus, no comprehensive review has been conducted for studies across all anti-hypertensive medicine classes. The objectives are to systematically review all pharmacoeconomic evaluations of antihypertensive medicines and summarize the cost effectiveness of these medicines.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^1165rPnZ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA and ESH guidelines recommend initial treatment with antihypertensive agents from at least 1 of 4 major classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. The ESH guideline continues to recommend beta-blockers as an optional first-line therapy for several CV and many non-CV conditions, including atrial fibrillation, aortic dissection, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while the American guideline only recommends them for patients with ischemic heart disease or heart failure. The ESH guideline points to several randomized control trials and meta-analyses that show beta-blockers significantly reduce major CVD events when compared to placebo.

Initiation of combination therapy with medications from different classes is also prominent in both guidelines. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends an initial two-drug regimen for patients with "stage 2 hypertension" and BP > 20/10 mm Hg above target, and for Black patients (COR I, LOE: C-EO), while ESH recommends initial therapy with a two-drug combination regimen for most patients with hypertension (COR I, LOE: A). ESH strongly advocates for single-pill combination therapy to improve medication adherence and achieve BP control, while the U.S. guideline recommends either single-pill combination or multi-pill combinations.

Harmonized antihypertensive drugs

In 2022, Whelton et al.published the Harmonization of the Hypertension guidelines for multiple societies across the world. In this document, four major drug classes were recommended as first-line therapies. These include AT 1 receptor antagonists/blockers; angiotensin converting enzyme or ACE inhibitors; thiazide diuretics; and calcium channel antagonists. Of these four major classes, only the AT 1 receptor is a GPCR. We discuss the primary actions of some of these drugs and the potential "new" pharmacological action of these first-line drugs. This is followed by a discussion of second-line drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, many of which target GPCRs. We consulted the publications of leaders in the field in including the drug classes included below. We also consulted the FDA database (June 2023 accession dates;) for lists of drugs in each class that are approved for use in the treatment of hypertension. We do not consider drugs that have been combined in a medication.

For first-line therapy, we will not discuss ACE inhibitors or diuretics given that the targets of these drugs and proteins are outside the four recognized receptor subtypes. Nonetheless, Table 1 includes a fairly comprehensive list of first and second-line drugs, with both generic and Trade names.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — first-line drug classes and comparative evidence are as follows: For adults initiating therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Strong randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports 4 classes of first-line agents compared with placebo, and a meta-analysis of 50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals revealed subtle differences between first-line agents. βBs were less effective than first-line classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications. The primary goal of treatment should be to reduce blood pressure (BP) to the target level, considering the underlying CVD risk and compelling indications. In a large pragmatic RCT comparing hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg to chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, switching from HCTZ to chlorthalidone did not lower the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

### Analysis of antihypertensive treatment using real-world Japanese data-the retrospective study of antihypertensives for lowering blood pressure (REAL) study [^111Z5TnN]. Hypertension Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sustained high blood pressure causes the development, progression, and recurrence of various cardiovascular diseases. High blood pressure also leads to a decrease in quality of life and an increase in the risk of death. Antihypertensive treatments are administered to reduce such risks. Lifestyle modification is advised as a primary treatment. However, when the target blood pressure cannot be achieved by these modifications, antihypertensive drug therapy is required.

The Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) has published Guidelines for management of hypertension. The recommendation of first-choice antihypertensive drugs in these guidelines has changed over time. Diuretics were often used as a concomitant medicine in the JSH guidelines in 2004 but were suggested as a first-choice drug together with other antihypertensive drug classes in the 2009 JSH guidelines. β-blockers were recommended as one of the classes for first-line treatment in the 2009 JSH guidelines but were excluded from the first-line treatments in the 2014 JSH guidelines.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — stage-based recommendations are: In adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with 2 first-line agents of different classes, ideally in a single-pill combination (SPC), is recommended (1 B-R). In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dosage titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control (2a C-EO). In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm (3: Harm A). Pharmacologically, most patients require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP control.

### Perindopril 3.5 mg / amlodipine 2.5 mg versus renin-angiotensin system inhibitor monotherapy as first-line treatment in hypertension: a combined analysis [^116pNrD6]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients are diagnosed with hypertension each year, making rapid and effective control of blood pressure (BP) crucial. Appropriate first-line treatment is important, and special attention should be paid to the positive effects of lowering BP early. Perindopril 3.5 mg/amlodipine 2.5mg (P3.5/A2.5) is a single-pill combination suitable for first-line use. The doses of each component of the single-pill combination were selected for a first-line setting.

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness of the P3.5/A2.5 combination at lowering BP compared with renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-inhibitor monotherapies, after 1 month of treatment.

Methods

Individual patient data from three randomized controlled trials were used to evaluate the efficacy of P3.5/A2.5 versus RAS-inhibitor monotherapies after 1 month in 5496 patients with hypertension, in a combined analysis.

Results

P3.5/A2.5 was well tolerated and significantly more effective at reducing BP after 1 month than RAS-inhibitor monotherapies (perindopril 5mg, irbesartan 150mg or valsartan 80mg). P3.5/A2.5 was associated with a significantly lower SBP (P = 0.002) and DBP (P = 0.005) after 1 month of treatment compared with RAS-inhibitor monotherapies.

Conclusion

In a large patient population, early administration of P3.5/A2.5 resulted in a significantly greater BP-lowering effect than perindopril, irbesartan or valsartan monotherapies after 1 month. Reducing BP levels within a month of treatment may reasonably be expected to lead to a reduced risk of cardiovascular events.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

### Persistence and adherence to antihypertensive treatment in relation to initial prescription: diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs [^114tfP2G]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The use of thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension is widely considered as a first-line treatment, given the efficacy and low cost of this class of drugs. This indication is not unanimous, because thiazides can cause metabolic alterations, and other side effects that reduce compliance and persistence on treatment.

Objectives

In a multicentre, open-label randomized study we compared adherence and persistence to therapy of chlortalidone versus other treatments, as a first-line antihypertensive therapy.

Methods

Ninety-two general practitioners (GPs) recruited 2409 hypertensive patients with indication to antihypertensive therapy, who were randomized in two arms to start treatment with chlortalidone (12.5–25mg daily) or any other single medications (excluding thiazides). The patients have been followed for at least 2 years.

Result

Patients receiving diuretic therapy as first-line antihypertensive treatment, modified antihypertensive treatment regimen more often than the others (79.1 versus 43.9%; χ² < 0.0001). Patients starting with diuretics received greater number of drugs, compared to patients starting with different antihypertensive therapy (1.55 versus 1.4 antihypertensive drugs; P < 0.0001), but achieved the same blood pressure (BP) control during the follow-up. No differences were observed in persistence and adherence to treatment between the two groups.

Conclusion

Our results demonstrate that the recommendation to start antihypertensive therapy with diuretics, when no compelling indications are present, is not supported by the evidence that this strategy produces more rapid and better control of BP.

### Individualized beta-blocker treatment for high blood pressure dictated by medical comorbidities: indications beyond the 2018 European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension guidelines [^116aczgM]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Several hypertension guidelines have removed beta-blockers from their previous position as first-choice drugs for the treatment of hypertension. However, this downgrading may not be justified by available evidence because beta-blockers lower blood pressure as effectively as other major antihypertensive drugs and have solid documentation in preventing cardiovascular complications. Suspected inconveniences of beta-blockers such as increased risk of depression or erectile dysfunction may have been overemphasized, while patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or peripheral artery disease, that is, conditions in which their use was previously restricted, will benefit from beta-blocker therapy. Besides, evidence that from early to late phases, hypertension is accompanied by activation of the sympathetic nervous system makes beta-blockers pathophysiologically an appropriate treatment in hypertension. Beta-blockers have favorable effects on a variety of clinical conditions that may coexist with hypertension, making their use either as specific treatment or as co-treatment potentially common in clinical practice. Guidelines typically limit recommendations on specific beta-blocker use to cardiac conditions including angina pectoris, postmyocardial infarction, or heart failure, with little or no mention of the additional cardiovascular or noncardiovascular conditions in which these drugs may be needed or preferred. In the present narrative review, we focus on multiple additional diseases and conditions that may occur and affect patients with hypertension, often more frequently than people without hypertension, and that may favor the choice of beta-blocker. Notwithstanding, beta-blockers represent an in-homogenous group of drugs and choosing beta-blockers with documented effect in prevention and treatment of disease is important for first choice in guidelines.

Change in systolic blood pressure for CCB versus ACEI/ARB use by age

In people younger than 55, systolic blood pressure changed from 162.8 mm Hg to 140.7 mm Hg at 12 weeks in new users of CCB, compared with a change from 162.7 mm Hg to 142.2 mm Hg in new users of ACEI/ARB. In relative terms, for people younger than 55, CCB use was associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 1.69 mm Hg (99% confidence interval −2.52 to −0.86) more than ACEI/ARB use (table 2). In those aged 55 and older, systolic blood pressure changed from 163.8 mm Hg to 143.2 mm Hg at 12 weeks in new users of CCB, compared with a change from 164.6 mm Hg to 144.6 mm Hg in new users of ACEI/ARB (fig 2; table 2; relative difference −0.40 mm Hg (−0.98 to 0.18) in favour of CCB). Over one year's follow-up, no difference was observed for reductions in systolic blood pressure associated with CCB and ACEI/ARB use in either age group (table 2 and fig 2).

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^115eWtok]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mm Hg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### Cardiovascular protection using β-blockers: a critical review of the evidence [^1112Eq5E]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

For more than 3 decades, beta-blockers have been widely used in the treatment of hypertension and are still recommended as first-line agents by national and international guidelines. Recent meta-analyses indicate that, in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, compared with other antihypertensive agents, first-line therapy with beta-blockers was associated with an increased risk of stroke, especially in the elderly cohort with no benefit for the end points of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality. In this review, we critically analyze the evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers in patients with hypertension and evaluate evidence for its role in other indications. The review of the currently available literature shows that in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, there is a paucity of data or absence of evidence to support use of beta-blockers as monotherapy or as first-line agents. Given the increased risk of stroke, their "pseudo-antihypertensive" efficacy (failure to lower central aortic pressure), lack of effect on regression of target end organ effects like left ventricular hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction, and numerous adverse effects, the risk benefit ratio for beta-blockers is not acceptable for this indication. However, beta-blockers remain very efficacious agents for the treatment of heart failure, certain types of arrhythmia, hypertropic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and in patients with prior myocardial infarction.

Differences in effects of drugs used in hypertension

Antihypertensive drug treatment is equally beneficial in men and women and the effects of the main classes of drugs used in hypertension are the same in both sexes when comparing the risk of outcomes such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. However, early trials included few women and in general, women have been underrepresented in clinical trials in hypertension. Women are, however, overall more likely to experience adverse effects of drugs and the drugs used in hypertension are no exception. There are also other clinical variables of relevance that may influence drug class choice. The following paragraphs elaborate on potential extracardiac treatment synergies and the differences in adverse effects between men and women for the main classes of drugs used in hypertension, which are summarized in Table 1.

Overview of treatment synergies and differences in adverse effects.

ACEi angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ARB angiotensin-receptor blocker, CCB calcium-channel blocker, HFrEF heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, MRA mineral-receptor antagonist, MTF male-to-female.

First-line drugs

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are recommended as first-line treatment of hypertension. ACEi are a suitable choice in both uncomplicated hypertension and in the context of coexisting coronary heart disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria. Men and women differ in regard to their risk of adverse effects, where ACEi treatment-induced cough is more than twice as likely to afflict women.

ARB are equally well tolerated in men and women, exhibiting an adverse effect rate comparable to placebo. They share indications with the ACEi, although they are now a second-line treatment in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Of note, both ACEi and ARB are strictly contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of fetal abnormalities. Like beta blockers (see below), ARB are also effective in preventing episodic migraine, which is more than twice as common in women.

### Prescription patterns for the use of antihypertensive drugs for primary prevention among patients with hypertension in the United Kingdom [^114cBUZi]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Several antihypertensive drugs are available for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, existing evidence on prescription patterns was primarily generated among patients at high CVD risk with short-term follow-up, and failed to capture impacts of time and patient characteristics. Our objective was therefore to describe longitudinal prescription patterns for antihypertensive drugs for the primary prevention of CVD among patients with arterial hypertension in the United Kingdom.

Methods

This population-based cohort study used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, included 660,545 patients with hypertension who initiated an antihypertensive drug between 1998 and 2018. Antihypertensive treatments were measured by drug class and described overall and in subgroups, focusing on first-line therapy (first antihypertensive drug(s) recorded after a diagnosis of hypertension) and second-line therapy (antihypertensive drug(s) prescribed as part of a treatment change following first-line therapy).

Results

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (29.0%), thiazide diuretics (22.1%), and calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) (21.0%) were the most prescribed first-line therapies. ACE inhibitors have been increasingly prescribed as first-line therapy since 2001. Men were more likely to be prescribed ACE inhibitors than women (43.5% vs. 32.1%; difference: 11.4%; 95% confidence interval, 11.0%-11.8%), and Black patients were more likely to be prescribed CCBs than White patients (63.6% vs. 37.0%; difference: 26.6%; 95% CI, 24.8%-28.4%).

Conclusions

Antihypertensive prescription patterns for the primary prevention of CVD among patients with hypertension are consistent with treatment guidelines that were in place during the study period, providing reassurance regarding the use of evidence-based prescribing.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116y1erM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes: hypertension treatment thresholds and agents — In adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at an SBP of ≥ 130 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 130 mm Hg, with encouragement to achieve an SBP < 120 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality; in adults with T2D and hypertension, antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated at a DBP of ≥ 80 mm Hg with a treatment goal of < 80 mm Hg to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality; in adults with T2D and hypertension, all first-line classes of antihypertensive agents (thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting CCB, ACEI, and ARB) are useful and effective for BP lowering; and in adults with diabetes and hypertension, ACEI or ARB are recommended in the presence of CKD as identified by eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or albuminuria ≥ 300 mg/g and should be considered when mild albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g) is present to delay progression of diabetes-related kidney disease.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^115hCmFc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To study whether treatment recommendations based on age and ethnicity according to United Kingdom (UK) clinical guidelines for hypertension translate to blood pressure reductions in current routine clinical care.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

UK primary care, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2017.

Participants

New users of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCB), and thiazides.

Main Outcome Measures

Change in systolic blood pressure in new users of ACEI/ARB versus CCB, stratified by age (< v ≥ 55) and ethnicity (black v non-black), from baseline to 12, 26, and 52 week follow-up. Secondary analyses included comparisons of new users of CCB with those of thiazides. A negative outcome (herpes zoster) was used to detect residual confounding and a series of positive outcomes (expected drug effects) was used to determine whether the study design could identify expected associations.

Results

During one year of follow-up, 87440 new users of ACEI/ARB, 67274 new users of CCB, and 22040 new users of thiazides were included (median 4 (interquartile range 2–6) blood pressure measurements per user). For non-black people who did not have diabetes and who were younger than 55, CCB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure of 1.69 mm Hg (99% confidence interval -2.52 to -0.86) relative to ACEI/ARB use at 12 weeks, and a reduction of 0.40 mm Hg (-0.98 to 0.18) in those aged 55 and older. In subgroup analyses using six finer age categories of non-black people who did not have diabetes, CCB use versus ACEI/ARB use was associated with a larger reduction in systolic blood pressure only in people aged 75 and older. Among people who did not have diabetes, systolic blood pressure decreased more with CCB use than with ACEI/ARB use in black people (reduction difference 2.15 mm Hg (-6.17 to 1.87)); the corresponding reduction difference was 0.98 mm Hg (-1.49 to -0.47) in non-black people.

Conclusions

Similar reductions in blood pressure were found to be associated with new use of CCB as with new use of ACEI/ARB in non-black people who did not have diabetes, both in those who were aged younger than 55 and those aged 55 and older. For black people without diabetes, CCB new use was associated with numerically greater reductions in blood pressure than ACEI/ARB compared with non-black people without diabetes, but the confidence intervals were overlapping for the two groups. These results suggest that the current UK algorithmic approach to first line antihypertensive treatment might not lead to greater reductions in blood pressure. Specific indications could be considered in treatment recommendations.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^112FXV7A]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

The benefits of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy accrue rapidly in primary care and clinical trials. When better blood pressure (BP, mm Hg) control is achieved during the first 3 to 6 months of treatment, fewer cardiovascular events occur during this time interval. – Standard hypertension control metrics typically exclude patients during the first 6 months following diagnosis, after which time they are included. Thus, for both clinical outcomes and care quality metrics, controlling hypertension within the first 6 months after diagnosis is important.

Prompt initiation of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy is a key to realizing the time-sensitive benefits of BP reduction. Antihypertensive monotherapy is the norm for treatment initiation in clinical practice, despite evidence that monotherapy is insufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Furthermore, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association high BP guideline recommends treatment initiation with 2 different antihypertensive medications when BP is ≥ 20/ ≥ 10 mm Hg above target. Previous research indicates that not only are most adults with hypertension initiated on antihypertensive monotherapy, but also that most of them remain on monotherapy at 3 years. Moreover, half of adults with uncontrolled hypertension were on monotherapy after 8 years.

Given the evidence, our study was designed to determine if initiating treatment with antihypertensive monotherapy (TI) during the first month after the diagnosis of hypertension that was uncontrolled led to more prompt and better BP control over time than when TI did not occur in the first month. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with the decision to initiate treatment during the first month following diagnosis of hypertension than later time points.

### Comparative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors versus β-blockers as second-line therapy for hypertension [^112k6mrn]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Trials comparing hypertension monotherapies have found either no difference or modest differences in blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular events. However, no trial has assessed the comparative effectiveness of 2nd-line therapy in patients whose BP was not controlled with a thiazide diuretic.

Methods and Results

This was an observational study conducted with a hypertension registry of adults enrolled in 3 large integrated health care delivery systems from 2002 to 2007. Patients newly started on thiazide monotherapy whose BP remained uncontrolled were observed after addition of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or β-blocker for subsequent BP control and cardiovascular events. Patients for whom either add-on drug was indicated or contraindicated were excluded. After adjustment for patient characteristics and study year, BP control during the subsequent 6 to 18 months was comparable for the 2 agents (70.5% ACE, 69.0% β-blockers; P = 0.09). Rates of incident myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.58) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.52) were also similar for the ACE inhibitor and β-blocker groups during an average of 2.3 years of follow-up. There were also no differences in heart failure or renal function.

Conclusions

ACE inhibitors and β-blockers are equally effective in lowering BP and preventing cardiovascular events for patients whose BP is not controlled with a thiazide diuretic alone and who have no compelling indication for a specific 2nd-line agent.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117RsYLN]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Drug treatment algorithm for hypertension — the guideline recommends the following simple treatment algorithm based on six key recommendations: (1) The initiation of treatment in most patients with an SPC comprising two drugs, to improve the speed, efficiency, and predictability of BP control. (2) Preferred two-drug combinations are a RAS blocker with a CCB or a diuretic, with a beta-blocker alternative when there is a specific indication (e.g. angina, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure, or heart rate control). (3) Use monotherapy for low-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension where systolic blood pressure (SBP) is < 150 mmHg, very high-risk patients with high–normal BP, or frail older patients. (4) The use of a three-drug single-pill combination (SPC) comprising a RAS blocker, a CCB, and a diuretic if BP is not controlled by a two-drug SPC. (5) The addition of spironolactone for the treatment of resistant hypertension, unless contraindicated (see section 8.1.4). (6) The use of other classes of antihypertensive drugs in the rare circumstances in which BP is not controlled by the above treatments. The document further notes this treatment algorithm focuses on ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), CCBs, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and beta-blockers, and that initial therapy for most patients is a two drug-combination, ideally as an SPC.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^113yYxy4]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data

We conducted a cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD-GOLD) linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics. CPRD-GOLD is a nationally representative repository of prospectively collected, anonymised electronic health records from primary care in the UK, which has been extensively validated. It holds data on demographic information, health related behaviours, test results including blood pressure measurements, diagnoses, and prescriptions for more than 11 million people. The Hospital Episodes Statistics database records all hospital admissions for patients covered by the UK's health service who receive treatment from either English NHS trusts or independent providers. Almost 60% of general practices included in CPRD-GOLD are linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics. We used linked data in this study to improve completeness of ethnicity recording.

Cohort entry

We identified new users of hypertension drugs (CCB, ACEI/ARB, and thiazides), defined as people who had a prescription for one of these drugs in the study period (1 January 2007 to 31 December 2017), with no previous use of these drugs in the preceding year. People entered the cohort (index date) on the date of the first prescription. People were eligible for inclusion from the latest of the following: study start date (1 January 2007), one year after general practice registration (to allow time for recording of covariates in the general practice record), the date when the general practices' data recording processes were considered of adequate standard to be included in CPRD-GOLD, or the person's 18th birthday. People remained in the cohort until the earliest of the following: end of the study period (31 December 2017), last data collection from the general practice, date of leaving the general practice, or death.

Exclusion

We sought to study the association between first line drug treatment for hypertension and blood pressure solely in those individuals treated for hypertension. Therefore, we excluded people who initiated any of the study drugs without recorded blood pressure measurements in the year before cohort entry, and those whose blood pressure was at target or lower (< 140/90 mm Hg, according to current NICE guidelines). We also excluded people who initiated more than one hypertension drug on the index date, as well as those with diabetes at baseline (because current NICE guidance recommends ACEI/ARB as first line hypertension treatment for all people with diabetes). Additionally, because ethnicity was a stratifying factor, we excluded people whose ethnicity was not determinable even after data linkage.

### First-line treatment for hypertension… [^114uHcvd]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 53-year-old, otherwise healthy woman presents with persistent hypertension despite lifestyle changes. She saw an advertisement on television about a new hypertension medication and asks about it for treatment. Clinical Question What class of medications is the best first-line treatment for hypertension. 1 ACE inhibitors and CCBs reduced mortality and morbidity as much as thiazide diuretics, but the evidence is less robust. Because the use of thiazide diuretics is supported by a strong body of evidence and no other class of antihypertensive medications has been shown to be better at improving outcomes, they are the first-line drugs for most patients with hypertension. Current evidence does not support using beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension.

Cochrane Abstract Background: Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug is the best first-line option. This review answers that question. Objectives: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line antihypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers. No RCTs were found for angiotensin receptor blockers or alpha blockers. Authors' Conclusions: First-line low-dose thiazides reduce all morbidity and mortality outcomes. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers may be similarly effective, but the evidence is less robust. First-line high-dose thiazides and beta blockers are inferior to first-line low-dose thiazides. 1 However, there is no evidence supporting the use of beta blockers over other antihypertensives. 1, 2.

The strongest body of evidence indicates that for most patients with hypertension, thiazide diuretics are the best proven first-line treatment in reducing morbidity and mortality. They are particularly effective in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in all patients with hypertension, and in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe hypertension. Current evidence does not support the use of beta blockers, particularly atenolol, as first-line treatment for hypertension. Although there is increasing evidence that ACE inhibitors and possibly CCBs may be equivalent to thiazide diuretics in reducing morbidity and mortality, the relative expense of these medications makes thiazide diuretics a more favorable first-line choice in patients who do not have contraindications for their use.

### Abstract… [^115qwZwT]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Choice of Agents Figure 1 is an algorithm that can guide combination therapy in patients with hypertension. 1, 6 JNC8, ESC, and ACC/AHA guidelines agree that for most patients, combination therapy should include a thiazide diuretic, a CCB, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or ARB. They further agree that a patient should not take an ACEI and ARB simultaneously. 4–6 Therapy should be escalated at one-month intervals using any of the three accepted strategies.
6. 4 JNC8 recommends that for black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or CCB. 6 Other drug classes may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate blood pressure control on maximal triple therapy, or for those with comorbidities such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease with proteinuria. 4–6 Table 4 lists fixed-dose combination medications that are currently available. 1, 5.

Special Populations These general antihypertensive therapy recommendations complement treatment recommendations for each disease state. In some cases, antihypertensive medications may be used to treat the underlying disease regardless of blood pressure. For this reason, these recommendations should be used in conjunction with disease-specific guidelines. 31 The JNC8 found insufficient evidence to recommend preferential use of ACEIs or ARBs in patients with heart failure and hypertension 6; however, the JNC8 recommendations were published before the PARADIGM-HF results. The beta blockers carvedilol, extended-release metoprolol, and bisoprolol have shown improvements in morbidity and mortality. One of these agents should be initiated in patients with HFrEF unless they have contraindications. 32–34 Beta blockers are usually added once the patient no longer has symptoms of volume overload.

DIABETES Using a fixed-dose combination of an ACEI and a thiazide diuretic in adults with diabetes, the Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension trial showed that a blood pressure decrease of 5. 6/2. 2 mm Hg led to lower rates of microvascular and macrovascular events and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

### Review of hypertension treatment… [^117DKjSW]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension, defined as persistent systolic blood pressure at least 130 mm Hg or diastolic BP at least 80 mm Hg, affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease events and death. Observations First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, including weight loss, healthy dietary pattern that includes low sodium and high potassium intake, physical activity, and moderation or elimination of alcohol consumption. The BP-lowering effects of individual lifestyle components are partially additive and enhance the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy. The decision to initiate antihypertensive medication should be based on the level of BP and the presence of high atherosclerotic CVD risk.

First-line drug therapy for hypertension consists of a thiazide or thiazidelike diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker such as enalapril or candesartan, and a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine and should be titrated according to office and home SBP/DBP levels to achieve in most people an SBP/DBP target. Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of BP lowering to reduce the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. An SBP reduction of 10 mm Hg decreases risk of CVD events by approximately 20% to 30%. Despite the benefits of BP control, only 44% of US adults with hypertension have their SBP/DBP controlled to less than 140/90 mm Hg.

Conclusions and Relevance Hypertension affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide and is a leading cause of CVD morbidity and mortality. First-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, consisting of weight loss, dietary sodium reduction and potassium supplementation, healthy dietary pattern, physical activity, and limited alcohol consumption. When drug therapy is required, first-line therapies are thiazide or thiazidelike diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers.

### Beta blockers as first-line therapy for hypertension? [^112RUgfo]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Beta-blocking drugs have been the mainstay of hypertension therapy for three decades. Because recent analyses have questioned the effectiveness of atenolol, Lind-holm and colleagues reexamined the evidence for effectiveness of the entire class of beta blockers in hypertension. They conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials using a beta blocker as first-line therapy for primary hypertension. Eligibility was restricted to trials in which beta blockers were used in at least one half of all patients in the treatment group, and the outcomes measured included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, or both. Studies were identified from electronic databases of systematic reviews and published reports. The analysis separated studies comparing beta blockers with placebo from those comparing beta blockers with other drugs. The outcome measures considered were stroke, myocar-dial infarction, and death.

Heart failure was not included as an outcome because it was not reported in several trials. In the seven studies comparing beta blockers with placebo or no treatment, the relative risk of stroke was reduced by 19 percent with beta blockers. The greatest reduction in stroke risk occurred in the two studies that used beta blockers in combination with other drugs, usually diuretics. Combination therapy was associated with a 45 percent reduction in stroke risk and a 43 percent reduction in mortality risk. The authors conclude that the reduction in stroke risk associated with beta-blocker therapy is about 19 percent, or about one half of the effect commonly quoted in the medical literature. They speculate that the effectiveness of beta blockers has been overestimated because these agents are commonly prescribed in combination with thiazide diuretics.

Because all antihy-pertensive drugs lower blood pressure by comparable amounts, the authors discuss mechanisms that might explain the superior effect of non-beta blockers in stroke and cardiovascular mortality. Possible explanations include effects on lipid and glucose metabolism or a differential effect on brachial and central blood pressure. They conclude that beta-blocker therapy is suboptimal and may prove more expensive than alternative therapies if the costs of the excess adverse events are taken into consideration.
