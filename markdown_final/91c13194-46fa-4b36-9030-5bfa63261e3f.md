## Question

thyroid function tests in thyroid disorders

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about thyroid function testing in various thyroid disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle of TSH-first testing and when to add free hormones. Then, I should verify how to interpret common TSH/FT4 patterns and when to suspect central disease. Next, I will examine special populations such as pregnancy, pediatrics, and the elderly. After that, I need to check for assay interferences and discordant results. Then, I will review subclinical disease thresholds and monitoring cadence. Finally, I will integrate disease-specific pathways for hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, nodules/cancer, and postoperative care, and close with a concise algorithm summary that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: in most outpatient settings, a sensitive TSH assay is the single best initial screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction, and reflex testing should be added based on the TSH result to avoid unnecessary panels and overtreatment, which is consistently endorsed by AACE/ATA and primary care guidance, with USPSTF emphasizing the risks of overdiagnosis and overtreatment in asymptomatic adults [^112s547R] [^114xt31k] [^112pWQ61].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the reflex strategy. If TSH is high, I need free T4 to distinguish subclinical from overt hypothyroidism and consider TPOAb to assess autoimmune etiology. If TSH is low, I should add free T4 and total T3 to characterize overt versus subclinical hyperthyroidism and to detect T3-toxicosis, which is explicitly recommended in hyperthyroidism guidelines and supported by endocrine society guidance on nodules and thyroid function testing [^112AZiH6] [^113n1g4j].

> Wait, let me verify the central hypothyroidism exception. In suspected pituitary or hypothalamic disease, TSH can be misleadingly normal or inappropriately low/normal with low FT4; here, I should prioritize FT4 or FT4 index to diagnose and guide therapy, and avoid relying on TSH for treatment titration, which is a Grade A recommendation in AACE/ATA guidance [^112SDVCZ] [^116NdwWZ] [^116AqRuH].

> I will now examine the common interpretive patterns to ensure I'm not missing anything. Elevated TSH with normal FT4 indicates subclinical hypothyroidism; elevated TSH with low FT4 indicates overt primary hypothyroidism; suppressed TSH with elevated FT4 and/or T3 indicates overt hyperthyroidism; suppressed TSH with normal FT4/T3 indicates subclinical hyperthyroidism; and discordant patterns like high FT4 with non-suppressed TSH should prompt me to check for assay interference, thyroid hormone resistance, or TSH-secreting adenoma using a structured approach [^114Ub1fK] [^111sz82J].

> Let me consider pregnancy physiology carefully because misinterpretation is common. In early pregnancy, hCG drives down TSH, so a low TSH with normal FT4 in weeks 9–13 can be physiologic; total T4 and T3 rise by about 50% by week 16, so trimester-specific reference ranges or adjusted total hormone interpretation is essential, and I should avoid using treatment targets as diagnostic ranges, as emphasized by ATA and RCOG guidance [^114PrnPb] [^115ChhYp] [^116aMaMN].

> I should double-check preconception and pregnancy-specific thresholds. For women planning pregnancy or early in the first trimester on levothyroxine, aim for TSH below 2.5 mU/L; during pregnancy, monitor TSH and FT4 every 4–6 weeks and adjust dose promptly, recognizing that some patients require a 25–30% dose increase immediately after a missed period or positive test, per ATA and ESPE consensus [^114czVEz] [^115KDSiz].

> Next, I should review pediatric and adolescent testing to avoid overtesting. TSH is the appropriate first test in children; avoid broad panels and reflexively adding FT4/T3 unless TSH is abnormal, and be cautious with "slightly abnormal" results that often normalize on repeat testing, which reduces anxiety and unnecessary referrals [^116JxCS5].

> For older adults, I need to ensure I account for nonspecific symptoms and high background prevalence of subclinical disease. Mild TSH elevations are common, and day-to-day TSH variability can approach 40–50%, so I should confirm persistence over 3–6 months before diagnosing or treating subclinical dysfunction, aligning with USPSTF and endocrine reviews on aging [^114bqgrE] [^111FhaGV] [^116XK1nC].

> But wait, what if the labs don't fit the patient? I should actively search for assay interferences and discordant patterns. Biotin, heterophile antibodies, macro-TSH, and anti-streptavidin antibodies can artifactually alter TSH, FT4, or FT3; medications like amiodarone, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors can cause true thyroid dysfunction or alter assays, so repeating tests on a different platform, checking for biotin use, and reviewing drugs are critical steps when results are incongruent [^114YTtYx] [^115mqnMU] [^117EYENp].

> Let me reconsider subclinical disease thresholds because overtreatment is a major pitfall. For subclinical hypothyroidism, a TSH above 10 mIU/L carries higher risk and is commonly treated. For TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, evidence for benefit is limited, and a strong BMJ guideline recommends against routine thyroid hormone therapy in adults with SCH, favoring observation and individualized decisions, especially given lack of quality-of-life or symptomatic benefit in trials [^114LBMH9] [^111yYVBa].

> For subclinical hyperthyroidism, I should confirm persistence and stratify risk. TSH less than 0.1 mIU/L is associated with atrial fibrillation and bone loss, and treatment is often favored in older adults or those with cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis; detectable but low TSH (0.1–0.4) is lower risk and often observed with repeat testing, consistent with ATA/AACE guidance and primary care recommendations [^111yYVBa] [^114xt31k].

> I need to ensure the monitoring cadence matches disease phase and therapy. After initiating or changing levothyroxine, recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks. After initiating antithyroid drugs, reassess FT4 and T3 in 2–6 weeks and titrate every 4–8 weeks until stable. After radioactive iodine for Graves' disease, monitor FT4 and T3 every 4–6 weeks for 6 months because hypothyroidism often emerges by 4–8 weeks and TSH may remain suppressed for months, so FT4 should guide replacement decisions early on [^114amZFd] [^1141NEjw] [^116o1x3e].

> Now, let me integrate disease-specific pathways, starting with hypothyroidism. Confirm with TSH and FT4, assess TPOAb to support autoimmune etiology, avoid T3 testing for diagnosis, and in central hypothyroidism use FT4 to diagnose and titrate therapy. Treat with levothyroxine, aiming for a TSH in the reference range in primary disease and FT4 in the upper half of normal in central disease, with careful attention to drug interactions and absorption issues [^116R5pZ2] [^116AqRuH] [^1121spBy].

> For hyperthyroidism, I should confirm with suppressed TSH plus elevated FT4/T3, then determine etiology. TRAb supports Graves' disease and informs pregnancy planning and neonatal risk. A low or suppressed TSH in a nodule evaluation should trigger a radionuclide uptake scan to distinguish hyperfunctioning (low malignancy risk) from nonfunctioning nodules. Monitor therapy with FT4 and T3 early because TSH suppression can persist for months [^113cT9y7] [^1178Nh11] [^116o1x3e].

> For thyroid nodules, I should confirm that TSH is measured in all patients with nodules. If TSH is suppressed, proceed to uptake imaging and FT4/T3 to assess for autonomy, whereas if TSH is normal or high, proceed to ultrasound and FNA based on size and sonographic risk features, avoiding routine radionuclide scanning in the latter scenario [^1178Nh11] [^113pHpMM].

> Postoperative care after total thyroidectomy requires coordinated follow-up. I should check TSH at 6–8 weeks and adjust levothyroxine to the clinical context, including cancer risk stratification and any residual tissue. Lifelong annual TSH monitoring is appropriate once stable, with earlier checks if symptoms or medications change [^112UcR3F].

> Special populations deserve tailored protocols. In pregnancy, use trimester-specific ranges and intensify monitoring; in pediatrics, keep testing simple and avoid over-calling mild abnormalities; in older adults, confirm persistence before labeling disease; in patients on amiodarone or ICIs, anticipate dysregulation and monitor proactively; and in those with dilated cardiomyopathy, include thyroid testing in the initial workup and treat identified dysfunction [^114PrnPb] [^116JxCS5] [^114bqgrE] [^117EYENp] [^115mqnMU] [^112R16mM].

> Finally, I should double-check that my algorithm aligns with evidence and avoids common traps. Start with TSH, add FT4/T3 selectively, confirm abnormal results before diagnosing, consider central disease when the picture is discordant, and individualize treatment decisions in subclinical disease. This approach minimizes overdiagnosis, reduces costs, and improves patient-centered outcomes, consistent with USPSTF, AACE/ATA, and contemporary primary care guidance [^112pWQ61] [^112s547R] [^114xt31k].

Thyroid function tests (TFTs) are the cornerstone for diagnosing and monitoring thyroid disorders, with **TSH as the first-line test** for most scenarios [^112s547R] [^114Ub1fK]. Abnormal TSH prompts measurement of free T4 and/or total T3 to define hypo- or hyperthyroidism, while **thyroid autoantibodies** (anti-TPO, TRAb) clarify etiology, especially in autoimmune disease [^113n1g4j] [^113cT9y7]. In pregnancy, use **trimester-specific reference ranges** and prioritize free T4 over TSH for central hypothyroidism [^115hDrrB] [^112SDVCZ]. TFTs require careful interpretation in the context of medications, acute illness, and assay interference; repeat testing is advised when results are discordant or unexpected [^114bqgrE] [^114YTtYx].

---

## Indications for thyroid function testing

TFTs are indicated in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Symptomatic patients**: Fatigue, weight changes, heat/cold intolerance, palpitations, or menstrual irregularities [^notfound].
- **Asymptomatic high-risk patients**: Elderly, pregnant/postpartum, or those with autoimmune disorders [^111yYVBa] [^111EDA9E].
- **Monitoring therapy**: Patients on thyroid hormone replacement or antithyroid drugs [^114xt31k] [^1141NEjw].
- **Post-thyroidectomy or radioiodine therapy**: Regular monitoring for recurrence or hypothyroidism [^116o1x3e] [^112UcR3F].

## Commonly used thyroid function tests

| **Test** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| TSH | Sensitive marker of thyroid dysfunction | First-line test for primary hypo/hyperthyroidism [^112s547R] [^112AZiH6] |
| Free T4 | Active hormone; less affected by protein changes | Confirms hypo/hyperthyroidism; central hypothyroidism [^112SDVCZ] |
| Total T3 | Useful in hyperthyroidism | Detects T3-toxicosis; suppressed TSH with normal T4 [^112AZiH6] |
| Anti-TPO | Autoimmune marker | Indicates Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^notfound] |
| TRAb | TSH receptor antibodies | Confirms Graves' disease; prognostic [^113cT9y7] |
| Thyroglobulin | Tumor marker | Monitors differentiated thyroid cancer [^notfound] |
| Calcitonin | Tumor marker | Suspected medullary thyroid carcinoma [^notfound] |

---

## Interpretation of thyroid function tests

Interpretation relies on the **inverse log-linear TSH–free T4 relationship** [^112AZiH6] and clinical context:

- **Primary hypothyroidism**: Elevated TSH, low free T4 [^notfound].
- **Primary hyperthyroidism**: Suppressed TSH, elevated free T4 and/or T3 [^112AZiH6].
- **Subclinical hypothyroidism**: Elevated TSH, normal free T4 [^111trvZ4].
- **Subclinical hyperthyroidism**: Suppressed TSH, normal free T4/T3 [^111yYVBa].
- **Central hypothyroidism**: Low or inappropriately normal TSH, low free T4 [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations in pregnancy

Pregnancy alters thyroid physiology; **trimester-specific reference ranges** are essential [^115ChhYp]:

- **First trimester**: TSH may be low due to hCG; free T4 is preferred for central hypothyroidism [^112SDVCZ].
- **Second/third trimesters**: Total T4/T3 rise ~50%; use trimester-specific ranges [^114PrnPb].
- **Postpartum**: Monitor for postpartum thyroiditis with serial TFTs [^115NLB6V].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can **confound TFT interpretation**:

- **Medications**: Amiodarone, lithium, glucocorticoids, dopamine, biotin [^114YTtYx].
- **Acute illness**: Non-thyroidal illness syndrome (euthyroid sick syndrome) [^111FhaGV].
- **Assay interference**: Heterophile antibodies, macro-TSH, biotin [^114YTtYx].
- **Individual variability**: Age, sex, smoking, iodine intake [^1145h7qw].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **First-line test**: TSH for most patients [^112s547R] [^114xt31k].
- **Confirmatory tests**: Free T4 and/or total T3 if TSH is abnormal [^112AZiH6].
- **Autoimmune etiology**: Anti-TPO and TRAb as indicated [^113cT9y7].
- **Pregnancy**: Use trimester-specific ranges; free T4 for central hypothyroidism [^115ChhYp] [^112SDVCZ].
- **Monitoring**: Adjust therapy based on TFTs and clinical status [^1141NEjw].

---

Thyroid function tests are essential for diagnosing and managing thyroid disorders, with **TSH as the primary screening tool** and free T4/T3 and autoantibodies providing confirmatory and etiologic information. Interpretation must consider clinical context, pregnancy, medications, and assay limitations to avoid misdiagnosis and overtreatment [^116XK1nC].

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) evidence review scope and test performance: The USPSTF commissioned a systematic evidence review in 2004 to assess the benefits and harms of screening for subclinical and "overt" thyroid dysfunction without clinically obvious symptoms and the effects of treating screen-detected cases on intermediate and final health outcomes; the review also evaluated the proportion of screened patients with clinically apparent disease, the proportion with TSH levels of 10 mIU/L or less who are treated in current practice, and cardiovascular consequences of untreated subclinical thyroid dysfunction. When used to confirm clinically suspected thyroid disease in patients referred to an endocrinologist, the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test has a sensitivity of about 98%.

### The role of nuclear medicine in the clinical management of benign thyroid disorders, part 2: nodular goiter, hypothyroidism, and subacute thyroiditis [^113GfMqu]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Part 2 of this series of Continuing Education articles on benign thyroid disorders deals with nodular goiter, hypothyroidism, and subacute thyroiditis. Together with Part 1 (which dealt with various forms of hyperthyroidism), this article is intended to provide relevant information for specialists in nuclear medicine dealing with the clinical management of patients with benign thyroid disorders, the primary audience for this series. Goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland, is a common endocrine abnormality. Constitutional factors, genetic abnormalities, or dietary and environmental factors may contribute to the development of nodular goiter. Most patients with nontoxic nodular goiter are asymptomatic or have only mild mechanical symptoms (globus pharyngis). Work-up of these patients includes measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid autoantibodies, ultrasound imaging, thyroid scintigraphy, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy of nodules with certain ultrasound and scintigraphic features. Treatment for multinodular goiter includes dietary iodine supplementation, surgery, radioiodine therapy (to decrease thyroid size), and minimally invasive ablation techniques. Hypothyroidism ranges from rare cases of myxedema to more common mild forms (subclinical hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism often has an autoimmune etiology. Clinical presentations differ in neonates, children, adults, and elderly patients. Work-up includes thyroid function tests and ultrasound imaging. Nuclear medicine is primarily used to locate ectopic thyroid tissue in congenital hypothyroidism or to detect defects in iodine organification with the perchlorate discharge test. Treatment consists of thyroid replacement therapy with l-thyroxine, adjusting the daily dose to the individual patient's metabolic and hormonal requirements. Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland, often associated with painless or painful swelling of the gland and somatic signs or symptoms. Inflammation disrupts thyroid follicles resulting in a rapid release of stored thyroxine and triiodothyronine causing an initial thyrotoxic phase, often followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism. Although subacute thyroiditis is often related to a viral infection, no infective agent has been identified. Subacute thyroiditis may be caused by a viral infection in genetically predisposed individuals. Work-up includes lab tests, ultrasound imaging, and radionuclide imaging. Thyroid scintigraphy demonstrates different findings depending on the phase of the illness, ranging from very low or absent tracer uptake in the thyroid gland in the hyperthyroid phase to a normal appearance in the late recovery phase. Since subacute thyroiditis is self-limited, treatment is directed toward relief of pain. High-dose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are usually the first-line treatment. If severe pain persists, a course of corticosteroids may be necessary. Permanent hypothyroidism develops in up to 15% of patients with subacute thyroiditis, even more than 1 y after presentation.

At a glance CDC is improving the accuracy of thyroid hormone measurements performed in patient care and public health activities. Overview Thyroid Disease Thyroid dysfunction can lead to serious health problems but can often be restored when detected correctly. If left untreated thyroid disorders can lead to serious cardiovascular and neuromuscular problems. Physicians rely on thyroid function tests to detect, diagnose, and treat diseases caused by thyroid hormones. CDC is improving the accuracy of free thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone tests. CDC uses a reference method for fT4 and provides serum materials to laboratories and test manufacturers to help assess measurement accuracy and reduce the variability of accuracy among laboratories.

### Clinical aspects of thyroid function during ageing [^1145h7qw]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Globally, populations are ageing at a rapid rate. The increase in the number of older citizens is accompanied by an increased prevalence of thyroid dysfunction, one of the most common disorders in older people. However, the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction in older people is hindered by several factors, including the scarcity of thyroid dysfunction symptoms in older people. We describe the physiological changes in thyroid function that occur with increasing age, focusing on literature regarding changes in thyroid function test results in older populations. We also discuss treatment considerations for clinical and subclinical thyroid dysfunction according to international guidelines for older people. Finally, we discuss the relationship between variations in thyroid function and common diseases of old age including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cognitive impairment, and frailty and suggest directions for future research.

Conclusion

Further research is required to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and management of this heterogenous disorder.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in early neurodevelopment so that untreated severe CH results in neurological and psychiatric deficits, including intellectual disability, spasticity, and disturbances of gait and co-ordination. CH is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation. Screening programs, which have been in operation over the last 30 years in most industrialized countries, have led to the successful early detection and treatment of infants with CH and have eliminated the severe neurodevelopmental deficits resulting from late diagnosis. Studies on cognitive function in patients with CH treated soon after birth have shown that normal development can be achieved in most patients, although some may have subtle neurocognitive deficits.

Estimates of the prevalence of CH vary according to the method of ascertainment: about 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births in countries with neonatal screening vs about 1 in 6700 live births before the screening era. Recent reports have indicated that the incidence of primary CH may be increasing in some countries, particularly for cases with a normally located (eutopic) thyroid gland and milder dysfunction. The reasons for this remain unclear but may relate to changes in screening thresholds.

The results from neonatal screening programs have also helped to identify a broad spectrum of thyroid dysfunctions with different underlying etiologies. CH can be classified according to site: primary (thyroid) or secondary/central (pituitary and/or hypothalamic); to severity: FT4 levels within the normal range for age (compensated) or subnormal (decompensated); and to age of onset. The most common form of CH is primary hypothyroidism, with high TSH levels reflecting various types of abnormal thyroid gland development or dyshormonogenesis. Secondary hypothyroidism is much less frequent, either with isolated TSH deficiency due to mutations inactivating the TSH β-subunit, the TRH receptor, or IGSF1 (ImmunoGlobulin SuperFamily member 1), or more commonly with TSH deficiency associated with other pituitary hormone deficiencies.

Impaired thyroid hormone production may also be temporary or permanent, the latter requiring lifelong treatment, and thyroid dysfunction may change in a given individual with growth and development stages. Transient primary CH can be defined as an increase in TSH levels during the neonatal period, with normal TFT results obtained off treatment at a later stage. The purely descriptive term "hyperthyrotropinemia" refers to a form of compensated CH in which there is a mild increase in TSH concentration (eg, 6–20 mU/L) with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. It may also be transient or permanent.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1119RUsp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2016 — monitoring of children taking propylthiouracil (PTU): In general, PTU should not be used in children. But if it is used, the medication should be stopped immediately and liver function and hepatocellular integrity assessed in children who experience anorexia, pruritus, rash, jaundice, light-colored stool or dark urine, joint pain, right upper quadrant pain or abdominal bloating, nausea, or malaise (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). PTU should be discontinued if transaminase levels reach 2–3 times the upper limit of normal; after discontinuing the drug, liver function tests should be monitored weekly until there is evidence of resolution, and if there is no evidence of resolution, referral to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist is warranted.

### Thyroid dysfunction in the elderly [^111FhaGV]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction is common in the general population, and mild or subclinical forms can be present in more than 10% of individuals aged > 80 years. The diagnosis of abnormal thyroid hormone concentrations in people aged > 60 years poses a challenge, as the clinical presentation of thyroid dysfunction is usually nonspecific, and ageing is associated with a number of physiological changes that can affect thyroid function test results. Furthermore, the presence of acute or chronic nonthyroidal illnesses and the use of medications that interfere with thyroid function tests are common confounders in the determination of thyroid status in the elderly. Early diagnosis and treatment of overt thyroid dysfunction is crucial in this population in view of the marked effects of abnormal circulating thyroid hormone levels on a number of organ systems, including the heart, the skeleton and the neurological system. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity remains uncertain, and the need for treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is much debated. A number of large epidemiological studies have identified associations between mild thyroid dysfunction and short-term as well as long-term adverse outcomes, and a small but increasing number of randomized controlled intervention studies have been reported. Guidelines recommend treatment of thyroid dysfunction on the basis of the degree of abnormal serum TSH concentrations, patient age and associated comorbidities. This Review describes the current evidence on the prevalence, diagnosis, management and long-term consequences of thyroid dysfunction in the elderly.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^116BQ3o2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^116XK1nC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^111EDA9E]. Thyroid (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid disease in pregnancy is a common clinical problem. Since the guidelines for the management of these disorders by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) were first published in 2011, significant clinical and scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease in women during pregnancy, preconception, and the postpartum period.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations. The guideline task force had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid disease in pregnancy include recommendations regarding the interpretation of thyroid function tests in pregnancy, iodine nutrition, thyroid autoantibodies and pregnancy complications, thyroid considerations in infertile women, hypothyroidism in pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy, thyroid nodules and cancer in pregnant women, fetal and neonatal considerations, thyroid disease and lactation, screening for thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy, and directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid disease in pregnant and postpartum women. While all care must be individualized, such recommendations provide, in our opinion, optimal care paradigms for patients with these disorders.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^111UyBCP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective:

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of congenital hypothyroidism (CH).

Evidence:

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify key articles relating to the screening, diagnosis, and management of CH. The evidence-based guidelines were developed with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, describing both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. In the absence of sufficient evidence, conclusions were based on expert opinion.

Consensus Process:

Thirty-two participants drawn from the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and five other major scientific societies in the field of pediatric endocrinology were allocated to working groups with assigned topics and specific questions. Each group searched the literature, evaluated the evidence, and developed a draft document. These papers were debated and finalized by each group before presentation to the full assembly for further discussion and agreement.

Recommendations:

The recommendations include: worldwide neonatal screening, approaches to assess the cause (including genotyping) and the severity of the disorder, the immediate initiation of appropriate L-T 4 supplementation and frequent monitoring to ensure dose adjustments to keep thyroid hormone levels in the target ranges, a trial of treatment in patients suspected of transient CH, regular assessments of developmental and neurosensory functions, consulting health professionals as appropriate, and education about CH. The harmonization of diagnosis, management, and routine health surveillance would not only optimize patient outcomes, but should also facilitate epidemiological studies of the disorder. Individuals with CH require monitoring throughout their lives, particularly during early childhood and pregnancy.

### Thyroid and the heart [^111upW69]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroid hormones modulate every component of the cardiovascular system necessary for normal cardiovascular development and function. When cardiovascular disease is present, thyroid function tests are characteristically indicated to determine if overt thyroid disorders or even subclinical dysfunction exists. As hypothyroidism, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease all increase with advancing age, monitoring of thyroid-stimulating hormone, the most sensitive test for hypothyroidism, is important in this expanding segment of our population. A better understanding of the impact of thyroid hormonal status on cardiovascular physiology will enable health care providers to make decisions about thyroid hormone evaluation and therapy in concert with evaluating and treating hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The goal of this review is to access contemporary understanding of the effects of thyroid hormones on normal cardiovascular function and the potential role of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in a variety of cardiovascular diseases.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^115KDSiz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations

3.3.6 If a precise diagnosis is sought, L-T 4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period (depending on the size of the maintenance dose) and a full re-evaluation carried out at the end of this period, with biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed (2|⊕○○).

3.3.7 If the clinician wishes to establish the presence or absence of primary hypothyroidism rather than to obtain an exact diagnosis, L-T 4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks. If an increase in TSH concentration to ≥ 10 mU/L is observed during this period, then continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed. By contrast, if thyroid function remains normal, the dose may be reduced further, followed by retesting (2|⊕⊕○).

3.3.6–3.3.7 Evidence

By the age of 2 to 3 years, the severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or, if compliance has been imperfect, high TSH levels despite treatment.

3.4 Treatment and monitoring in pregnant women with CH

Recommendations

3.4.1 For women with CH who are planning a pregnancy, even greater efforts should be made to ensure that maternal thyroid hormones are optimal. In newly pregnant patients, we recommend an immediate increase in L-T 4 dose by 25 to 30% after a missed menstrual cycle or positive home pregnancy test (1|⊕○○).

3.4.2 TSH and FT4 (or TT 4) levels should be evaluated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, every 4 to 6 weeks during the pregnancy, and 4 weeks after every change in dose (1|⊕⊕⊕).

3.4.3 The goal of the treatment is to maintain TSH concentration below 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester and below 3 mU/L later in pregnancy (1|⊕○○).

3.4.1–3.4.3 Evidence

There is currently no specific evidence for treatment schedules in pregnant women with CH. We therefore refer to the guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and The Endocrine Society regarding the management of thyroid disease during pregnancy.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^11314zSF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment and terminology: A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from 28 October to 24 November 2014. The USPSTF also clarified that the systematic evidence review searched for studies on the treatment of thyroid dysfunction that used placebo or no treatment as the comparator. The USPSTF notes there are no high-quality studies that show that treatment of "overt" thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic persons affects important health outcomes, and given the widespread practice of screening and the absence of high-quality evidence on effectiveness, a presumption that treatment is effective seems unwarranted. To reduce terminology confusion, the USPSTF believes alternative terms are needed and suggests the term "overt thyroid disease" to describe symptomatic patients who also have persistently abnormal serum TSH and T4 levels. This recommendation replaces the 2004 USPSTF recommendation on screening for thyroid disease.

### The "slightly" abnormal thyroid test: what is the pediatrician to do? [^116JxCS5]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid disorders are common in pediatrics. Tests of thyroid function are widely available and frequently ordered in the pediatric healthcare setting. This is sometimes driven by common signs or symptoms of thyroid disease. All too often, it is driven by patients and their parents requesting thyroid tests for nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, obesity or family history of thyroid disease. The decision to order thyroid tests, as well as which test(s) of thyroid function to order, deserves careful thought rather than a reflexive "thyroid panel" for every patient. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is the single most appropriate test of thyroid function when screening a pediatric or adolescent for thyroid disorders. Adding more tests only increases the likelihood that a minor (and often insignificant) abnormality will be found. These incidental abnormalities can create anxiety for the parent and child, and usually results in additional testing, referral to a pediatric endocrinologist, and further expense. This review will aim to guide the pediatric primary care provider on the choice of appropriate screening test(s) for acquired thyroid dysfunction in children and adolescents, as well as the proper interpretation of the test(s). Emphasis will be placed on the "slightly" abnormal thyroid screening test. Specific thyroid tests to be reviewed include TSH, (free) T4, (free) T3, and thyroid antibodies. Finally, this review will aim to guide decisions on follow-up, additional testing, and reasons for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. Congenital hypothyroidism, including abnormalities on state newborn screening, will not be discussed.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114bqgrE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening performance and variability — test characteristics and limitations are outlined: specificity is "about 92%", most laboratories "define an abnormal TSH test result by using the upper and lower limits of the 95% reference interval for a particular assay (generally about 0.4 to 4.5 mIU/L)", and among older adults "12% of persons aged 80 years or older with no evidence of thyroid disease have been found to have TSH levels greater than 4.5 mIU/L". Day-to-day mean values can vary "by as much as 50%", with "up to 40% variation" in same-time serial measurements; consequently, "All of this confirms the importance of not relying on a single TSH value to establish a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction" and "Serial TSH measurements are an essential step in establishing that a thyroid disorder is real and persistent", while "TSH secretion is highly sensitive to factors other than thyroid disorders".

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

Thyroid dysfunction screening — test interpretation and confirmation in asymptomatic adults indicates that accurate interpretation of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels is further complicated by measurement variability and conditions other than thyroid disease, and many professional groups recommend repeating thyroid function tests for confirmation of persistent dysfunction over 3- to 6-month intervals in asymptomatic persons before diagnosis or treatment unless the serum TSH level is greater than 10.0 or less than 0.1 mIU/L.

### The complex web of interferences with thyroid function tests [^114YTtYx]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Thyroid disorders are common. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone is frequently measured and is the single best initial biomarker to diagnose thyroid disease. Automated immunoassays used to evaluate thyroid function are susceptible to interferences that can affect test results and therefore clinical decisions. In this comprehensive review, our aim is to discuss common assay and drug interferences leading to abnormal thyroid function tests.

Methods

Authors conducted a literature review of PubMed to include studies on drug related and laboratory assay interferences leading to primary and secondary thyroid dysfunction in addition to interferences with thyroid hormone replacement and thyroid function tests.

Results

Overall, there are several assay interferences as well as drug interferences leading to primary thyroid dysfunction including iodine-containing drugs such as amiodarone, lithium, immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, drug interferences leading to secondary thyroid dysfunction such as glucocorticoids, and drug interferences affecting thyroid hormone absorption, metabolism, and thyroid binding globulin levels. In addition, assay interferences from biotin, heterophile antibodies, macro-thyrotropin or anti-streptavidin antibodies may occur without underlying thyroid dysfunction, leading to abnormal thyroid function tests.

Conclusion

For appropriate patient management, it is imperative to identify assay interferences when discrepancies between clinical presentation and thyroid function test results are noted.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^117EYENp]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring thyroid function tests before and within the first 3 months following the initiation of amiodarone therapy and at 3–6-month intervals thereafter.

### Clinical parameters are more likely to be associated with thyroid hormone levels than with thyrotropin levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gv3zG]. Thyroid (2020). Medium credibility.

This work addressed diagnosis alone. Extrapolation of our findings appears logical, and there is no apparent a priori reason as to why TSH levels should be preferred over thyroid hormone levels in the context of monitoring thyroid treatments. Randomized trials might, nevertheless, reveal that additional considerations apply in these circumstances. Though there was no suggestion in the studies that we examined of a difference with individuals on thyroid hormone replacement, their numbers were small.

In summary, there is now matching theoretical and empiric evidence from a variety of sources suggesting that the thyroid status of an individual is better defined by thyroid hormone levels than TSH levels. There is evidence of a continuum of thyroid hormone effects along the continuum of thyroid hormone levels, with a possible optimum around the middle of the reference range. Though TSH levels remain good screening tests for overt thyroid dysfunction, it is theoretically and empirically more sound to rely on thyroid hormone and especially fT4 levels to classify the thyroid state.

This work should result in a simplification of the understanding of thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, and bring it more into line with the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of other parameters, whereby the status of a parameter is judged by its level rather than the level of any controlling factor. Reconsideration of the TSH-based diagnostic approach to thyroid function appears to be indicated. In turn, this would appear to have implications for clinical guidelines, research methodology, and the rationale of underlying physiological principles.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

Thyroid disease is common, affecting 1% to 2% of pregnant women. Pregnancy may modify the course of thyroid disease, and pregnancy outcomes can depend on optimal management of thyroid disorders. Consequently, obstetric providers must be familiar with thyroid physiology and management of thyroid diseases in pregnancy.

### Thyroid dysfunction and type 2 diabetes mellitus: screening strategies and implications for management [^115ZAjoV]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Guidelines on Screening for Thyroid Disorders in Diabetes

It is important to screen for TD in T2DM patients as each of these endocrinopathies and their complex interdependent interactions increase cardiovascular risks. However, some guidelines do not mention anything about monitoring thyroid function in T2DM, while others recommend a thyroid function test at baseline but are against routine annual thyroid screening in T2DM (Table 1).

Table 1
Major recommendations for thyroid screening in diabetes mellitus patients

T1DM type 1 diabetes mellitus, T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus, GDM gestational diabetes, TD thyroid disorders, TSH thyroid-stimulating hormone, anti-TPO anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody, anti-TG antithyroglobulin antibody, FT4 free thyroxine, TFT thyroid function test, NICE National Institute for Clinical Excellence, SCH subclinical hypothyroidism, OGTT oral glucose tolerance test

In its guidance for 2000, the American Thyroid Association recommended that adults who were at least 35 years old should be screened for thyroid disorders by measuring serum thyrotropin every 5 years irrespective of whether they were diabetic or nondiabetic. However, the 2015 Thyroid Dysfunction: Screening Guidelines of the US Preventive Services Task Force conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend TD screening in nonpregnant or asymptomatic adults.

The recommendations for thyroid function screening of T2DM patients are not clear. The increasing evidence supporting a link between T2DM and TD, however, suggests that screening may need to be considered.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112s547R]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^114rAP4D]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association/AACE — Thyroid function testing during pregnancy — diagnostic interpretation is as follows: Serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy; therefore, low serum TSH with normal free T4 in early pregnancy does not indicate abnormal thyroid function, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit for TSH in the nonpregnant population can be used. Serum total T4 and T3 increase in early pregnancy and, from the late first trimester, reference ranges are close to 1.5 times nonpregnancy ranges during the second and third trimesters. Total T4 and T3 may be combined with a T3 uptake test or TBG measurements to create "free T4 index" or "TBG adjusted T4", which may be useful for diagnosing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, but trimester-specific normal reference ranges should be established for each individual test and assay used. The reliability of automated analog-based free T4 and free T3 assays has been questioned, and method-specific reference ranges for each trimester of pregnancy should be employed by the manufacturer.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^114PrnPb]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy-related thyroid function test interpretation describes that serum TSH levels may be below the nonpregnant reference range in the first half of a normal-term pregnancy, especially in gestational weeks 9–13, and during the second half of pregnancy the lower limit of normal for TSH in the pregnant population can be used. Free T4 and T3 measured in an equilibrium dialysis or an ultrafiltrate of serum may be slightly higher (5%–10%) than nonpregnancy values early in gestation, then gradually decrease so that late third trimester values are lower than in nonpregnant women. Serum total T4 and T3 reference ranges increase at a rate of 5% of nonpregnant values per week over the 10-week period of gestation weeks 7–16, after which this 50% increase stabilizes and reference range limits remain 1.5 times above nonpregnancy ranges over the remaining weeks of pregnancy.

### Risk factors for thyroid function test abnormalities during pregnancy: a systematic review of the literature to validate current risk factors and identify novel ones [^117HEJmo]. Thyroid (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: International guidelines recommend that the indication to perform thyroid function testing during pregnancy is based on the presence of risk factors for thyroid function test abnormalities. However, the discriminative ability of currently recommended risk factors is questionable. To inform on an update of the American Thyroid Association Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Disease in Preconception, Pregnancy, and the Postpartum, we aimed to systematically review the literature to evaluate evidence for current risk factors and potential novel ones for thyroid function test abnormalities in pregnancy. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed on Embase, Medline Ovid, and the Cochrane Library from inception to October 17, 2024, to identify articles on the associations of any candidate variables with thyroid function test abnormalities, thyroid antibody positivity, or results of continuous thyroid function tests in pregnancy. Additional records were identified through citation searching. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We summarized the results using a narrative synthesis. Results: A total of 81 articles were included, describing 36 candidate variables. Thyroid antibody positivity was associated with a higher risk of overt or subclinical hypothyroidism compared with antibody negativity (absolute risks: 2.4–7.0% vs. 0.1–0.2% for overt hypothyroidism and 1.9–29.0% vs. 2.0–5.7% for subclinical hypothyroidism). In cases of iodine deficiency, sufficiency, and intake above pregnancy requirements or excess, the absolute risks for subclinical hypothyroidism were 2.2–42.6%, 1.42–16.0%, and 3.8–24.3%, respectively. A limited number of studies were available for history of autoimmune diseases, family history of thyroid disease, symptoms of hypothyroidism, and history of pregnancy loss, preterm delivery, or infertility. There was little or no association of current risk factors with isolated hypothyroxinemia or (subclinical) hyperthyroidism. We did not identify novel risk factors for thyroid function test abnormalities. Conclusions: Evidence for most currently recommended risk factors remains limited and heterogeneous, and no novel risk factor was identified. While risk factors can help guide thyroid function testing in pregnancy, a clinical risk assessment cannot be replaced. Future studies are needed to detect novel risk factors that can improve the accuracy and efficiency of identifying pregnant women at high risk of thyroid function test abnormalities, in particular, overt hypothyroidism.

Laboratory evaluation of thyroid nodules — The high sensitivity of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay makes it the most useful laboratory test in the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules, and third-generation TSH chemiluminometric assays, with detection limits of about 0.01 μU/mL, should be used; if the serum TSH level is within the reference range (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism), the measurement of free thyroid hormones adds no further relevant information. To limit unnecessary laboratory testing, the following strategy should be followed for most patients: serum TSH within normal limits — no further testing (unless suspicion of central hypothyroidism); increased serum TSH — test FT4 and TPOAb to evaluate for hypothyroidism; decreased serum TSH — test FT4 and total or FT3 to evaluate for hyperthyroidism.

Laboratory evaluation for thyroid disease and nodules — The initial evaluation for all patients should include a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). If TSH is suppressed, a free T4 and total T3 should be obtained, and a thyroid uptake scan should be obtained to assess if the index nodule is hyperfunctioning; such nodules have a low risk of malignancy and do not require FNAB.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced thyroid dysfunction — screening and follow-up emphasize that "the majority of patients in whom thyroid dysfunction develops after ICI therapy are asymptomatic", and "all patients should be tested (TSH and free T4) at the baseline prior to therapy". Ongoing surveillance is advised with "frequent monitoring with each cycle or every 4 to 6 weeks from the start of ICI therapy or as needed… should allow for the detection of evolving thyroid disease". Baseline antibodies are not definitive because "Evidence for the measurement of the levels of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies at the baseline to predict future thyroid dysfunction is still emerging", though "additional laboratory investigations for TSH receptor antibodies… and thyroglobulin may help to distinguish the diagnoses", and "Additional imaging… may have a role in select cases". Management notes that "ICI therapy need not be interrupted or discontinued in cases of thyroid-related side effects", while "Patients with overt hypothyroidism (a low level of free T4 and persistently elevated level of TSH of more than twice the upper limit of the normal range) will require thyroid hormone replacement".

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^117Kumyp]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Interpretation of thyroid function tests [^114Ub1fK]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin assays and free thyroid hormone measurements has simplified the interpretation of thyroid function tests. However, important pitfalls and difficult cases still exist. In this review, thyroid function test results are grouped into six different patterns. We propose that if assays for thyrotropin, free T3, and free T4 are all done, knowledge of these patterns coupled with clinical details and simple additional tests allow a diagnosis to be made in almost all cases.

Conclusions

Patients with CH benefit from neonatal screening, which makes it possible to initiate essential replacement therapy immediately. This consensus highlights the need to identify clear cutoff points for CH screening, without increasing the number of false-positive results. However, the results of long-term prospective studies in subjects with false-positive results are not yet available for the formulation of evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management. Based on current outcome data, an immediate treatment should be initiated, and it appears necessary to maintain adequate L-T 4 treatment throughout the lifespan for most patients, with a particular emphasis on treatment in the first years of life and of treatment optimization in pregnant women with CH. Careful neurodevelopmental and neurosensory evaluations should be started early in life and repeated at important critical developmental phases, taking into account disease severity at diagnosis and providing appropriate interventions as required. Subsequent efforts should focus on educating both patients and caregivers to ensure that adequate treatment is continued into adulthood. Future research should aim to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of this heterogeneous disorder and to determine whether knowledge of the specific defect in thyroid development or function is likely to improve patient care and outcomes.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112pWQ61]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — variability and potential overdiagnosis: Management of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L is described as more controversial, with a likely large magnitude of overdiagnosis and overtreatment from screening; the high variability of TSH secretion and frequent reversion to normal underscore the importance of not relying on a single abnormal laboratory value, and it is not possible to differentiate those who will progress from those who will remain stable or normalize, so treating the latter yields no benefit and can cause harms from antithyroid medications, ablation therapy, and long-term thyroid hormone therapy.

### What should be done when thyroid function tests do not make sense? [^111sz82J]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Interpretation of thyroid function tests (TFTs) is generally straightforward. However, in a minority of contexts the results of thyroid hormone and thyrotropin measurements either conflict with the clinical picture or form an unusual pattern. In many such cases, reassessment of the clinical context provides an explanation for the discrepant TFTs; in other instances, interference in one or other laboratory assays can be shown to account for divergent results; uncommonly, genetic defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are associated with anomalous TFTs. Failure to recognize these potential 'pitfalls' can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management. Here, focusing particularly on the combination of hyperthyroxinaemia with nonsuppressed thyrotropin, we show how a structured approach to investigation can help make sense of atypical TFTs.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

Postoperative thyroid function monitoring — testing schedule and coordination: After total thyroidectomy, testing of thyroid function should be coordinated with the patient's endocrinologist and/or primary care physician, and TSH level should be checked at 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively and T4 dose adjusted accordingly. The appropriate TSH level depends on multiple factors, including whether the patient has a diagnosis of TC of follicular cell origin and has ongoing features of hypo- or hyperthyroidism.

Patients who have been treated with ATD for 12–18 months a rapid relapse after withdrawal becomes less likely, even if the frequency of relapse may be in the order of 50% within 1 year. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and associazione medici endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules [^116pnehY]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common and are frequently benign. Current data suggest that the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules is 3% to 7% in North America; the prevalence is as high as 50% based on ultrasonography (US) or autopsy data. The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) assays, the widespread application of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, and the availability of high-resolution US have substantially improved the management of thyroid nodules. This document was prepared as a collaborative effort between the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AME). Most Task Force members are members of AACE. We have used the AACE protocol for clinical practice guidelines, with rating of available evidence, linking the guidelines to the strength of recommendations. Key observations include the following. Although most patients with thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, occasionally patients complain of dysphagia, dysphonia, pressure, pain, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Absence of symptoms does not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, it is important to review risk factors for malignant disease. Thyroid US should not be performed as a screening test. All patients with a palpable thyroid nodule, however, should undergo US examination. US-guided FNA (US-FNA) is recommended for nodules ≥ 10 mm; US-FNA is suggested for nodules < 10 mm only if clinical information or US features are suspicious. Thyroid FNA is reliable and safe, and smears should be interpreted by an experienced pathologist. Patients with benign thyroid nodules should undergo follow-up, and malignant or suspicious nodules should be treated surgically. A radioisotope scan of the thyroid is useful if the TSH level is low or suppressed. Measurement of serum TSH is the best initial laboratory test of thyroid function and should be followed by measurement of free thyroxine if the TSH value is low and of thyroid peroxidase antibody if the TSH value is high. Percutaneous ethanol injection is useful in the treatment of cystic thyroid lesions; large, symptomatic goiters may be treated surgically or with radioiodine. Routine measurement of serum calcitonin is not recommended. Suggestions for thyroid nodule management during pregnancy are presented. We believe that these guidelines will be useful to clinical endocrinologists, endocrine surgeons, pediatricians, and internists whose practices include management of patients with thyroid disorders. These guidelines are thorough and practical, and they offer reasoned and balanced recommendations based on the best available evidence.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^111Nyqhk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Different professional bodies have published detailed guidelines pertaining to various facets of management of Graves' disease, such as the 2016 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines and the 2018 European thyroid association (ETA) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism, the 2017 ATA guidelines for the management of peripartum GD, the 2022 ETA guidelines and the 2016 Japanese guidelines for the management of paediatric GD. However, apart from a 2011 guidelines on management of Indian patients with thyroid nodules, guidelines specific to management of patients with thyroid disorders in the South Asian region including the Indian subcontinent have not been published.

Studies exploring ethnic differences in autoimmune disorders in general and autoimmune thyroid disorders in particular have unearthed a higher risk and an earlier age of onset of these conditions among South Asians. Thus, the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of autoimmune disorders such as GD are better informed by regional guidelines. Further, considering the improved knowledge in the role of TRAbs in GD and the availability of reliable laboratory tests to measure TRAbs, the need was felt to develop a dedicated recommendation exploring the role of TRAbs in the diagnosis, prognosis, and risk prediction, and management of GD.

Thyroid autoimmunity may result from the formation of autoantibodies that target different thyroid antigens, including thyroglobulin (TG), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), or more importantly, TSH receptor. All antibodies targeting TSH receptor are called by the blanket term TSH Receptor Antibodies (TRAbs). It has been possible to identify three distinct subtypes of TRAbs by means of cell binding assays, based on their overall impact on the TSH receptor: these are Thyroid stimulating antibodies (TSAbs), Thyroid blocking antibodies (TBAbs), and neutral (or 'cleavage') antibodies, which stimulate, block, and do not significantly affect, the functioning of the TSH receptor, respectively, as summarised in Table 1. The pathophysiology of autoimmune GD is essentially associated with the persistent and unregulated stimulation of the TSH receptor by TSABs, leading to thyrotoxicosis in the backdrop of low TSH levels.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaThyroid disease [^115rhQZQ]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are a wide variety of diseases that affect the thyroid gland ranging from hyperplastic to neoplastic, autoimmune, or inflammatory. They can present with functional abnormality or a palpable structural change. Imaging has a key role in diagnosing and characterizing the thyroid finding for management. Imaging is also essential in the management of thyroid cancer. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^1178EczP]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The development of this document was conceived by a panel of South Asian endocrinologists with minimum 10 years of experience managing patients with thyroid disorders. The members consenting to be a part of the expert panel communicated with each other informally through virtual social groups almost continuously, and formally through minuted virtual meetings three times: once before the drafting the best practice points, once to discuss, deliberate, vote, and finalise the best practice points, and once to finalise the manuscript.

The best practice points were based on a targeted literature search in PubMed directed by headings that were decided by the expert panel. Each best practice point was supported by evidence from literature, and was accompanied by the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system was used to first categorise the quality of evidence into high, moderate, low, and very low quality, and based on this, the strength of recommendation was judged to be either "strong" and "weak/ conditional/ discretionary".

After the best practice points were drafted, each point was individually discussed by the expert panel; following a detailed deliberation and review of evidence, a voting was held by the members. The outcome of this voting in terms of consensus achieved was displayed along with the quality of evidence and strength of evidence. This enables the reader to take informed decision pertaining to the adoption of the guidance in routine practice.

American Thyroid Association pregnancy thyroid disease guideline — diagnostic interventions recommendation strength specifies that a strong recommendation with high- or moderate-quality evidence implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances without reservation, while with low-quality evidence it implies the test can be offered to most patients in most applicable circumstances, but the utilization of the test may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available. For a weak recommendation, with high-quality evidence the degree to which the diagnostic test is seriously considered may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values, with moderate-quality evidence it may differ depending on individual patients'/ practice circumstances or patients' or societal values, and with low-quality evidence alternative options may be equally reasonable. An insufficient rating notes evidence may be of such poor quality, conflicting, lacking (i.e., studies not done), or not externally generalizable to the target clinical population such that the estimate of the true effect of the test is uncertain and does not permit a reasonable conclusion to be made, concluding insufficient evidence exists to recommend for or against routinely offering the diagnostic test.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112AZiH6]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism — biochemical evaluation states that serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity and specificity of any single blood test in suspected hyperthyroidism and should be used as an initial screening test; when hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected, diagnostic accuracy improves when both a serum TSH and free T4 are assessed at the initial evaluation. The relationship between free T4 and TSH is an inverse log-linear relationship, so small changes in free T4 result in large changes in serum TSH, and serum TSH levels are considerably more sensitive than direct thyroid hormone measurements for assessing excess. In overt hyperthyroidism, both serum free T4 and T3 estimates are usually elevated and serum TSH is undetectable, whereas in milder hyperthyroidism serum T4 and free T4 can be normal, only serum T3 may be elevated, and serum TSH will be < 0.01 mU/L (or undetectable), a pattern called "T3-toxicosis"; assays for estimating free T3 are less widely validated than those for free T4, so measurement of total T3 is frequently preferred in clinical practice.

Presently there are a sufficient number of sensitive and specific tests of thyroid function to establish a diagnosis of thyroid disease with a high degree of precision. A variety of clinical situations, however, including but not limited to thyroid hormone resistance states, alterations in thyroid-binding proteins and nonthyroidal illness, challenge the clinician to evaluate the thyroid status of the patient beyond that which can be done with routine laboratory tests. This article reviews several clinical, cardiac, skeletal muscle, and other laboratory studies that have been suggested to complement the overall assessment of thyroid status.

### Thyroid disorders in subfertility and early pregnancy [^114kiJc3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Disorders of thyroid function are common in pregnancy and have implications for foetal and maternal health. Thyroid autoimmunity, as evidenced by the presence of elevated levels of anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-TPO and anti-Tg antibodies) is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, though the mechanism remains poorly understood. There has been considerable focus on the implications and optimal management of pregnant women with thyroid disease, especially those undergoing assisted reproduction. Pregnancy results in significant changes in thyroid physiology and these need to be understood by clinicians involved in the care of pregnant women. Guidelines for the use of thyroxine and target thyroid function tests have been produced by international bodies but it is recognised that these predominantly reflect expert opinion rather than established evidence-based practice. Importantly a number of key clinical trials have been performed to aid understanding, particularly of the consequences of hypothyroidism for mother and baby, and the effectiveness of thyroid hormone use in autoimmune and subclinical hypothyroidism. This review summarises the current knowledge base and guidance for practice relating to thyroid disorders in pregnancy and subfertility.

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### Thyroid physiology and thyroid function testing [^113ToMYA]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The art and science of medicine has changed so much in the last 40 years, not only in the manner that physicians treat medical diseases but also in how they diagnose them. Technological advances have made it possible to have a test for almost anything. These technological advances, however, are important contributing factors to the rising cost of healthcare. More than ever, cost containment is an important element in all aspects of patient care. Minimizing costly diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests is essential in keeping healthcare costs reasonable but these tests should not be excluded at the risk of compromising patient care. For patients with thyroid disorders, the multiplicity of tests available do not make diagnoses more accurate or treatment more effective. A single test, the sensitive thyrotropin assay, most eloquently allows an organized, streamlined approach to the diagnoses and management of patients with thyroid disease. Even the most technologically advanced tests that are available cannot replace the clinical skills of the physician. Clinical acumen combined with the judicious use of diagnostic testing is one of the most important elements in diagnosing and treating a patient.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^115ChhYp]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association — diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy (Recommendation 78) states that diagnosis should be made using serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values with either total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) using adjusted reference ranges or free T4 and total T3 with trimester-specific normal reference ranges; this is a Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. If trimester-specific ranges are unavailable, consideration should be given to utilizing total T4 and T3 levels and multiply the nonpregnancy reference range by 1.5 after week 16.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^113cT9y7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by activation of the TSH receptor by stimulatory autoantibodies (TSH Receptor Antibodies, or TRAbs), leading to unregulated thyroid hormone production. Diagnosis is largely based on the typical clinical picture and laboratory thyroid panel. Establishment of elevated serum levels of TRAbs by competitive binding assay or cell-binding assay has its unique role in diagnosis and management of GD, especially in the differential diagnosis, therapy selection, prognostication, evaluation of thyroid function during pregnancy, peri-conceptional and neonatal thyroid workup, and in certain special situation. Inclusion of TRAbs in GD diagnostic algorithm can improve cost-effectiveness of GD management. The current best practice guidelines were developed to provide evidence-based recommendations in the use of TRABs in GD management for healthcare providers in South Asia. A panel of endocrinologists with minimum 10 years of clinical experience in thyroid disorders reviewed existing literature and their quality, and after deliberation and discussion, developed 21 recommendations surrounding the best practices surrounding the role of TRAbs in GD management.

### Thinking through testing for primary thyroid disease… [^114xt31k]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Discordant test results between thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine or triiodothyronine levels can lead to unnecessary follow-up, patient anxiety, and increased health care costs without clinical benefit. The US Preventive Services Task Force states that there is insufficient evidence for screening asymptomatic, nonpregnant adults for thyroid disease. 7 Given the risks of unnecessary treatment and overtreatment, it is critical to use a patient-centered approach. When should thyroid function tests be performed, and when should they be avoided. For patients with symptoms of thyroid disease, and when there is clinical suspicion for thyroid disease, testing for TSH levels is preferred initially. 1, 2 If TSH levels are elevated, free T 4 levels should be obtained.

1 If TSH levels are below normal limits, free T 4 and total T 3 levels should be obtained for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.
2. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined by suppressed TSH and normal free T 4 levels. TSH should be retested in 3 to 6 months to confirm subclinical hyperthyroidism before starting treatment. If a patient is at high risk of complications from untreated subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH and free T 4 should be retested within 2 to 6 weeks. 9 Because hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and decreased bone mineral density, the American Thyroid Association recommends treating subclinical hyperthyroidism if TSH levels are less than 0. 1 mIU/L in two groups: adults 65 years and older and adults younger than 65 years who have heart disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic hyperthyroidism. 2, 9.

Clinicians should follow a guideline-based approach for the evaluation of thyroid disease. Routinely performing full thyroid panels should be avoided. Testing for TSH levels should be performed initially, with reflex testing when indicated. Screening should be avoided in asymptomatic patients. When treating primary thyroid disease, TSH levels should be used to guide dosing. By reassessing how we approach thyroid function testing, we can reduce overtreatment, minimize unnecessary health care costs, and improve patient outcomes.

### 2017 guidelines of the American Thyroid Association for the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease during pregnancy and the postpartum [^117RSRDa]. Thyroid (2017). Medium credibility.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction before or during pregnancy: Whether to universally screen for thyroid disease either before or during pregnancy remains controversial. Untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes. However, overt thyroid dysfunction is less common than subclinical dysfunction and is frequently identified by clinical assessment at the time of presentation. Thus, the most notable impact of a universal screening mandate for thyroid dysfunction would be the identification of the large proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (mild elevations in serum TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels).
