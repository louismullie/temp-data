## Question

What does nursing need to educate patients on if the patient is taking iron for the first time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what nursing needs to educate patients on if the patient is taking iron for the first time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core education domains that directly affect safety, adherence, and efficacy. Then, I should verify dosing, timing, and absorption strategies, including vitamin C and alternate-day approaches. Next, I will review side effects, tolerability, and what to do if they occur. After that, I need to check drug–food and drug–drug interactions and how to separate them. I will then consider special populations and when to escalate to IV iron. Finally, I should confirm follow-up labs, red flags, and practical adherence tools, and I will double-check any points that seem uncertain before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core education domains that must be covered: indication and goals of therapy, correct dosing and administration, absorption optimization, side effect anticipation and management, interaction avoidance, adherence strategies, and follow-up monitoring with clear stop criteria. These align with contemporary guidance emphasizing patient-centered counseling to improve tolerance and response to oral iron therapy [^73dba1e6] [^9dd8c36d].

> I need to verify the indication and set expectations. Iron is being used to treat iron deficiency anemia, with the goal of restoring hemoglobin and replenishing iron stores; in pregnancy, treating IDA reduces risks such as low birth weight and preterm delivery, which underscores the importance of adherence and follow-up [^a923787e] [^9dd8c36d].

> Next, I should review dosing and formulation. Wait, let me verify the elemental iron content so I don't misstate it: ferrous sulfate 325 mg contains about 65 mg elemental iron, so a common regimen is 325 mg once daily, not three times daily, unless a clinician specifically orders otherwise; many patients do not require or tolerate higher daily totals, and once-daily or alternate-day dosing can improve tolerability with similar or equal absorption in some studies, so I should emphasize starting low and titrating to effect and tolerance [^73dba1e6] [^a00ffb6f] [^cc261f64].

> I will now examine administration timing and absorption. Absorption is best on an empty stomach, 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals, but if gastrointestinal upset occurs, taking with a small amount of food or at bedtime can improve tolerability at the cost of some absorption; vitamin C can enhance absorption, so taking iron with 500 mg ascorbic acid or a vitamin C–rich food can help, especially if taken with meals or if calcium/fiber are present; importantly, tea and coffee inhibit absorption and should be avoided for about an hour after dosing, and alternate-day dosing may mitigate hepcidin-mediated inhibition and improve tolerance, though evidence is evolving and should be individualized [^73dba1e6] [^2bcd92de] [^a00ffb6f].

> Hold on, I should verify side effects and mitigation. Common adverse effects include constipation, diarrhea, and nausea, with pooled estimates around 12%, 8%, and 11% respectively; strategies include dose reduction, switching formulations, taking with minimal food, or using alternate-day dosing; dark stools are expected and harmless, but patients should report severe gastrointestinal pain, vomiting, or black tarry stools that could signal bleeding; if side effects persist, consider IV iron rather than forcing oral therapy [^2bcd92de] [^73dba1e6] [^e894aa8b].

> I need to ensure we cover interactions carefully. Calcium, dairy products, and fiber can bind iron and reduce absorption, so separate them by at least 2 hours; proton pump inhibitors and antacids impair absorption, so if unavoidable, consider alternate-day dosing or IV iron; I initially thought PPIs must always be stopped, but wait, I should correct that — stopping PPIs is not always feasible, so separation strategies and route modification are reasonable alternatives rather than categorical cessation [^73dba1e6] [^2bcd92de] [^66ca1a28].

> Let me consider special populations and escalation triggers. In pregnancy, oral iron is first-line and is often paired with prenatal vitamins; if oral iron fails or is not tolerated, IV iron is appropriate, particularly when approaching term or with severe anemia; in older adults, low-dose or alternate-day regimens improve tolerability; in IBD or post-bariatric surgery, IV iron is often preferred due to malabsorption or active inflammation; in CKD, IV iron is commonly used when oral iron is ineffective or not tolerated, with first-dose monitoring for reactions [^a923787e] [^ce94c7db] [^cc261f64] [^cdb68180] [^73dba1e6] [^e1f6e4ec].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring. A practical approach is to recheck hemoglobin in about 4 weeks to assess response; in pregnancy, some guidelines suggest a 2-week check to ensure early correction; if there is inadequate hemoglobin rise, reassess adherence, absorption, and ongoing blood loss before switching routes; once anemia resolves, continue iron for about 3 months to replete stores, then monitor periodically for recurrence, as IDA can recur in a minority on long-term follow-up [^9dd8c36d] [^56214296] [^21b693f7].

> I should double-check red flags and when to seek urgent care. Patients should stop iron and contact a clinician promptly for severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or black tarry stools; for suspected iron overdose with severe symptoms; and for any signs of allergic reaction such as rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing, which are rare but require immediate attention [^notfound].

> Let me think about adherence tools and practical counseling. Using a pill organizer, setting phone reminders, and pairing dosing with a consistent daily routine can improve adherence; explaining that dark stools are expected and harmless reduces anxiety; providing written instructions and teach-back improves retention, especially for patients with lower health literacy; in pregnancy, integrating education with prenatal visits and addressing side effects proactively improves persistence [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the patient asks about brand or formulation differences. I should confirm that ferrous sulfate is generally preferred for cost-effectiveness, and no oral formulation has clear superiority over others; if one formulation causes intolerance, switching to a different ferrous salt or using a liquid or chewable form may help, and alternate-day dosing can be trialed before abandoning oral therapy [^6d6f8ec1] [^73dba1e6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the patient receives a concise, actionable package: take the prescribed elemental iron dose once daily or every other day if needed, preferentially on an empty stomach with vitamin C or a vitamin C–rich food, avoid tea/coffee for an hour, separate calcium/dairy/fiber and PPIs/antacids by at least 2 hours, anticipate and manage mild GI effects, know the red flags, and return for labs in about 4 weeks to verify response and adjust therapy; this approach balances absorption, tolerability, and safety and is consistent with current expert guidance [^73dba1e6] [^2bcd92de] [^9dd8c36d].

When starting iron for the first time, patients need clear education on **dosing and timing** (take once daily or every other day on an empty stomach with water; if GI upset occurs, take with a small amount of food or at bedtime) [^a00ffb6f] [^2bcd92de], **absorption enhancers** (vitamin C can improve absorption; avoid tea, coffee, calcium, dairy, and antacids within 1–2 hours) [^96c8ca2d] [^2bcd92de], and **expected side effects** (dark stools, mild GI upset; report severe pain, vomiting, or allergic reactions) [^2bcd92de]. Emphasize adherence, storage away from children, and follow-up labs in 4–6 weeks to check hemoglobin and ferritin; if no response in 4 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss [^9dd8c36d] [^66ca1a28].

---

## Indication and purpose of iron therapy

Explain that iron is used to treat **iron deficiency anemia**, which causes fatigue, weakness, and pallor, and that therapy aims to restore iron stores and normalize hemoglobin [^9dd8c36d].

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Standard dosing**: 325 mg ferrous sulfate once daily or every other day (65 mg elemental iron per tablet) [^a00ffb6f] [^73dba1e6].
- **Timing**: Take on an empty stomach 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals with water; if GI upset occurs, take with a small amount of food or at bedtime [^2bcd92de] [^cc261f64].
- **Alternate-day dosing**: May improve absorption and tolerability in some patients [^a00ffb6f] [^2bcd92de].

---

## Enhancing absorption

- **Vitamin C**: Co-administration can improve absorption; consider 500 mg with iron [^96c8ca2d] [^2bcd92de].
- **Avoid inhibitors**: Tea, coffee, calcium, dairy, and antacids within 1–2 hours of iron [^2bcd92de] [^66ca1a28].
- **Food interactions**: High-fiber foods and phytates can reduce absorption; separate if possible [^66ca1a28].

---

## Expected side effects and management

Common side effects include **dark stools** (harmless), mild gastrointestinal upset (nausea, constipation, diarrhea), and metallic taste [^2bcd92de]. Management strategies include taking iron with a small amount of food, using a lower dose, or switching formulations; report severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or allergic reactions promptly [^2bcd92de].

---

## Adherence and follow-up

Emphasize the importance of **consistent use** and adherence to the prescribed regimen. Arrange follow-up in 4–6 weeks to check hemoglobin and ferritin; if there is no response in 4 weeks, reassess adherence, absorption, or ongoing blood loss [^9dd8c36d] [^66ca1a28].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Iron is safe and recommended; monitor for constipation and GI upset [^a923787e].
- **Pediatrics**: Liquid formulations are preferred; monitor growth and development [^notfound].
- **Elderly**: Lower doses may improve tolerability; monitor for GI side effects [^cc261f64].

### Deferiprone-induced agranulocytosis: 20 years of clinical observations [^41e31253]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Patients who experience deferiprone‐induced agranulocytosis are at increased risk of its recurrence on rechallenge, and the second episode is generally more severe 15, 29, 35. Nonetheless, rechallenge might be considered for those patients at risk of death due to iron toxicity and for whom therapy with other chelators has been shown to be ineffective, inadequate, or too toxic.

Fifteen episodes of agranulocytosis with fatal outcome have been reported since 1999, the majority of which show evidence of deficiencies in patient management. The implementation in 2006 of an educational program for health care professionals and patients in Europe was followed by a decline in fatal cases of deferiprone‐related agranulocytosis, suggesting that education may be an important contributor to minimizing risk.

Weekly ANC monitoring in patients treated with deferiprone is a demanding expectation, and may deter some from initiating therapy. While weekly monitoring may seem prudent, this analysis and another study 10 do not support its value in intervening in the occurrence of agranulocytosis or the severity of its consequences. The data evaluated here suggest that most cases of neutropenia do not progress to agranulocytosis, and that the development of agranulocytosis is frequently precipitous and not the outcome of a slow decline in neutrophil count. A normal routine ANC count thus may provide false security, as it does not preclude agranulocytosis occurring shortly afterwards 4. These observations underline the desirability of identifying a better approach to the minimization of the risks associated with agranulocytosis.

In that regard, the panel recommends that patient education should focus on stopping deferiprone therapy at first symptoms of a fever, and that measurement of ANC be conducted within 24 hr. In addition, we support that until novel predictive tools are available, weekly ANC monitoring, despite its shortcomings in terms of detecting an emerging episode of agranulocytosis, be maintained during the first year, but that ANC monitoring thereafter occurs at the time of blood transfusions (typically, every 2–4 weeks).

Our evaluation confirms that patients who experience agranulocytosis must cease taking deferiprone. The need to discontinue therapy at manifestation of mild to moderate neutropenia is less clear. Continuation of therapy may be reasonable in patients at high risk of iron toxicity if there are no signs of infection and the ANC can be monitored as frequently as needed. In other patients, deferiprone therapy might be temporarily suspended, and recommenced if considered appropriate on resolution of the neutropenia.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions — strength of recommendation: For Strong recommendations, most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, and most individuals should receive the recommended course of action, with formal decision aids not likely to be needed. For Conditional recommendations, the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not, and different choices will be appropriate for different patients; decision aids may be useful in helping individuals in making decisions consistent with their values and preferences, and clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working towards a decision.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^8157aa96]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### Deferiprone-induced agranulocytosis: 20 years of clinical observations [^a22afb6c]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Use of the iron chelator deferiprone for treatment of iron overload in thalassemia patients is associated with concerns over agranulocytosis, which requires weekly absolute neutrophil counts (ANC). Here, we analyze all episodes of agranulocytosis (n = 161) and neutropenia (n = 250) during deferiprone use in clinical trials (CT) and postmarketing surveillance programs (PMSP). Rates of agranulocytosis and neutropenia in CT were 1.5% and 5.5%, respectively. Of the agranulocytosis cases, 61% occurred during the first 6 months of therapy and 78% during the first year. These events appeared to be independent of dose, and occurred three times more often in females than males. Their duration was not significantly shortened by use of G-CSF. No patient with baseline neutropenia (n = 12) developed agranulocytosis during treatment, which raises questions about the validity of prior neutropenia as a contraindication to use. Only 1/7 novel neutropenia cases in CT progressed to agranulocytosis with continued treatment, indicating that neutropenia does not necessarily lead to agranulocytosis. The agranulocytosis fatality rate was 0% in CT and 15/143 (11%) in PMSP. Rechallenge with deferiprone produced agranulocytosis in 75% of patients in whom the event had already occurred, and in 10% with previous neutropenia. Weekly ANC monitoring allows early detection and interruption of therapy, but does not prevent agranulocytosis from occurring. Its relevance appears to decrease after the first year of therapy, when agranulocytosis occurs less often. Based upon analysis of data collected over the past 20 years, it appears that patient education may be the key to minimizing agranulocytosis-associated risks during deferiprone therapy. Am. J.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^cc261f64]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of IDA

Management of IDA in older adults includes iron supplementation and addressing the cause of IDA. Repletion of iron using oral iron formulations, typically containing 50 to 65 mg of elemental iron, can be challenging for many older adults because of side effects such as constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping.

A misconception exists that high-dose oral iron, 3 times a day, represents the best way to treat IDA. The absorption of oral iron is optimal when it is taken on an empty stomach (1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal). Alternate day dosing of oral iron also allows better absorption because there is an acute rise in hepcidin for 24 hours after oral iron is ingested. For management of IDA in older adults, 1 study found equivalent hemoglobin response and iron repletion, but with less toxicity, with once daily iron at 15 mg compared with 50 mg or 150 mg of iron daily. Consequently, in patients who do not tolerate formulations with > 50 mg of elemental iron, a switch to low-dose iron formulations should be considered.

IV iron is recommended for patients who have an intolerance or inadequate response to oral iron or malabsorption conditions such as history of gastric bypass. Numerous IV iron formulations exist. Iron replacement has been previously reviewed. From a practical perspective, institutions may have preferred IV iron formulations.

The patient in case 2 was treated with 1 dose of IV low–molecular weight dextran 1000 mg. Her walking endurance improved, and she achieved a normal hemoglobin level. She continued oral ferrous sulfate every other day because of an ongoing need for aspirin for secondary prevention of CAD. We concluded that the patient had occult gastrointestinal bleeding from either gastritis or an occult source. Small-bowel interrogation is a consideration now or in the future. We recommended at least annual monitoring for development of new symptoms or recurrence of IDA.

Case 2 educational points

In older adults with IDA, it is important to determine the cause of iron deficiency and review how the patient is taking oral iron and adherence to iron supplementation and side effects. Counsel patients on methods of taking iron that will promote optimal absorption, such as alternate day dosing and taking it on an empty stomach. IV iron is generally safe for older adults and should be used in patients who are unable to tolerate, or respond inadequately to, oral iron supplementation.

Search methods

The following electronic databases were searched through 30 November 2020: PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS and EMBASE using a pre-specified search strategy (online supplemental appendix A). Secondary reference searching was conducted on all studies included in the review, as well as on relevant reviews identified through the search. Further, selected experts in the field, including the corresponding authors of articles selected for full-text review, were contacted to identify additional articles not identified through other search methods. We also searched for ongoing randomised controlled trials through ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. In addition, the Cochrane Library was consulted for the articles cited in its reviews that may be included in our main review. Finally, we conducted a hand-search of hits from key search terms entered into Google's search engine.

Titles and abstracts identified through the search strategy were screened to identify articles for full-text review using Covidence. Full-text articles were obtained for selected references and independently reviewed by two reviewers to determine final study inclusion. Differences were resolved through consensus with a third reviewer.

Data extraction and management

We planned for two reviewers to independently extract data from included studies using standardised data extraction forms. The standardised data extraction form included information about study identification (author, year of publication), study description (objective, location, description of supplements, description of self-management and the intervention, description of the comparison group, study design, sample size, follow-up) and study outcomes (outcome measures, effect size, confidence levels; values and preferences data; cost-related data; conclusion and limitations).

We planned to assess risk of bias for randomised trials using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. For non-randomised trials but comparative studies, we planned to assess study rigour using the Evidence Project 8-item checklist for intervention evaluations.

Data analysis

We developed an analysis plan based on coding categories and outcomes. Where multiple studies reported the same outcome, we planned to conduct meta-analysis using random-effects models to combine risk ratios with the program Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA). We planned subgroup stratifications by IFA dosage, forms of self-management, points of access, population vulnerabilities, country economic classification and literacy/education level.

Patient and public involvement

Patients and the public were not involved in this review, but they are involved in a global survey of values and preferences being conducted to inform the WHO normative guidance on self-care interventions.

### Interventions for improving adherence to iron chelation therapy in people with sickle cell disease or thalassaemia [^fbfbcb29]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Regularly transfused people with sickle cell disease (SCD) and people with thalassaemia are at risk of iron overload. Iron overload can lead to iron toxicity in vulnerable organs such as the heart, liver and endocrine glands, which can be prevented and treated with iron-chelating agents. The intensive demands and uncomfortable side effects of therapy can have a negative impact on daily activities and wellbeing, which may affect adherence.

Objectives

To identify and assess the effectiveness of different types of interventions (psychological and psychosocial, educational, medication interventions, or multi-component interventions) and interventions specific to different age groups, to improve adherence to iron chelation therapy compared to another listed intervention, or standard care in people with SCD or thalassaemia.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations & Global Theses, Web of Science & Social Sciences Conference Proceedings Indexes and ongoing trial databases (13 December 2021). We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register (1 August 2022).

Selection Criteria

For trials comparing medications or medication changes, only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion. For studies including psychological and psychosocial interventions, educational interventions, or multi-component interventions, non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies with adherence as a primary outcome were also eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

For this update, two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs and one NRSI published between 1997 and 2021. One trial assessed medication management, one assessed an education intervention (NRSI) and 18 RCTs were of medication interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral chelating agents, deferiprone and deferasirox. We rated the certainty of evidence as very low to low across all outcomes identified in this review. Four trials measured quality of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data and reported no difference in QoL. We identified nine comparisons of interest. 1. Deferiprone versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferiprone affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (four RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.21; 3 RCTs, 376 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.46; 1 RCT, 228 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adherence was reported as "good", "high" or "excellent" by all seven trials, though the data could not be analysed formally: adherence ranged from 69% to 95% (deferiprone, mean 86.6%), and 71% to 93% (deferoxamine, mean 78.8%), based on five trials (474 participants) only. 2. Deferasirox versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferasirox affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (three RCTs, unpooled, very low-certainty evidence), although medication adherence was high in all trials. We are uncertain whether or not there is any difference between the drug therapies in serious adverse events (SAEs) (SCD or thalassaemia) or all-cause mortality (thalassaemia). 3. Deferiprone versus deferasirox We are uncertain if there is a difference between oral deferiprone and deferasirox based on a single trial in children (average age 9 to 10 years) with any hereditary haemoglobinopathy in adherence, SAEs and all-cause mortality. 4. Deferasirox film-coated tablet (FCT) versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) One RCT compared deferasirox in different tablet forms. There may be a preference for FCTs, shown through a trend for greater adherence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 88 participants), although medication adherence was high in both groups (FCT 92.9%; DT 85.3%). We are uncertain if there is a benefit in chelation-related AEs with FCTs. We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs, all-cause mortality or sustained adherence. 5. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence, though reporting was usually narrative as triallists report it was "excellent" in both groups (three RCTs, unpooled). We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs and all-cause mortality. 6. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferoxamine alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence (four RCTs), SAEs (none reported in the trial period) and all-cause mortality (no deaths reported in the trial period). There was high adherence in all trials. 7. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone and deferasirox combined There may be a difference in favour of deferiprone and deferasirox (combined) in rates of adherence (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99) (one RCT), although it was high (> 80%) in both groups. We are uncertain if there is a difference in SAEs, and no deaths were reported in the trial, so we cannot draw conclusions based on these data (one RCT). 8. Medication management versus standard care We are uncertain if there is a difference in QoL (one RCT), and we could not assess adherence due to a lack of reporting in the control group. 9. Education versus standard care One quasi-experimental (NRSI) study could not be analysed due to the severe baseline confounding.

Authors' Conclusions

The medication comparisons included in this review had higher than average adherence rates not accounted for by differences in medication administration or side effects, though often follow-up was not good (high dropout over longer trials), with adherence based on a per protocol analysis. Participants may have been selected based on higher adherence to trial medications at baseline. Also, within the clinical trial context, there is increased attention and involvement of clinicians, thus high adherence rates may be an artefact of trial participation. Real-world, pragmatic trials in community and clinic settings are needed that examine both confirmed or unconfirmed adherence strategies that may increase adherence to iron chelation therapy. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on intervention strategies for different age groups.

Cautions regarding IV iron — first‑dose monitoring and adverse reactions: When the initial dose of IV non‑dextran iron is administered, we suggest (2C) monitoring patients for 60 minutes after infusion and ensuring resuscitative facilities and trained personnel are available. IV iron can cause serious immediate reactions, with an estimated reaction rate of 0.6–0.7% of patients treated. In the United States, FDA‑mandated labeling for ferumoxytol specifies observation for 60 minutes after administration.

### Nurse-led approach to standardising the management of iron-deficiency anaemia, achieving the 2-week cancer pathway targets and reducing hospital admissions: practicalities and learnings from a success story [^b48efbeb]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron replacement therapy

IRT has been found to be suboptimal, incomplete and even neglected as an essential component in the management of IDA across all specialties. IRT, with the aim of replenishing iron stores and normalising haemoglobin level, should be given in parallel with investigation of the causative factor. IRT aims to improve the many symptoms of IDA which can include shortness of breath on exertion, tiredness, lethargy, headache, palpitations and chest pain, all of which can impact quality of life, morbidity and prognosis in chronic conditions.

The route of iron replacement is guided by the underlying cause of the IDA. Initial management of IDA should be with oral iron once daily, (eg, ferrous sulfate 200 mg tablets)and patient advice about an iron rich diet (eg, red meat, leafy green vegetables, liver, salmon). If IRT has not been started at referral, supplementation is recommended to the GP in the initial clinic consultation letter. The route of administration is changed to parenteral administration if the patient is intolerant or non-compliant with oral iron, or if they have had previous surgery that would prevent absorption of iron from the GI tract such as bariatric surgery or small bowel resection. In addition, patients with a GI cancer proven at investigation are treated with intravenous iron, in preparation for surgical management, as it is reported that preoperative IDA treated before surgery, leads to reduced blood transfusion, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and reduced hospital costs. Intravenous iron is requested electronically at the time of clinic assessment or if investigations identify a malignancy, with the first dose given on the medical day ward within 7 days.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^03d50a9e]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO iron status evaluation during ESA therapy — recommendations and rationale: Evaluate iron status (TSAT and ferritin) at least every 3 months during ESA therapy, including the decision to start or continue iron therapy (Not Graded), and test more frequently when initiating or increasing ESA dose, when there is blood loss, when monitoring response after a course of IV iron, and when iron stores may become depleted (Not Graded). The rationale states that in patients on ESA therapy, ferritin and TSAT should be measured at least every 3 months; falling TSAT and/or ferritin likely reflect ongoing blood loss or consumption of iron stores and can be used to anticipate the need for future or additional iron supplementation; and in patients on oral iron, testing can assess adherence. Increasing TSAT and/or ferritin may indicate excessive treatment that can be stopped or reduced, whereas increasing ferritin with stable or declining TSAT may indicate inflammation, infection, or other clinical situations requiring reassessment of continued iron administration; more frequent testing may be appropriate following initiation of ESA or iron therapy or when ESA dose or dose frequency is increased, and iron status testing is important in assessing patients who become less responsive to ESA treatment.

### Managing iron overload in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with oral deferasirox therapy [^0e069d22]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) often require chronic RBC transfusions, which can lead to iron overload. Without adequate management, this may cause progressive damage to hepatic, endocrine, and cardiac organs, significantly affecting overall survival. Recent retrospective analyses have suggested that iron chelation provides a survival advantage in iron-overloaded patients with MDS who are given chelation therapy compared with those who are not. Nonetheless, it is evident that iron overload in many patients with MDS is not adequately managed. Clinical evaluation of the once-daily, oral iron chelator deferasirox in MDS populations has indicated that it provides dose-dependent reductions in body iron burden and is generally well tolerated, with a manageable safety profile in adult and pediatric patients. The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) included transient, mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rash, which rarely required drug discontinuation and resolved spontaneously in most cases. Adequate management of AEs and practical approaches such as patient education and counseling are necessary to ensure that patients remain compliant with therapy. Regular monitoring of serum ferritin levels is key to identifying patients who require iron chelation therapy, and to ensure maintenance of iron levels below the critical level of 1,000 microg/l. The flexible dosing regimen of deferasirox allows dose adjustments to be made in response to trends in serum ferritin, to changes in a patient's transfusional iron intake, and to the objectives of treatment, allowing the full benefit of transfusion therapy without the risks associated with iron overload.

### Self-management of iron and folic acid supplementation during pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and postnatal periods: a systematic review [^aef8b7d4]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Our review has several strengths. We searched multiple databases, considered both non-randomised/comparative observational and randomised studies for inclusion, and did not exclude studies by language of publication or geographical location. In addition, we took extra measures in our search strategy, including contacting study authors and reviewing grey literature, to increase comprehensiveness and ensure that any and all existing evidence was likely to be found. Furthermore, this review explores a novel question expanding on the work being conducted by WHO to develop further normative guidance around self-care interventions with known effectiveness and safety.

However, our search failed to yield any studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Due to the variation by context in IFA supplement acquisition (OTC vs prescription), few settings offer the opportunity to study our research question, as we defined self-care interventions, with quantitative comparisons. However, a review of a different conceptualisation of self-care, for example, the extent to which health workers are needed to support daily adherence to supplement usage during pregnancy, could yield richer results. It should be noted that self care should never replace care provided by the health system and should instead be a bridge for users to engage with the health system.

Further research should seek to explore settings in which IFA supplements are available to pregnant women both as OTC or home-based products and provided through healthcare providers to identify values and preferences around modes of access of supplements. Research conducted to address this knowledge gap would have inherent limitations. Studies would most likely need to be observational studies, as experimental designs would not be appropriate or ethical. Studies would need to be conducted in a setting where IFA supplements are available OTC, which limits the research context to settings with a strong pharmaceutical industry and robust regulatory systems. Potential experimental intervention studies could be conducted to test the use of education or behaviour change mechanisms outside of provider service to promote self-management of IFA supplement use pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy and postnatal. Furthermore, as many pregnancies are not planned, research and programming efforts to integrate pre-pregnancy supplementation with family planning efforts could promote initiation of pre-pregnancy supplementation following the discontinuation of contraceptive use. However, prior to designing or conducting intervention trials to test the impact of self-management of IFA supplements, there is a need for a general understanding of dietary supplementation self-management behaviours, values and preferences, and cost. Given the existing challenges of poor adherence to supplementation, particularly during pregnancy, research should explore how different modes of supplement access and uptake, including self-management, may influence adherence, acceptability and cost.

Data collection

In pre-post visits, patients were asked about the time of taking LT4, meal time after taking LT4, simultaneous medication use (PPIs, multivitamins, iron preparations, etc.), taking the pill with water or other liquids (milk, tea, coffee) and daily alternative or were examined in terms of receiving a fixed dose of LT4.

Recommendations were made to the physicians about the instructions for use, dosage, other medications used by the patient, and concurrent dietary habits of the LT4 drug used by patients in IG. DRPs detected by CP in patients were presented to physicians. At the first visit, all participants received a Type III medication review, which involved a detailed review of a patient's medication regimen to identify and resolve DRPs. For context, Type I reviews focus on prescription accuracy, and Type II reviews assess the appropriateness of therapy for individual patients. Patient randomized in the IG, provided patients with education on optimizing LT4 use based on physician-approved recommendations. Regarding the patients in CG, CP did not intervene with the physicians regarding DRPs or provide patient education. Patients in CG were only observed for DRPs.

### Management of iron deficiency in children, adults, and pregnant individuals: evidence-based and expert consensus recommendations [^d26ff216]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide. Oral iron is often recommended as first-line treatment, but there is no consensus on the optimal formulation, dosing strategy, or which patients should be treated preferentially with intravenous iron. To address these challenges, the Iron Consortium at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) convened an international panel of 26 experts in haematology, primary care, paediatrics, obstetrics, gastroenterology, cancer, and patient advocacy among its members. This panel was supplemented by insights from a four-person patient focus group to develop current recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The panel developed clinically relevant questions in five priority topic areas, a systematic literature search was performed, and studies meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables for recommendation development. Evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations were made through a structured anonymous consensus voting process at an in-person meeting in Portland, OR, USA, hosted by OHSU on Feb 16–17, 2024. The expert panel made seven evidence-based recommendations for three demographic groups with iron deficiency: non-pregnant adults, pregnant individuals, and infants, children, and adolescents. Expert opinions supported the recommendations on 21 aspects of care for which there is insufficient evidence. This Review provides evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of iron deficiency, detailing best practices for oral and intravenous iron repletion across diverse patient populations.

### A European patient record study on diagnosis and treatment of chemotherapy-induced anaemia [^a55a4d78]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Use of iron therapy in survey 1 patients (FR, DE, ES, CH, UK)

In survey 1 countries, further details on iron therapy were surveyed and analysed. On average, 67% of first prescriptions were for an oral iron formulation. In the UK, oral iron even accounted for all first prescriptions. Conversely, in Switzerland, 77% of first prescriptions were for an i.v. iron formulation. At commencement of iron therapy, mean Hb, ferritin and TSAT levels were 9.2 g/dL [8.6–9.3 g/dL], 120 ng/mL [59–187 ng/mL] and 26% [15–32%], respectively. A comparison of "current" vs. "previous" iron treatment revealed that the iron administration route was rarely switched in individual patients (overall only in 6% of iron-treated patients). Most commonly (in 56% of cases where there was a change), the switch was made from oral to i.v. iron.

Reasons for iron treatment selection were analysed in the extended patient sample. "Quick onset of action" was stated as the main reason (37%) for selecting i.v. iron, whereas convenience rather than efficacy-related arguments were the main basis for using oral iron ("easy/convenient administration" (54%), "familiarity" (46%)). In 30% of cases, use of oral iron was justified by "effective when used in combination". Iron treatment was mainly initiated by medical oncologists and/or haematologists (98% of i.v. and 91% of oral iron treatments). In the UK, a notable minority of patients (17%) received oral iron prescribed by general practitioners.

Mean self-reported Hb cut-off levels, at which surveyed medical oncologists and/or haematologists would initiate any kind of anaemia treatment, were 9.6 g/dL [9.0–10.2 g/dL] for male and 9.4 g/dL [8.8–10.0 g/dL] for female patients. Mean target Hb levels were 11.1 g/dL [10.1–11.7 g/dL] and 10.9 g/dL [9.9–11.6 g/dL] for male and female patients, respectively.

### Improving the management of iron deficiency in ambulatory heart failure patients [^d9168155]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Design

When we presented our baseline data at the heart failure multidisciplinary meeting the opinion of the heart failure team was that this is an important area and that we should be more proactive in identifying and treating iron deficiency. To establish a measurable outcome it was agreed by consensus that patients who met the clinical criteria should have iron studies performed at least once every six months.

Our baseline data suggest two areas for potential improvement: 1) A large proportion of symptomatic heart failure patients were not being investigated for iron deficiency (Figure 1) and 2) Those found to be iron deficient were not being offered appropriate management advice.

Our approach to improve these findings was to increase awareness and education regarding the importance of diagnosing and methods of treating iron deficiency in heart failure.

This study was a quality improvement project and hence did not require ethical approval and it was formally registered at the Royal Brompton Hospital.

### The clinical impact of oral iron treatment for anaemia in pregnancy in accordance with current guidance: a prospective cohort study in a maternity unit in the midlands of england [^26809e5b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia is a common disorder affecting up to 30% of pregnant women. Treatment guidelines for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy exist, which if adopted, may reduce the associated risks of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. However, multiple factors may impair adherence and absorption of oral iron, limiting the success of this first-line treatment.

Methods

To document the effectiveness of national (British Society of Haematology) guidelines for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in pregnancy, with a focus on use of oral iron, we carried out a prospective cohort study. Aims were to assess the response, side effect and adherence to treatment and predictability of response using routine clinical and laboratory data. The study population consisted of pregnant women diagnosed with anaemia. Women were offered follow-up through a dedicated anaemia clinic in a secondary care maternity unit serving a multi-ethnic population in the midlands of England. First line treatment was ferrous sulphate 200 mg three time a day as recommended in earlier national guidelines. The response was assessed 2 to 4 weeks later by measuring the haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. A response was defined in 2 ways; (i) a 10 g/L increase in Hb; and (ii) a 10 g/L increase in Hb and/or gestationally adjusted threshold of the Hb. Education and advice were provided to women, with on-going follow-up at clinic appointments including an assessment of side effects. Following a response with oral iron, treatment was continued for a further 3 months when the women were again reviewed.

Results

The overall rate of haematological response to a first course of oral iron was 36.5% (10 g/L increase in Hb) and 55.2% (incorporating gestational threshold in Hb). The response rates at the completion of follow up, post-delivery, were 70.5% and 88.5% respectively. Responders to oral iron had lower median Hb at diagnosis (95 g/L) compared to non-responders (100 g/L). The responders median Hb was 113 g/l versus 103 g/L for non-responders at first follow-up and was Hb 122 g/L versus 110 g/L, respectively, at the end of the study visit 5. There is a statistically significant difference between responders and non-responders for the change in haemoglobin from baseline to visit 5 (p = 0.017). Non-responders reported more side effects than responders (95% versus 85%).

Conclusion

Oral iron treatment for IDA in pregnancy as advocated in national guidelines is challenging to deliver, even in the setting of a specialist anaemia clinic. The findings have implications for guideline recommendations and implementation, and identify research opportunities for diagnosing IDA in pregnancy, optimising the pathways of iron treatment.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^66ca1a28]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although a recent clinical trial in adults with iron deficiency anaemia showed no added benefit from ascorbic acid, this may not exclude its potential benefit in IRIDA. Moreover, reported cases showed varying outcomes with this combination therapy. Iron should be taken apart from certain foods (e.g. dairy products, fibres) and medications (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, calcium supplements, antacids), which can reduce iron availability by forming insoluble complexes. Alternate‐day dosing may reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which for iron‐deficient adult women has been described to last for approximately 24 h after iron intake.

In absolute iron deficiency anaemia, a weekly haemoglobin increase of approximately 0.8 g/dL is expected; however, in IRIDA, this haemoglobin increase in time is likely lower due to reduced iron availability. We define IRIDA non‐responders as those with less than a 1 g/dL haemoglobin increase after 4 weeks of oral therapy. As extended use appears more effective, oral supplementation should be continued for at least 3 months before considering switching to IV therapy. However, in practice, most patients diagnosed with IRIDA have already completed multiple unsuccessful attempts at oral iron supplementation. For these children, if they have been compliant with the prescribed therapy, reinitiating or extending oral therapy for 3 months is unnecessary. Instead, we recommend initiating IV iron therapy as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.

### Effect of medication therapy management services on medication-burden quality of life in hemodialysis patients [^524d6a50]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

First phase: assessment of baseline data

Baseline data were collected over a period of three months. During that period, patients continued to receive the usual medical care that was provided by the physician and nurses, in addition to simple advice that was given by the pharmacist during monthly dispensing of medications. Medication burden quality of life, DRPs, adherence and adverse effects were also assessed using the previously mentioned tools. Laboratory data were recorded from patient recorded.

To construct good relations with the study participants, the data collector, who is a certified clinical pharmacist, started to show up in the dispensing pharmacy and introduced herself to the patients during the dispensing process. She started short conversations with the patients and gave them an idea about the aim of the research. A detailed explanation of the study procedure was performed. Those who agreed to be part of this study were included in the study. Data were collected from patients at their bedsides. If the patient was unable to communicate due to fatigue of any cause or if he was not ready to communicate, this was respected and told that the data collection will be postponed until he is ready.

Second phase: intervention phase

During the second three months, MTM interventions were applied including performing a medication review, participating in the treatment plan by selecting, modifying, or administering medication therapy, evaluating the patient response to therapy, identifying, and resolving any DRPs, and providing patient education to enhance the patient understanding and adherence to the treatment plan and to encourage self-management strategies. Educational sessions were provided to patients at least monthly. The first session lasted 30 to 60 minutes while follow up sessions were 5 to 15 minutes long. During these sessions, the treatment plan was explained, as well as the indication of each medication, dose, appropriate administration route and time, and what to do if a dose was missed.

Some of the misconceptions that needed to be clarified were the proper timing of phosphate binders within meals, the purpose and indication of iron and erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) in the treatment of anemia, proper use of vitamin D derivatives, safe analgesics and proper doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when indicated. Duplicate therapy was rectified. Possible adverse effects due to medications or HD complications and their prevention were addressed. Instructions for appropriate nutrition and care of HD access were also given. Causes of poor adherence were identified and resolved.

Patients welcomed the education process and continue to consult and seek education regarding their medications and any suspected adverse event from the unit clinical pharmacists till now.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^cdb68180]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

### SAGES guideline for clinical application of laparoscopic bariatric surgery [^85d98df9]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic RGB postoperative follow-up and counseling — Close, long-term follow-up is recommended for patients after bariatric surgery, with a typical schedule at 1–3 weeks, followed by quarterly visits during the first year and annually thereafter to assess weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, long-term complications, and need for continuing education and support. Patients are counseled to eat small, frequent meals of high protein and low carbohydrate content, should take long-term vitamin supplements (multivitamins, Vitamin B12, and calcium with some patients requiring iron supplementation) and undergo periodic blood testing to identify and treat deficiencies early, and should be encouraged to develop regular exercise practices. Two retrospective studies on the impact of follow-up on outcomes after laparoscopic RGB have been done; one suggests patient follow-up does not play an important role while the other reports improved weight loss in patients compliant with follow-up at 1 year.

### Do the patient education program and nurse-led telephone follow-up improve treatment adherence in hemodialysis patients? A randomized controlled trial [^15d222d8]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Tele-nursing is becoming a new method for providing nursing care, and it has been increasingly used as an effective approach to chronic disease care. The results of this study indicated that the patient education program and nurse-led telephone follow-up could improve treatment adherence in the four dimensions of HD attendance, medication use, fluid restrictions, and diet recommendations in HD patients. Furthermore, it was found that the intervention program and the telephone follow-up made an improvement in the mean scores of laboratory values, i.e. serum potassium, calcium, creatinine, phosphate, albumin, iron, BUN, hemoglobin, nPCR, and Kt/V. Therefore, we need to make changes in terms of patient education strategies and utilize effective methods in this regard in ESRD patients. Overall, there are different factors affecting the adherence to the therapeutic regimen in patients undergoing HD. In this regard, factors such as socioeconomic status, health beliefs, patients' attitudes towards treatment, and cultural differences are notable. Adherence to dietary recommendations, fluid restrictions, and medication regimen are not easy. On the other hand, neglecting the therapeutic regimen may lead to serious consequences, so that low patient education level can cause the patients to lack knowledge about the disease process and related therapeutic regimen.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^a244ba44]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

KDIGO Chapter 2 — use of iron to treat anemia in CKD — provides the following guidance: When prescribing iron therapy, balance the potential benefits of avoiding or minimizing blood transfusions, ESA therapy, and anemia-related symptoms against the risks of harm in individual patients (Not Graded). For adult CKD patients with anemia not on iron or ESA therapy we suggest a trial of IV iron (or in CKD ND patients alternatively a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy) if (2C): an increase in Hb concentration without starting ESA treatment is desired and TSAT is ≤ 30% and ferritin is ≤ 500 ng/ml (≤ 500 μg/l). For adult CKD patients with anemia not receiving iron supplementation, we suggest a trial of IV iron (or in CKD ND patients alternatively a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy) if (2C): an increase in Hb concentration or a decrease in ESA dose is desired and TSAT is ≤ 30% and ferritin is ≤ 500 ng/ml (≤ 500 μg/l). For CKD ND patients who require iron supplementation, select the route of iron administration based on the severity of iron deficiency, availability of venous access, response to prior oral iron therapy, side effects with prior oral or IV iron therapy, patient compliance, and cost (Not Graded). Guide subsequent iron administration in CKD patients based on Hb responses to recent iron therapy, ongoing blood losses, iron status tests (TSAT and ferritin), Hb concentration, ESA responsiveness and ESA dose in ESA treated patients, trends in each parameter, and the patient's clinical status (Not Graded).

### Results communication and patient education after screening for possible hemochromatosis and iron overload: experience from the HEIRS study of a large ethnically and linguistically diverse group [^a5272a88]. Genetics in Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We assessed the effectiveness of educational interventions for conveying clinical findings and information about hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and iron overload (IO) to individuals evaluated clinically after initial screening for HH/IO with serum ferritin (SF) concentration, transferrin saturation (TS), and HFE genotyping.

Methods

A questionnaire mailed to 2300 cases and controls 1 month after a letter summarizing clinical findings measured understanding of results and recommendations, knowledge of HH/IO, and satisfaction with information received.

Results

Of 1622 (70.5%) participants completing relevant items, 83.6% were satisfied with receiving initial screening results by mail, 93.4% found information clear and easy to understand, 89.2% generally felt they got enough information, but 47.5% still had questions. C282Y/C282Y homozygosity with normal TS/SF predicted the best understanding of genetic results. Many with no mutations thought relatives were at risk. Iron levels created most confusion, and a third incorrectly recalled treatment recommendations. Having any abnormal result, lower education, older age, and being non-white, and/or non-English speaking predicted lower understanding.

Conclusions

Combining genotypic and phenotypic screening for HH/IO creates additional difficulties in communicating results-particularly to those with low health literacy. Explaining aberrant iron TS and SF levels and low-risk genotypes, follow-up recommendations, and risk to relatives will need creative, culturally appropriate strategies.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use)

Instruct patients and their caregivers to store FERRIPROX Oral Solution at 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C); excursions permitted to 59°F to 86°F (15°C to 30°C) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Store in the originally supplied bottle and carton to protect from light.
Advise patients to use the measuring cup provided with FERRIPROX Oral Solution to measure the volume prescribed. Instruct patients to add about 10–15 mL of water to the measuring cup and swirl it around to mix the water with any remaining medicine in the cup and drink the mixture. The measuring cup should be hand-washed with water after use.
Advise patients to take the first dose of FERRIPROX Oral Solution in the morning, the second dose at midday, and the third dose in the evening. Clinical experience suggests that taking FERRIPROX Oral Solution with meals may reduce nausea. If a dose of this medicine has been missed, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not catch-up or double doses.
Inform patients of the risks of developing agranulocytosis and the need for regular blood testing before and during their treatment to monitor for decreases in their ANC. Instruct them to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms of infection such as fever, sore throat or flu-like symptoms [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] in order to check their ANC within 24 hours. Advise them if they are unable to reach their physician, seek care from another provider so as not to delay medical care.
Inform patients of the risk of abnormal liver transaminases and the need for regular blood testing before and during their treatment to monitor for increases in ALT [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Inform patients of the risk of zinc deficiency and the need for regular blood testing before and during their treatment to monitor for reductions in zinc [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Advise patients to contact their physician in the event of overdose.
Inform patients that their urine might show a reddish/brown discoloration due to the excretion of the iron-deferiprone complex. This is a very common sign of the desired effect, and it is not harmful.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^73dba1e6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia — best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### Improving compliance with iron infusion therapy in the treatment of chronic anemia in haemodialysis patients with chronic kidney disease [^065c8975]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Lessons and limitations

Blood investigations done for patients receiving iron infusion were more regularised and were not excessive in comparison to the beginning of the project.

Nursing staff behaviour has become more independent as regards to initiation and maintenance of iron infusion for chronic anemia. This frees up valuable doctor time, while at the same time empowers nursing decision making. This also helps in improving team morale and ultimately patient safety by mitigating human factors.

Feedback from one of the PDSA cycles meant that one patient could have benefited from receiving less iron infusion as the iron stores were adequate.

The improvement cycle was repeated after two months which showed improved compliance and adherence to checklist. One hundred percent of patient episodes examined were correctly investigated and given infusions as per guideline after the third cycle.

The checklist was applied to limited number of patient episodes. We plan to roll it out to all patients in the department.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^19b526fa]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

CASE DESCRIPTIONS

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre (Figure 2). These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

FIGURE 2
Course of haemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients. The left panels display Hb levels (with CRP for case 3); the right panels show ferritin and TSAT levels. Case 1: Hb and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow up. At age 26 (6 years post‐diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of FCM via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range. Case 2: Hb and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (shown by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32‐year‐old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than during non‐pregnancy periods. Case 3: Hb, CRP and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (totalling 5800 mg FS at 200 mg/dose) was administered every 2 months, maintaining ferritin > 500 μg/L for nearly a decade, with Hb within the reference range. Diagnosis of IRIDA was made at t = 5 when she was 41 years old. Ferritin and TSAT varied widely, likely due to chronic inflammation (CRP ~25 mg/L). In the final years (following t = 15), heavy menstrual bleeding led to a Hb decline, requiring additional IV iron therapy (totalling 1700 mg FCM).

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^8271d660]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^9dd8c36d]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

Oral iron supplementation — product selection, adverse effects, and absorption strategies: Many formulations are available without substantial evidence that any one product is better than another, and ferrous salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate) are a reasonable low-cost starting choice. Side effects are common, with a meta-analysis reporting constipation in 12%, diarrhea in 8%, and nausea in 11%. Serum hepcidin rises after oral dosing and remains increased for up to 48 hours; early data suggest every-other-day dosing appears to improve tolerance but needs better study before implementation. Absorption can be enhanced by taking iron with 80 mg ascorbic acid on an empty stomach, though evidence supporting vitamin C to improve absorption is mixed and needs further clarification. Tea and coffee are powerful inhibitors and should not be consumed within an hour after taking iron. Although absorption is better on an empty stomach, some patients will better tolerate iron with meals; if feasible, taking iron with meat protein will improve absorption, and using 500 mg vitamin C will allow absorption even if calcium or fiber is present in the meal.
