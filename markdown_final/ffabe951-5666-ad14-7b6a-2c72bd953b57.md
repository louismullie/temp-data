## Question

Acute eczema in kids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing acute eczema in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical entity and severity framework. Then, I should verify first-line topical therapy choices and potency selection. Next, I will examine application frequency, duration, and safety. After that, I need to check the role of emollients and whether bath additives help. I will then review escalation strategies, including wet wraps and when to consider systemic therapy. Finally, I should confirm what to avoid, address common misconceptions, and synthesize a practical, stepwise plan with monitoring and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and severity. Acute eczema in children most often reflects an atopic dermatitis flare characterized by erythema, edema, vesiculation, weeping, and intense pruritus; severity is typically categorized as mild, moderate, or severe based on extent, intensity, and impact on sleep and quality of life, which guides potency selection and escalation decisions [^14951601] [^ace6e6d5].

> I need to verify first-line therapy. Topical corticosteroids remain first-line for acute flares, with potency matched to severity and anatomic site; for moderate disease, moderate-potency agents are appropriate, and for severe disease, potent agents are favored, while the face, intertriginous areas, and diaper region generally warrant lower potency to minimize atrophy risk [^e8ac108b] [^220a0a61] [^f20ec8c8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about frequency. I initially thought twice-daily application might be clearly superior, but wait, let me verify the evidence. High-quality syntheses show that once-daily application of potent topical corticosteroids is probably not inferior to twice-daily for short-term flare control, with moderate-certainty evidence; this supports simplifying regimens to improve adherence, though some patients with more severe flares may still prefer twice-daily initially [^89804841] [^af57e491] [^1c1781c4].

> Next, I should review duration and safety. Typical acute courses are 1 to 2 weeks, followed by taper to the lowest effective potency or transition to maintenance; across 104 trials and 8,443 participants, abnormal skin thinning occurred in about 1% and clustered with higher-potency agents, with no cases reported in weekend proactive therapy trials, supporting short, intermittent use as safe when appropriately supervised [^89804841] [^f20ec8c8].

> I will now examine emollients. Regular leave-on emollients are foundational to restore barrier function and reduce itch, and should be continued even during flares; however, I should double-check bath additives, because I recall conflicting data. The large BATHE randomized trial found no added benefit from emollient bath additives beyond standard care, so I should counsel families to prioritize leave-on emollients and soap-free cleansing rather than bath additives [^64480221] [^ace6e6d5].

> Let me consider escalation for refractory flares. Wet-wrap therapy with low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids can be used short term for moderate-to-severe acute eczema, with guidelines recommending standardized technique and education; evidence is largely pediatric and suggests modest incremental benefit over emollient-only wraps, but infections can occur and technique matters, so I need to ensure caregivers are trained if used [^ad656dc4] [^65fb49b0] [^8c197aa3].

> But wait, what if the child is failing multiple topical strategies or has frequent, severe flares. I should confirm when systemic therapy is appropriate. Systemic corticosteroids are generally discouraged for atopic dermatitis due to rebound flares and systemic harms; expert consensus suggests they be reserved for rare, short-term rescue scenarios or as a bridge to safer systemic agents, and pediatric guidelines emphasize avoiding routine systemic steroids in children with AD [^54df511c] [^eac53415] [^513ae84c].

> Next, I should review what to avoid. Systemic corticosteroids should not be used routinely for flares; leukotriene receptor antagonists like montelukast have not shown clinically meaningful benefit for eczema; and probiotics are not effective for treating established eczema, though they may be considered for prevention in select high-risk infants outside the scope of acute management [^54df511c] [^8048e31f] [^101fb8b7].

> I need to ensure I address common misconceptions. Parents often fear "steroid addiction" or permanent skin damage; I should explain that short courses of appropriately potent topical corticosteroids are safe, that skin thinning is uncommon with short-term use, and that untreated inflammation itself causes more barrier injury and complications; shared decision-making and written action plans improve adherence and outcomes [^89804841] [^e8ac108b] [^fce40220].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan. For a typical moderate acute flare, I would prescribe a moderate-potency topical corticosteroid once daily for 7 to 14 days to involved areas, continue a fragrance-free leave-on emollient multiple times daily, use soap-free cleansers, and reassess at 1 to 2 weeks; if improving, taper potency or frequency, and if not controlled, step up to a potent agent or consider a short, supervised wet-wrap course, reserving systemic options only for exceptional circumstances and with specialist input [^e8ac108b] [^89804841] [^ad656dc4].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and prevention. After acute control, proactive therapy with twice-weekly topical corticosteroid to previously inflamed sites reduces relapse risk, and ongoing barrier-focused care with trigger avoidance and education sustains remission; I should schedule follow-up to review technique, adherence, and early signs of relapse, adjusting the plan accordingly [^89804841] [^aaa85e6a] [^ad02b1f1].

Acute eczema in children is best managed with **topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy** [^e8ac108b], using potency matched to severity and site (mild for face/intertriginous areas, moderate for trunk/limbs, potent for severe flares) [^f20ec8c8] [^aaa85e6a]. Apply once daily [^1c1781c4] for 7–14 days, then taper to the lowest effective dose; **once-daily application is as effective as twice daily** and improves adherence [^89804841] [^af57e491]. Emollients should be used liberally and frequently to restore the barrier [^ace6e6d5] [^c9c47b06], and wet-wrap therapy can be added for severe or refractory flares [^ad656dc4] [^65fb49b0]. Avoid systemic corticosteroids due to rebound and adverse effects [^54df511c] [^eac53415]; reserve for exceptional cases with specialist input [^513ae84c]. Educate caregivers on proper application, trigger avoidance, and when to seek care for infection or treatment failure [^ad02b1f1].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

Acute eczema in children presents with:

- **Intense pruritus**: Often with scratching and sleep disturbance [^ace6e6d5].
- **Erythematous, edematous papules and vesicles**: Often with exudation and crusting [^82eeddb6].
- **Distribution**: Commonly on the face, scalp, extensor limbs in infants; flexural areas in older children [^notfound].
- **Secondary infection**: Look for impetiginization (honey-colored crusts) or eczema herpeticum (punched-out erosions) [^82eeddb6].

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on history and examination; consider atopy, family history, and triggers (allergens, irritants, stress, climate) [^notfound].

---

## General principles of management

- **Identify and avoid triggers**: Allergens, irritants, stress, and climate factors [^ad02b1f1].
- **Restore skin barrier**: Regular emollients are foundational [^ace6e6d5].
- **Control inflammation**: Topical corticosteroids are first-line [^e8ac108b].
- **Prevent secondary infection**: Recognize and treat promptly [^82eeddb6].
- **Educate caregivers**: Improve adherence and outcomes [^ad02b1f1].

---

## Topical corticosteroids (TCS)

### Potency selection

Potency should be matched to **severity and site**:

| **Potency** | **Indication** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | Face, intertriginous areas, mild flares | Hydrocortisone 1% |
| Moderate | Trunk, limbs, moderate flares | Mometasone 0.1%, fluticasone 0.005% |
| Potent | Severe flares, lichenified areas | Betamethasone 0.1%, mometasone 0.1% |

---

Avoid very potent steroids in children unless under specialist supervision [^aaa85e6a].

---

### Application guidelines

- **Frequency**: Once daily is as effective as twice daily for most flares; twice daily may be used for severe flares or when rapid control is needed [^89804841] [^1c1781c4].
- **Duration**: 7–14 days, then taper to the lowest effective dose or switch to non-steroidal maintenance (e.g. calcineurin inhibitors) [^f20ec8c8].
- **Amount**: Use the fingertip unit (FTU) method: 1 FTU = 0.5 g, enough to treat an area the size of two adult palms [^notfound].

---

### Safety considerations

- **Local adverse effects**: Skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, and secondary infection are rare with short-term use but increase with potency and duration [^89804841] [^d9e40110].
- **Systemic effects**: Rare with appropriate use; monitor growth if prolonged high-potency use is required [^cb7e9f88].
- **Rebound flares**: Can occur with abrupt withdrawal; taper gradually [^eac53415].

---

## Emollients

Emollients are **essential for barrier repair** and should be applied liberally and frequently, even during flares [^ace6e6d5]. Choose fragrance-free, hypoallergenic formulations; ointments are preferred for very dry skin, while creams are acceptable for less dry or inflamed skin. Emollients should be applied before TCS to minimize stinging and improve absorption [^notfound].

---

## Wet-wrap therapy (WWT)

WWT is indicated for **severe or refractory flares**, particularly with significant sleep disturbance or failure of standard therapy [^ad656dc4]. Apply a low- to moderate-potency TCS, then cover with damp inner layers and dry outer layers for several hours or overnight; limit to 7–14 days and monitor for infection or irritation [^65fb49b0].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Topical calcineurin inhibitors**: Tacrolimus 0.03% or pimecrolimus 1% for maintenance or sensitive areas (face, intertriginous regions) [^64bcd8bb].
- **Antihistamines**: Sedating antihistamines (e.g. hydroxyzine) may help with pruritus and sleep disturbance, especially at night [^notfound].
- **Antibiotics**: Use only if secondary bacterial infection is present; topical mupirocin for localized infection, oral antibiotics for widespread or severe cases [^notfound].

---

## Systemic corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are **generally not recommended** due to rebound flares and adverse effects (growth suppression, hypertension, immunosuppression) [^54df511c] [^eac53415]. Reserve for exceptional cases (e.g. severe, refractory flares with significant systemic involvement) and use short courses (≤ 7 days) with close follow-up [^513ae84c].

---

## Patient and caregiver education

Education improves adherence and outcomes. Key points include **proper TCS application**, consistent emollient use, trigger identification and avoidance, and recognition of infection or treatment failure. Provide written action plans and schedule follow-up to reinforce technique and adjust therapy [^ad02b1f1].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should assess **control, adherence, and adverse effects**. Adjust therapy based on severity, response, and patient preference, and monitor growth if prolonged high-potency TCS are used [^cb7e9f88].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Topical corticosteroids matched to severity and site [^e8ac108b].
- **Emollients**: Liberal, frequent application [^ace6e6d5].
- **Wet-wrap therapy**: For severe or refractory flares [^ad656dc4].
- **Avoid**: Routine systemic corticosteroids [^54df511c].
- **Education**: Essential for adherence and outcomes [^ad02b1f1].

---

Acute eczema in children is best managed with **topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy**, using potency matched to severity and site, applied once daily for 7–14 days, then tapered. Emollients are essential for barrier repair, and wet-wrap therapy can be added for severe flares. Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided. Caregiver education and regular follow-up are critical to success.

Summary

Background

Guidelines discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis, but their use remains widespread.

Objectives

To reach consensus among an international group ofexperts on the use of systemic corticosteroids for.

Methods

A survey consisting of statements accompanied by visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree' was distributed to the International Eczema Council. Consensus was reached in agreement on a statement if < 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.

Results

Sixty of 77 (78%)members participated. Consensus was reached on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but can be used rarely for severeunder certain circumstances, including a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be limited to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, but consensus was not reached on that statement. The conclusions of our expert group are limited by a dearth of high‐quality published evidence. If more stringent consensus criteria were applied (e.g. requiring < 20% of respondents marking towards 'strongly disagree'), consensus would have been reached on fewer statements.

Conclusions

Based on expert opinion from the, routine use of systemic corticosteroids foris generally discouraged and should be reserved for special circumstances.

### Use of emollients in dry-skin conditions: consensus statement [^c9c47b06]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Emollients can perform an important role in the treatment of a number of dermatological conditions. Currently, the use of emollient therapy in the UK is supported only by limited guidelines and a best-practice statement, although guidelines do exist for specific conditions such as childhood eczema. To address this need, a group of clinical professionals covering acute community-care settings and medicines management met to review current data and practice. Their aim was to support other professionals in their approach to the use of emollient therapies in dry-skin conditions.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^f264266c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines discourage the use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis (AD), but their use remains widespread.

Objectives

To reach consensus among an international group of AD experts on the use of systemic corticosteroids for AD.

Methods

A survey consisting of statements accompanied by visual analogue scales ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'neutral' to 'strongly agree' was distributed to the International Eczema Council (IEC). Consensus was reached in agreement on a statement if < 30% of respondents marked to the left of 'neutral' towards 'strongly disagree'.

Results

Sixty of 77 (78%) IEC members participated. Consensus was reached on 12 statements, including that systemic corticosteroids should generally be avoided but can be used rarely for severe AD under certain circumstances, including a lack of other treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, during acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event or in the most severe cases. If used, treatment should be limited to the short term. Most respondents agreed that systemic corticosteroids should never be used in children, but consensus was not reached on that statement. The conclusions of our expert group are limited by a dearth of high-quality published evidence. If more stringent consensus criteria were applied (e.g. requiring < 20% of respondents marking towards 'strongly disagree'), consensus would have been reached on fewer statements.

Conclusions

Based on expert opinion from the IEC, routine use of systemic corticosteroids for AD is generally discouraged and should be reserved for special circumstances.

### Leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema [^8048e31f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is frequently associated with atopic conditions, including asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) have a corticosteroid-sparing role in asthma, but their role in eczema remains controversial. Currently available topical therapies for eczema are often poorly tolerated, and use of systemic agents is restricted by their adverse effect profile. A review of alternative treatments was therefore warranted.

Objectives

To assess the possible benefits and harms of leukotriene receptor antagonists for eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to September 2017: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database. We also searched five trial registries, and handsearched the bibliographies of all extracted studies for further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of LTRAs alone or in combination with other (topical or systemic) treatments compared with other treatments alone such as topical corticosteroids or placebo for eczema in the acute or chronic (maintenance) phase of eczema in adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome measures were change in disease severity, long-term symptom control, and adverse effects of treatment. Secondary outcomes were change in corticosteroid requirement, reduction of pruritis, quality of life, and emollient requirement. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Only five studies (including a total of 202 participants) met the inclusion criteria, all of which assessed oral montelukast; hence, we found no studies assessing other LTRAs. Treatment ranged from four to eight weeks, and outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment; therefore, we could only report short-term measurements (defined as less than three months follow-up from baseline). Montelukast dosing was 10 mg for adults (age 14 years and above) and 5 mg for children (age 6 years to 14 years). One study included children (aged 6 years and above) among their participants, while the remaining studies only included adults (participant age ranged from 16 to 70 years). The participants were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe eczema in four studies and moderate eczema in one study. The study setting was unclear in two studies, multicentre in two studies, and single centre in one study; the studies were conducted in Europe and Bangladesh. Two studies were industry funded. The comparator was placebo in three studies and conventional treatment in two studies. The conventional treatment comparator was a combination of antihistamines and topical corticosteroids (plus oral antibiotics in one study). Four of the studies did not adequately describe their randomisation or allocation concealment method and were considered as at unclear risk of selection bias. Only one study was at low risk of performance and detection bias. However, we judged all studies to be at low risk of attrition and reporting bias. We found no evidence of a difference in disease severity of moderate-to-severe eczema after short-term use of montelukast (10 mg) when compared with placebo. The outcome was assessed using the modified EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) score and SASSAD (Six Area, Six Sign Atopic Dermatitis) severity score (standardised mean difference 0.29, with a positive score showing montelukast is favoured, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.81; 3 studies; n = 131; low-quality evidence). When short-term montelukast (10 mg) treatment was compared with conventional treatment in one study, the mean improvement in severity of moderate-to-severe eczema was greater in the intervention group (measured using SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) severity index) (mean difference 10.57, 95% CI 4.58 to 16.56; n = 31); however, another study of 32 participants found no significant difference between groups using the same measure (mean improvement was 25.2 points with montelukast versus 23.9 points with conventional treatment; no further numerical data provided). We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for this outcome, meaning the results are uncertain. All studies reported their adverse event rate during treatment. Four studies (136 participants) reported no adverse events. In one study of 58 participants with moderate eczema who received montelukast 10 mg (compared with placebo), there was one case of septicaemia and one case of dizziness reported in the intervention group, both resulting in study withdrawal, although whether these effects were related to the medication is unclear. Mild side effects (e.g. headache and mild gastrointestinal disturbances) were also noted, but these were fairly evenly distributed between the montelukast and placebo groups. The quality of evidence for this outcome was low. No studies specifically evaluated emollient requirement or quality of life. One study that administered treatment for eight weeks specifically evaluated pruritus improvement at the end treatment and topical corticosteroid use during treatment. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo for both outcomes (low-quality evidence, n = 58). No other study assessed these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this review are limited to montelukast. There was a lack of evidence addressing the review question, and the quality of the available evidence for most of the measured outcomes was low. Some primary and secondary outcomes were not addressed at all, including long-term control. We found no evidence of a difference between montelukast (10 mg) and placebo on disease severity, pruritus improvement, and topical corticosteroid use. Very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of montelukast (10 mg) compared with conventional treatment on disease severity. Participants in only one study reported adverse events, which were mainly mild (low-quality evidence). There is no evidence that LTRA is an effective treatment for eczema. Serious limitations were that all studies focused on montelukast and only included people with moderate-to-severe eczema, who were mainly adults; and that each outcome was evaluated with a small sample size, if at all. Further large randomised controlled trials, with a longer treatment duration, of adults and children who have eczema of all severities may help to evaluate the effect of all types of LTRA, especially on eczema maintenance.

### Atopic dermatitis: an overview… [^82eeddb6]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

2 A 2003 survey of children in the United States estimated an overall prevalence of approximately 11 percent, and as high as 19 percent in some states. 3 A 2007 U. S. population-based survey suggested an estimated 17. 8 million persons are living with atopic dermatitis, and most cases have not been diagnosed. 4 Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent significant morbidity from sleep disturbances, chronic postinflammatory skin changes, scarring from picking and scratching, and the development of secondary skin infections with Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and herpes species.
5. Pathophysiology A genetic defect in the filaggrin protein is thought to cause atopic dermatitis by disrupting the epidermis. This disruption, in turn, results in contact between immune cells in the dermis and antigens from the external environment leading to intense itching, scratching, and inflammation.

6 Scratching can then lead to further disruption and inflammation of the epidermal skin barrier; this has been described as the itchscratch cycle.
2. Clinical Presentation and Differential Diagnosis Atopic dermatitis can present in three clinical phases. Acute atopic dermatitis presents with a vesicular, weeping, crusting eruption. Subacute atopic dermatitis presents with dry, scaly, erythematous papules and plaques. Chronic atopic dermatitis demonstrates lichenification from repeated scratching. A more subtle presentation of atopic dermatitis that commonly occurs in children is pityriasis alba, which is characterized by hypopigmented, poorly demarcated plaques with fine scale. Complications Patients with atopic dermatitis can develop a secondary bacterial infection from skin flora, particularly Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species.

Secondarily infected atopic dermatitis presents with pustules and crusts, and should be suspected if symptoms do not respond to conventional therapy, or if the patient presents with fever and malaise or rapidly worsening symptoms. Patients with atopic dermatitis are also at risk of developing herpes simplex virus infection, known as Kaposi varicelliform eruption or eczema herpeticum. Eczematous skin enables a localized herpes outbreak to spread over the skin and create a painful papulovesicular rash. Other complications of atopic dermatitis include scars from picking and scratching, chronic postinflammatory skin changes, and skin atrophy from long-term treatment with topical corticosteroids.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^76160a31]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We created summary of findings tables for our main comparisons. We selected the following four most relevant and important comparisons, from both clinician and patient perspectives, to be included in the summary of findings tables.

Stronger potency versus weaker potency for treatment of eczema flare‐ups
Twice daily versus once daily application for treatment of eczema flare‐ups
Longer‐ versus shorter‐term application for induction of remission
Twice weekly application to prevent relapse (weekend therapy) versus no application

We included both primary outcomes and secondary outcomes in each summary of findings table. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each primary and secondary outcome for our main comparisons. GRADE includes the assessment of five factors: trial limitations (risk of bias); inconsistency of results; indirectness of evidence; imprecision; and publication bias (Schünemann 2013). Each outcome can be downgraded by one or two levels for each domain, and we classed the overall certainty as high, moderate, low or very low. We used GRADEpro GDT to create our summary of findings tables and undertake our GRADE assessments.

### Atopic dermatitis-American Academy of Pediatrics… [^14951601]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

We have assembled clinical guidance for atopic dermatitis including signs and symptoms, treatment, referral considerations and additional resources. You will find an interactive image tool, case scenarios, a diagnostic aid for educating and diagnosing patients, a treatment tool, and detailed management guidance. Atopic Dermatitis Overview Atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic, relapsing-remitting, inflammatory skin condition characterized by pruritic lesions.
- Atopic dermatitis is the most common pediatric skin disorder, with 12-month prevalence rates averaging approximately 10% in resource-rich countries and ranging up to 20% globally.
- Approximately 60% of children with atopic dermatitis develop symptoms in the first year after birth, and 90% develop symptoms by 5 years of age.
- Symptoms of atopic dermatitis typically resolve by adulthood, but between 10% and 30% of children continue to exhibit symptoms of atopic dermatitis as adults.
- Up to 15% of children with atopic dermatitis have severe disease, according to an international study of 12-month prevalence rates. Children who have atopic dermatitis are susceptible to certain bacterial and viral infections.
- The increased adherence of Staphylococcus aureus to the skin and reduced production of antimicrobial peptides may explain the high rates of colonization and infection with these bacteria.
- Altered T-cell function may explain the predisposition of children to develop molluscum contagiosum, eczema herpeticum, and eczema vaccinatum. Clinical Resources Below you will find clinical information and resources to help care for children with atopic dermatitis including risk factors, signs and symptoms and treatment options. Professional Tools & Resources The following tools and resources are designed to aid diagnosis, patient consultation, and patient education.

### Treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic eczema in adults within the U.K.: results of a national survey of dermatologists [^5528cc29]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Our finding that > 90% of the responding U.K. dermatologists would choose narrowband UVB as their first‐line phototherapy modality is in line with evidence from RCTs 4 and recently published European guidelines. 21 However, it is interesting that respondents' own clinical experience and knowledge of acute and chronic side‐effect profiles (rather than their knowledge of the evidence base for treatment efficacy) appeared to be the major factors influencing their choice.

Among paediatric dermatologists and paediatricians in Europe, 2 ciclosporin was the most commonly used first‐ and second‐line medication. However, notably there was clear regional variation, and within the U.K. azathioprine appeared to be the most prescribed first‐line systemic agent for children, although ciclosporin was almost as commonly used. 2 Use of azathioprine as the first‐line choice of systemic is in line with a growing body of literature, including guidelines on the safe and effective prescription of azathioprine for dermatological conditions published by the BAD in 2011, and later studies. 5, 22, 23, 24 Systematic reviews and European guidelines have also recommended consideration of azathioprine for treatment of refractory moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema. 9, 25 On the other hand, although treatment guidelines report a largely unfavourable risk‐to‐benefit ratio for the use of systemic corticosteroids, 9 a surprisingly high percentage of respondents (42%) reported using systemic corticosteroids as the first‐line choice. This might reflect short‐term treatment, particularly if admission to hospital is not available, although participants were asked to consider their answers outwith the treatment of acute flares, and we did not ask about the duration of use of systemic steroids.

### Topical steroids for atopic dermatitis in primary care [^b54cfe62]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is very common. In most instances, the condition is relatively mild and can be managed in primary care. Topical corticosteroids are the standard therapy for controlling acute 'flares' of dermatitis. However, poor communication between doctors and patients often results in suboptimal use of such therapy. Here, we review the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. We discuss their optimal use in primary care, and the advice and information that patients or parents of children need when using such treatment.

### Atopic dermatitis [^ace6e6d5]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is characterised by intense itching and recurrent eczematous lesions. Although it most often starts in infancy and affects two of ten children, it is also highly prevalent in adults. It is the leading non-fatal health burden attributable to skin diseases, inflicts a substantial psychosocial burden on patients and their relatives, and increases the risk of food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, and mental health disorders. Originally regarded as a childhood disorder mediated by an imbalance towards a T-helper-2 response and exaggerated IgE responses to allergens, it is now recognised as a lifelong disposition with variable clinical manifestations and expressivity, in which defects of the epidermal barrier are central. Present prevention and treatment focus on restoration of epidermal barrier function, which is best achieved through the use of emollients. Topical corticosteroids are still the first-line therapy for acute flares, but they are also used proactively along with topical calcineurin inhibitors to maintain remission. Non-specific immunosuppressive drugs are used in severe refractory cases, but targeted disease-modifying drugs are being developed. We need to improve understanding of the heterogeneity of the disease and its subtypes, the role of atopy and autoimmunity, the mechanisms behind disease-associated itch, and the comparative effectiveness and safety of therapies.

Abstract

Background

Eczema is a common skin condition. Although topical corticosteroids have been a first‐line treatment for eczema for decades, there are uncertainties over their optimal use.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician‐reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient‐reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty‐five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data.

Stronger‐potency versus weaker‐potency topical corticosteroids

Sixty‐three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician‐reported signs of eczema.

We pooled four trials that compared moderate‐ versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low‐certainty evidence).

Twice daily or more versus once daily application

We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks.

Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare‐up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher‐potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low‐certainty evidence.

Longer versus shorter‐term duration of application for induction of remission

No trials were identified.

Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare‐ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application

Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe).

Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty.

Other comparisons

Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare‐ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare‐ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low‐ or very low‐certainty, short‐term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient. There is a need for longer‐term trials, in people with mild eczema.

Key differences with NICE guidance.

NICE says use once or twice a day. This review suggests there is no evidence of additional effectiveness of application of potent topical corticosteroids once a day over twice a day (we GRADE‐assessed the evidence as moderate certainty). For mild or moderate topical corticosteroids there is a lack of evidence regarding once‐ or twice daily application.
NICE says there is limited evidence on strategies to prevent flares. This review provides moderate‐certainty evidence for use of weekend (proactive) therapy.
This review suggests that newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than older topical corticosteroids; this is not included in NICE guidance. We did not GRADE‐assess the evidence within this analysis as it was not one of the main comparisons reported in the summary of findings tables.

We found limited or no evidence to support some of the recommendations in NICE.

NICE says occlusion strategies should not be used as first‐line treatment in children, should only be initiated by a healthcare professional trained in their use, and should only be used for 7 to 14 days without specialist dermatological advice.
NICE says do not use potent topical corticosteroids in children under 12 months without specialist dermatological supervision.
NICE says to start treatment of moderate eczema with moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid and severe eczema with potent topical corticosteroid. Whilst this review supports the notion that stronger topical corticosteroids probably have increased effectiveness, there was insufficient data in participants with mild to moderate eczema to fully support this stepped approach.
NICE says, in children over 12 months, to use potent topical corticosteroids for as short a time as possible and in any case for no longer than 14 days.
NICE says to use mild potency for the face and neck, except for short‐term use of moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids for severe flares, and to use moderate or potent preparations for short periods only in the axillae and groin.

Measures of treatment effect

Many of our pooled analyses required a generic inverse variance (GIV) approach to enable parallel‐group and within‐participant trials to be pooled alongside one another. Therefore, we reported dichotomous data as odds ratios (OR) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). One exception was the weekend therapy comparison where we reported relapse risk as a risk ratio to extend the previous meta‐analysis by Schmitt 2011.

We reported continuous data as mean differences (MD) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), where trials used the same scale to measure an outcome. Where appropriate, we used a standardised mean difference (SMD) and associated 95% CI when trials used different instruments to measure effectiveness outcomes (i.e. clinician‐reported signs and patient‐reported symptoms).

Where trials reported time‐to‐relapse data based on a measure of effectiveness (e.g. EASI), we extracted hazard ratios (HR) from the trial reports. We pooled log‐rank and Cox model estimates using the GIV approach according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2021a).

For adverse event data, we reported the number of participants who experienced an event within the intervention and the control group, unless specified otherwise. We could not pool these data due to the low number of events. When judging whether a participant was deemed to have cortisol levels out of range, in the first instance we accepted what the trial report stated as the number of participants outside of the normal range whether they reported their reference range or not. If the trial did not tell us how many participants were deemed to be outside the normal range but did tell us cortisol test results, we used guidelines (referenced) to classify the participants. A clinical member of the author team reviewed these decisions.

We include contact with trial authors, where published data were ambiguous, in Table 10.

How often to apply topical corticosteroid?

See: Table 5; Table 6; and Table 7.

Applying topical corticosteroid twice daily probably does not increase the proportion of participants (adults and children) who achieve clinician‐reported treatment success for treating a flare (1 to 4 weeks) compared to once daily application (moderate‐certainty evidence). This still applied when restricting to trials where the same topical corticosteroid was used in both arms; however, most of those trials were in participants with moderate to severe eczema, using a potent or very potent topical corticosteroid. It also applied in the trials that spanned more than one strategy, comparing higher‐potency, often newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroid applied once a day with lower‐potency topical corticosteroid applied more frequently.

The evidence suggests that frequency of application results in little to no difference between strategies in the risk of developing skin thinning (low‐certainty evidence). The number of reported cases was low, and more than three‐quarters of cases were seen in participants using very potent topical corticosteroid. The evidence addressing whether using topical corticosteroids more than once daily affects cortisol levels is very uncertain and there were no data on clinically relevant effects.

No trials looked at longer‐ versus shorter‐term duration of treatment for induction of remission from a flare.

Weekend, or 'proactive' therapy, in which topical corticosteroids are applied twice a week for two consecutive days in between flares, aims to prevent rather than treat eczema flares. Weekend therapy likely results in a large decrease in the likelihood of experiencing a new flare compared to no topical corticosteroid application, with moderate‐certainty evidence. This effect was seen in children and adults and across all eczema severities, although most evidence was in moderate to severe eczema. With regard to safety, no cases of skin thinning, or new cases of abnormal cortisol levels were reported (low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence), but there were no data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression or impact on growth. The trials of weekend therapy were significantly longer in duration (16 weeks to 12 months) than trials identified for other strategies, primarily because of the need to detect the number of new flares rather than treating the existing flare. Whilst these trials may be better designed to detect adverse events that take longer to manifest, such as skin thinning, it should be noted that the data are not necessarily comparable with the other strategy comparisons as the topical corticosteroid use was intermittent (two days per week) rather than daily as is normal for treating a flare.

### What's new in topicals for atopic dermatitis? [^661e3c0e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can have tremendous impact on quality of life for affected children and adults. First-line therapy for acute management of AD includes topical therapies such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and, more recently, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor crisaborole. Topical agents have remained the mainstay therapy for decades; however, there has been a longstanding need for topical therapies with high efficacy and low risk of adverse effects with long-term use. Given the ongoing advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AD, there are novel targets for pharmacological intervention. We are now in an unprecedented time with more than 40 topical treatments in the pipeline for AD in addition to many developments and treatments on the horizon. This review summarizes selected therapeutic topical agents in later phases of development that target various aspects in the pathogenesis of AD such as Janus kinase inhibition (ruxolitinib and delgocitinib), phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition (roflumilast and difamilast), aryl hydrocarbon modulation (tapinarof), and modulation of the microbiome. We also review novel targeted therapies that are in early phase clinical trials, including AMTX-100, BEN-2293, and PRN473. Preliminary findings on efficacy and tolerability of most of these agents are promising, but further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of these novel agents against the current standard of care.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^cb765e3d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The majority (65%) disagreed that nonresponse to topical therapy was an indication for use of systemic CS. Consensus was reached that among the appropriate circumstances for the use of systemic CS in AD were a lack of other viable treatment options, as a bridge to other systemic therapies or phototherapy, acute flares in need of immediate relief, in anticipation of a major life event or in cases that were the most severe. Consensus was reached that, if used, systemic CS treatment of severe AD should be limited to short‐term use.

In their responses to the open‐ended questions, individual participants qualified their responses in several ways. Some expressed strong support for the use of systemic CS, whereas others expressed strong opposition.

In the sensitivity analysis using < 20% disagreement as a more stringent cut‐off, only five statements would have reached consensus (Box S1; see Supporting Information). In the sensitivity analysis in which no more than 30% of voters marked within the left two‐thirds of the VAS (counting more of the 'neutral' range as disagreement), only three statements would have reached consensus (Box S2; see Supporting Information).

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^c6ee7271]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A total of 104 trials and 8443 participants were included in this review. These covered a wide range of clinically plausible strategies for using topical corticosteroids in treating eczema, which fell into three broad categories:

which topical corticosteroid to use;
how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for; and
how best to apply the topical corticosteroid.

Summary of main results

The main findings, for which we have drawn up summary of findings tables, address 1. which topical corticosteroid to use, and 2. how often and how long to use topical corticosteroid for.

Which topical corticosteroid to use

See: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4.

Our review focused on four comparisons of topical corticosteroid of one potency with another topical corticosteroid of a different potency (moderate versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus mild topical corticosteroid, potent versus moderate topical corticosteroid, and very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid) for treating eczema flare‐ups, which reflects clinical practice decision making based on a stepped approach. In mainly moderate to severe eczema, potent and moderately potent topical corticosteroid probably result in an increased number of participants achieving clinician‐reported treatment success compared to mild‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence), with insufficient data to determine whether this applied to people with mild disease. There was also insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroid compared to moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid (moderate‐certainty evidence). Again, the trials were mainly in moderate to severe eczema but perhaps more representative of the population that may be offered these higher‐potency topical corticosteroids There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroid, with only three small trials included in the meta‐analysis (low‐certainty evidence). These trials usually included more children than adults. The number of reported cases of skin thinning was very low, with a relatively even spread across groups but tending towards more events with increasing potency of topical corticosteroid. Most trials were of short duration so may not detect longer‐term adverse events (low‐certainty evidence for local adverse events, except for the comparison of very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid which we assessed as very low‐certainty.)

In six trials involving 188 participants, 16 participants had levels of cortisol outside of the normal range (very low‐certainty evidence). There were minimal data on whether the levels returned to normal once the topical corticosteroids were stopped, minimal data on clinically relevant adrenal suppression, and no data regarding impact on growth (see: Completeness of outcomes; safety).

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^1d0d5d6d]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We identified 35 papers reporting on 34 trials of 46 emollients. They primarily included children and took place in research centres and secondary care sites. Four papers did not discuss adverse events at all, and of the remaining 31 papers, 58% provided detail on the adverse events experienced. The methodology to collect data on adverse events was unclear in 40% of the papers and only two papers shared their data-collection tools. Where studies provided detailed information about the type of adverse events experienced with emollients, pruritis, erythema and burning on application were the most common, whereas 'irritation' was the most commonly mentioned 'other' symptom.

This study has some limitations in addition to its strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to focus on how and what adverse events are reported in trials of emollients used in the treatment of eczema. Because of the lack of consensus about how or what symptoms should be sought and reported, and variation across countries and cultures in how terms are understood or used, there is likely to be inconsistency in the use of terminology. For instance, one study may have referred to 'stinging' and another study may have referred to 'burning' in reference to the same side-effect. The generally poor reporting of adverse events was also reflected in poor reporting generally, as noted by the overall quality assessment.

### A placebo-controlled trial of antimicrobial treatment for acute otitis media [^762da0e2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy of antimicrobial treatment in children with acute otitis media remains controversial.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, children 6 to 35 months of age with acute otitis media, diagnosed with the use of strict criteria, received amoxicillin-clavulanate (161 children) or placebo (158 children) for 7 days. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure from the first dose until the end-of-treatment visit on day 8. The definition of treatment failure was based on the overall condition of the child (including adverse events) and otoscopic signs of acute otitis media.

Results

Treatment failure occurred in 18.6% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 44.9% of the children who received placebo (P < 0.001). The difference between the groups was already apparent at the first scheduled visit (day 3), at which time 13.7% of the children who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, as compared with 25.3% of those who received placebo, had treatment failure. Overall, amoxicillin-clavulanate reduced the progression to treatment failure by 62% (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.59; P < 0.001) and the need for rescue treatment by 81% (6.8% vs. 33.5%; hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.36; P < 0.001). Analgesic or antipyretic agents were given to 84.2% and 85.9% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events were significantly more common in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group than in the placebo group. A total of 47.8% of the children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group had diarrhea, as compared with 26.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.001); 8.7% and 3.2% of the children in the respective groups had eczema (P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Children with acute otitis media benefit from antimicrobial treatment as compared with placebo, although they have more side effects. Future studies should identify patients who may derive the greatest benefit, in order to minimize unnecessary antimicrobial treatment and the development of bacterial resistance.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^6e9afd22]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

How to use the topical corticosteroid?

Timing of application of topical corticosteroid (2 trials in 158 participants)
Wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials in 221 participants)
Topical corticosteroid applied to wet versus dry skin (1 trial in 45 participants)
Topical corticosteroid applied before emollient versus topical corticosteroid applied after emollient (1 trial in 46 participants)
Time between application of emollient and steroid (no trials)

*Key comparisons for which summary of findings tables are presented.

Several included trials tested a combination of the above, reflecting how topical corticosteroids might be used in clinical practice, therefore, are found in more than one results section. For instance, Rafanelli 1993 compares a newer, second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid (mometasone furoate) applied once daily with a moderate‐potency, older topical corticosteroid (clobetasone butyrate) used twice daily. As a result, Rafanelli 1993 is included in three separate meta‐analyses; 1. potency versus moderate topical corticosteroid; 2. second‐generation versus older topical corticosteroid; and 3. frequency of application, and the comparison of interest changes for each.

Trials that compared treatment strategies designed to treat eczema flares were generally short‐term (range 1 to 6 weeks) and rarely conducted any follow‐up. Trials included in the comparison of weekend (proactive) therapy with topical corticosteroid versus no topical corticosteroid, where the intervention aimed to prolong time to new flare (i.e. prevent relapse), were longer in duration. These trials involved a two‐ to four‐week stabilisation phase where both groups received topical corticosteroid, followed by a 16‐ to 20‐week maintenance phase, with the exceptions of Fukuie 2012 and Fukuie 2016, which observed participants at 6 and 12 months, respectively.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^703e17d0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

How to use the topical corticosteroid?

Timing of application of topical corticosteroid
Wet wrap versus no wet wrap
Topical corticosteroid applied to wet versus dry skin
Topical corticosteroid applied before emollient versus topical corticosteroid applied after emollient
Time between application of emollient and steroid

We also included combinations of any of the strategies above (e.g. short burst of potent topical corticosteroids versus longer duration of mild topical corticosteroids).

Since the focus of this review was to compare different strategies of using topical corticosteroids, we excluded the following comparisons.

Topical corticosteroid compared with either no treatment, vehicle or placebo (unless it was specifically assessing an alternative regimen such as weekend (proactive) therapy)
Topical corticosteroid compared with another topical corticosteroid of the same potency and preparation but no differences in how they were used. We developed a hierarchy of sources to assign potency to each topical corticosteroid (Table 9). Potencies were most frequently determined using the British National Formulary 2018 and WHO 1997. If we could not establish the potency using these sources, we reviewed regional guidelines and the wider scientific literature, and consulted regional experts until we could reach a decision.
Topical corticosteroid compared with different topical treatments such as calcineurin inhibitors or emollients
Topical corticosteroid compared with systemic treatments
Topical corticosteroid treatment in conjunction with an eczema treatment used for the most severe cases of eczema as defined by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); that is, phototherapy and systemic therapy (NICE 2018). This was because it would have been difficult to detect any differences in efficacy or safety between the topical corticosteroid strategies when such treatments were also used.

Types of outcome measures

We assessed both effectiveness and safety to reflect the overall aim of this review.

The effectiveness outcomes of interest for this review were focused on the two domains for which the international Harmonizing Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) initiative recommended core outcome measurement instruments, that is, clinician‐reported signs and patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (HOME).

There is currently no agreed standardised timing for effectiveness outcome assessments for eczema trials. Therefore, to assess treatment effects in a consistent way, we focused on short‐term effectiveness outcomes reported between one and four weeks (taking the earliest available time point within that range), medium‐term effectiveness outcomes between 12 and 16 weeks (taking the closest time point to 12 weeks), and long‐term effectiveness as the longest time point longer than 16 weeks.

### Oral H1 antihistamines as' add-on' therapy to topical treatment for eczema [^c9fb49ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The symptoms of eczema can lead to sleeplessness and fatigue and may have a substantial impact on quality of life. Use of oral H1 antihistamines (H1 AH) as adjuvant therapy alongside topical agents is based on the idea that combining the anti-inflammatory effects of topical treatments with the blocking action of histamine on its receptors in the skin by H1 AH (to reduce the principal symptom of itch) might magnify or intensify the effect of treatment. Also, it would be unethical to compare oral H1 AH alone versus no treatment, as topical treatment is the standard management for this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment in adults and children with eczema.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2018: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database (Global Resource of EczemA Trials; from inception). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the abstracts of four conference proceedings held between 2000 and 2018.

Selection Criteria

We sought RCTs assessing oral H1 AH as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment for people with eczema compared with topical treatment plus placebo or no additional treatment as add-on therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Primary outcome measures were 'Mean change in patient-assessed symptoms of eczema' and 'Proportion of participants reporting adverse effects and serious adverse events'. Secondary outcomes were 'Mean change in physician-assessed clinical signs', 'Mean change in quality of life', and 'Number of eczema flares'.

Main Results

We included 25 studies (3285 randomised participants). Seventeen studies included 1344 adults, and eight studies included 1941 children. Most studies failed to report eczema severity at baseline, but they were conducted in secondary care settings, so it is likely that they recruited patients with more severe cases of eczema. Trial duration was between three days and 18 months. Researchers studied 13 different H1 AH treatments. We could not undertake pooling because of the high level of diversity across studies in terms of duration and dose of intervention, concomitant topical therapy, and outcome assessment. Risk of bias was generally unclear, but five studies had high risk of bias in one domain (attrition, selection, or reporting bias). Only one study measured quality of life, but these results were insufficient for statistical analysis. Although this review assessed 17 comparisons, we summarise here the results of three key comparisons in this review. Cetirizine versus placeboOne study compared cetirizine 0.5 mg/kg/d against placebo over 18 months in 795 children. Study authors did not report patient-assessed symptoms of eczema separately for pruritus. Cetirizine is probably associated with fewer adverse events (mainly mild) (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.01) and the need for slightly less additional H1 AH use as an indication of eczema flare rate (P = 0.035; no further numerical data given). Physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD)) were reduced in both groups, but the difference between groups was reported as non-significant (no P value given). Evidence for this comparison was of moderate quality. One study assessed cetirizine 10 mg/d against placebo over four weeks in 84 adults. Results show no evidence of differences between groups in patient-assessed symptoms of eczema (pruritus measured as part of SCORAD; no numerical data given), numbers of adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45; mainly sedation, other skin-related problems, respiratory symptoms, or headache), or physician-assessed changes in clinical signs, amount of local rescue therapy required, or number of applications as an indicator of eczema flares (no numerical data reported). Evidence for this comparison was of low quality. Fexofenadine versus placeboCompared with placebo, fexofenadine 120 mg/d taken in adults over one week (one study) probably leads to a small reduction in patient-assessed symptoms of pruritus on a scale of 0 to 8 (mean difference (MD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.07; n = 400) and a greater reduction in the ratio of physician-assessed pruritus area to whole body surface area (P = 0.007; no further numerical data given); however, these reductions may not be clinically meaningful. Results suggest probably little or no difference in adverse events (mostly somnolence and headache) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.50; n = 411) nor in the amount of 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate used (co-intervention in both groups) as an indicator of eczema flare, but no numerical data were given. Evidence for this comparison was of moderate quality. Loratadine versus placeboA study of 28 adults compared loratadine 10 mg/d taken over 4 weeks versus placebo. Researchers found no evidence of differences between groups in patient-assessed pruritus, measured by a 100-point visual analogue scale (MD -2.30, 95% CI -20.27 to 15.67); reduction in physician-assessed clinical signs (SCORAD) (MD -4.10, 95% CI -13.22 to 5.02); or adverse events. Study authors reported only one side effect (folliculitis with placebo) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.76). Evidence for this comparison was of low quality. Number of eczema flares was not measured for this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the main comparisons, we did not find consistent evidence that H1 AH treatments are effective as 'add-on' therapy for eczema when compared to placebo; evidence for this comparison was of low and moderate quality. However, fexofenadine probably leads to a small improvement in patient-assessed pruritus, with probably no significant difference in the amount of treatment used to prevent eczema flares. Cetirizine was no better than placebo in terms of physician-assessed clinical signs nor patient-assessed symptoms, and we found no evidence that loratadine was more beneficial than placebo, although all interventions seem safe. The quality of evidence was limited because of poor study design and imprecise results. Future researchers should clearly define the condition (course and severity) and clearly report their methods, especially participant selection and randomisation; baseline characteristics; and outcomes (based on the Harmonising Outcome Measures in Eczema initiative).

### TREatment of ATopic eczema (TREAT) registry taskforce: consensus on how and when to measure the core dataset for atopic eczema treatment research registries [^46ecf6b9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

A significant number of paediatric and adult patients with moderate‐to‐severe atopic eczema (AE) may require phototherapy or systemic immunomodulatory therapy at some point during their life. For adults, ciclosporin, and recently dupilumab, are currently the only systemic therapies that are approved by the European Medicines Agency, 1, 2 while only dupilumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 3 For children, there are no approved systemic therapies, although our European and North American treatment surveys show that they are regularly prescribed. 4, 5 While there is some evidence on the short‐term effectiveness of phototherapy and systemic immunomodulatory therapy, there is a clear lack of head‐to‐head comparison trials and a paucity of data on the long‐term effectiveness and safety of such treatments. 6, 7 As randomized controlled trials have very strict inclusion criteria, important subgroups of patients (e.g. those with comorbidities) are commonly excluded and therefore evidence in real‐life populations is missing. All of this requires data collection from well‐defined patient cohorts. 8, 9, 10

To harmonize data collection for such observational cohorts, the TREatment of ATopic eczema (TREAT) Registry Taskforce initiated a consensus exercise to develop a core set of domains and domain items for AE treatment research registries. After an international Delphi study and consensus meeting, the core dataset ('what to measure') was agreed on, consisting of 19 domains with 69 corresponding domain items (49 at baseline and 20 at follow‐up). 11, 12

As the next step in this consensus‐finding process, we performed a consensus exercise to define how and when to measure the core domain items to harmonize data collection fully within national AE treatment research registries and prevent heterogeneity. 13, 14

### What is "eczema"? [^1579de96]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Eczema is the most common category of inflammatory skin disorders as dermatologists see many patients with the diseases classified into this group in daily medical practice. While eczema is frequently used to communicate among dermatologists, they may not exactly know the origin and history of the term "eczema". The original word for eczema is "ekzein (Greek)", which means "boil over" or "break out" (Oxford Learner's Dictionaries). Before eczema earned its formal title, descriptions of similar skin conditions appeared in ancient Egyptian texts. The Ebers Papyrus, one of the earliest known medical documents, was written more than 3000 years ago, and skin issues were described in this ancient writing. Hippocrates also contributed to theories on the origins and treatment of eczema‐like skin conditions around 400. Eventually, eczema was coined in 1817 to describe a fluid‐filled, blistering rash–like sunburn. Thus, the original meaning represents aggressive acute eczema and does not match the currently used eczema that we typically image today.

Despite its highly frequent usage, "eczema" has been terminologically confused with "dermatitis". Eczema and dermatitis are often used synonymously to denote a polymorphic pattern of inflammation of the skin characterized, at least in its acute phase, by erythema, vesiculation, and pruritus. One of the representative diseases lacking standardized nomenclature using eczema/dermatitis is atopic dermatitis (AD) or atopic eczema. The term atopic "dermatitis" was rarely used until the late 1970s, after which AD became commonly used as compared with atopic "eczema" and continuously increased until 2015. Atopic eczema decreased between 2008 and 2015. One may recognize that "eczema" is used for skin features as seen in childhood eczema, flexural eczema, infantile eczema, dyshidrotic eczema, and nummular eczema. Meanwhile, "dermatitis" is intended to be used for disease names, such as contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis.

Although it takes courage to describe the whole aspects of eczema, in this review article, we aim to reveal the classical concept and current etiological thoughts of eczema. We review the morphology of eczema, looking back on the "eczema triangle", and discuss acute and chronic eczema, focusing on the pathophysiology of spongiosis and fibrosis, respectively.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^ce7b760b]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Eczema affects up to 20% of infants, 6% of school‐age children and 5% of adults worldwide and is the most burdensome skin condition globally. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the most commonly used anti‐inflammatory treatment for eczema and have been available for over 70 years. While there is great interest in novel systemic treatments for moderate–severe eczema, new classes of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments have also been licensed for mild, moderate or severe eczema treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) tacrolimus and pimecrolimus were licensed in 2000, and subsequently phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE‐4) inhibitors such as crisaborole, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as ruxolitinib and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators such as tapinarof have subsequently become available or are in development. There is a lack of comparative effectiveness research in eczema, as in many other areas of healthcare. This paucity makes it very difficult for health care professionals and patients to decide which treatment is best in terms of benefits and the least harms. It also hampers guideline development. Network meta‐analysis (NMA) is a tool developed for indirectly evaluating the relative effectiveness and safety of interventions used to treat the same condition. One NMA that included different interventions in addition to topical anti‐inflammatory treatments was published after our work started.

We conducted a NMA focussed on use of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for treating eczema, in order to statistically rank and compare the effectiveness and safety of different topical anti‐inflammatory treatments.

Atopic dermatitis guideline — scope states that this guideline addresses the treatment of pediatric and adult atopic dermatitis (AD) of all severities and that the treatment of other forms of eczematous dermatitis is outside the scope of this document. Recommendations on AD management are subdivided into 4 sections to update and expand on the clinical information and recommendations previously published in 2004. This document is the final in the series of 4 publications and discusses the management and control of AD flares using topical modalities and the utility and timing of allergen testing and avoidance, and also discusses the use of adjunctive therapies and approaches, such as environmental, dietary, and educational interventions, in addition to complementary therapies.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^31529a08]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Emollients are universally recommended for atopic dermatitis/eczema ('eczema'), to improve the skin barrier and reduce symptoms. However, our knowledge of the frequency and nature of adverse effects associated with their use is limited.

Objectives

We sought to determine how well adverse events are reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of emollients for eczema.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched from inception (1946) to May 2022. Inclusion criteria were RCTs of moisturizers or emollients used as a leave-on treatment (as the intervention or control) in adults or children with eczema. Exclusion criteria were non-RCTs; patients with other diagnoses included; use of emollient as bath additives, soap substitutes or as preventative; and not published in English. References of eligible papers were reviewed for any additional, relevant research. Data were extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and analysed descriptively. An assessment of study quality was carried out using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for RCTs.

Results

From 369 potential papers, 35 papers (reporting on 34 studies) were included. Most research was conducted in research centres or hospitals (unclear in 34%). In total, 89% reported collecting data on adverse events related to emollient treatment use but the methods used were poorly reported (40% unclear). Four papers used patient questionnaires/diaries. However, it was unclear how and what was collected as only two studies showed the questionnaires used.

Conclusions

Reporting of adverse events related to emollient use in trials of patients with eczema is poor and inconsistent. Agreement should be reached on how and what adverse events should be collected, to standardize reporting across studies.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^d9e40110]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti-inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti-inflammatory treatments.

Objectives

To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included within-participant or between-participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti-inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti-inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient-reported eczema symptoms, clinician-reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life, long-term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application-site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high-income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry-funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti-inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta-analysis (NMA) was only possible for short-term outcomes. Patient-reported symptoms NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE-4 inhibitors. NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD -1.99, 95% CI -3.25 to -0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -1.57, 95% CI -2.42 to -0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI. A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient-reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Clinician-reported signs NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE-4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE-4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness. NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD -2.69, 95% CI -3.36, -2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD -1.87, 95% CI -2.69, -1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class-level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI. A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA. Investigator Global Assessment NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class-level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE-4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta-analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants). Local adverse effects NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application-site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions. NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%. NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term (median 3 weeks, range 1–16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer-term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).

Authors' Conclusions

Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE-4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application-site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short-term TCS but an increase with longer-term TCS.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — topical corticosteroids after moisturization failure: In patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a topical corticosteroid over no topical corticosteroid (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). The linked systematic review and NMA synthesized 219 RCTs enrolling 43,123 infants, children, and adults with primarily mild-moderate AD addressing 68 different treatments, and TCS, used in RCTs mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, probably did not importantly increase adverse effects, including skin infections, atrophy, or other local skin changes. A Cochrane systematic review reported 26 cases of skin atrophy of 3574 RCT children and adult participants applying mild, moderate, and potent TCS for primarily either 1 to 6 weeks or 16 to 20 weeks (raw proportion: 7 per 1000 [95% CI, 5–11 per 1000]).

UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)

Key areas where this review supports NICE guidance (NICE 2007).

NICE says do not use very potent preparations in children without specialist dermatological advice. Most cases of skin thinning collated into this review were in participants using very potent steroids. We assessed the evidence found within this review relating to the rates of skin thinning using GRADE as low or very low certainty.
NICE says start with mild steroids for those with mild eczema. Within the potent versus mild topical corticosteroid comparison, there was no difference between mild and potent topical corticosteroid in participants with mild to moderate eczema, suggesting that mild steroids may work well enough for this group, however this only considered 43 participants from two trials and the confidence interval was wide compared to the data in moderate to severe eczema, which favoured potent topical corticosteroid. Furthermore, as there were more reports of skin thinning in more potent steroids, the trade‐off of more effectiveness from higher potency does not seem necessary for this group unless it fails to control the flare. The evidence for potency in relation to specific disease severities was not GRADE‐assessed independently from the overall analysis of potency.
NICE says healthcare professionals should discuss risks and benefits, emphasising that the benefits outweigh possible harms when topical corticosteroid are applied correctly. Most participants had a good response to topical corticosteroids, these results were taken from within trials usually GRADE‐assessed to be of moderate certainty. Rates of adverse events such as skin thinning were generally very low, though we GRADE‐assessed this evidence as low or very low certainty.
NICE says prescribe according to lowest acquisition cost. We did not find any data that compared generic and branded topical corticosteroids.
NICE says healthcare professionals should consider treating problem areas of atopic eczema with topical corticosteroids for two consecutive days per week to prevent flares, instead of treating flares as they arise, in children with frequent flares (2 or 3 per month) once the eczema has been controlled. This strategy should be reviewed within three months to six months to assess effectiveness. This review supports weekend (proactive) therapy for the prevention of eczema flares, including in children, however more trials are needed to verify for how long this should be continued (effectiveness evidence for weekend (proactive) therapy GRADE‐assessed as moderate certainty).
This review confirms the research gap identified by NICE regarding a lack of good, long‐term data on topical corticosteroid safety. For example, we GRADE‐assessed the safety data reported for the main comparisons reported in the summary of findings tables as low or very low certainty.

### Guidance on the diagnosis and clinical management of atopic eczema [^acb3727c]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

This article discusses the effects of atopic eczema, how to diagnose it confidently, and the options available for treatment, especially in primary care. We also suggest when referral to dermatology departments in secondary care should be considered, and try to anticipate some frequently asked questions.

### Optimizing outcomes for paediatric atopic dermatitis [^2749ca3d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is considered the most prevalent chronic inflammatory condition in very young children, with a prevalence approaching 20% in some industrialized countries. Recent advances in the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of AD - particularly in relation to genetically determined skin barrier dysfunction and the role of microbial infections in AD flares - have helped to galvanize thinking on approaches to treatment in young patients. Topical anti-inflammatory medicines (corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors) in addition to emollients are the mainstay of therapy in children, but parents need help to understand how and when to apply them and reassurance to allay their fears about the long-term effects of these treatments. At the same time, more work is required in order to identify which clinical signs, symptoms, long-term control of flares, and quality of life measures are the best outcome domains for AD clinical trials in order to continue to improve control of AD in children.

Strategy‐focused reviews

Daily frequency

This review accords with previous systematic reviews (Green 2004; Green 2005), in concluding that there is probably (evidence GRADE‐assessed as moderate certainty) no benefit of topical corticosteroid application more than once daily, building on that initial work with the addition of data from two newer RCTs (Del Rosso 2009; Schlessinger 2006), and several older and foreign language publications (Amerio 1998; Harder 1983; Lebwohl 1999; Nolting 1991; Rafanelli 1993; Rampini 1992a; Ryu 1997). Green and colleagues did include data from an unpublished trial, which could not be obtained for this review (GSK 1995). However, given that the conclusion of this review agrees with Green 2004, it is unlikely to change should GSK 1995 be included in future.

Weekend therapy

The results presented in this review confirm that weekend (proactive) therapy is probably (evidence GRADE‐assessed as moderate certainty) of benefit in preventing flares and update the findings of a previous systematic review (Schmitt 2011), with the addition of four further RCTs, two of which we were able to pool.

Wet wrap

Our review included the same six trials of wet wrap therapy as a previous review that also showed there may be little or no benefit of wet wrap (not GRADE‐assessed), and cases of skin infection with wet wraps (González‐López 2017). However, the effectiveness results in this review are numerically different because of the method used to include within‐participant trials and adjust for baseline differences between groups where possible.

### Developing drugs for treatment of atopic dermatitis in children (≥ 3 months to… [^f9e8f6f9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic skin disease, and it primarily affects children. Although atopic dermatitis (AD) has the highest effect on burden of skin disease, no high-level studies have defined optimal therapy for severe disease. Corticosteroids have been used to treat AD since the 1950s and remain the only systemic medication with Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication in children, despite published guidelines of care that recommend against this option. Several clinical trials with level 1 evidence have supported the use of topical treatments for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children, but these trials have had little consistency in protocol design. Consensus recommendations will help standardize clinical development and trial design for children. The Food and Drug Administration issues guidance documents for industry as a source for "the Agency's current thinking on a particular subject". Although they are nonbinding, industry considers these documents to be the standard for clinical development and trial design. Our consensus group is the first to specifically address clinical trial design in this population. We developed a draft guidance document for industry, Developing Drugs for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in Children (≥ 3 months to < 18 years of age). This draft guidance has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration based on a provision in the Federal Register (Good Guidance Practices).

### Interventions for hand eczema [^d5aaed80]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hand eczema is an inflammation of the skin of the hands that tends to run a chronic, relapsing course. This common condition is often associated with itch, social stigma, and impairment in employment. Many different interventions of unknown effectiveness are used to treat hand eczema.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical and systemic interventions for hand eczema in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the following up to April 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, LILACS, GREAT, and four trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared interventions for hand eczema, regardless of hand eczema type and other affected sites, versus no treatment, placebo, vehicle, or active treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were participant- and investigator-rated good/excellent control of symptoms, and adverse events.

Main Results

We included 60 RCTs, conducted in secondary care (5469 participants with mild to severe chronic hand eczema). Most participants were over 18 years old. The duration of treatment was short, generally up to four months. Only 24 studies included a follow-up period. Clinical heterogeneity in treatments and outcome measures was evident. Few studies performed head-to-head comparisons of different interventions. Risk of bias varied considerably, with only five studies at low risk in all domains. Twenty-two studies were industry-funded. Eighteen trials studied topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors; 10 studies, phototherapy; three studies, systemic immunosuppressives; and five studies, oral retinoids. Most studies compared an active intervention against no treatment, variants of the same medication, or placebo (or vehicle). Below, we present results from the main comparisons. Corticosteroid creams/ointments: when assessed 15 days after the start of treatment, clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam probably improves participant-rated control of symptoms compared to vehicle (risk ratio (RR) 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38 to 3.91; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 8; 1 study, 125 participants); the effect of clobetasol compared to vehicle for investigator-rated improvement is less clear (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.40). More participants had at least one adverse event with clobetasol (11/62 versus 5/63; RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.82 to 6.06), including application site burning/pruritus. This evidence was rated as moderate certainty. When assessed 36 weeks after the start of treatment, mometasone furoate cream used thrice weekly may slightly improve investigator-rated symptom control compared to twice weekly (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.61; 1 study, 72 participants) after remission is reached. Participant-rated symptoms were not measured. Some mild atrophy was reported in both groups (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.83; 5/35 versus 3/37). This evidence was rated as low certainty. Irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light: local combination ultraviolet light therapy (PUVA) may lead to improvement in investigator-rated symptom control when compared to local narrow-band UVB after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.16; 1 study, 60 participants). However, the 95% CI indicates that PUVA might make little or no difference. Participant-rated symptoms were not measured. Adverse events (mainly erythema) were reported by 9/30 participants in the narrow-band UVB group versus none in the PUVA group. This evidence was rated as moderate certainty. Topical calcineurin inhibitors: tacrolimus 0.1% over two weeks probably improves investigator-rated symptom control measured after three weeks compared to vehicle (14/14 tacrolimus versus 0/14 vehicle; 1 study). Participant-rated symptoms were not measured. Four of 14 people in the tacrolimus group versus zero in the vehicle group had well-tolerated application site burning/itching. A within-participant study in 16 participants compared 0.1% tacrolimus to 0.1% mometasone furoate but did not measure investigator- or participant-rated symptoms. Both treatments were well tolerated when assessed at two weeks during four weeks of treatment. Evidence from these studies was rated as moderate certainty. Oral interventions: oral cyclosporin 3 mg/kg/d probably slightly improves investigator-rated (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.99; 1 study, 34 participants) or participant-rated (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.27) control of symptoms compared to topical betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% after six weeks of treatment. The risk of adverse events such as dizziness was similar between groups (up to 36 weeks; RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.86, n = 55; 15/27 betamethasone versus 19/28 cyclosporin). The evidence was rated as moderate certainty. Alitretinoin 10 mg improves investigator-rated symptom control compared with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.07; NNTB 11, 95% CI 6.3 to 26.5; 2 studies, n = 781) and alitretinoin 30 mg also improves this outcome compared with placebo (RR 2.75, 95% CI 2.20 to 3.43; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; 2 studies, n = 1210). Similar results were found for participant-rated symptom control: alitretinoin 10 mg RR 1.73 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.40) and 30 mg RR 2.75 (95% CI 2.18 to 3.48). Evidence was rated as high certainty. The number of adverse events (including headache) probably did not differ between alitretinoin 10 mg and placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; 1 study, n = 158; moderate-certainty evidence), but the risk of headache increased with alitretinoin 30 mg (RR 3.43, 95% CI 2.45 to 4.81; 2 studies, n = 1210; high-certainty evidence). Outcomes were assessed between 48 and 72 weeks.

Authors' Conclusions

Most findings were from single studies with low precision, so they should be interpreted with caution. Topical corticosteroids and UV phototherapy were two of the major standard treatments, but evidence is insufficient to support one specific treatment over another. The effect of topical calcineurin inhibitors is not certain. Alitretinoin is more effective than placebo in controlling symptoms, but advantages over other treatments need evaluating. Well-designed and well-reported, long-term (more than three months), head-to-head studies comparing different treatments are needed. Consensus is required regarding the definition of hand eczema and its subtypes, and a standard severity scale should be established. The main limitation was heterogeneity between studies. Small sample size impacted our ability to detect differences between treatments.

### Wet wrap therapy in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis [^8c197aa3]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

National and international guidelines address stepwise atopic dermatitis (AD) management. Wet wrap therapy (WWT) is important as an acute therapeutic intervention for treatment of moderate to severe AD. Using clothing instead of bandages makes this intervention simpler, less time intensive, and less expensive. Education of patients and caregivers is critical to success; methodology must be standardized. Future studies must carefully describe all procedure components. Incorporation of validated outcomes tools would help with interpretation. WWT should be considered as a potential treatment option ahead of systemic immunosuppressive therapies for patients failing conventional therapy.

### New insights and treatments in atopic dermatitis [^cf7c5304]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a complex, chronic inflammatory skin disorder with significant morbidity. It is often a frustrating condition for both children and parents due to chronic and relapsing course. There is now an increasing understanding of the disease pathogenesis resulting in discovery of much wanted newer therapeutics and targeted therapies after a long time. Whether these interventions will result in sustained benefits or long term cure remains to be seen.

Materials and methods

Study design

We conducted an online, anonymous, multiple‐response survey among European dermatologists caring for adult patients with moderate‐to‐severe AE. Moderate‐to‐severe AE was defined as AE that is not adequately controlled by standard and optimized topical treatment. Participants were asked to make decisions for patients who did not have an acute flare.

The survey was developed in Snap Surveys software, was available in the English language and was pilot tested. As this study is not part of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO), a medical ethics committee was not consulted. The survey was live from 5 March 2018 to 28 September 2018. In total five reminders were sent.

Effects of interventions

See: Table 1; Table 2; Table 3; Table 4; Table 5; Table 6; Table 7

See Table 1: Moderate‐ versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroid; Table 2: Potent versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroid; Table 3: Potent versus moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid; Table 4: Very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid; Table 5: Twice or more versus once daily topical corticosteroid; Table 6: Duration of use for induction of remission; and Table 7: Weekend therapy versus no topical corticosteroid.

We reported all relevant outcomes from the included trials for 18 pairwise comparisons. We considered seven of these the main comparisons in our review because of their relevance to clinical practice, and we rated the quality of evidence for these outcomes using GRADE.

We have performed subgroup analyses throughout, where there were sufficient data, with respect to age and baseline severity of eczema. As there were consistently insufficient data with which to compare effectiveness at different anatomical sites it was not possible to conduct subgroup analyses for any of the comparisons in this review.

Where possible, we did sensitivity analyses removing trials at high risk of bias. The results were generally consistent or based on insufficient trials (see: Table 13), and points of particular interest are highlighted under the relevant comparison. In addition, we examined the effects of Becker‐Balagtas correction of the variance from within‐participant trials, and imputation of missing standard deviations for a range of intraclass correlation coefficients (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75; Table 12 and Table 14).

Potency comparisons

Strategies in this review regarding potency were focused on clinically relevant comparisons that reflected the 'stepping‐up' strategies for treating eczema, including moderate versus mild, potent versus mild, potent versus moderate, and very potent versus potent topical corticosteroid.

Moderate‐ versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroid

See: Table 1.

This comparison comprises 12 trials; six parallel‐group (Bagatell 1983; Jorizzo 1995; Lucky 1997; Mobacken 1986; Queille 1984; Rossi 2002) and six within‐participant (Haribhakti 1982; Kuokkanen 1987; Meenan 1963; Munro 1975; Portnoy 1969; Roth 1978a). In all trials only the potency of topical corticosteroid varied between groups, none compared multiple strategies.

Data were available for all outcomes relevant to this review.

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2019. part 2: treatment [^c37534cf]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This review forms part of a series of annual evidence updates on atopic eczema (AE), and provides a summary of key findings from systematic reviews (SRs) published or indexed in 2019 related to AE treatment. Several SRs assessed the efficacy of topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors and topical Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway inhibitors. However, there is a lack of good-quality trials comparing topical treatment agents with TCS, which remain the standard of care for patients with AE. Most of the included trials lack meaningful comparisons as they used vehicle as a comparator. There is also lack of harmonization of outcome measures for AE across studies. Large, well-designed RCTs are needed to further determine whether any specific emollients offer superior benefit. There is evidence highlighting limited benefit of oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment of eczema. Mycophenolate mofetil may have a role in patients with refractory AE. Among biologic therapies, most of the efficacy data relate to dupilumab. Furthermore, there is growing evidence for the efficacy and safety of systemic JAK/STAT pathway inhibitors, but the existing data are of low quality.

Quality of the evidence

We GRADE assessed almost all clinician‐reported effectiveness outcomes as moderate, with only one judged very low. The reason for downgrading the effectiveness outcomes was due to issues identified by the risk of bias assessment and in the comparison classed as low, imprecision. Only half of the comparisons from the summary of findings table reported complete numerical data for the most reported patient‐reported outcome; patient global assessment. Of those that did, one provided moderate‐quality evidence, one low, and one very low. The reason for downgrading the data obtained from this analysis was again issues from the risk of bias assessment, and in the trials assessed as low, unexplained heterogeneity. In the comparison classed as very low, small numbers of events and participants meant we downgraded the comparison twice for this outcome in addition to the risk of bias concerns.

We judged all but one comparison low with regards to the data concerning skin thinning. This was again due to issues highlighted by the risk of bias assessment and imprecision. The comparison in which we classed the skin thinning data as very low was downgraded twice for imprecision due to low numbers of events and participants.

In all assessments of the evidence associated with abnormal cortisol assessment, we judged the certainty of the evidence as very low. This was due to risk of bias issues and low numbers of events and participants. One comparison also demonstrated inconsistency.

Where we sought further information from authors relating to risk of bias assessments, our requests for further data did not always get a response (see Table 10). In many cases, this is likely owing to the age of the included trials.

We did not downgrade any GRADE assessments due to publication bias. However, only two analyses that included assessment of short‐term IGA from the potent versus moderate and twice or more versus once daily topical corticosteroid comparisons, included enough trials to allow the generation of valid funnel plots. Both showed no clear asymmetry (Figure 5 relating to Analysis 3.1; Figure 6 relating to Analysis 7.1).

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^24429776]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most burdensome skin condition worldwide and cannot currently be prevented or cured. Topical anti‐inflammatory treatments are used to control eczema symptoms, but there is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness and safety of different topical anti‐inflammatory treatments.

Objectives

To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for people with eczema using a network meta‐analysis.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries on 29 June 2023, and checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection criteria

We included within‐participant or between‐participant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people of any age with eczema of any severity, but excluded trials in clinically infected eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, contact eczema, or hand eczema. We included topical anti‐inflammatory treatments used for at least one week, compared with another anti‐inflammatory treatment, no treatment, or vehicle/placebo. Vehicle is a 'carrier system' for an active pharmaceutical substance, which may also be used on its own as an emollient for dry skin. We excluded trials of topical antibiotics used alone, complementary therapies, emollients used alone, phototherapy, wet wraps, and systemic treatments.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were patient‐reported eczema symptoms, clinician‐reported eczema signs and investigator global assessment. Secondary outcomes were health‐related quality of life, long‐term control of eczema, withdrawal from treatment/study, and local adverse effects (application‐site reactions, pigmentation changes and skin thinning/atrophy were identified as important concerns through patient and public involvement). We used CINeMA to quantify our confidence in the evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included 291 studies involving 45,846 participants with the full spectrum of eczema severity, mainly conducted in high‐income countries in secondary care settings. Most studies included adults, with only 31 studies limited to children aged < 12 years. Studies usually included male and female participants, multiple ethnic groups but predominantly white populations. Most studies were industry‐funded (68%) or did not report their funding sources/details. Treatment duration and trial participation were a median of 21 and 28 days (ranging from 7 days to 5 years), respectively. Interventions used were topical corticosteroids (TCS) (172), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (134), phosphodiesterase‐4 (PDE‐4) inhibitors (55), janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (30), aryl hydrocarbon receptor activators (10), or other topical agents (21). Comparators included vehicle (170) or other anti‐inflammatory treatments. The risk of bias was high in 242 of the 272 (89.0%) trials contributing to data analyses, most commonly due to concerns about selective reporting. Network meta‐analysis (NMA) was only possible for short‐term outcomes.

Patient‐reported symptoms

NMA of 40 trials (6482 participants) reporting patient‐reported symptoms as a binary outcome ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 6.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 32.98), potent TCS (OR 5.99, 95% CI 2.83 to 12.69), and ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 5.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 25.25) as the most effective, all with low confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, and crisaborole 2% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and was more effective than mild TCI and PDE‐4 inhibitors.

NMA of 29 trials (3839 participants) reporting patient‐reported symptoms as a continuous outcome ranked very potent TCS (SMD ‐1.99, 95% CI ‐3.25 to ‐0.73; low confidence) and tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD ‐1.57, 95% CI –2.42 to ‐0.72; moderate confidence) the highest. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial of 60 participants at high risk of bias. Roflumilast 0.15%, delgocitinib 0.25% or 0.5%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and mild/moderate TCS was less effective than mild TCI.

A further 50 trials (9636 participants) reported patient‐reported symptoms as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA.

Clinician‐reported signs

NMA of 32 trials (4121 participants) reported clinician signs as a binary outcome and ranked potent TCS (OR 8.15, 95% CI 4.99, 13.57), tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 8.06, 95% CI 3.30, 19.67), ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 7.72, 95% CI 4.92, 12.10), and delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 7.61, 95% CI 3.72, 15.58) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, roflumilast 0.15%, crisaborole 2%, and tapinarof 1% were the least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS more effective than potent TCI, mild TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE‐4 inhibitors; and mild TCS and PDE‐4 inhibitors had similar effectiveness.

NMA of 49 trials (5261 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome and ranked tacrolimus 0.03% (SMD ‐2.69, 95% CI ‐3.36, ‐2.02) and very potent TCS (SMD ‐1.87, 95% CI ‐2.69, ‐1.05) as most effective, both with moderate confidence; roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and tapinarof 1% were ranked as least effective. Direct information for tacrolimus 0.03% was based on one trial in 60 participants with a high risk of bias. For some sensitivity analyses, potent TCS, tacrolimus 0.1%, ruxolitinib 1.5%, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% became some of the most effective treatments. Class‐level analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors, and moderate/mild TCS was more effective than mild TCI.

A further 100 trials (22,814 participants) reported clinician signs as a continuous outcome but could not be included in NMA.

Investigator Global Assessment

NMA of 140 trials (23,383 participants) reported IGA as a binary outcome and ranked ruxolitinib 1.5% (OR 9.34, 95% CI 4.8, 18.18), delgocitinib 0.5% (OR 10.08, 95% CI 2.65, 38.37), delgocitinib 0.25% (OR 6.87, 95% CI 1.79, 26.33), very potent TCS (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.73, 14.67), potent TCS (OR 5.00, 95% CI 3.80, 6.58), and tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 5.06, 95% CI 3.59, 7.13) as most effective, all with moderate confidence. Mild TCS, crisaborole 2%, pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 0.3% and 1%, and tacrolimus 0.03% were the least effective. In a sensitivity analysis of low risk of bias information (12 trials, 1639 participants), potent TCS, delgocitinib 0.5% and delgocitinib 0.25% were most effective, and pimecrolimus 1%, roflumilast 0.15%, difamilast 1% and difamilast 0.3% least effective. Class‐level sensitivity analysis found potent/very potent TCS had similar effectiveness to potent TCI and JAK inhibitors and were more effective than PDE‐4 inhibitors; mild/moderate TCS were less effective than potent TCI and had similar effectiveness to mild TCI.

Longer‐term outcomes over 6 to 12 months showed a possible increase in effectiveness for pimecrolimus 1% versus vehicle (4 trials, 2218 participants) in a pairwise meta‐analysis, and greater treatment success with mild/moderate TCS than pimecrolimus 1% (based on 1 trial of 2045 participants).

Local adverse effects

NMA of 83 trials (18,992 participants, 2424 events) reporting application‐site reactions ranked tacrolimus 0.1% (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53, 3.17; moderate confidence), crisaborole 2% (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.18, 3.81; high confidence), tacrolimus 0.03% (OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.10, 2.09; low confidence), and pimecrolimus 1% (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01, 2.04; low confidence) as most likely to cause site reactions. Very potent, potent, moderate, and mild TCS were least likely to cause site reactions.

NMA of eight trials (1786 participants, 3 events) reporting pigmentation changes found no evidence for increased pigmentation changes with TCS and crisaborole 2%, with low confidence for mild, moderate or potent TCS and moderate confidence for crisaborole 2%.

NMA of 25 trials (3691 participants, 36 events) reporting skin thinning found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short‐term (median 3 weeks, range 1‐16 weeks) use of mild TCS (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.12, 4.31), moderate TCS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.16, 5.33), potent TCS (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.21, 4.43) or very potent TCS (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.31, 2.49), all with low confidence. Longer‐term outcomes over 6 to 60 months showed increased skin thinning with mild to potent TCS versus TCI (3 trials, 4069 participants, 6 events with TCS).

Authors' conclusions

Potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as amongst the most effective topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema and PDE‐4 inhibitors as amongst the least effective. Mild TCS and tapinarof 1% were ranked amongst the least effective treatments in three of five efficacy networks. TCI and crisaborole 2% were ranked most likely to cause local application‐site reactions and TCS least likely. We found no evidence for increased skin thinning with short‐term TCS but an increase with longer‐term TCS.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: a cochrane systematic review and network meta-analysis [^cb7e9f88]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this Cochrane systematic review and NMA of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema, we found potent TCS, JAK inhibitors and the TCI tacrolimus 0.1% were consistently ranked as among the most effective topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema. Our confidence in the findings was low or moderate, largely due to concerns about selective reporting; and we were not able to reliably rank the comparative effectiveness of these three treatments. Safety data were limited, but local application site reactions were most common with tacrolimus 0.1% and the PDE‐4 inhibitor crisaborole 2%. Although skin thinning was not increased with short‐term (< 16 weeks) use of any TCS potency, skin thinning was reported as an adverse effect in 0.3% participants treated with TCS for 6 to 60 months.

These findings largely relate to short‐term use of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for treating non‐severe eczema in adults living in high‐income countries. There is a need for more work to identify longer‐term outcomes, to evaluate effectiveness and safety in young children, in whom eczema is most common, and in low‐middle income countries. For example, recent trials have reported no impact of intermittent mild–moderate TCS on young children's growth over up to 5 years, but significant growth suppression when a proactive potent TCS regimen is used in infants with eczema. We did not formally evaluate cost effectiveness, but it is worthwhile noting that per gram, TCI, JAK inhibitors, PDE‐4 inhibitors and AHR activators typically cost 4–20 times more than TCS.

Our findings are broadly consistent with previous literature, including a recent NMA of topical anti‐inflammatory treatments for eczema. However, there are some differences in emphasis between the two NMA findings, including slightly lower efficacy ranking of JAK inhibitors by Chu et al. and a different focus of adverse event outcomes. Inclusion criteria differed between the two NMAs, and there were some differences in methodology. For example, the review of Chu et al. excluded within‐participant trials, and included complementary therapy, moisturisers, non‐licensed treatment regimens and secondary prevention of eczema flares using regular anti‐inflammatory treatment which were not part of this Cochrane review. This is likely to explain any differences in rankings between the two NMAs, for comparable outcomes. Our finding that TCS rarely cause skin thinning is consistent with the conclusions of a separate Cochrane review evaluating strategies for intermittent short‐term treatment of eczema with TCS.

### Emollient bath additives for the treatment of childhood eczema (BATHE): multicentre pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness [^64480221]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This trial provides strong evidence that emollient bath additives provide minimal or no additional benefit beyond standard eczema care in the management of eczema in children.

The BATHE trial was an adequately powered trial, with high follow-up rates and good adherence to trial intervention allocations. The study has strong external validity as it was pragmatic in design to reflect normal practice, and, despite the relatively low response rate, participants were broadly reflective of children with eczema seen in primary care. We used a participant reported outcome measure with good validity that has been accepted by international consensus. A participant reported outcome could be biased in favour of finding a positive effect of trial intervention owing to a perception of benefits of treatment. However, the negative result of the trial suggests that this was not the case.

This trial was large; previous reviews of the literature have not been able to draw conclusions owing to the small size of existing trials.

We cannot exclude the possibility of a small benefit among children bathing more than five times a week or among children aged less than 5 years, but differences are sufficiently small to be unlikely to be clinically useful. Furthermore, caution is needed in interpreting these underpowered subgroup analyses as statistically significant results might arise because the data have been tested multiple times rather than because a genuine difference exists between the groups.

These findings are timely for clinicians and prescribing advisers, as prescribing guidelines vary widely in their advice on the use of bath additives, and pressure on budgets has led to formularies becoming increasingly restrictive. Reviews have estimated that bath additives might contribute to up to one third of the costs of eczema in the United Kingdom. Our findings provide evidence that can contribute to effective prescribing in this area, where there is currently little research evidence to guide decision making. These findings are also useful for families with members who have eczema as they have more certainty about directing their efforts towards more effective treatments.

Our findings are only relevant to the use of emollient bath additives. More research is needed into optimal regimens for other emollients, although there is strong evidence that regular use of leave-on emollients prevents flare-ups in eczema, and there is widespread clinical consensus around the role of emollients as soap substitutes.

### Use of systemic corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis: international eczema council consensus statement [^54af9698]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Among a large international group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in AD, we reached consensus on 12 key statements related to the use of systemic CS for severe AD. The results provide a framework for clinicians caring for patients with severe AD who are considering systemic CS as a treatment option. Most notably, the group agreed on the statements that, for patients of any age, systemic CS should generally be avoided but may be used rarely, and strongly opposed the statements that systemic CS should be used regularly for severe AD.

While our group agreed that systemic CS use should be limited, consensus was reached on several clinical situations in which systemic CS may be appropriate. These included disease‐related factors, such as severe acute flares, as well as patient‐related factors, such as important life events. Additionally, 72% of participants agreed that systemic CS could be considered a bridging treatment to other systemic treatments. While ciclosporin acts rapidly for acute AD flares, it may be contraindicated in some patients. Methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate take several weeks to exert their clinical effects and so, in some circumstances, taking advantage of the rapid onset of action of systemic CS while waiting for a safer long‐term alternative to work may be appropriate. There are also some circumstances in which other systemic treatment options are not acceptable; for example, a recent diagnosis of cancer along with a history of alcoholism would be a contraindication to the use of ciclosporin, azathioprine and mycophenolate (owing to malignancy risk) and methotrexate (owing to the risk of liver disease).

### What's new in atopic eczema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2016. part 1: treatment and prevention [^838dbd03]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review is part of a series of annual updates summarizing the evidence base for atopic eczema (AE). It provides a summary of key findings from 28 systematic reviews that were published or indexed during 2016 with a focus on treatment and prevention of AE. There is reasonable evidence of benefit for topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, a glycyrrhetinic acid-containing preparation (Atopiclair ®), oral ciclosporin, oral azathioprine, narrowband ultraviolet B radiation and education programmes. Overall, there is evidence that topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors have similar efficacy and that both can prevent AE flares when used twice weekly as maintenance therapy. However, topical calcineurin inhibitors are costlier and have more adverse reactions, thus topical corticosteroids should remain the standard of care for patients with AE. There is no evidence that multiple applications are better than once-daily application of topical corticosteroid. There is inconsistent evidence to support omalizumab and specific allergen immunotherapy use in AE. There is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation and synbiotics reduce AE severity, although the margin of improvement may not be clinically meaningful. There is little evidence to support the use of wet wraps or of complementary/alternative medicine (including Chinese herbal medicine). There is some evidence to suggest that a diet high in fish in infancy may be preventative for AE, but other dietary interventions for the prevention of AE show little promise. This review provides a succinct guide for clinicians and patients wishing to remain up to date with the latest evidence for the treatment and prevention of AE.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines 2023: highlights [^9f5fc744]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder, with a complex pathogenesis. It is characterized by eczematous skin lesions, pruritus, and recurrent skin infections and has a negative impact on patients' and caregivers' quality of life. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force Atopic Dermatitis Guideline Panel recently released updated AD guidelines. This guideline focuses on addressing clinical questions using trustworthy guideline development standards, including mitigating the potential influence of financial and nonfinancial conflicts of interest, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. A multidisciplinary panel used systematic reviews and meta-analyses to inform specific recommendations addressing optimal use of topical treatments, dilute bleach bath, dietary avoidance/elimination, allergen immunotherapy, and systemic treatments. The comprehensive recommendations, emphasizing the third principle of evidence-based medicine-that evidence alone is never enough, and that patient values and preferences must be carefully considered when determining optimal treatments for patients and populations-provide a framework to support clinicians in selecting an optimal treatment plan for each patient. This review provides an overview of the guideline and discusses how those recommendations relate to current practice.

Atopic dermatitis — systemic corticosteroids harms and panel rationale — Less than 30 days of oral corticosteroids, for any indication, is associated with sepsis (IRR, 5.3 [95% CI, 3.80–7.41]; 5 vs 1 per 1000), venous thromboembolism (IRR, 3.33 [2.78–3.99]; 8 vs 2 per 1000), and fracture (IRR, 1.87 [1.69–2.07]; 27 vs 14 per 1000). Common adverse events in patients with AD using systemic corticosteroids include rebound flares shortly after drug discontinuation, weight gain, insomnia, adrenal insufficiency, and growth impairment, and clinical experts report repeated cycles rather than accessing safer and more effective long-term control strategies; for multiple indications, repeated cycles of short-term (< 7 days) systemic corticosteroids and long-term systemic corticosteroid use cause a range of common and serious harms. Trials often reported that benefits were transient with disease activity rebounding on discontinuation, and the significant harms and burdens relative to low certainty benefits drove the conditional recommendation and supported against their routine use for flare management or bridge therapy.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^2d9b0b00]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Other strategies examined

Newer, second‐generation topical corticosteroids, fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate, are probably more effective than older topical corticosteroids; use of second‐generation topical corticosteroid is approximately two and a half times more likely to result in cleared or marked improvement on IGA compared to older topical corticosteroid in adults and children with moderate or severe eczema when used in the short term for treating a flare. Most trials tested once daily application of the second‐generation topical corticosteroid in line with the marketing strategy compared to twice‐a‐day use of the older topical corticosteroid, supporting the conclusion that these newer topical corticosteroids are probably more effective. However, given many of these trials were industry funded, an independent trial would be beneficial.

Whether a cream or ointment preparation of the topical corticosteroid is used may have little to no effect on clinical signs of eczema, but the evidence is very uncertain with a high degree of imprecision. Similarly, the data from three trials that compared different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroid was not conclusive. We found no evidence comparing the branded versus a generic version of the same topical corticosteroid.

The frequency that topical corticosteroid is applied each week (i.e. every day or less frequently) may have little to no effect on clinical signs of eczema and safety, but the evidence is very uncertain. Substituting an evening application of topical corticosteroid with a topical calcineurin inhibitor may have little to no effect on effectiveness in children with moderate to severe eczema compared to applying topical corticosteroid twice a day, but the evidence is very uncertain from only one very small trial, with no data on skin thinning or adrenal suppression.

Using topical corticosteroid under wet wraps may have little to no effect on investigator‐assessed signs, but the evidence is very uncertain with a high degree of imprecision, and when we addressed the heterogeneity in the limited meta‐analysis, the results favoured topical corticosteroid without wet wraps. Minimal safety data meant that we could not draw firm conclusions, however, skin infections did occur with wet wraps without corresponding events reported in the participants who did not use wet wraps. The time of day that the topical corticosteroid is applied, whether topical corticosteroid is applied to wet or dry skin, or order of application of topical corticosteroid and emollients may have little to no effect on clinician‐reported signs of eczema or implications for safety, but the evidence is very uncertain from only one or two small trials for each comparison. No trials looked at the optimum time to leave between emollient and topical corticosteroid application.

### How and what adverse events are reported and captured in randomized control trials of emollients in the treatment of eczema? [^d1d94f8c]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The review was prospectively registered on Research Registry (unique number: reviewregistry1441) and conducted/reported in line with PRISMA guidance (Appendix S1; see the Supporting Information).

Literature search

The MEDLINE database (Ovid) was searched from 1946 to May 2022. The search strategy used is given in Appendix S2; see the Supporting Information.

The citations were exported into Microsoft Excel, and their eligibility assessed. Firstly, they were screened using the title and abstract. Next, the remaining papers were read in full to create a list of eligible papers. Lastly, these were then reviewed for any additional papers, which were then added to create the final list to be used for data extraction and analysis. Papers were independently screened by two authors (E.R.E. and S.C. or M. A.) and any questions were discussed with a fourth author (M.J.R.) until a decision was made.

Quality assessment

An overall quality assessment of the papers included was carried out using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for RCTs.M. A. led this assessment and ambiguities were resolved with E.R.E. and M.J.R.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were: RCTs of moisturizers or emollients used as a leave-on treatment (as the intervention or control) in adults or children with atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis. Papers were excluded if: they did not study leave-on emollients or moisturizers (e.g. bath additives or soap substitutes); were not RCTs; included patients with other diagnoses; the use of emollients as preventative treatments; were not published in English; and were not in humans.

Emollients or moisturizers used in the treatment of eczema do not have a strict definition, but for the purposes of this review were defined as products applied directly to the skin to help retain moisture. They did not contain recognized anti-inflammatory agents such as topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors.

The adverse events focused on in this report are those related to the treatment.

Once-daily versus twice-daily application of topical corticosteroids (TCS) or topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) — in patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis using mid-to-high-potency topical treatments, the JTF panel suggests applying the medication once per day over twice per day application (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence); evidence from Nine RCTs comprising 1507 participants showed high-certainty evidence for a small difference between regimens (MD −3.33 [−4.28 to −2.39] on SCORAD scale 0–103; RD to improve by 50% from baseline 5 more per 100 [1–9 more]), which is just above the a priori threshold of 3 per 100 set by the guideline panel, and harms were no different between groups; patient-centered considerations include that patients who value a simpler treatment routine and using less overall medication may prefer once per day application, whereas patients with a more severe flare or who might value resolving it more quickly may prefer twice per day application, and once per day application would use less overall TCS and TCI and could lead to less resource use compared with twice per day application.

### Practical algorithm to inform clinical decision-making in the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis [^64bcd8bb]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder associated with skin barrier dysfunction, the prevalence of which has increased dramatically in developing countries. In this article, we propose a treatment algorithm for patients with mild-to-moderate and severe atopic dermatitis flares in daily clinical practice. An international panel of 15 dermatology and allergy experts from eight countries was formed to develop a practical algorithm for the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis, with a particular focus on topical therapies. In cases of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis involving sensitive skin areas, the topical calcineurin inhibitor pimecrolimus should be applied twice daily at the first signs of atopic dermatitis. For other body locations, patients should apply a topical calcineurin inhibitor, either pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, twice daily at the first signs of atopic dermatitis, such as pruritus, or twice weekly in previously affected skin areas. Emollients should be used regularly. Patients experiencing acute atopic dermatitis flares in sensitive skin areas should apply a topical corticosteroid twice daily or alternate once-daily topical corticosteroid/topical calcineurin inhibitor until symptoms improve. Following improvement, topical corticosteroid therapy should be discontinued and patients switched to a topical calcineurin inhibitor. Maintenance therapy should include the use of pimecrolimus once daily for sensitive areas and tacrolimus for other body locations. This treatment algorithm can help guide clinical decision-making in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^2abfa73f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Eczema and food allergy are common health conditions that usually begin in early childhood and often occur in the same people. They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy.

Objectives

Primary objective To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants. Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy.

Search Methods

We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (≤ 12 months) without pre-existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow-up was required.

Data Collection and Analysis

This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician-assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen.

Main Results

We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review. We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta-analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta-analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only. Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty-five studies, including all those contributing data to meta-analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta-analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow-up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate-certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low-certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low-certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low-certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to over-reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate-certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low-certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low-certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin (FLG) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434, or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy.

Primary objective To assess effects of skin care interventions, such as emollients, for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to July 2020: Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase. We searched two trials registers and checked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We contacted field experts to identify planned trials and to seek information about unpublished or incomplete trials.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (0 to 12 months) without pre-existing diagnosis of eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition were included. Comparison was standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions included moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow-up was required.

Data Collection and Analysis

This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset.

Main Results

This review identified 33 RCTs, comprising 25,827 participants. A total of 17 studies, randomising 5823 participants, reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review. Eleven studies randomising 5217 participants, with 10 of these studies providing IPD, were included in one or more meta-analysis (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta-analysis). Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported our outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. Twenty-five studies, including all those contributing data to meta-analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta-analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow-up ranged from 24 hours to two years. We assessed most of this review's evidence as low certainty or had some concerns of risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. Evidence for the primary food allergy outcome was rated as high risk of bias due to inclusion of only one trial where findings varied when different assumptions were made about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change risk of eczema by one to two years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; moderate-certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) nor time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate-certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). It is unclear whether skin care interventions during infancy change risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by one to two years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.47; 996 participants, 1 trial) or allergic sensitisation to a food allergen at age one to two years (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.69; 1055 participants, 2 trials) due to very low-certainty evidence for these outcomes. Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low-certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial). However, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to significant over-reporting of cow's milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.77; moderate-certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low-certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) or stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low-certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although confidence intervals for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions are wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses show that effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, FLG mutation, or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and risk of developing eczema or food allergy.

Authors' Conclusions

Skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema, and probably increase risk of skin infection. Effects of skin care interventions on risk of food allergy are uncertain. Further work is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might promote or prevent eczema and to evaluate effects on food allergy based on robust outcome assessments.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^22ac505b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Pooled analyses: moderate‐ versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroid

Investigator global assessment (IGA)
We pooled results from four trials for IGA as a short‐term outcome (range 1 to 5 weeks; Bagatell 1983; Jorizzo 1995; Mobacken 1986; Roth 1978a), that included 420 participants; 391 from the parallel‐group trials and 29 from the within‐participant trial (Roth 1978a). The trials used a 5‐, or 6‐point scale and we pooled data from categories corresponding to 'cleared or marked improvement'. In the parallel‐group trials, 86 of 195 participants who used moderate topical corticosteroid achieved cleared or marked improvement in the short‐term compared to 60 of 196 participants who used mild topical corticosteroid. In the within‐participant trial, 24 of 29 sides achieved cleared or marked improvement when treated with moderate topical corticosteroid compared to 17 of 29 sides treated with mild topical corticosteroid (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.04; P = 0.0002; I² = 0%; 4 trials, 449 participants or sides treated; Analysis 1.1), indicating that moderate‐potency topical corticosteroid is more effective than mild‐potency topical corticosteroid. It is expected that one additional person will achieve success for every six participants receiving moderate topical corticosteroid rather than mild topical corticosteroid (95% CI 4 to 12).
We were unable to perform subgroup analyses of trials in adults compared to children owing to the lack of trials in adults only, so we restricted the previous analysis to children only. Two parallel‐group trials (Jorizzo 1995; Mobacken 1986), reported IGA as a short‐term outcome (day 7 to 10), with 169 participants. The OR for achieving cleared or marked improvement was 2.11 (95% CI 1.08 to 4.13; P = 0.03; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 169 participants; Analysis 1.2), in favour of moderate topical corticosteroid.
The three trials that reported baseline severity of eczema were all different severities, therefore subgroup analyses were not appropriate with respect to severity.
We found similar results at end of treatment both overall (range 3 to 5 weeks; Bagatell 1983; Jorizzo 1995; Mobacken 1986; Roth 1978a; OR 2.74. 95% CI 1.47 to 5.11; P = 0.002; I² = 53%; 4 trials, 427 participants or sides treated; Analysis 1.3); and in children only (range 3 to 5 weeks; OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.84 to 8.25; P = 0.0004; I² = 6%; 2 trials, 169 participants; Jorizzo 1995; Mobacken 1986; Analysis 1.4).
Investigator assessment of clinical signs We pooled results from two trials (Haribhakti 1982; Queille 1984), for investigator assessment of clinical signs as a short‐term outcome in children with moderate to severe eczema. There were 30 participants; nine from the parallel‐group trial (Queille 1984), and 21 from the within‐participant trial (Haribhakti 1982). The standardised mean difference (SMD) at day 6 to 7 was a decrease of 0.15 (95% CI −0.27 to 0.56; P = 0.49; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 51 participants or sides treated; Analysis 1.5), suggesting no difference between groups in contrast to the pooled IGA data. We found similar results for end of treatment (range 1 to 3 weeks; SMD 0.43, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.86; P = 0.05; I² = 0%; 2 trials, 51 participants or sides treated; Analysis 1.6). Subgroup analysis was not possible because all trials included in SMD Analysis 1.5 and Analysis 1.6 included children with moderate to severe eczema only.
Number of participants with a greater investigator global assessment (IGA)/patient global assessment (PGA) compared to the other group We pooled data from three within‐participant trials (Meenan 1963; Munro 1975; Portnoy 1969), that included 472 participants, for IGA, in the form of the number of participants for which each topical corticosteroid was judged to be better than the other, as a short‐term outcome and at end of treatment. Two of the trials (Meenan 1963; Portnoy 1969; 64 participants), combined patient judgement with clinician judgement. Moderate topical corticosteroid was judged to be better in 180 participants; mild topical corticosteroid was judged to be better in 106 participants. The OR for the clinician judging one topical corticosteroid to be superior to the other was 3.14 (95% CI 1.39 to 7.13; P = 0.006; I² = 91%; 3 trials, 472 participants; Analysis 1.7). This suggests that moderate topical corticosteroid was more effective than mild‐potency topical corticosteroid in line with the pooled IGA analysis, although this result has a high degree of imprecision and statistical heterogeneity. The increasing concentration of moderate topical corticosteroid used in the moderate arms of Munro 1975 is reflected in how they increasingly favour moderate topical corticosteroid; Meenan 1963 appears as an outlier because none of the participants favoured the mild topical corticosteroid; an artefact of using the generic inverse variance approach to enable consistent pooling of within‐participant trials across this review. Removing the trials judged high risk of bias inflated the result and expanded the 95% confidence interval to include 1 (see: Table 13); OR = 37.51 (95% CI 0.34 to 4133.15). Only Meenan 1963 specified they investigated children only (Analysis 1.7), and none of the trials reported baseline severity, therefore no subgroup analyses were possible.
Data not included in the meta‐analyses We could not include two trials in the meta‐analyses because the numerical data were incomplete. We have summarised these in Analysis 1.8. They did not show any difference between moderate and mild‐potency topical corticosteroid.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^65fb49b0]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis bathing and wet wrap therapy — based on low certainty evidence, bathing for treatment and maintenance in patients with AD can be conditionally recommended, and moisturizers may be applied soon after bathing to improve skin hydration; however, standards for bathing frequency or duration, water temperature, soap type, water softeners, or accessories including bleach for noninfected AD cannot be suggested based on limited evidence. Wet wrap therapy (WWT), in which a topical agent (typically a low or mid potency TCS) is applied then covered by a moistened first layer and a dry external layer, can be used anywhere from 1 hour to 1 day at a time, for up to several weeks if needed. Most data on WWT are from pediatric patients and, based on available pediatric data, WWT with TCS (+ emollient in some studies) are superior to emollient-based wet dressings; in a left-right comparison of 24 patients with acute AD, prednicarbate plus WWT versus prednicarbate alone showed a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, improvement in SCORAD with WWT (MD: 1.4 lower, 95% CI: 2.75 lower to 0.05 lower), with no side effects and no withdrawals during the 14 day follow-up period. WWT requires increased effort and time with patient education to ensure correctness, its benefit in mild disease is questioned, and for patients with moderate to severe AD the work group proposes a conditional recommendation based on low certainty evidence.

### What is "eczema"? [^7bcc1fd7]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

6.5 Significance of defense systems in eczema

Acute and chronic eczema have different pathophysiological significance for defense towards external invaders. Acute eczema provides measures to eliminate contactants and antigens exposed to the skin. The exudative change with spongiosis may be effective to eliminate stimulants or antigens that penetrate through the stratum corneum barrier.

On the other hand, chronic eczema exhibits a different strategy for defense against external stimuli. The histopathologically observed acanthosis and hyperkeratosis can protect from frequent scratching that destructs the skin barrier. The proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes is induced by IL‐22 and helpfully by IL‐17, which are produced by Th17 and/or Th22 cells. Therefore, type 3 immunity is involved in the development of chronic eczema. IL‐17 and IL‐22 also stimulate keratinocytes to produce human β‐defensin‐2 and cathericidin LL‐37. The epidermal defense is thus reconstructed morphologically by thick epidermis and functionally by increased antimicrobial peptides. In eczema, the above events operate sequentially and gradually so that the boundary between acute and chronic eczema is continuous.

Similarly to chronic eczema, type 3 inflammation is also observed in AD, and prurigo nodularis. In AD subtypes, extrinsic versus intrinsic, European/American versus Asian, and early‐onset versus late‐onset AD, while extrinsic, European/American and early‐onset AD show relatively pure type 2 inflammation, intrinsic, Asian, and late‐onset AD have additional type 3 and/or type 1 inflammation. These types seem to be led by virtually the same immunological mechanism as chronic eczema.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^38f75030]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema, is a common and burdensome skin disease. Eczema is most common in early life, affecting up to 20% of infants and about 6% of school‐age children and adolescents and 5% of adults worldwide (De Lusignan 2021; Hay 2014; Langan 2023; Williams 2008). It is a chronic, fluctuating condition that varies in severity. In mild eczema, individuals may have only occasional localised patches of inflamed skin that cause minimal symptoms, but severe eczema causes extensive erythema, excoriations and chronic skin changes such as lichenification.

Eczema can have a substantial impact on quality of life and psychosocial domains (social, academic, and occupational) through persistent itch and the stigma associated with having visibly affected skin (Carroll 2005; Chamlin 2004; Drucker 2017; Lewis‐Jones 2006). The impact on quality of life can exceed that reported in other chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes, especially when eczema is severe or affects readily visible areas (Beattie 2006; Drucker 2017; Kemp 2003; Vittrup 2023). Eczema also causes an economic burden and, in the USA alone, the direct costs of eczema are estimated as over 1 billion US dollars per year (Drucker 2017). Costs which affect people with eczema and their families include buying moisturisers, washing products or special clothing and taking time off work to care for a child with eczema (Carroll 2005).

Table II — Certainty of evidence categories and implications: High certainty evidence indicates being very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate certainty evidence indicates being moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty evidence indicates confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Very low certainty evidence indicates the estimate of effect is very uncertain; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

### Probiotics for treating eczema [^101fb8b7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common chronic skin condition. Probiotics have been proposed as an effective treatment for eczema; their use is increasing, as numerous clinical trials are under way. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2008, which suggested that probiotics may not be an effective treatment for eczema but identified areas in which evidence was lacking.

Objectives

To assess the effects of probiotics for treating patients of all ages with eczema.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to January 2017: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library, the Global Resource of Eczema Trials (GREAT) database, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched a number of conference proceedings. We updated the searches of the main databases in January 2018 and of trials registries in March 2018, but we have not yet incorporated these results into the review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of probiotics (live orally ingested micro-organisms) compared with no treatment, placebo, or other active intervention with no probiotics for the treatment of eczema diagnosed by a doctor.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We recorded adverse events from the included studies and from a separate adverse events search conducted for the first review. We formally assessed reporting bias by preparing funnel plots, and we performed trial sequential analysis for the first primary outcome - eczema symptoms at the end of active treatment. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome (in italic font).

Main Results

We included 39 randomised controlled trials involving 2599 randomised participants. We included participants of either gender, aged from the first year of life through to 55 years (only six studies assessed adults), who had mild to severe eczema. Trials were undertaken in primary and secondary healthcare settings, mainly in Europe or Asia. Duration of treatment ranged from four weeks to six months, and duration of follow-up after end of treatment ranged from zero to 36 months. We selected no standard dose: researchers used a variety of doses and concentrations of probiotics. The probiotics used were bacteria of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species, which were taken alone or combined with other probiotics, and were given with or without prebiotics. Comparators were no treatment, placebo, and other treatments with no probiotics. For all results described in this abstract, the comparator was no probiotics. Active treatment ranged from six weeks to three months for all of the following results, apart from the investigator-rated eczema severity outcome, for which the upper limit of active treatment was 16 weeks. With regard to score, the higher the score, the more severe were the symptoms. All key results reported in this abstract were measured at the end of active treatment, except for adverse events, which were measured during the active treatment period. Probiotics probably make little or no difference in participant- or parent-rated symptoms of eczema (13 trials; 754 participants): symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 20 was 0.44 points lower after probiotic treatment (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.22 to 0.33; moderate-quality evidence). Trial sequential analysis shows that target sample sizes of 258 and 456, which are necessary to demonstrate a minimum mean difference of -2 and -1.5, respectively, with 90% power, have been exceeded, suggesting that further trials with similar probiotic strains for this outcome at the end of active treatment may be futile. We found no evidence suggesting that probiotics make a difference in QoL for patients with eczema (six studies; 552 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.42; low-quality evidence) when measured by the participant or the parent using validated disease-specific QoL instruments. Probiotics may slightly reduce investigator-rated eczema severity scores (24 trials; 1596 participants). On a scale of 0 to 103 for total Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), a score combining investigator-rated eczema severity score and participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss was 3.91 points lower after probiotic treatment than after no probiotic treatment (95% CI -5.86 to -1.96; low-quality evidence). The minimum clinically important difference for SCORAD has been estimated to be 8.7 points. We noted significant to extreme levels of unexplainable heterogeneity between the results of individual studies. We judged most studies to be at unclear risk of bias; six studies had high attrition bias, and nine were at low risk of bias overall. We found no evidence to show that probiotics make a difference in the risk of adverse events during active treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.63; seven trials; 402 participants; low-quality evidence). Studies in our review that reported adverse effects described gastrointestinal symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests that, compared with no probiotic, currently available probiotic strains probably make little or no difference in improving patient-rated eczema symptoms. Probiotics may make little or no difference in QoL for people with eczema nor in investigator-rated eczema severity score (combined with participant scoring for eczema symptoms of itch and sleep loss); for the latter, the observed effect was small and of uncertain clinical significance. Therefore, use of probiotics for the treatment of eczema is currently not evidence-based. This update found no evidence of increased adverse effects with probiotic use during studies, but a separate adverse events search from the first review revealed that probiotic treatment carries a small risk of adverse events. Results show significant, unexplainable heterogeneity between individual trial results. Only a small number of studies measured some outcomes. Future studies should better measure QoL scores and adverse events, and should report on new probiotics. Researchers should also consider studying subgroups of patients (e.g. patients with atopy or food allergies, adults) and standardising doses/concentrations of probiotics given.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^a22866ea]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Pooled analyses: potent versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroid

Investigator global assessment (IGA) We pooled IGA, as a short‐term outcome (range 1 to 4 weeks), from nine trials (Gentry 1973; Giannetti 1981; Handa 1985; Kirkup 2003a; Mali 1976; Ryu 1997; Savin 1976; Veien 1984; Wortzel 1975), that included 392 participants; 326 from the parallel‐group trials and 66 from the within‐participant trials. Most trials used a 4‐, 5‐, or 6‐point scale and we pooled data from categories corresponding to 'cleared or marked improvement' where possible. In the parallel‐group trials, 131 of 165 participants who used potent topical corticosteroid achieved cleared or marked improvement compared to 73 of 161 who used mild topical corticosteroid. In the within‐participant trials, 25 of 66 participants achieved cleared or marked improvement on the side treated with potent topical corticosteroid compared to 16 of 66 on the side treated with mild topical corticosteroid (OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; P < 0.00001; I² = 39%; 9 trials, 458 participants or sides treated; Analysis 2.1), indicating that potent topical corticosteroid is more effective than mild‐potency topical corticosteroid. This corresponds to a need to treat 3.2 people with potent topical corticosteroid to achieve an additional treatment success compared to mild topical corticosteroid (95% CI 2.4 to 5.7). We observed this effect in analyses of trials of a single strategy only, potent versus mild topical corticosteroid (Analysis 2.1.1; Analysis 2.1.2), as well as in multiple strategies including a second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid (Analysis 2.1.3), and a second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid applied once daily versus twice daily application of mild‐potency topical corticosteroid (Analysis 2.1.4). The short‐term time point was the end of treatment for over half of the trials; therefore, we did not carry out a separate end of treatment meta‐analysis. We were unable to perform subgroup analyses of adults and children owing to the lack of trials in adults only, so we restricted the previous short‐term IGA analyses to three trials in children (Giannetti 1981; Kirkup 2003a; Veien 1984). The OR for achieving cleared or marked improvement in the short term was 2.21 (95% CI 1.39 to 3.51; P = 0.0008; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 245 participants or sides treated; Analysis 2.2), in favour of potent topical corticosteroid, consistent with the overall finding. We then pooled IGA as a short‐term outcome from three trials that included participants with moderate to severe eczema (Kirkup 2003a; Savin 1976; Veien 1984). The OR for achieving cleared or marked improvement was 2.69 (95% CI 1.34 to 5.39; P = 0.005; I² = 35%; 3 trials, 232 participants or sides treated; Analysis 2.3.1), in favour of potent topical corticosteroid. Two trials included participants with mild to moderate eczema (Giannetti 1981; Ryu 1997). The OR for achieving cleared or marked improvement was 4.84 (95% CI 0.33 to 71.44; P = 0.25; I² = 80%; 2 trials, 63 participants or sides treated; Analysis 2.3.2). We observed no difference between the two groups when we pooled only trials in mild‐ to moderate‐severity eczema, however, the test for subgroup differences for Analysis 2.3 was not statistically significant, with a P value of 0.68, suggesting that potent topical corticosteroids are more effective than mild‐potency topical corticosteroids regardless of baseline severity of eczema.
Investigator assessment of clinical signs We pooled investigator assessment of clinical signs as a short‐term outcome (day 5 to 6) from two parallel‐group trials in 46 children with severe eczema (Lebrun‐Vignes 2000; Queille 1984). The SMD was a decrease of 0.63 (95% CI −0.95 to 2.21; P = 0.43; I² = 82%; 2 trials, 46 participants; Analysis 2.4) and therefore did not reflect the difference between potent and mild‐potency topical corticosteroid seen in the main pooled IGA analysis. The statistical heterogeneity is high; Queille 1984 favours potent topical corticosteroid while Lebrun‐Vignes 2000 shows no difference, but the number of participants is small, and the confidence intervals do overlap. The short‐term time point was the end of treatment for one of the trials, therefore we did not carry out a separate end of treatment meta‐analysis. Both trials included in SMD Analysis 2.4 included children with severe eczema only, therefore no further restricted analyses were required.
Number of participants with a greater IGA compared to the other group We pooled IGA, in the form of the number of participants for whom each topical corticosteroid was judged to be better than the other, as a short‐term outcome (week 1), from three within‐participant trials in 67 participants (Cahn 1961; Roth 1973; Yasuda 1976). Roth 1973 included participants aged 18 months to 59 years with moderate to severe eczema; Cahn 1961 and Yasuda 1976 did not specify age and severity. The clinician‐reported potent topical corticosteroid to be superior to mild in 39 participants and mild to be superior in six (OR 11.70, 95% CI 5.67 to 24.15; P < 0.00001; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 67 participants; Analysis 2.5) in favour of potent topical corticosteroid. The short‐term time point was the end of treatment for two of the trials, therefore we did not carry out a separate end of treatment meta‐analysis. None of the trials included in Analysis 2.5 were in either adults or children only, and only one trial reported participants' baseline severity (Roth 1973; moderate to severe eczema); therefore, no further subgroup or restricted analyses were possible.
Data not included in the meta‐analyses We could not include nine trials in the meta‐analyses, either because we could not pool the instrument used to measure clinician‐reported signs of eczema alongside those included (Thomas 2002), because the duration was too long relative to the short‐term outcomes pooled (Prado de Oliveira 2002), or because the numerical data were incomplete (Fadrhoncova 1982; Kaplan 1978; Kirkup 2003a; Marten 1980; Noren 1989; Sanabria‐Silva 1991; Vernon 1991), and are summarised in Analysis 2.6. Five trials suggest potent topical corticosteroid to be more effective than mild‐potency topical corticosteroid in line with the meta‐analyses favouring potent topical corticosteroid, but most are difficult to interpret with any certainty due to lack of information about the scale used or lack of dispersion data. The remaining four trials did not show any difference between the two potencies, including Thomas 2002, which compared mild topical corticosteroid used daily with short, three‐day bursts of potent topical corticosteroid. One trial (Sanabria‐Silva 1991), looked for 'rebound', defined as "reactivation of lesions with greater intensity than their pre‐treatment state" in the 10 days after the cessation of topical corticosteroid treatment (end of treatment was 4 weeks). No participants in either the potent topical corticosteroid group (assumed 15 participants) or mild topical corticosteroid group (assumed 15 participants) were reported as having experienced rebound.

### EAACI biologicals guidelines-dupilumab for children and adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^e454dbd8]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity, co-morbidities, complexity in care pathways and differences between national or regional healthcare systems. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of atopic dermatitis, supporting the use of targeted treatments with biologicals. However, there are still many issues that require further clarification. These include the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based), its cost-effectiveness and long-term safety. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each outcome and age group. In addition, future approaches and research priorities are discussed.

### Emollients, education and quality of life: the RCPCH care pathway for children with eczema [^ad02b1f1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) Science and Research Department was commissioned by the Department of Health to develop national care pathways for children with allergies. The eczema pathway focuses on defining the competences to improve the equity of care received by children with eczema.

Method

The eczema pathway was developed by a multidisciplinary working group and was based on a comprehensive review of evidence. The pathway was reviewed by a broad group of stakeholders including paediatricians, allergists, dermatologists, specialist nurses, dietician, patients' representatives and approved by the Allergy Care Pathways Project Board and the RCPCH Clinical Standards Committee. It was also reviewed by a wide range of stakeholders.

Results

The results are presented in three sections: the evidence review, mapping and the core knowledge document. The various entry points to the ideal pathway of care are defined from self-care through to follow-up. There is considerable emphasis on good skin care and when allergy problems should be dealt with.

Conclusions

Effective eczema management is holistic and encompasses an assessment of severity and impact on quality of life, treatment of the inflamed epidermal skin barrier, recognition and treatment of infection and assessment and management of environmental and allergy triggers. Patient and family education which seeks to maximise understanding and concordance with treatment is also important in all children with eczema.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^5bd6f430]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Eczema and food allergy are common health conditions that usually begin in early childhood and often occur in the same people. They can be associated with an impaired skin barrier in early infancy. It is unclear whether trying to prevent or reverse an impaired skin barrier soon after birth is effective for preventing eczema or food allergy.

Objectives

Primary objective

To assess the effects of skin care interventions such as emollients for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in infants.

Secondary objective

To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy.

Search methods

We performed an updated search of the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in September 2021. We searched two trials registers in July 2021. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and scanned conference proceedings to identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Selection criteria

We included RCTs of skin care interventions that could potentially enhance skin barrier function, reduce dryness, or reduce subclinical inflammation in healthy term (> 37 weeks) infants (≤ 12 months) without pre‐existing eczema, food allergy, or other skin condition. Eligible comparisons were standard care in the locality or no treatment. Types of skin care interventions could include moisturisers/emollients; bathing products; advice regarding reducing soap exposure and bathing frequency; and use of water softeners. No minimum follow‐up was required.

Data collection and analysis

This is a prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta‐analysis. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, and primary analyses used the IPD dataset. Primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of eczema and cumulative incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E‐mediated food allergy by one to three years, both measured at the closest available time point to two years. Secondary outcomes included adverse events during the intervention period; eczema severity (clinician‐assessed); parent report of eczema severity; time to onset of eczema; parent report of immediate food allergy; and allergic sensitisation to food or inhalant allergen.

Main results

We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review. We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta‐analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta‐analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only.

Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty‐five studies, including all those contributing data to meta‐analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta‐analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow‐up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients.

We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data.

Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate‐certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE‐mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low‐certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low‐certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low‐certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow's milk, and may be unreliable due to over‐reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate‐certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low‐certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low‐certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk.

Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin (FLG) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434, or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development.

Authors' conclusions

Based on low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy.

### Skin care interventions in infants for preventing eczema and food allergy [^0a721131]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Exact prevalence rates for food allergy are difficult to ascertain and are largely dependent on the method used to diagnose food allergy and the population studied. Self‐reported food allergy rates are generally higher than those confirmed by specific allergy testing (Woods 2002). Previous population‐based studies have suggested that IgE‐mediated food allergy affects around 3% to 10% of children (Kelleher 2016; Osborne 2011; Venter 2008). For some people, food allergy can resolve spontaneously during childhood, particularly for foods such as milk and egg. However, a recent US survey study identified a history suggestive of IgE‐mediated food allergy in over 10% of adults, demonstrating that it is not just a disease of childhood (Gupta 2019). Like eczema, food allergy is thought to have increased in prevalence in recent decades, although epidemiological data from the 1990s onwards in England and Australia suggest that food allergy prevalence in young children may be stable (Peters 2018; Prescott 2013; Sicherer 2003; Venter 2008). Food allergy also varies in prevalence across different regions, with lower prevalence in areas with lower overall rates of allergic disease, such as rural settings in Asia and Africa (Botha 2019; Prescott 2013).

Food allergy is a considerable burden on the individual, family, and wider society. Acute reactions can cause significant anxiety and when severe may rarely result in a fatal outcome within minutes of food ingestion (Umasunthar 2013). The continuous vigilance required to avoid potential triggers has an adverse impact on quality of life of allergic children and adults and their families (Cummings 2010). People with food allergy and their carers report a negative impact of dietary restrictions, limitations to social activities, and an emotional and financial burden of living with food allergy. For example, in the USA, the financial cost of food allergy for affected families and healthcare providers has been estimated as at least USD 25 billion per annum (Gupta 2013). In recent decades, numbers of hospital admissions for food‐related anaphylaxis have increased. It is unclear, however, whether this represents a true increase in incidence or a greater recognition of the potential for acute food allergy as a cause of symptoms, as there reassuringly has not been a concomitant increase in fatal anaphylaxis (Jerschow 2014; Poulos 2007; Turner 2015).

### Interventions to reduce Staphylococcus aureus in the management of eczema [^cb0d7b1c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) can cause secondary infection in eczema, and may promote inflammation in eczema that does not look infected. There is no standard intervention to reduce S. aureus burden in eczema. It is unclear whether antimicrobial treatments help eczema or promote bacterial resistance. This is an update of a 2008 Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions to reduce S. aureus for treating eczema.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to October 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS. We searched five trials registers and three sets of conference proceedings. We checked references of trials and reviews for further relevant studies. We contacted pharmaceutical companies regarding ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of products intended to reduce S. aureus on the skin in people diagnosed with atopic eczema by a medical practitioner. Eligible comparators were a similar treatment regimen without the anti-staphylococcal agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our key outcomes were participant- or assessor-rated global improvement in symptoms/signs, quality of life (QOL), severe adverse events requiring withdrawal, minor adverse events, and emergence of antibiotic-resistant micro-organisms.

Main Results

We included 41 studies (1753 analysed participants) covering 10 treatment categories. Studies were conducted mainly in secondary care in Western Europe; North America; the Far East; and elsewhere. Twelve studies recruited children; four, adults; 19, both; and six, unclear. Fifty-nine per cent of the studies reported the mean age of participants (range: 1.1 to 34.6 years). Eczema severity ranged from mild to severe. Many studies did not report our primary outcomes. Treatment durations ranged from 10 minutes to 3 months; total study durations ranged from 15 weeks to 27 months. We considered 33 studies at high risk of bias in at least one domain. We present results for three key comparisons. All time point measurements were taken from baseline. We classed outcomes as short-term when treatment duration was less than four weeks, and long-term when treatment was given for more than four weeks. Fourteen studies evaluated topical steroid/antibiotic combinations compared to topical steroids alone (infective status: infected (two studies), not infected (four studies), unspecified (eight studies)). Topical steroid/antibiotic combinations may lead to slightly greater global improvement in good or excellent signs/symptoms than topical steroid alone at 6 to 28 days follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.21; 224 participants; 3 studies, low-quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference between groups for QOL in children, at 14 days follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.18, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.04; 42 participants; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). The subsequent results for this comparison were based on very low-quality evidence, meaning we are uncertain of their validity: severe adverse events were rare (follow-up: between 6 to 28 days): both groups reported flare of dermatitis, worsening of the condition, and folliculitis (325 participants; 4 studies). There were fewer minor adverse events (e.g. flare, stinging, itch, folliculitis) in the combination group at 14 days follow-up (218 participants; 2 studies). One study reported antibiotic resistance in children at three months follow-up, with similar results between the groups (65 participants; 1 study). Four studies evaluated oral antibiotics compared to placebo (infective status: infected eczema (two studies), uninfected (one study), one study's participants had colonisation but no clinical infection). Oral antibiotics may make no difference in terms of good or excellent global improvement in infants and children at 14 to 28 days follow-up compared to placebo (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.50; 75 participants; 2 studies, low-quality evidence). There is probably little or no difference between groups for QOL (in infants and children) at 14 days follow-up (MD 0.11, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.32, 45 participants, 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). The subsequent results for this comparison were based on very low-quality evidence, meaning we are uncertain of their validity: adverse events requiring treatment withdrawal between 14 to 28 days follow-up were very rare, but included eczema worsening (both groups), loose stools (antibiotic group), and Henoch-Schönlein purpura (placebo group) (4 studies, 199 participants). Minor adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and stomach and joint pains, at 28 days follow-up were also rare and generally low in both groups (1 study, 68 infants and children). Antibiotic resistance at 14 days was reported as similar in both groups (2 studies, 98 infants and children). Of five studies evaluating bleach baths compared to placebo (water) or bath emollient (infective status: uninfected (two studies), unspecified (three studies)), one reported global improvement and showed that bleach baths may make no difference when compared with placebo at one month follow-up (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.63; 36 participants; low-quality evidence). One study showed there is probably little or no difference in QOL at 28 days follow-up when comparing bleach baths to placebo (MD 0.90, 95% CI -1.32 to 3.12) (80 infants and children; moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain if the groups differ in the likelihood of treatment withdrawals due to adverse events at two months follow-up (only one dropout reported due to worsening itch (placebo group)) as the quality of evidence was very low (1 study, 42 participants). One study reported that five participants in each group experienced burning/stinging or dry skin at two months follow-up, so there may be no difference in minor adverse events between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.87, 36 participants, low-quality evidence). Very low-quality evidence means we are also uncertain if antibiotic resistance at four weeks follow-up is different between groups (1 study, 80 participants ≤ 18 years).

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence on the effects of anti-staphylococcal treatments for treating people with infected or uninfected eczema. Low-quality evidence, due to risk of bias, imprecise effect estimates and heterogeneity, made pooling of results difficult. Topical steroid/antibiotic combinations may be associated with possible small improvements in good or excellent signs/symptoms compared with topical steroid alone. High-quality trials evaluating efficacy, QOL, and antibiotic resistance are required.

### Emollient bath additives for the treatment of childhood eczema (BATHE): multicentre pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness [^be1f4e46]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of including emollient bath additives in the management of eczema in children.

Design

Pragmatic randomised open label superiority trial with two parallel groups.

Setting

96 general practices in Wales and western and southern England.

Participants

483 children aged 1 to 11 years, fulfilling UK diagnostic criteria for atopic dermatitis. Children with very mild eczema and children who bathed less than once weekly were excluded.

Interventions

Participants in the intervention group were prescribed emollient bath additives by their usual clinical team to be used regularly for 12 months. The control group were asked to use no bath additives for 12 months. Both groups continued with standard eczema management, including leave-on emollients, and caregivers were given standardised advice on how to wash participants.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was eczema control measured by the patient oriented eczema measure (POEM, scores 0–7 mild, 8–16 moderate, 17–28 severe) weekly for 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were eczema severity over one year (monthly POEM score from baseline to 52 weeks), number of eczema exacerbations resulting in primary healthcare consultation, disease specific quality of life (dermatitis family impact), generic quality of life (child health utility-9D), utilisation of resources, and type and quantity of topical corticosteroid or topical calcineurin inhibitors prescribed.

Results

483 children were randomised and one child was withdrawn, leaving 482 children in the trial: 51% were girls (244/482), 84% were of white ethnicity (447/470), and the mean age was 5 years. 96% (461/482) of participants completed at least one post-baseline POEM, so were included in the analysis, and 77% (370/482) completed questionnaires for more than 80% of the time points for the primary outcome (12/16 weekly questionnaires to 16 weeks). The mean baseline POEM score was 9.5 (SD 5.7) in the bath additives group and 10.1 (SD 5.8) in the no bath additives group. The mean POEM score over the 16 week period was 7.5 (SD. 6.0) in the bath additives group and 8.4 (SD 6.0) in the no bath additives group. No statistically significant difference was found in weekly POEM scores between groups over 16 weeks. After controlling for baseline severity and confounders (ethnicity, topical corticosteroid use, soap substitute use) and allowing for clustering of participants within centres and responses within participants over time, POEM scores in the no bath additives group were 0.41 points higher than in the bath additives group (95% confidence interval -0.27 to 1.10), below the published minimal clinically important difference for POEM of 3 points. The groups did not differ in secondary outcomes, economic outcomes, or adverse effects.

Conclusions

This trial found no evidence of clinical benefit from including emollient bath additives in the standard management of eczema in children. Further research is needed into optimal regimens for leave-on emollient and soap substitutes.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^3f170fdc]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) potency classification and safe-use considerations — TCS are classified in multiple ways, with 1 to 7 in the US system and 1 representing the most potent; the US system is best used in research but in clinical practice there are effectively 4 classes of potency of topical treatments, so both systems must be known to interpret and apply the literature. Avoid high-potency (classes 1 and 2) TCS for prolonged periods of time (> 4 weeks) and limit use on sensitive areas (face, folds, groin), and continuous and prolonged use of low-potency TCS on sensitive areas can also cause these effects.

### Allergic diseases and the effect of inhaled epinephrine in children with acute bronchiolitis: follow-up from the randomised, controlled, double-blind, bronchiolitis ALL trial [^24dc6cb5]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Although use of inhaled bronchodilators in infants with acute bronchiolitis is not supported by evidence-based guidelines, it is often justified by the belief in a subgroup effect in individuals developing atopic disease. We aimed to assess if inhaled epinephrine during acute bronchiolitis in infancy would benefit patients with later recurrent bronchial obstruction, atopic eczema, or allergic sensitisation.

Methods

In the randomised, double-blind, multicentre Bronchiolitis ALL trial, 404 infants with moderate-to-severe acute bronchiolitis were recruited from eight hospitals in Norway to receive either inhaled epinephrine or saline up to every second hour throughout the hospital stay. Randomisation was done centrally, and the two study medications (20 mg/mL racemic epinephrine or 0.9% saline) were prepared in identical bottles. The dose given depended on the infant's weight: 0.10 mL, less than 5 kg; 0.15 mL, 5–6.9 kg; 0.2 mL, 7–9.9 kg; and 0.25 mL, 10 kg or more; all dissolved in 2 mL of 0.9% saline before nebulisation. The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay. In this follow-up study, 294 children were reinvestigated at 2 years of age with an interview, a clinical examination, and a skin prick test for 17 allergens, determining bronchial obstruction, atopic eczema, and allergic sensitisation, on which subgroup analyses were done. Analyses were done by intention to treat. The trial has been completed and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00817466) and EUDRACT (number 2009-012667-34).

Findings

Length of stay did not differ between patients who received inhaled epinephrine versus saline in the subgroup of infants who developed recurrent bronchial obstruction by age 2 years (143 [48.6%] of 294 patients; p(interaction) = 0.40). However, the presence of atopic eczema or allergic sensitisation by the age of 2 years (n = 77) significantly interacted with the treatment effect of inhaled epinephrine (p(interaction) = 0.02); the length of stay (mean 80.3 h, 95% CI 72.8–87.9) was significantly shorter in patients receiving inhaled epinephrine versus saline in patients without allergic sensitisation or atopic eczema by 2 years (-19.9 h, -33.1 to -6.3; p = 0.003). No significant differences were found in length of hospital stay in response to epinephrine or saline in children with atopic eczema or allergic sensitisation by 2 years (+16.2 h, -11.0 to 43.3; p = 0.24).

Interpretation

Contrary to our hypothesis, hospital length of stay for bronchiolitis was not reduced by administration of inhaled epinephrine in infants who subsequently developed atopic eczema, allergic sensitisation, or recurrent bronchial obstruction. The present study does not support an individual trial of inhaled epinephrine in acute bronchiolitis in children with increased risk of allergic diseases.

### The eczema priority setting partnership: a collaboration between patients, carers, clinicians and researchers to identify and prioritize important research questions for the treatment of eczema [^76edf16b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Eczema is a common condition, yet there are uncertainties regarding many frequently used treatments. Knowing which of these uncertainties matter to patients and clinicians is important, because they are likely to have different priorities from those of researchers and funders.

Objectives

To identify the uncertainties in eczema treatment that are important to patients who have eczema, their carers and the healthcare professionals (HCPs) who treat them.

Methods

An eczema Priority Setting Partnership was established, including patients, HCPs and researchers. Eczema treatment uncertainties were gathered from patients and clinicians, and then prioritized in a transparent process, using a methodology advocated by the James Lind Alliance.

Results

In the consultation stage 493 participants (including 341 patients/carers) made 1070 submissions, of which 718 were uncertainties relating to the treatment of eczema. Treatment uncertainties with more than one submission were grouped into 52 'indicative uncertainties', which were then ranked by 514 participants (including 399 patients/carers). The top 14 treatment uncertainties were prioritized for research. The first four were common to patients/carers and HCPs (shared uncertainties): (i) the best and safest way of using topical steroids (including frequency of application, potency, length of time, alternation with other topical treatments and age limits); (ii) the long-term safety of topical steroids; (iii) the role of food allergy tests; and (iv) the most effective and safe emollients in treating eczema. The remaining 10 of the top 14 uncertainties comprised the next five highest ranked uncertainties for patients and the next five highest ranked uncertainties for HCPs. At a workshop involving 40 participants (patients, HCPs and researchers), shared uncertainties were formulated into possible research questions.

Conclusions

The top 14 treatment uncertainties around the treatment of eczema provide guidance for researchers and funding bodies to ensure that future research answers questions that are important to both clinicians and patients.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^ce12cafa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Data not included in the meta‐analyses

We did not include three trials in any meta‐analyses because the numerical data were unsuitable for pooling (Bryden 2009; Murphy 2003; Pei 2001), and are summarised in Analysis 10.3. In line with the Analysis 10.1, Bryden 2009 found no significant difference in SASSAD between groups in a small trial of 51 children with moderate to severe eczema. One multiple arm trial of 40 children with moderate to severe eczema, who used a newer, second‐generation potent topical corticosteroid (Pei 2001), showed improvement in clinical signs in all groups, but baseline severity differed significantly between the groups making it difficult to draw any meaningful conclusion. One trial suggested an improvement in clinical signs in the wet‐wraps group but provided no numerical data to support this statement (Murphy 2003).

One trial in children with moderate‐severity eczema reported limited follow‐up data (Beattie 2004). At one week of follow‐up (week 3), SASSAD had increased in the twice daily, without wet‐wraps group to 22.8 (9 participants) and to 21.9 in the once daily, wet‐wrap group (10 participants). Beattie 2004 did not report dispersion data at this time point.

Effectiveness: patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (secondary outcome)

Two trials reported itch and sleep data and we have summarised them in Analysis 10.4 (Beattie 2004; Hindley 2006). These trials included a very low number of participants (19 and 45 respectively) but there were no relevant differences suggestive of benefit in using wet wraps.

Safety: number of relevant local adverse events (primary outcome)

Two small short‐term trials in children with moderate and severe eczema (Beattie 2004; Hindley 2006; Analysis 10.5), found that seven of 33 participants treated with wet wraps reported skin infections or required antibiotics whilst none were reported in the group that did not use wet wraps (31 participants).

None of the trials included under this comparison reported skin thinning and related signs, and local site reactions.

Safety: number of relevant systemic adverse events (secondary outcome)

Relevant systemic adverse events were not reported.

Unspecified adverse events (safety)

Foelster‐Holst 2006 reported that no adverse events occurred up to end of treatment (48 to 72 hours) in the 14‐day follow‐up period (adults and children; mild to moderate eczema; 24 participants).

### A practical toolbox for the effective transition of adolescents and young adults with asthma and allergies: an EAACI position paper [^716201a9]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

3.2.2 Specific advice forand families

Self‐managing asthma and allergies effectively requires AYA to understand their condition, identify and avoid potential triggers and risky situations, manage symptoms — particularly acute emergencies such as asthma attacks or anaphylaxis — and cope with the psychosocial impact of living with these issues in their changing reality. AYA and their support network may feel overwhelmed by the many aspects where AYA need to develop their knowledge and skills to effectively self‐manage their conditions and keep safe. In Table 2, sections B–E, we have selected a range of web‐based resources offering comprehensive information, advice and useful documents on a range of areas relevant to AYA with asthma and allergies, including:

Written action plans are patient‐ or carer‐held instructions that help support self‐management. They have the potential to address barriers to effective treatment, such as a lack of understanding about the condition and medications prescribed. They are recommended by national and international guidelines, and their use can improve managementand asthma outcomes.

We advocate the use of a patient‐held, written self‐management plan which provides clear individualized treatment guidance. Many action plans available are designed for parents/carers of young children. However, medical communication should gradually be addressed to the AYA themselves in a clear age‐appropriate language and format. We have not been able to identify adolescent‐focused self‐management plans for different atopic conditions, including much‐needed electronic versions of these, which remains a major gap. Links to action plans for asthma, anaphylaxis and atopic eczema designed to suit all ages, rather than children‐focused, are included in Tables 1 and 2, section B.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^d1d10e3c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness: patient‐reported symptoms of eczema (secondary outcome)

Five trials reported this outcome in 356 participants (range 1 to 5 weeks). Taken together, we judged the certainty of evidence to be low.

We combined parent or participant judgements with investigator assessments in two within‐participant trials (Meenan 1963 in children with unspecified disease severity; Portnoy 1969 in participants with unspecified age and disease severity; 64 participants), and pooled the data (Analysis 1.7). Results favoured moderate over mild‐potency topical corticosteroid. Three additional parallel‐group trials in 292 participants (263 from parallel‐group trials and 29 from a within‐participant trial), summarised in Analysis 1.9, were also in favour of moderate topical corticosteroid (Jorizzo 1995; Rossi 2002; Roth 1978a).

Safety: number of relevant local adverse events (primary outcome)

Five trials reported on local adverse events (Bagatell 1983; Haribhakti 1982; Jorizzo 1995; Kuokkanen 1987; Roth 1978a), that included 446 participants; 362 from the parallel‐group trials and 84 from the within‐participant trials (range 2 to 5 weeks). Taken together, we judged the certainty of evidence to be low.

Skin thinning and related signs

Four trials that compared moderate and mild topical corticosteroid of two to five weeks' duration assessed skin thinning and related signs; no cases were reported (Bagatell 1983; Haribhakti 1982; Jorizzo 1995; Kuokkanen 1987; 417 participants). No cases were reported in a subgroup of 36 participants treated for up to 25 weeks in Jorizzo 1995.

Local site reactions

Four trials that compared moderate and mild topical corticosteroid of two to five weeks' duration reported the number of participants who experienced local site reactions (Bagatell 1983; Jorizzo 1995; Kuokkanen 1987; Roth 1978a; Analysis 1.10). Some trials described adverse events as "brief" and "slight". The trial with the largest number of participants that reported local site reactions was Bagatell 1983 (4/127 with moderate topical corticosteroid and 3/122 with mild topical corticosteroid).

Skin infections

A three‐week trial that compared moderate (127 participants) and mild (122 participants) topical corticosteroid found no cases of folliculitis (Bagatell 1983).

Other adverse events are described under 'Unspecified adverse events (safety)'.

### Topical anti-inflammatory treatments for eczema: network meta-analysis [^5a51a6e0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In a subgroup analysis of studies in people with severe eczema (11 trials; n = 1892), potent TCS and the TCI tacrolimus 0.1% were ranked as most effective, with mild and moderate TCS and the TCI pimecrolimus 1% ranked as least effective. There was no significant inconsistency for comparisons in this network.

In the subgroup analysis of trials in people with eczema over age 12 years (17 trials; n = 2602), potent TCS, the TCI tacrolimus 0.1% and the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib 1.5% were ranked as most effective, with the PDE‐4 inhibitor roflumilast 0.15% ranked as least effective. There was significant inconsistency for the comparison of potent TCS versus pimecrolimus 1%, where indirect effects suggest similar effectiveness, but direct evidence suggests potent TCS was more effective than pimecrolimus 1%.

In a sensitivity analysis using an alternative classification for TCS potency (42 trials; n = 6571), the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib 1.5% and potent and very potent TCS were ranked as most effective and mild TCS, PDE‐4 inhibitors roflumilast 0.15% and crisaborole 2% were ranked as least effective. There was significant inconsistency between the comparison of moderate TCS versus pimecrolimus 1%, where indirect effects suggest similar effectiveness, but direct evidence suggests moderate TCS was more effective than pimecrolimus 1%.

In the sensitivity analysis excluding within‐participant studies (32 trials; n = 5978), potent TCS, the TCI tacrolimus 0.1% and the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib 1.5% ranked as most effective, and PDE‐4 inhibitors roflumilast 0.15% and crisaborole 2% and mild TCS ranked as least effective. There was no significant inconsistency between comparisons in this network.

### Steroid-free over-the-counter eczema skin care formulations reduce risk of flare, prolong time to flare, and reduce eczema symptoms in pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis [^b1e7a712]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin condition associated with decreased barrier function resulting in periodic flare-ups of erythematous and pruritic lesions. Guidelines recommend daily treatment of atopic skin with emollient moisturizers for prevention of flares and maintenance of the flare-free state. This study evaluated the efficacy of 2 steroid-free, nonprescription eczema skin care formulations for reducing the risk of flare and relieving symptoms in infants and children with AD: Body Cream for the daily maintenance treatment of atopic skin and Flare Treatment for the treatment of atopic flares.

Methods

After a 2-week washout period, subjects (N = 45; mean age 3.5 years) were randomized to cleanser plus daily moisturizing with Body Cream (moisturizer group) or cleanser only (control group) for 6 months or until flare. Subjects experiencing flare received Flare Treatment for 4 weeks.

Results

The incidence of flare was significantly lower in the moisturizer group compared with the control group (21% vs 65%; <em> P < /em ≥ .006), while the median time to flare was shorter in the control group (28 vs > 180 days). Risk of flare was reduced by 44.1% after 6 months of Body Cream application. Flare Treatment reduced overall eczema symptom severity at week 2 and week 4; 78.9% of flares had improved or cleared at week 4.

Conclusions

Body Cream reduced the incidence of flare and the time to flare, reinforcing guidelines that daily emollient therapy should be an integral part of the maintenance treatment plan for the prevention of disease flares. Body Cream and Flare Treatment are effective over-the-counter steroid-free options for management of AD in children.

### Emollient bath additives for the treatment of childhood eczema (BATHE): multicentre pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial of clinical and cost effectiveness [^040c7d3b]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Analysis was conducted according to CONSORT guidelines, following an analysis plan agreed in advance with the independent trial steering committee. We used descriptive statistics to compare baseline characteristics of trial participants by allocated group. The primary analysis for the total POEM score was performed using a multilevel mixed model framework with observations over time from weeks 1 to 16 (level 1) nested within participants (level 2). Our primary outcome is based on adjusted results, controlling for baseline POEM score, recruiting centre, and any significant confounders. We also report unadjusted results.

For all models, we analysed participants in the group to which they were randomised, regardless of their adherence to that allocation (intention to treat analysis). The only exception to this was the per protocol analysis, where analyses were carried out on the basis of bath additive use as reported by parents or carers.

The model used all the observed data and we made the assumption that missing POEM scores are missing at random given the observed data. The model included a random effect for centre (random intercept) and patient (random intercept and slope on time) to allow for differences between patients and between centres at baseline and between patients in the rate of change over time (if a treatment or time interaction was significant), and fixed effects for baseline covariates. We used an unstructured covariance matrix.

In the analysis of secondary outcomes, for the monthly POEM measure up to one year we used repeated measures analysis in line with that used for the primary outcome. For other secondary outcomes, we used linear regression for continuous outcomes if the assumptions were met. Otherwise we used non-parametric analyses. We used logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes and a suitable count model, as determined by goodness of fit measures, for count data. In all analyses we controlled for stratification variables and potential confounders. As set out in the statistical analysis plan, we carried out preplanned sensitivity analysis and exploratory subgroup analyses. For the economic evaluation we used resource use, cost and effectiveness data collected from participants, and reviews of GPs' notes.
