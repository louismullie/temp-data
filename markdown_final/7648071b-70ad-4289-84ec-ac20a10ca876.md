## Question

interpret new result for 74yo male. protein electrophoresis No monoclonal protein identified by serum protein electrophoresis.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a new serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) result stating "No monoclonal protein identified" in a 74-year-old man, and whether any additional evaluation or follow-up is needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a "negative SPEP" truly rules out and what it can miss. Then, I should verify the age-related pre-test probability and whether screening is recommended. Next, I will outline the guideline-recommended completion of the initial laboratory panel beyond SPEP, including interpretation nuances in renal impairment. After that, I need to consider how to interpret combined results and apply risk stratification models. Finally, I will map risk-based management pathways, consider monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS), address test interferences and advanced methods, and close with specific recommendations for this patient.

> Let me first confirm what a "negative SPEP" means and, just as importantly, what it does not mean; wait, let me verify my assumption here — at first glance I might think a negative SPEP largely excludes monoclonal gammopathy, but that would be incorrect because SPEP misses small M-proteins, species migrating in the beta region, and light chain–only disease, and up to a notable minority of myeloma cases secrete only light chains that SPEP alone can miss, so I should not provide false reassurance based solely on a negative SPEP [^114s28h1] [^1165reep] [^115AW7Pu].

> Next, I should review pre-test probability; at age 74 the background prevalence of MGUS is approximately 3–4%, which reminds me not to dismiss the possibility in an older adult, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines do not recommend population screening, so the key here is that since testing was already performed, I need to complete the appropriate panel to avoid missed pathology while avoiding over-investigation when there is no corroborating evidence or symptoms [^113itTDc].

> I will now examine the mandatory next steps to complete the initial laboratory workup; I need to ensure I add serum free light chain (sFLC) with kappa, lambda, and ratio, serum immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), and urine IFE because together they materially increase sensitivity for detecting low-level or light chain–only clones that SPEP alone can miss, and in renal impairment I should widen the "normal" sFLC ratio to approximately 0.34–3.10 to avoid false positives; if results remain equivocal or suspicion persists, I should consider a mass spectrometry–based assay such as MASS-FIX where available given its higher sensitivity for subtle clones [^114s28h1] [^115vqgry] [^115cW2DQ] [^112NnYuV] [^116We96T].

> Hold on, I should verify how to interpret combined results; if SPEP, serum IFE, urine IFE, and sFLC are all negative, the appropriate diagnosis is "no monoclonal gammopathy detected" at this time, and I should then pivot to other explanations for the clinical context while ensuring baseline myeloma-targeted labs such as CBC, calcium, creatinine, and albumin are documented so that any emergent CRAB features would be recognized promptly if they appear later [^112duMU4] [^114s28h1].

> If any test is positive, I need to quantify the M-protein appropriately, calculate and interpret the sFLC ratio, and assess for immunoparesis; wait, I need to double-check a common pitfall — total or intact light chains should not be used to quantify M-proteins, and my quantification should follow validated approaches while serum IFE confirms isotype and clonality in new positives, ensuring I do not rely on sFLC changes alone to define burden or response [^111uWHgi] [^116bkfsy] [^116SarbZ].

> Now, let me consider risk stratification; I should apply a validated model such as the Mayo Clinic MGUS criteria incorporating M-protein size, FLC ratio, isotype, and immunoparesis, recognizing that BSH recommends formal risk assessment without mandating bone marrow in all patients, which helps optimize who can be safely followed in primary care versus who needs specialist evaluation, and I should confirm I'm using the same model consistently for longitudinal decisions [^113VMzX9] [^1135LEiu].

> For low-risk MGUS, I should confirm the follow-up cadence; repeat at about 6 months to establish stability and then every 1–2 years is reasonable, and importantly, routine imaging is not recommended when IgG is at or below 15 g/L or IgA at or below 10 g/L in the absence of bone pain or other red flags, which helps avoid unnecessary radiation and costs while maintaining vigilance [^111BSJHP] [^113WDeFy] [^116dWY6k].

> For intermediate- or high-risk MGUS, I should verify that referral to hematology is appropriate; follow-up at 6 months then annually is typical, bone marrow evaluation is recommended for high-intermediate or high-risk profiles at diagnosis, and whole-body imaging should be considered to exclude smoldering myeloma, overt myeloma, or AL amyloidosis when risk or symptoms indicate, noting that imaging modality may differ slightly by isotype and clinical presentation [^115RveHs] [^1134QEuq] [^112R5sdx] [^113vTGar] [^114SfT3n].

> But wait, what if the M-protein is small yet the patient has organ dysfunction; I need to think about MGCS entities such as MGRS, neuropathic syndromes including POEMS, and AL amyloidosis, where low-level clones can cause serious damage, so I should keep a high index of suspicion and escalate to organ-specific evaluation and, if available, consider advanced detection tools like mass spectrometry when standard assays are negative but clinical suspicion remains high [^115cW2DQ] [^116heGxK] [^116We96T] [^114s28h1].

> I should confirm there are no analytical interferences confounding interpretation; therapeutic monoclonal antibodies such as daratumumab can appear on SPE/IFE and mimic or obscure an M-spike, and SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis with tixagevimab/cilgavimab can transiently create IgGκ bands shortly after administration, so I need to check medication timing and, if necessary, repeat testing off-interference to avoid misclassification of response or new disease [^111kX81Z] [^112ijtaM] [^112CFVBp].

> Next, I should review key pitfalls; I must not monitor or diagnose based on an isolated sFLC ratio abnormality without confirmatory immunofixation because urine IFE can be the only positive test in a small but meaningful fraction of cases, and I should remember that beta-region migrating M-proteins can be cloaked on SPEP, warranting reflex IFE or immunosubtraction when the beta region looks suspicious on capillary electrophoresis [^1179j5p4] [^1165reep].

> Finalizing a plan for this patient, my immediate actions should be to obtain sFLC with kappa, lambda, and ratio, serum IFE, and urine IFE within the next few weeks, along with CBC, calcium, creatinine, and albumin, while documenting any bone pain, anemia-related symptoms, neuropathy, edema, weight loss, or fatigue; if all studies remain negative, I will document "no evidence of monoclonal gammopathy detected" and redirect the workup to alternative etiologies without hematology follow-up, whereas if any study is positive, I will apply risk stratification, avoid relying on sFLC ratio alone, and either monitor in primary care for low-risk profiles or refer to hematology for consideration of marrow and imaging in intermediate- or high-risk profiles [^112duMU4] [^114s28h1] [^1179j5p4].

The absence of a monoclonal protein on serum protein electrophoresis in a 74-year-old male means **no M-protein detected**, so there is **no evidence of MGUS, multiple myeloma, or related plasma cell disorders**. This result **does not exclude low-level or light-chain–only disease**; if clinical suspicion persists, order serum free light chains and immunofixation [^114s28h1], and consider urine studies [^112HUemF] or mass spectrometry [^112NnYuV] [^116YdtmV]. Routine follow-up is **not needed** unless symptoms or lab abnormalities suggest a plasma cell disorder [^111ZzrJ9].

---

## Clinical significance of the result

- **No monoclonal protein detected**: This indicates no evidence of MGUS, multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, or other plasma cell dyscrasias [^112zY9TQ] [^113zpJPS].

- **Normal polyclonal pattern**: The result suggests a normal polyclonal immunoglobulin pattern, typical of healthy individuals or reactive states [^111W1ktE].

- **No immediate concern**: There is no immediate evidence of a clonal plasma cell disorder or related malignancy [^115uLPTN].

---

## Limitations of serum protein electrophoresis

While SPEP is a useful screening tool, it has **limitations**:

- **Sensitivity**: SPEP may miss low-level monoclonal proteins, especially in early or smoldering disease [^1117AMwv].

- **Light-chain disease**: SPEP may not detect light-chain–only disease, as free light chains may not produce a visible M-spike [^115fREST].

- **Small clones**: Small or early clones may be below SPEP detection limits [^116YdtmV].

---

## Recommended follow-up and additional testing

Given the absence of a monoclonal protein, **routine follow-up for monoclonal gammopathy is not required**. If clinical suspicion persists or the patient develops symptoms suggestive of plasma cell disorders (e.g. unexplained anemia, hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, bone pain), **additional testing may be warranted** [^112duMU4]:

- **Serum free light chain assay**: To detect light-chain–only disease or low-level monoclonal proteins [^114s28h1] [^115fREST].

- **Immunofixation electrophoresis**: More sensitive than SPEP for detecting small monoclonal proteins [^114s28h1] [^112HUemF].

- **Urine protein electrophoresis**: To detect Bence Jones proteins (monoclonal light chains) in urine [^112HUemF].

- **Mass spectrometry**: Highly sensitive for detecting low-level monoclonal proteins [^112NnYuV] [^116YdtmV].

---

## Clinical implications for patient management

Immediate intervention or specific follow-up is **not required** based on this SPEP result alone. Continue routine clinical care and monitor for symptoms or signs suggestive of plasma cell disorders. If clinical suspicion arises or symptoms develop, pursue additional testing as outlined above [^114s28h1].

---

## Conclusion

The absence of a monoclonal protein on serum protein electrophoresis in a 74-year-old male indicates **no evidence of monoclonal gammopathy or related plasma cell disorders** [^113zpJPS]. No immediate clinical concern or intervention is required based on this result alone. If clinical suspicion persists or symptoms develop, consider additional testing — such as a serum free light chain assay, immunofixation electrophoresis, or mass spectrometry [^114s28h1] [^116YdtmV].

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, AACC/ASCP/CAP 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining SPEP, sFLC, serum immunofixation electrophoresis, and urine immunofixation electrophoresis for the initial detection of M protein in all patients with suspected AL amyloidosis.

The detection and quantification of monoclonal proteins (M-proteins) are necessary for the diagnosis and evaluation of response in plasma cell dyscrasias. Immunoglobulin enrichment coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MASS-FIX) is a simple and inexpensive method to identify M-proteins, but its clinical generalizability has not yet been elucidated. We compared MASS-FIX to protein electrophoresis (PEL), serum/urine immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), and quantitative serum free light chain (FLC) for the identification of M-proteins in different clinical diagnoses. Paired serum and urine samples from 257 patients were tested.

There were six patients for whom s-IFE and FLC ratio were positive and serum MASS-FIX was negative, but when serum and urine MASS-FIX results were combined, only one patient with light chain MGUS was missed. Serum/urine MASS-FIX detected M-proteins in 18 patients with negative serum/urine PEL/IFE and serum FLC, 10 of whom had multiple myeloma or AL amyloidosis, who were mistakenly thought to have complete hematologic response by serum/urine PEL/IFE and serum FLC. Nearly half of the AL amyloidosis patients had atypical spectra, which may prove to be a clue to the diagnosis and pathogenesis of the disease.

In conclusion, MASS-FIX has comparable sensitivity with PEL/IFE/FLC methods and can help inform the clinical diagnosis.

### Understanding and interpreting serum protein electrophoresis [^111W1ktE]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Serum protein electrophoresis is used to identify patients with multiple myeloma and other serum protein disorders. Electrophoresis separates proteins based on their physical properties, and the subsets of these proteins are used in interpreting the results. Plasma protein levels display reasonably predictable changes in response to acute inflammation, malignancy, trauma, necrosis, infarction, burns, and chemical injury. A homogeneous spike-like peak in a focal region of the gamma-globulin zone indicates a monoclonal gammopathy.

Monoclonal gammopathies are associated with a clonal process that is malignant or potentially malignant, including multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, solitary plasmacytoma, smoldering multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, plasma cell leukemia, heavy chain disease, and amyloidosis. The quantity of M protein, the results of bone marrow biopsy, and other characteristics can help differentiate multiple myeloma from other causes of monoclonal gammopathy. In contrast, polyclonal gammopathies may be caused by any reactive or inflammatory process.

### Monitoring residual myeloma: High-resolution serum/urine electrophoresis or marrow biopsy with immunohistochemical analysis [^111UYzk5]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Numerous methods exist for monitoring residual disease in multiple myeloma using peripheral blood, urine, and bone marrow (BM) techniques. This study involved a cohort of 83 patients to compare residual disease detection using serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPE) with immunofixation with immunoperoxidase staining of BM tissue sections. Of the 83 patients, 49 had a positive SPE and/or UPE result, and all had BM involvement shown by immunohistochemical analysis. The results for SPE and UPE were negative in 17 patients, and all 17 had a negative immunohistochemical BM result, indicating a negative predictive value for SPE/UPE of 100%. In addition, SPE and UPE detected residual disease in 17 patients with negative BM biopsy studies. SPE and UPE can be used to screen patients for residual disease, and negative results for both can obviate the need for BM biopsy for the detection of residual disease by immunohistochemical analysis.

### Analysis of multiple bands on serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis: Challenge in interpretation of clonality in a patient with light chain-predominant multiple myeloma [^115xSi3o]. Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Sera from patients with multiple myeloma usually display a single monoclonal immunoglobulin band on serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis. Multiple bands may be observed if the myeloma is bi- or triclonal, or if the monoclonal immunoglobulin has rheumatoid factor activity. We describe a patient with light chain-predominant IgA lambda myeloma; the patient's serum displayed two spatially distinct bands reacting for alpha heavy and lambda light chains. The methods used to establish monoclonality are addressed.

### Value of serum-free light chain measurements in response and progression assessment in multiple myeloma with monoclonal protein measurable by electrophoresis [^113dt7xS]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Low credibility.

According to IMWG guidelines, sFLC is included in the MM response assessment to define stringent complete response (sCR). Serial sFLC measurements are only indicated for evaluating response and progression in patients with no measurable M-protein in the serum or urine, as defined by IMWG response criteria, with at least 1 g/dL and 200 mg/24 h in the serum and urine, respectively. M-protein should be measured using sPEP and/or uPEP at each assessment in these patients. If urine M-protein is not measurable at baseline, urine M-protein is not required to document partial or minor responses; however, it is necessary for complete and very good partial responses. Nevertheless, 24-h urine assessments remain burdensome for patients, resulting in inadequate adherence and failure to assess disease response, especially in the setting of clinical trials. Recent studies have suggested that serum-free light chain may be used in place of 24-h urine protein electrophoresis in most situations.

This study was designed to determine how serial measurements of sFLC correlate with those of serum and urine-based assessments in monitoring response and progression in MM with serum and/or urine-measurable disease with standard electrophoretic methods. Additionally, we also evaluated whether serial measurements of sFLC can replace the 24-h urine protein electrophoresis as a measure of disease response in this cohort.

Question 3: What complementary test would most likely explain the etiology of the skin lesions?
A. Genetic study of ECM1 gene
B. Abdominal fat pad biopsy
C. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis
D. Lipid profile
E. No further test is required

- **Answers**
- **Genetic study of ECM1 gene**: Incorrect. Loss-of-function mutations in the extracellular matrix protein ECM1 gene is used to confirm the diagnosis of lipoid proteinosis.
- **Abdominal fat pad biopsy**: Incorrect. In an already-diagnosed cutaneous amyloidosis case, abdominal fat pad biopsy will be redundant and will not help in delineating the etiology of the lesions.
- **Serum and urine protein electrophoresis**: Correct. The most common cause of systemic amyloidosis is the deposition of immunoglobulin light chains secondary to plasma cell dyscrasias, in which the results of serum and urine protein electrophoresis may be abnormal. Quantitative serum-free light-chain assay will further help, when, on rare occasions, as in the presented patient, the serum protein electrophoresis and urine protein electrophoresis return normal.
- **Lipid profile**: Incorrect. Based on the histopathological features, the diagnosis is amyloidosis, and lipid profile would not be the best next step in finding the underlying causative disorder. On the contrary, dyslipidemia is seen in 50% of patients presenting with xanthelasma.
- **No further test is required**: Incorrect. Amyloidosis is the deposition of amyloid material with a wide range of etiologies. Therefore, conducting supplementary tests is of paramount importance in establishing the appropriate diagnosis.

Case presentation

A 76-year-old Chinese man presented with microscopic haematuria for 2 years and oedema for 8 months. The patient had a past history of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), hypertension, angina pectoris, and hypothyroidism. On admission, the physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, a temperature of 36.5 °C, a heart rate of 76 beats/min, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths/min. The patient had severe bilateral symmetrical lower extremity oedema. Urine dipstick analysis showed blood (3+) and protein (3+). Urinalysis exhibited 80–90 RBCs/HPF, with a majority of dysmorphic RBCs.

Laboratory findings included a serum albumin concentration of 20 g/L and a proteinuria value of 8.06 g/d. His serum creatinine value rose from 1.41 mg/dL to 2.96 mg/dL in 10 months and decreased to 1.81 mg/dL after diuretic therapy. Hemoglobin was notably low at 77 g/L (normal range: 130–175 g/L), and his platelet count was within normal range at 212 × 10⁹ cells/L (normal range: 125–350 × 10⁹ cells/L). The patient's C3 level was low at 0.356 g/L (normal range: 0.6–1.5 g/L), while his C4 and plasma CFH levels were normal at 0.162 g/L (normal range: 0.12–0.36 g/L) and 392.9 μg/mL (normal range: 247–1010.8 μg/mL), respectively. Serum IgG level was 9.89 g/L (normal range: 7.23–16.85 g/L), IgA level was 2.38 g/L (normal range: 0.69–3.82 g/L), and IgM level was 0.78 g/L (normal range: 0.63–2.77 g/L).

Immunofixation electrophoresis of serum and urine both revealed a monoclonal IgGλ. A bone marrow puncture led to the diagnosis of plasma cell dyscrasias.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS): Real-world data on outcomes and prognostic factors [^116heGxK]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is defined by a serum or urine monoclonal protein of less than 3 g/dL and 500 mg/24 h, respectively, and by less than 10% monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Currently, no treatment is indicated for MGUS outside of a clinical trial. The cumulative risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM) has been widely reported and is about 1% per year over 20 years. Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is characterized by 10%–60% monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or ≥ 3 g/dL of monoclonal component in the serum or urine of ≥ 500 mg/24 h. In SMM, there is no organ damage, and treatment is indicated only in the context of a clinical trial.

Three new criteria have been introduced to predict increased risk of progression from SMM to symptomatic MM within two years from diagnosis: bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%, free light chain (FLC) ratio > 100 (or if κ/λ ratio is used, ≥ 100 or ≤ 0.01), and ≥ 1 bone lesion detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) — now defined as SLiM-CRAB. However, both MGUS and SMM may be harmful in the absence of the usual SLiM-CRAB criteria. A newer term, monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS), indicates organ compromise secondary to the production of clonal paraprotein(s), which damages the kidney, eye, heart, liver, or neurological compartment. In addition to MGUS and SMM, this may also be a manifestation of small B-cell clones arising from lymphoproliferative diseases, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

### IgG4-related disease: What a hematologist needs to know [^115a7cbj]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately 70% of patients with IgG4-RD have an elevated serum IgG4 level. Serum IgG subclasses should be investigated in conjunction with serum protein electrophoresis to exclude a monoclonal paraprotein. The serum IgG4 level has a diagnostic sensitivity ranging from 83–97% and specificity from 60–85%, with a general cut-off of "above the upper limit of normal". Typically, 1.35 g/L is used as the biomarker cut-off for IgG4-RD, which corresponds to the upper limit of normal for one common commercial method but not another, without specifying the methodology. While mildly elevated serum IgG4 can be seen in many conditions, markedly elevated serum IgG4 (> 5 g/L) is approximately 90% specific for IgG4-RD.

Aside from methodological differences, serum IgG4 levels in IgG4-RD can vary greatly depending on ethnicity and degree of organ involvement. In the Boston cohort of patients (76% White), only 53 of 103 patients had elevated serum IgG4 levels. In contrast, in a cohort of 334 Japanese patients, more than 95% had elevated serum IgG4. In our multi-ethnic cohort, we found that Asians have a higher serum IgG4 than non-Asians (median 11.2 g/L versus 2.9 g/L, P = 0.0094), and elevated serum IgG4 had a sensitivity of 96% in Asians compared to 67% in non-Asians. Patients with multi-organ involvement or of Asian ethnicity typically have elevated serum IgG4, sometimes markedly so, such as the patient in this illustrative case. The serum IgG4/IgG ratio is typically > 0.2 in patients with IgG4-RD, although the ratio does not increase the diagnostic specificity.

### Data analytics improves the diagnostic accuracy of serum free light chain results for detecting monoclonal gammopathy [^116bWCmU]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). High credibility.

The time period for sample inclusion was chosen randomly, with the goal of maximizing the number of samples that met our eligibility criteria; no sample size calculation was performed. Therefore, all consecutive clinical samples with a PE or immunofixation result reported between 2010 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion. Samples were categorized by the presence or absence of a single monoclonal component, according to the reported immunofixation interpretation result, outlined in Figure 1 and in the Supplementary Materials. Only "first-occurrence" specimens (i.e. the first time a particular monoclonal component was identified for that patient) were included in the analyses to eliminate the effects of repeated testing of individuals with known monoclonal components and to limit bias introduced when a patient's previously identified monoclonal component was already known. Samples with indeterminate oligoclonal banding were not included in our data set. All quality control, research, and proficiency testing specimens were excluded from the analyses, as were specimens without medical record number information.

- **Figure 1: Data analysis flowchart and descriptive characteristics of included specimens**: Serum electrophoresis/immunofixation and SFLC data from 95,609 specimens tested over a 10-year period were filtered to yield a subset of 8,178 first-occurrence specimens with conSFLC results for analysis. Specimens were grouped according to their respective immunofixation interpretations, and descriptive characteristics were evaluated.

### Screening for and diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy [^113zpJPS]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy is a spectrum of disorders characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells or lymphocytes that produce abnormal immunoglobulin or its components (monoclonal proteins). Monoclonal gammopathies are often categorized as low-tumor-burden diseases (e.g. amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis), premalignant disorders (such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma), and malignancies (e.g. multiple myeloma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia). The diversity of concentration and structure makes monoclonal protein a challenging clonal marker. This article provides an overview of initial laboratory testing of monoclonal gammopathy to guide clinicians and laboratory professionals in the selection and interpretation of appropriate investigations.

### Prognosis of young patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) [^116zUvnr]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is defined by the presence of monoclonal (M) protein ≤ 3 g/dl in the peripheral blood, plasma cells < 10% in the bone marrow, and the absence of end-organ damage or CRAB features related to M protein or clonal plasma cells. MGUS is considered a premalignant entity for multiple myeloma and lymphoplasmacytic malignancies in patients older than 50 years. The progression rate of MGUS in these patients to malignant disorders is about 1% per year. The prevalence of MGUS in young patients (age < 40 years) is < 0.3%, representing about 2% of all patients with MGUS. The clinical course of young MGUS patients remains largely unknown.

- **Risk factors**: A variety of risk factors have been associated with progression from MGUS to other plasma cell disorders, but their impact has not been specifically evaluated in younger patients with MGUS. The impact of immune-related conditions, including autoimmune, infectious, and inflammatory disorders occurring in the context of monoclonal gammopathy, has not been studied. Lindqvist et al. reported in a large case–control study that the risk of MGUS was higher in patients with all categories of immune-related conditions. Similar relations were highlighted in multiple myeloma (MM) by Brown et al, who found that patients with immune-related conditions were 15–29% more likely to develop MM. Autoimmune diseases have been associated with an increased risk of MGUS and MM. In patients with autoimmune diseases, the age of onset of MM is earlier. Constant stimulation to immune systems might be contributing to these outcomes.

### The evaluation of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance: A consensus report of the International Kidney and Monoclonal Gammopathy Research Group [^115cW2DQ]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Another critical test is the serum free light-chain assay, which detects unbound free light chains. This assay measures κ and λ free light chains independently and can be used to determine the κ:λ free light-chain ratio. Clonality can be inferred from an abnormal κ:λ free light-chain ratio: a high ratio indicates a κ clone, whereas a low ratio indicates a λ clone. Because free light chains are cleared by the kidney, impaired renal function alters the free light-chain concentration. The 'normal' free light-chain ratio, 0.26–1.65, can rise to 0.34–3.10 in patients with severe renal impairment (CKD stage 5 or greater), but small declines in renal function can also impair free light-chain clearance.

Knowing which serum free light-chain assay is being used by the laboratory is extremely important, as at least two major assays are currently on the market. Not only are the results of these assays mathematically inconvertible, but the effects of renal impairment differ between these assays; the evidence suggests that the N Latex assay is less affected than the FreeLite assay by impaired renal function. Thus, the same assay must be used to monitor a particular patient throughout their treatment. Moreover, given that the two assays have different performance characteristics, free light-chain levels might need to be checked using the other assay if the first result is negative. In addition, serum immunofixation might be more helpful than serum free light-chain assays in diseases associated with an intact monoclonal immunoglobulin (such as PGNMID).

### Abnormalities of serum-free light chain in patients with primary antibody deficiency in the absence of B lymphocyte clonality [^114FTVuQ]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

A review of practice was conducted to determine whether serum-free light chain (SFLC) assays are helpful in detecting underlying clonal B-cell disorders or amyloidosis in patients with primary antibody deficiency (PAD) and reinfection.

- **Methods**: SFLCs were assayed by nephelometry (BN2 nephelometer, Siemens; FREELITE assay, Binding Site). We reviewed SFLC test results recorded in our regional laboratory over a 4-year period; 20 adults with PAD were identified as having been tested on at least two occasions.

- **Results**: Of the 20 patients, 4 with PAD had abnormal serum-free kappa/lambda (K/L) ratios but no evidence of B-cell clonality. We also found extremely low levels of kappa and/or lambda (below the limits of reliable detection) in 19 out of 20 PAD cases (mostly common variable immunodeficiency), to the extent that in many, ratios were not calculable.

- **Conclusions**: The data suggest that the abnormal ratios are generated by an inability to produce and/or secrete SFLCs, particularly kappa FLC. In this small initial study, we seek to highlight PAD cases where a suspicious K/L ratio, typically with very low absolute quantities of SFLCs, most likely points to B-cell dysfunction rather than to B lymphocyte clonality.

### Prognosis of young patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) [^115BR9vy]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The size of M protein in our study is relatively small compared to those in previous studies. There are two potential explanations for this observation. First, our young MGUS patients were likely diagnosed in an earlier stage of their disease process rather than the older patients who had a longer history of undiagnosed MGUS until it is identified incidentally. The size of M protein gradually increases in the majority of patients over the disease course. It is possible that immune-related conditions are the early trigger for the development of plasma cell disorders, as the size of M protein was frequently reported as unquantifiable in the setting of immune-related conditions.

Second, the unquantifiable M protein in patients with immune-related conditions might not represent bona-fide MGUS as some of them did not persist. There were 36 patients in whom we observed the disappearance of M protein. In a smaller number of patients, we could not ascertain the status of the M protein as these patients were lost to follow-up after the diagnosis of MGUS. We find that the M protein was more likely to resolve in the patients with immune-related conditions compared with the patients without immune-related conditions. The patients with immune-related conditions also had a lower serum concentration of M protein. The pathophysiology behind the resolution of M protein is not clear. Murray et al. reported that unquantifiable M proteins were less likely to persist, as 30% of the unquantifiable M proteins disappeared in their study.

### Detection and prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: A study utilizing mass spectrometry-based monoclonal immunoglobulin rapid accurate mass measurement [^116HKb87]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Low credibility.

The miRAMM mass spectrometry technique has demonstrated significant potential in detecting monoclonal protein and deciphering the origins of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).

- **Fig. 3: Detection capability of miRAMM**: miRAMM showed no evidence of monoclonal protein in a patient who was considered positive for immunofixation. The top panel shows no monoclonal protein by miRAMM in 2007 in a patient thought to have IgG kappa monoclonal protein on immunofixation. The bottom panel from 1996 in the same patient shows no monoclonal protein, with a pattern identical to that seen in 2007.

- **Fig. 4 and Fig. 5: Potential insights of miRAMM**: Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the potential of miRAMM to better understand the origins of MGUS and its role as a predictor of disease progression. In Fig. 4, MGUS seems to originate from an oligoclonal response, while Fig. 5 shows that what is thought to be monoclonal protein on immunofixation may in fact be more of an oligoclonal response when analyzed through miRAMM.

	- **Fig. 4**: The origin of monoclonal gammopathy from within an oligoclonal response is illustrated here. The top panel shows an IgG kappa (23,635 Da) monoclonal protein with non-enzymatic glycation. The bottom panel shows the same patient 12 years earlier, demonstrating an oligoclonal profile with a clone matching the future MGUS clone (23,635 Da) detectable within the oligoclonal background.

	- **Fig. 5**: The persistence of an oligoclonal immune response over a 5-year period is shown. The top panel presents an oligoclonal pattern in 2000, considered positive for IgG kappa monoclonal protein by immunofixation. The bottom panel presents a sample from 1995, showing the same oligoclonal distribution, with immunofixation considered negative during this period.

The prevalence of MGUS was assessed by performing both serum immunofixation and miRAMM assay on all baseline samples.

### Optimization of utilization of serum protein analysis: Role of the electronic medical record in promoting consultation by pathology [^1141iAv3]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Screening for monoclonal gammopathies is typically conducted using serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain tests. SPEP may be followed by immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), which can be ordered by the treating physician or at the discretion of the pathologist. We evaluated the appropriateness of IFE ordering by treating physicians and reported our findings, follow-up changes to the ordering process, and results of the change. A retrospective analysis of laboratory data was conducted from April 2009 through July 2012. In April 2009, clinicians had three options for test ordering: SPEP with reflex IFE, SPEP only, and SPEP with IFE. This was restricted to SPEP with reflex IFE only in April 2010. We compared the rates of SPEP and IFE performed during the two periods, namely, April 2009 through April 2010 and May 2010 through July 2012. There was a significant reduction in the IFE/SPEP ratio from 0.47 to 0.21. The review of electronic medical records by the consultant pathologist significantly improved utilization and enhanced the value of pathology consultation. Potential impacts on laboratory costs, revenue, and overall healthcare are also discussed.

### New definition of light chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^116FQBWq]. JAMA Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question**: Can the definition of light chain (LC) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) be improved?

- **Findings**: In this cohort study of 75,422 individuals, standard reference intervals led to overdiagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies. Revised age-stratified reference intervals for free light chains (FLC) were calculated, and a new definition of LC-MGUS was proposed; the new definition decreased the prevalence of LC-MGUS by 82%.

- **Meaning**: A new definition of LC-MGUS can substantially decrease false-positive diagnosis and optimize care.

### Audit of use and overuse of serum protein immunofixation electrophoresis and serum free light chain assay in tertiary health care: A case for algorithmic testing to optimize laboratory utilization [^115HmH3h]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

The overuse of laboratory tests is a persistent issue. We examined the use and overuse of serum immunofixation electrophoresis and serum free light chain assays to develop an algorithm for optimizing utilization.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of all tests for the investigation of monoclonal gammopathies was conducted for all patients who had any of these tests done from April 24, 2014, through July 25, 2014. The test orders were categorized as warranted or not warranted according to criteria presented in the article.

- **Results**: A total of 237 patients were tested, and their historical records included 1,503 episodes of testing for one or more of the following: serum protein electrophoresis, serum immunofixation electrophoresis, and serum free light chain assays. Only 46% of the serum immunofixation and 42% of serum free light chain assays were warranted. Proper utilization at our institution alone would have saved $64,182.95 per year in healthcare costs, reduced the laboratory cost of reagents alone by $26,436.04 per year, and put $21,904.92 per year of part B reimbursement at risk.

- **Conclusions**: Fewer than half of the serum immunofixation and serum free light chain assays added value. The proposed algorithm for testing should improve utilization. Risk to part B billing may be a disincentive to reducing test utilization.

### Interference of M-protein on thrombin time test: A case report [^115ooJTR]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A case of interference of monoclonal protein (M-protein) on the thrombin time (TT) test in a 39-year-old Caucasian male patient is presented.

- **Methods**: Coagulation screening tests were performed, with altered results noted only for TT (> 150 seconds) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (36 seconds). Further specific coagulation testing included the measurement of individual coagulation factors FII, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, and FXII. Diagnostic steps for the detection and identification of monoclonal protein included serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation (both serum and urine specimens).

- **Results**: The detection and identification of monoclonal protein immunoglobulin G kappa in serum and urine clarified the situation.

- **Conclusion**: Unexpectedly altered results of screening coagulation tests, without any appropriate clinical signs and symptoms in a patient without anticoagulant therapy, need to be critically considered. This consideration should direct the next diagnostic steps to clarify the cause of pathological test results.

### Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits: A unique case with a clinical course of over 46 years [^116kTHTe]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

The slow progression of disease in this patient, who did not receive immunosuppressive therapy, suggests that PGNMID may have a better prognosis than previously described. However, cases reported in the literature may not have presented until later in the course of illness when the disease was more advanced, as PGNMID has only recently been described.

There are multiple limitations to this case report, including the lack of pathology data available regarding the first biopsy and the lack of detailed clinical data after the first two biopsies. Furthermore, no other investigation was conducted to identify a potentially pathogenic clone except for serum and urine electrophoresis and serum free light chains, which are negative in the majority of patients with PGNMID. However, there is a low likelihood of detecting such a clone when no circulating paraprotein is found. As for treatment, even though no clone was detected, it has been previously shown that clone-directed therapy with agents such as bortezomib or rituximab may have a good response rate. In this case, the patient was aware of the lack of strong evidence to support any specific approach and, as a result, elected to be managed conservatively.

In conclusion, our case opens a window into the natural history of PGNMID, contradicting previous literature associating PGNMID with a poor prognosis. However, early diagnosis in this case did not affect the patient's overall outcome and is unlikely to change the course of the disease, especially since there is no established treatment course.

### Screening for antibody deficiencies in adults by serum electrophoresis and calculated globulin [^111ws49c]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the correlation between calculated globulin (CG, total protein level minus albumin level) and the gamma globulin fraction (Gamma), obtained from serum protein electrophoresis with serum IgG levels in adults (≥ 18 years).

- **Methods**: Using linear regression models, analyses of CG and Gamma levels correlation with IgG levels in adults were performed. Receiver-operator curves were created to determine cutoff values and the respective sensitivity and specificity measures.

- **Results**: A total of 886 samples were analyzed. CG and Gamma were positively and statistically correlated with IgG levels (r² = 0.4628 for CG, and = 0.7941 for Gamma, p < 0.0001 for both analyses). For the detection of hypogammaglobulinemia, i.e. IgG level below the reference value (6 g/L), a CG cutoff value of 24 g/L showed a sensitivity of 86.2% (95% CI 69.4–94.5) and a specificity of 92% (90.0–93.6). A Gamma cutoff value of 7.15 g/L yielded a sensitivity of 100% (88.3–100) and a specificity of 96.8 (95.3–97.8).

- **Conclusion**: Both CG and Gamma levels determined by protein electrophoresis analysis may be used to screen for antibody deficiencies in adults, enabling earlier diagnosis of antibody deficiencies in a routine clinical setting.

### Performance of the Sebia CAPILLARYS 2 for detection and immunotyping of serum monoclonal paraproteins [^115oxqTm]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

We evaluated the performance of the CAPILLARYS 2 (Sebia, Norcross, GA) capillary electrophoresis system for the detection and identification of monoclonal proteins in serum samples. We analyzed 104 serum specimens by Sebia Hydragel serum protein electrophoresis (agarose gel electrophoresis [AGE]/immunofixation electrophoresis [IFE]) and CAPILLARYS 2 capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)/immunosubtraction.

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: AGE and CZE had sensitivities of 90% and 81%, respectively, based on IFE as the "gold standard", and all bands detected were confirmed by IFE, resulting in 100% specificity. AGE and CZE exhibited an overall agreement of 91% on serum protein electrophoresis.

- **Detection rates**: In the population tested, IgG was detected in 29% of samples by IFE and 30% using immunosubtraction. Similarly, IgA was detected in 9% of cases by IFE and 8% by immunosubtraction. IgM and light chains were detected in 6% and 3% of cases, respectively, by IFE. However, CZE/immunosubtraction did not detect any IgM or light chains.

In our hands, AGE and CZE had the same specificity for the detection of monoclonal proteins. However, CZE/immunosubtraction seems to be less sensitive than IFE for the detection of IgM and, possibly, serum light chains.

### Tixagevimab plus cilgavimab does not affect the interpretation of electrophoretic and free light chain assays [^112ijtaM]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). High credibility.

There is concern that the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, used as preexposure prophylaxis in patients with multiple myeloma, may appear as a detectable monoclonal protein by electrophoretic methods, resulting in misinterpretation or inability to measure therapeutic responses in some patients. In this pilot study, we characterize the effect of tixagevimab plus cilgavimab (Evusheld; T+C) on interpretation of serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE), and serum free light chain (sFLC) assays.

- **Methods**: We performed spiking experiments with T+C at serum maximum concentration following a 300-mg dose (1× Cmax) and at 10 times the concentration of Cmax (10× Cmax) with pooled serum samples. SPE and IFE technical procedures were performed on the SPIFE 3000, and sFLC and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subtype quantitation was performed on the Optilite.

- **Results**: T+C-associated interference was not visible as an M-spike in normogammaglobulinemic pooled samples. Hypogammaglobulinemic pooled samples at 10× Cmax demonstrated an M-spike in SPE and immunoglobulin Gκ pattern in IFE. No increases were noted in the results of sFLC or IgG1 levels.

- **Conclusions**: This study indicates that T+C at pharmacologic Cmax is unlikely to interfere with SPE, IFE, sFLC, or IgG1 analyses when spiked into patient serum samples, but further evaluation of recently injected patients may be warranted.

### Polyclonal serum free light chain elevation is associated with increased risk of monoclonal gammopathies [^112L9erX]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Plasma cells, both normal and clonal, secrete small amounts of kappa or lambda free light chains. These are quickly eliminated by the kidneys, resulting in relatively low levels of circulating serum free light chains. However, in the presence of clonal plasma cells, as with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or multiple myeloma (MM), there is excess production of one type of light chain. This leads to a skewed ratio between the two light chains and an overall increase in their levels. An abnormal serum free light ratio becomes more common along the spectrum of disease progression from MGUS to smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), and finally to active MM. A polyclonal elevation of both kappa and lambda serum free light chains can be observed in many individuals without resulting in an abnormal free light chain (FLC) ratio, the etiology of which is not clear. It has been observed in the context of immune activation, as it can occur with chronic infections and inflammatory states.

We hypothesized that a polyclonal increase in serum free light chains may help to identify individuals at higher risk of developing a monoclonal gammopathy. We undertook this study in a population-based cohort previously examined for the prevalence of MGUS to ascertain if increased polyclonal FLC levels were associated with an increased risk of MGUS and related disorders, including SMM, MM, or light chain amyloidosis.

### Axial myopathy due to primary amyloidosis [^112S8Xrw]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

A 74-year-old man presented with progressive weakness involving only his back muscles. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy. Muscle biopsy of affected muscles demonstrated amyloid light chain deposition surrounding individual muscle fibers, as well as in the walls of blood vessels, in association with vasculitis. Selective involvement of axial muscles in isolated amyloid myopathy has not been previously described. We report the occurrence of axial myopathy with associated vasculitis as a presenting feature of primary (AL) amyloidosis. Amyloidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of focal myopathies, since the condition may be responsive to chemotherapy.

### IgM monoclonal gammopathy with heavy-and-light-chain amyloidosis resembling fibrillary glomerulonephritis determined by tandem mass spectrometry: A case report [^111NtoR9]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

A 75-year-old man visited our hospital because of the exacerbation of lower extremity edema that he had noticed three months before admission. He had received annual medical checks and had no specific medical history. His body weight had increased by 10 kg over the past five months, and his systemic edema was remarkable. Urinary protein was 9.9 g/day, no microscopic hematuria was detected, and his serum creatinine was 1.15 mg/dL on admission. The serum protein fractions showed an M peak at a high level, and serum IgM was 1657 mg/dL. Protein electrophoresis demonstrated IgM κ type M proteinemia. Although his monoclonal IgM was increased, bone marrow biopsy showed normal findings, with no infiltration of abnormal lymphocytes, plasma cells, or chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting that this was a case of IgM monoclonal gammopathy rather than primary macroglobulinemia.

Because the patient did not agree to our proposal initially, a renal biopsy was performed three months after his first admission to elucidate the cause of his nephrotic syndrome. Thus, the etiology of his nephrosis was initially unknown due to the lack of renal biopsy. Considering his background, the possibility of membranous nephropathy was high; consequently, we administered 30 mg of oral prednisolone first. Three months after his first admission, the patient agreed to receive a renal biopsy.

Under light microscopy, the biopsy sample largely consisted of renal cortex and contained 34 glomeruli. Marked enlargement of the mesangial region and strong periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive deposits were observed.

### Clinical applications of mass spectrometry in multiple myeloma [^116YdtmV]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is an emerging tool in multiple myeloma that detects and quantifies monoclonal proteins in the peripheral blood with sensitivity several orders of magnitude greater than conventional serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. Both intact light chain (top-down) and clonotypic peptide (bottom-up) MS approaches have demonstrated sensitivity comparable to — or even surpassing — BM-based assessments using next-generation flow cytometry or sequencing.

However, due to the delayed clearance of paraproteins, MS may be less informative for early response assessment, underscoring the need to define the optimal timing for evaluation. MS assays have now transitioned from research settings to commercial availability, addressing the clinical demand for sensitive, non-invasive monitoring tools that avoid reliance on BM biopsies. This review provides an overview of MS and explores its growing role in clinical practice.

### Successful hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in multicentric Castleman disease complicated by POEMS syndrome [^117SPraQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

A 39-year-old male presented with pedal edema, pleural effusion, splenomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of a monoclonal protein. Histological examination of the spleen following splenectomy showed multifocal vascular proliferation and angiovascular lesions consistent with multicentric Castleman disease. He was treated with steroids and rituximab, but without improvement. The patient was found to have portal venous thrombosis and lower extremity arterial thrombosis. He then received combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone but developed a severe inflammatory polyneuropathy that left him disabled and wheelchair-bound.

A diagnosis of multicentric Castleman disease with POEMS syndrome was made, and he then received high-dose chemotherapy with melphalan followed by autologous peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation. Following transplantation, his nerve conduction studies improved and his serum protein electrophoresis normalized. He is currently ambulatory and does not need wheelchair assistance. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation may be a treatment option for patients with multicentric Castleman disease and POEMS syndrome.

### Serum free light chain (FLC) measurement can aid capillary zone electrophoresis in detecting subtle FLC-producing M proteins [^116pvQoU]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that using a free light chain (FLC) assay as an adjunct to capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) could improve the detection of lymphoplasmacytic processes. In our study, 1,003 consecutive serum samples submitted for routine protein electrophoresis and/or immunofixation electrophoresis by CZE and FLC were prospectively analyzed. Samples from patients previously characterized as having M proteins were excluded.

Protein electrophoresis was interpreted by a pathologist who was unaware of the FLC results. Sixteen cases revealed an abnormal free kappa/lambda ratio where CZE did not demonstrate an M protein. Nine cases of B-lymphocyte or plasma cell proliferative processes were detected by an abnormal free kappa/lambda ratio where CZE did not demonstrate an M protein.

- **Cases with low free kappa/lambda ratios**: Included 1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 1 IgM lambda with aplastic anemia, and 1 lambda light chain myeloma.
- **Cases with high free kappa/lambda ratios**: Included 2 CLL, 1 lymphocytosis (possibly early CLL), 1 kappa light chain myeloma, 1 atypical lymphoma with neuropathy, and 1 nonsecretory myeloma.

The addition of the free kappa/lambda ratio to CZE increases the yield of lymphocyte and plasma cell proliferative processes detected by 56%.

### Comparison of serum free light chain and urine electrophoresis for the detection of the light chain component of monoclonal immunoglobulins in light chain and intact immunoglobulin multiple myeloma [^1167jwUT]. Haematologica (2016). Low credibility.

Response criteria for multiple myeloma are based upon changes in monoclonal protein levels quantified using serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis. The latter lacks sensitivity at low monoclonal protein levels. Since 2001, the serum free light chain test has been available, and its clinical utility is proven. However, guidelines have not recommended it as a replacement for urine assessment.

We evaluated responses using serum free light chain measurements, serum, and urine electrophoresis after 2 and 4 cycles of therapy and after stem cell transplantation in 25 light chain and 157 intact immunoglobulin myeloma patients enrolled in the IFM 2007–02 MM trial. All 25 light chain patients had measurable disease by serum free light chain and urine methods at presentation. By contrast, 98 out of 157 intact immunoglobulin patients had measurable disease by serum free light chain compared to 55 out of 157 by urine electrophoresis.

In all patients, there was substantial agreement between predicate (serum/urine protein electrophoresis) and test (serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chain) methods for response assessment, with a weighted Kappa of 0.83. Urine immunofixation became negative in 47% of light chain and 43% of intact immunoglobulin patients after 2 cycles of therapy. At this time, the serum free light chain ratio normalized in only 11% and 27% of patients, respectively.

In summary, we found good agreement between methods for response assessment, but the serum free light chain test provided greater sensitivity than urine electrophoresis for monitoring. To our knowledge, this is a substantial finding for the field of multiple myeloma.

### Reflexing suspicious β-region findings on capillary serum protein electrophoresis to immunofixation or immunosubtraction for detecting monoclonal proteins [^1165reep]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). High credibility.

Monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-proteins) that migrate in the β region on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) are often cloaked by this region's normal constituents. The present study interrogates the utility of using both quantitative and qualitative alterations in β-region bands for detection of β-migrating M-proteins.

- **Methods**: Consecutive SPEP cases analyzed by capillary electrophoresis were searched to identify the initial workup on 1,841 patients with increased total β regions, suspicious β-region findings resulting in reflex immunofixation (IFE) or immunosubtraction (ISUB). To augment quantitative information, separate β1 and β2 measurements were established and retrospectively used to evaluate their sensitivity for M-protein detection.

- **Results**: We identified M-proteins in 205 (11.1%) cases, including immunoglobulin A (IgA) (54%), IgG (24%), IgM (13%), and free light chain (9%) isotypes. Of the 15 cases flagged by separate β1 and β2 measurements that were not identified by total β-region measurement, 1 progressed to myeloma. Of the 56 β-migrating M-proteins identified by qualitative features but without increase in any of the β-region measurements, 1 progressed to myeloma.

- **Conclusions**: A combination of separate measurements for β1 and β2 regions together with detection of β-region distortions increase sensitivity for identifying β-migrating M-proteins via reflex IFE or ISUB.

### Quantification by ultrafiltration and immunofixation electrophoresis testing for monoclonal serum free light chains [^115AW7Pu]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The measurement of monoclonal immunoglobulins is a reliable estimate of the plasma cell tumor mass. About 15% of plasma cell myelomas secrete light chains only. The concentration of serum free light chains is insufficient evidence of the monoclonal light chain burden. A sensitive quantitative estimate of serum free monoclonal light chains could be useful for monitoring patients with light chain myeloma. We describe such an assay that does not require mass-spectrometry equipment or expertise.

- **Methods**: Serum specimens from patients with known light chain myelomas and controls were subjected to ultrafiltration through a membrane with a pore size of 50 kDa. The filtrate was concentrated and tested by immunofixation electrophoresis. The relative area under the monoclonal peak, compared to that of the total involved light chain composition, was estimated by densitometric scanning of immunofixation gels. The proportion of the area occupied by the monoclonal peak in representative densitometric scans was used to determine the total serum concentration of the monoclonal serum free light chains.

- **Results**: Using an ultracentrifugation and concentration process, monoclonal serum free light chains were detectable, along with polyclonal light chains, in all 10 patients with active light chain myelomas. Monoclonal light chains were identified in serum specimens that did not reveal monoclonal light chains by conventional immunofixation electrophoresis. The limit of detection by this method was 1.0 mg/L of monoclonal serum free light chains.

- **Conclusion**: The method described here is sensitive and effective for detecting monoclonal serum free light chains in patients with light chain myelomas.

### A rare case of proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG2 kappa deposit: A case report [^113UtNMp]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

A 78-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with mild proteinuria, lower extremity edema, and worsening renal function. His serum creatinine level was 1.22 mg/dL just before referral to our hospital. His type 2 diabetes mellitus had been well controlled for several years, with hemoglobin A1c levels between 6.2% and 7.4%. There was no family history of kidney disease.

On admission to our hospital, the patient's blood pressure was 132/48 mmHg, pulse rate was 78 beats/min, and body temperature was 36.9°C. Physical examination revealed no significant systolic heart murmur on auscultation. Examination of the lungs, abdomen, and central and peripheral nervous systems found no abnormalities. However, mild edema was observed in the lower extremities.

- **Laboratory data**: The patient's laboratory data on admission are summarized as follows: Urinalysis showed markedly elevated proteinuria, with protein excretion at 6.37 g/day and hematuria with 10–19 red blood cells per high-powered field. Serum albumin level was 3.1 g/dL, and serum creatinine level was 1.68 mg/dL (reference range, 0.65–1.07 mg/dL), with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 56 mL/min/1.73 m². White blood cell count was 8.62 × 10³ cells/μL (reference range, 3.3 × 10³–8.6 × 10³ cells/μL), hemoglobin level was 10.5 g/dL (reference range, 13.7–16.8 g/dL), and platelet count was 22.4 × 10⁴ cells/μL (reference range, 15.8 × 10⁴–34.8 × 10⁴ cells/μL). Serum IgG level was 1120 mg/dL (reference range, 861–1747 mg/dL), IgA level was 222 mg/dL (reference range, 93–393 mg/dL), and IgM level was 28 mg/dL (reference range, 33–183 mg/dL). The IgE level was not completely recorded.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, the BSH 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining immunofixation upon the detection of a new M protein to confirm the type of monoclonal protein. Additionally, the guidelines advise obtaining a serum free light chain assay to measure free light chain levels and calculate the free light chain ratio.

### What do the elevated protein levels mean in my patients with myeloma, amyloidosis, and related disorders [^115uLPTN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma, light chain amyloidosis, and other plasma cell dyscrasias are characterized, in part, by abnormal production of paraproteins that are often responsible for the sequelae of those diseases. These paraproteins are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins produced by clonal antibody-secreting cells (usually plasma cells, but occasionally B lymphocytes). Significant heterogeneity exists in the presentation of these diseases, ranging from incidental detection of a monoclonal protein in an asymptomatic patient to life-threatening manifestations that require urgent diagnostic confirmation and intervention.

Successful management of such scenarios requires a fundamental understanding of the laboratory assays at one's disposal, their role in the workup of paraproteinemias, and the interpretation thereof. This review broadly covers these assays and their roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of these diseases.

### How I manage monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^112zY9TQ]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is, in many ways, a unique hematologic entity. Unlike most hematologic conditions, for which the diagnosis is intentional and credited to hematologists, the discovery of MGUS is most often incidental and made by non-hematologists. MGUS is considered an obligate precursor to several lymphoplasmacytic malignancies, including immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia; therefore, long-term follow-up is generally recommended.

Despite its high prevalence, there is surprisingly limited evidence to inform best clinical practice both at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. We present seven vignettes to illustrate common clinical management questions that arise during the course of MGUS. Where evidence is present, we provide a concise summary of the literature and clear recommendations on management. Where evidence is lacking, we describe how we practice and provide a rationale for our approach. We also discuss the potential harms associated with MGUS diagnosis, a topic that is rarely, if ever, broached between patients and providers or even considered in academic debate.

### Screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is contraindicated [^112r1hTa]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is contraindicated because screening, as it is currently performed, causes harm but provides no benefit. MGUS is a common finding in elderly subjects, with a prevalence of 3.2% in people older than 50 years of age. There is no treatment for this disorder. The diagnosis of MGUS generates as much mental anguish and trauma as a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, in part due to the reevaluations to which patients are subjected every few months.

Neoplastic disorders of plasma cells include MGUS, asymptomatic/smouldering multiple myeloma (SMM), and multiple myeloma (MM). MM is a malignant disorder that, while treatable, is not curable. MGUS and SMM are pre-malignant disorders. Patients with MGUS develop MM at the rate of 1–2% per year. A proportion of MGUS cases, especially kappa chain MGUS, resolve spontaneously. In incidentally discovered MGUS, additional investigation would be appropriate in symptomatic patients, especially in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance. However, it is inappropriate to subject patients with just an abnormal κ/λ ratio to repeated monitoring and investigations. It is worth noting that only 4% of the patients with a κ/λ ratio greater than 1.65 had detectable monoclonal light chains in urine, and there was no other evidence of a monoclonal lesion. Subjecting individuals with abnormal κ/λ ratios, of whom 96% have pseudo-MGUS, to the surveillance protocol results in harm without providing benefit.

### Oligoclonal bands of immunoglobulins in serum leading to diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection [^115mBUru]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

To present a unique case where detection of oligoclonal bands in serum led to the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

A 64-year-old man treated for hypertension for 11 years had laboratory tests ordered by his primary care physician, including serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and serum immunofixation electrophoresis.

The total protein serum concentration was elevated at 9.6 g/dL. The SPE showed an oligoclonal pattern of multiple discrete bands in the γ region; the concentration of one band was approximately 1 g/dL and that of two bands was approximately 0.5 g/dL each, with multiple smaller overlapping bands at approximately 0.1 g/dL each. All fractions by SPE were within reference intervals except for the γ fraction, which was elevated at 3.4 g/dL. The IFE demonstrated that this oligoclonal pattern was a mixture of multiple bands of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-λ and IgG-κ. The patient's HIV-1 antibody screen and HIV-1 Western blot were positive on three subsequent visits with strongly positive HIV-1 antibody index values of more than 50 (cutoff value of 1.0 for reactivity).

The etiology of HIV-associated clonal immunoglobulin bands is hypothesized to result from chronic antigenic stimulation leading to B-cell hyperplasia. In this regard, hypergammaglobulinemia is a well-known consequence of HIV infection due to B-cell activation, associated with paraproteins, and can be seen at any stage of the disease.

### Replacing urine protein electrophoresis with serum free light chain analysis as a first-line test for detecting plasma cell disorders offers increased diagnostic accuracy and potential health benefit to patients [^117F2xiY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

To determine the most clinically effective diagnostic testing strategy for plasma cell disorders in the clinical laboratory, serum and urine samples from 2,799 patients with suspected plasma cell dyscrasias were tested using alternative diagnostic testing strategies. These strategies consisted of serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) combined with either urine protein electrophoresis (UPE) or serum free light chain (sFLC) analysis.

The combination of sFLC analysis and SPE demonstrated the greatest sensitivity (100%), detecting abnormalities in all 124 patients diagnosed with plasma cell disorders. Routine sFLC testing showed potential health benefits for specific patients in the study. For instance, a patient with a markedly abnormal sFLC result was diagnosed with light chain deposition disease by renal biopsy, although no abnormality was detected by SPE or UPE. Another patient diagnosed with multiple plasmacytomas following a biopsy of a lung tumor had a grossly abnormal sFLC result, an equivocal weak-positive SPE result, and no urine sample was received by the laboratory.

Our study suggests that the combination of SPE and sFLC analysis is the most clinically effective first-line diagnostic testing strategy for detecting plasma cell disorders in the clinical laboratory.

### Detection by immunofixation of M proteins in hypogammaglobulinemic patients with normal serum protein electrophoresis results [^1117AMwv]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) demonstrates a monoclonal protein as an M spike in the majority of patients with monoclonal gammopathies. However, in patients with an apparently normal SPE pattern or hypogammaglobulinemia, immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) can reveal an M protein. We undertook this study to determine the yield of reflex IFE testing in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and to identify any laboratory or biochemical parameters that would predict a positive IFE result. We evaluated 380 patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and a normal SPE pattern. Of these, 37 (9.7%) had a positive IFE result in serum, urine, or both.

- **Positive predictors**: Of the other laboratory values evaluated, a high alpha2-globulin level with an increased alpha2-globulin/alpha1-globulin ratio, a low hemoglobin level, and an elevated creatinine level predicted a positive IFE result. There was a 2-fold increase in the odds ratio for a positive IFE result when the alpha2-globulin/alpha1-globulin ratio was elevated.

We recommend reflex IFE testing in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia with a normal SPE pattern if any of the following are present: elevated alpha2-globulin/alpha1-globulin ratio, low hemoglobin level, and elevated creatinine level.

### The clinical relevance and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and related disorders: Recommendations from the European Myeloma Network [^112duMU4]. Haematologica (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, specifically in relation to laboratory testing, the EMN 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests. These tests help exclude multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, AL amyloidosis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients with symptoms or laboratory abnormalities likely attributable to the underlying MGUS clone:

- **CBC with differential**: Complete blood count with a detailed breakdown of white blood cells.
- **Blood chemistry**: This includes calcium, albumin, and creatinine levels.
- **Serum and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation**: To detect abnormal proteins in blood and urine.
- **Measurement of free light chains**: Important for assessing the presence and quantity of these proteins.

### Noninfectious mixed cryoglobulinaemic glomerulonephritis and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a coincidental association [^115SBVUw]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy is diagnosed when monoclonal immunoglobulin (mIg) secreted into the circulation by a proliferating clone of plasma cells or B cells is detected using serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), immunofixation (SIFE), free light chain assays (SFLC), urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), or urine immunofixation (UIFE). Further evaluation is often necessary to identify one of the malignant clonal disorders, which include multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia, B cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, in most patients, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or another pre-malignant condition is diagnosed.

Previous studies have established a clear association of type 1 cryoglobulinaemic glomerulonephritis (CGN) not only with malignant clonal disorders but also with MGUS. This has led to the inclusion of type 1 CGN within the disease classification of monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). This term recognizes that certain renal lesions may be the result of nephrotoxic mIg produced by small, pre-malignant plasma cell or B cell clones, with confirmation in many cases based on light chain-restricted renal staining.

### Interference of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies with routine serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation in patients with myeloma: Frequency and duration of detection of daratumumab and elotuzumab [^111kX81Z]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

We investigated the frequency and pattern of detection of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (t-mAbs) daratumumab and elotuzumab by routine serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IF) in treated patients with myeloma.

- **Methods**: Detection of t-mAb was assessed in 22 patients by retrospective review of SPE/IF ordered prior to, during, and after 26 individual courses of therapy.

- **Results**: t-mAb was distinguishable from M-protein in 16 of 26 courses, with daratumumab detected in nine of nine and elotuzumab in six of seven patients. t-mAb was detected on first follow-up SPE/IF in 12 patients, with earliest detection 7 days after therapy initiation and latest detection 70 days after therapy. t-mAb persisted throughout induction therapy in most patients, with loss of detection during maintenance daratumumab.

- **Conclusions**: When distinguishable from M-protein, t-mAbs are detectable in 93% of treated patients as soon as 7 days after the initial dose and are consistently observed throughout induction therapy, warranting increased monitoring and careful interpretation of SPE/IF.

### Investigation and management of the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: A British Society for Haematology good practice paper [^113VMzX9]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, BSH 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain risk stratification (either in primary care or secondary care) using a validated published model, preferably models not involving a bone marrow examination, to optimize initial management and further follow-up in patients with newly diagnosed MGUS.

### Screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is contraindicated [^1179j5p4]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Even with evidence of the lack of usefulness of the κ/λ ratio as a diagnostic marker for MGUS, patients are being subjected to additional testing, including bone marrow biopsy without the benefit of urine immunofixation electrophoresis (UIFE). A particularly problematic sentiment has been expressed by the authors of the iStopMM study, namely, "To address this, we recently described the first screened cohort of LC‐SMM and proposed an updated definition consisting of abnormal FLC levels together with > 10% PC in the bone marrow (BM) and overcomes the inconvenience and ineffectiveness of using urine measurements of monoclonal proteins". This sentiment suggests that UIFE is more inconvenient than trephine bone biopsy, which is clearly contrary to most patients' perceptions of urinalysis versus invasive bone biopsy. In addition, UIFE is not ineffective; in fact, in a large study, a positive UIFE was the only evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy in about 3% of cases.

- **Serum free light chain assay**: The serum free light chain (SFLC) assay and κ/λ ratio have limited usefulness in MGUS and other disorders. Documented utility for SFLC is limited to monitoring light chain MM and diagnosis of light chain predominant multiple myeloma (LCPMM). Other diagnostic criteria based on SFLC have been contested. For example, involved light chain level and ratio of involved to uninvolved light chain level in diagnosing myeloma defining condition. The sensitivity of this criterion is < 16%. It is possible that had the criterion been based on light chain-specific levels, it might have been more useful for diagnosing MM.

### What about (mg)us? Towards tailored testing in monoclonal gammopathies [^116We96T]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

A further layer of complexity in monoclonal gammopathies is the existence of very rare, non-malignant, albeit severely disabling entities, such as light-chain amyloidosis or renal, neurological, or myopathic disease for which the abbreviation "MGCS" (monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance) was coined. These entities are typically characterized by their underlying low-burden plasma cell dyscrasias and by a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms. This highlights the need for more sensitive laboratory tests with respect to both confirming the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy and monitoring treatment response.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry has the potential to identify even small amounts of monoclonal proteins that go unrecognized by serum protein electrophoresis and serum immunofixation. A large study has proven its superiority in detecting monoclonal gammopathies in a defined screening cohort. Mass spectrometry could in the future replace serum immunofixation, resulting in greater accuracy in detecting gammopathies and excluding false-positive cases on immunofixation. The incremental benefit of this advanced technology is most likely to occur in low-level conditions.

From a diagnostic perspective, certain "red flags" may serve as initial clues to the underlying clonal B-/plasma cell proliferation. Awareness is a prerequisite to allow for a timely diagnosis.

### Differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^113itTDc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic plasma cell disorder occurring in 4.2% of adults over 50 years of age, which can progress into symptomatic diseases either through proliferation of the plasma cell clone, giving rise to multiple myeloma and other lymphoplasmacellular neoplasms, or through organ damage caused by the monoclonal protein, as seen in light-chain amyloidosis and related conditions. Differential diagnosis of asymptomatic and symptomatic monoclonal gammopathies is the determinant for starting therapy. The criteria for determining end-organ damage should include markers of organ injury caused by the monoclonal protein.

Patient assessment and optimal follow-up are now performed using risk stratification models that should also take into account the risk of developing AL amyloidosis. Patients with low-risk MGUS (approximately 40% of all MGUS patients) need limited assessment and very infrequent follow-up. The ongoing development of novel molecular biomarkers and advanced imaging techniques will improve the identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from early therapeutic intervention through innovative clinical trials.

### Consensus recommendations for standard investigative workup: Report of the International Myeloma Workshop Consensus Panel 3 [^112HUemF]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

A panel of members of the 2009 International Myeloma Workshop developed guidelines for the standard investigative workup of patients with suspected multiple myeloma. Both serum and urine should be assessed for monoclonal protein. Measurement of monoclonal protein by densitometer tracing or nephelometric quantitation is recommended, and immunofixation is required for confirmation. The serum-free light chain assay is recommended in all newly diagnosed patients with plasma cell dyscrasias. Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy, along with the demonstration of the clonality of plasma cells, is necessary. Serum β(2)-microglobulin, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase are necessary for prognostic purposes. Standard metaphase cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization for 17p, t(4;14), and t(14;16) are recommended. The skeletal survey remains the standard method for imaging screening, but magnetic resonance imaging frequently provides valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. Most of these tests are repeated during follow-up or at relapse.

### Evusheld, a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-directed attachment inhibitor, appears in serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation: a case study [^112CFVBp]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays are commonly used to diagnose and monitor patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Identifying analytical interferences in SPE and IFE caused by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (tmAbs) can be challenging. Here we report the case of a 72-year-old male with a long history of relapsed immunoglobulin (Ig)G kappa MM. A follow-up SPE showed the original peak plus two additional cathode peaks. Immunofixation was ordered as a reflex test to investigate the new peaks that showed initial patient monoclonal IgG kappa in addition to two restricted bands of the IgG kappa type.

Therapeutic monoclonal antibody interference was suspected, and the patient's chart was reviewed. The patient was not on any antimyeloma monoclonal antibody therapy. However, preexposure prophylaxis therapeutic monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab plus cilgavimab (Evusheld) for severe acute SARS-CoV-2 was administered approximately 45 minutes before sample collection, which led to the identifiable spikes and correlated bands. After two days, the IgG kappa bands disappeared, confirming this therapy's effect on SPE and IFE. Therefore, clinical pathologists should be aware of when providers prescribe new monoclonal antibody therapy and become familiar with the position of commonly prescribed tmAbs therapies at their institutions.
