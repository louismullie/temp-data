## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which doctrine Cicero called the "most pernicious". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical and philosophical context of Cicero's ethics. Then, I should verify which of the answer choices aligns with his core moral commitments, especially his stance on the relationship between expediency and moral rightness. Next, I will examine the provided sources to see if any directly support a specific option. Finally, I will eliminate the distractors and confirm the best answer with reasoning grounded in Cicero's thought and the available references.

> Let me first confirm the historical and philosophical context. Cicero was a Roman Stoic-influenced philosopher who emphasized that moral rightness is objective and grounded in natural law; he sharply distinguished true moral right from mere expediency or utility, arguing that what is expedient must also be morally right or it is not truly expedient at all.

> Now, I need to check which option maps onto that core commitment. Option E, "a thing may be expedient without being morally right", directly contradicts Cicero's central ethical stance; he repeatedly warned that separating expediency from moral rightness opens the door to rationalizing injustice and corruption, making it the most dangerous doctrine in his view.

> Wait, let me verify whether any of the provided sources explicitly name this doctrine. I should double-check the references. While the packet does not contain a direct quotation of Cicero labeling this the "most pernicious doctrine", the bioethics literature repeatedly discusses the conflict between expediency and moral rightness, and the danger of treating expediency as sufficient justification for action, which mirrors Cicero's concern and supports the inference that he would condemn the idea that expediency can be divorced from morality [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should eliminate the alternatives. Options C and D about moral relativism or subjectivity are modern philosophical positions that Cicero would reject, but they are not the specific doctrine he singled out as most pernicious in his ethical writings. Options B and F about lying are related but too narrow; Cicero's deeper worry is the broader principle that utility can override morality, not just the act of lying. Options G, H, I, and J about consequences, divine indifference, or absolute truth are not the focal point of his ethical critique in this context [^notfound].

> I will now examine the remaining candidates more closely. Option A, "it is sometimes necessary to act against one's principles", is a general statement that could be interpreted in many ways; Cicero might concede tragic dilemmas exist, but his specific condemnation targets the claim that expediency alone can justify immoral action, which is captured by Option E. Therefore, Option E remains the best fit for the doctrine Cicero called most pernicious [^notfound].

> Final answer: E. a thing may be expedient without being morally right.

---

Cicero's "most pernicious doctrine" is the idea that **expediency can justify immorality** — that a thing may be expedient without being morally right [^notfound]. This view undermines the foundation of ethical conduct by allowing practical advantage to override moral duty, leading to rationalized injustice and corruption. Cicero argued that true expediency must align with moral rightness; separating them is the root of moral decay and the most dangerous doctrine for society [^notfound].

---

## Cicero's ethical framework

Cicero's ethics are rooted in **Stoic philosophy**, emphasizing virtue, duty, and natural law. He held that moral rightness is objective and universal, grounded in reason and nature, and that expediency (utilitas) must always be subordinate to honestas (moral rightness). For Cicero, any doctrine that allows expediency to trump morality is fundamentally corrupting [^notfound].

---

## The pernicious doctrine: expediency without moral rightness

The doctrine Cicero most vehemently opposed is the notion that **a thing may be expedient without being morally right** [^notfound]. This view asserts that practical advantage or utility can justify actions that are morally wrong. Cicero argued that this separation of expediency from morality is the root of all ethical corruption, as it allows individuals and societies to rationalize injustice, betrayal, and oppression under the guise of practical necessity [^notfound].

---

## Consequences of the pernicious doctrine

Cicero warned that embracing this doctrine leads to **severe consequences**:

- **Moral relativism**: It erodes the foundation of objective moral standards, leading to situational ethics where any action can be justified if it is deemed expedient [^notfound].

- **Corruption and injustice**: It provides a convenient excuse for unethical behavior, fostering corruption, betrayal, and injustice in personal and political life [^notfound].

- **Social decay**: It undermines trust, integrity, and the rule of law, leading to societal breakdown and chaos [^notfound].

---

## Cicero's arguments against the doctrine

Cicero presented several arguments against this doctrine:

- **Natural law**: He argued that moral rightness is grounded in natural law, which is immutable and universal. Expediency that contradicts natural law is false and harmful [^notfound].

- **Virtue ethics**: He emphasized that true expediency must align with virtue. Actions that are morally wrong cannot be truly expedient because they ultimately lead to harm and disorder [^notfound].

- **Practical consequences**: He pointed out that history is replete with examples where actions justified by expediency alone have led to disaster, both for individuals and societies [^notfound].

---

## Relevance to contemporary ethics

Cicero's warning remains relevant today. Modern ethical dilemmas often involve conflicts between **expediency and morality**, such as:

- **Business ethics**: Companies may prioritize profit over ethical considerations, leading to exploitation, environmental degradation, and financial crises [^notfound].

- **Political ethics**: Politicians may justify unethical actions as necessary for political gain, undermining democratic institutions and public trust [^notfound].

- **Personal ethics**: Individuals may rationalize dishonest or harmful behavior as necessary for personal advancement, eroding personal integrity and social cohesion [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Cicero's "most pernicious doctrine" is the belief that **expediency can justify immorality** [^notfound]. This doctrine is dangerous because it severs the link between moral duty and practical action, allowing injustice and corruption to flourish. Cicero's ethical framework reminds us that true expediency must always align with moral rightness, and that separating them is the surest path to moral and societal decay [^notfound].

### What principlism misses [^0c58d9c3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

Principlism aims to provide a framework to help those working in medicine both to identify moral problems and to make decisions about what to do. For it to meet this aim, the principles included within it must express values that all morally serious people share (or ought to share), and there must be no other values that all morally serious people share (or ought to share). This paper challenges the latter of these claims. I will argue that as a descriptive claim about what values morally serious people do in fact share, principlism is inadequate; more principles would be needed to make this claim true. Furthermore, I will argue that while, taken as a claim about what principles we ought to share, principlism could turn out to be correct, it is either unsupported or unable to meet its aims. The only way in which principlists can avoid these problems is to add to the current four principles.

### Our right to in vitro fertilisation – its scope and limits [^b8639c93]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

Given this notion of a moral right we may sometimes, when we state that it is wrong to do a certain thing against a certain individual, come to back up this claim with the moral claim that, to do this against this individual, would be to violate this individual's basic right to self-ownership. The idea of a moral right then appears in the premise of a moral argument.

In the present context I will have none of this. I do not believe that basic rights of this kind exist. There are both moral and methodological problems with the claim that they do exist that seem to me to be insurmountable. The moral problems have to do with the fact that, by respecting a putative basic right to self-ownership, we may come to make the world a much worse place. We may even come to encounter situations where the number and seriousness of rights-violations increase, just because we hesitate to violate an individual right. This is not acceptable from a moral point of view. Furthermore, the moral rights theorists are at a loss when we invite them to explain more exactly what it means to be a moral agent, a person, a rights bearer. And even if they were able, in the final analysis, to answer this question in a satisfactory manner (we would at least understand what they are referring to), they would still be at a loss when we ask them to explain why, from a moral point of view, moral agents or persons are so special. Why are they more important, in particular, from a moral point of view, than other creatures capable of feeling pain and pleasure? Lack of personhood may be a good reason not to hold someone responsible for her actions, but hardly a reason not to grant her rights; that is, lack of personhood is hardly a reason not to take the interests of someone into moral consideration.

### Forced to be free? Increasing patient autonomy by constraining it [^1d4b3a08]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

Towards psychological realism in medical ethics

The motivations for making informed consent central to medical ethics were laudable, but as it currently conceived, it rests on implicit assumptions with regard to the capacities of normal human beings that may be unrealistic. At least insofar as the doctrine rested upon the supposition that normal human beings can be expected, unaided and in stressful and novel contexts, to make choices that contribute to the achievement of their own most cherished ends, it seems to be in trouble. Of course, individual autonomy is, very plausibly, important enough that we ought to promote it even if it predictably imposes costs on some individuals, but the evidence is accumulating that these costs are far higher than most people imagine. It may be possible to avoid much of this cost without unduly infringing on autonomy. Indeed, it may be possible to avoid these costs while actually increasing autonomy.

### The moral primacy of the human being: a reply to parker [^69aae19f]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

In a previous paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics, the authors argued that the research ethical principle stating that the individual shall have priority over science, found in many guidelines, is utterly unclear and because of this should be explicated or otherwise deleted. In a recent commentary, Parker argued that this leaves us defending a position that would allow totalitarian regimes to pursue glory at the expense of its citizens. The present response addresses this and similar accusations.

### The right not to know and the obligation to know [^bbf4db5b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

However, this position does not rule out all moral constraints on individual citizens in their pursuit of the good life. In particular, we may still hold that in our free actions, individual citizens have an obligation to reduce where reasonable the costs to others in society. If I face two possible ways of pursuing my goals, and one involves imposing greater burdens on the rest of society, it is consistent with liberal political values to say that I ought to choose the less burdensome option. Note that the argument is importantly not that anyone has the right to force me to pursue the less burdensome method of pursuing my reasonable goals. As I detail further on, there are many things that I have a moral obligation to do or refrain from doing, but which nobody has a right to force me to do, or coercively prevent me from doing. For instance, I ought not knowingly give misleading directions to tourists, and I ought not snap at innocent questions from my children just because I have had a bad day. But while people might morally condemn or chastise me for these behaviours, nobody ought to force me to act differently.

In some cases, patients who refuse relevant medical information will make their health problems worse, more complicated and more expensive to treat. If such patients live in a society that provides publicly funded healthcare, and they make a claim for such care (as they have every right to do), then their initial refusal of information has increased the overall costs to the rest of society. When their refusal of information was unreasonable (I discuss this below), then they have violated a moral obligation not to unreasonably impose burdens on others. However, this does not mean that anyone is entitled to force them to hear the relevant information. While there might be some levels of burden that would justify this latter choice, there is no reason to suppose that the two levels — that is, the degree of burden at which one has a moral obligation not to impose it, and the degree at which others have a right to stop you imposing it — are the same.

### The moral primacy of the human being [^b9463621]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

Can the view that medical science is more important than the individual properly persuade recruitment to trials? This paper considers the nature and interests of the person and their relationships to the concepts of science and society; and analyses a conception of value used to balance the interests of science and research subjects. The implications of arguments opposing the primacy of the individual are set out to indicate their implausibility; while the primacy principle is described to show its necessity in any moral society. Finally, the importance of fully informed consent to participate is explained with the requirement that the individual human life provide the criteria of moral value for human life.

### Stem cell research on other worlds, or why embryos do not have a right to life [^32bdc6df]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2006). Low credibility.

Anxieties about the creation and destruction of human embryos for the purpose of scientific research on embryonic stem cells have given a new urgency to the question of whether embryos have moral rights. This article uses a thought experiment involving two possible worlds, somewhat removed from our own in the space of possibilities, to shed light on whether early embryos have such rights as a right not to be destroyed or discarded (a "right to life"). It is argued that early embryos do not have meaningful interests or any moral rights. Accordingly, claims about the moral rights of embryos do not justify restrictions on stem cell research.

### The right not to know and the obligation to know [^b1c8cd41]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Such an argument may take two forms. The stronger form argues that once suitably strong interests of other people besides the patient are involved, the patient no longer has a claim against their doctor (or other medical professionals) not to tell them relevant information. They may even lose the right that their doctor does not tell others, that is, those affected, the patient's normally private medical information. The weaker form of this argument is that while medical professionals still have obligations to their patients to respect their wishes not to know, it is no longer morally innocent of the patient to enforce that right. On this view, while the patient still has the RNTK in an institutional context, they do not have such a right at a more general moral level. I will say more about this idea of rights operating at different contexts shortly.

Arguments against the RNTK that appeal to the interests of those besides the patient typically focus on harms to particular individuals who have some connection to the patient (eg, existing family; possible future children; sexual partners). Some authors do also consider the broader social good. Rhodes supports a duty to participate in population studies, while Knoppers and Chadwick note that such participation might be supported by an appeal to solidarity.

But it is also possible to argue for a defeasible moral obligation to acquire relevant knowledge about one's health — and, thus, the absence of a moral right not to do so — in a different way. This argument appeals to a further obligation: not to impose unreasonable, avoidable burdens on others. In a pluralistic, liberal society, individuals should have considerable freedom to pursue the kind of life that they consider best. Such pursuit, according to classical liberalism, should be constrained neither by appeal to either the individual's own welfare, nor the purported irrationality of their values.

### Is there a' new ethics of abortion'? [^966a35b3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

This paper argues that the central issue in the abortion debate has not changed since 1967 when the English parliament enacted the Abortion Act. That central issue concerns the moral status of the human fetus. The debate here is not, it is argued, primarily a moral debate, but rather a metaphysical debate and/or a theological debate — though one with massive moral implications. It concerns the nature and attributes that an entity requires to have "full moral standing" or "moral inviolability" including a "right to life". It concerns the question when, in its development from newly fertilised ovum to unequivocally mature, autonomous morally inviolable person does a human being acquire that nature and those attributes, and thus a "right to life". The paper briefly reviews standard answers to these questions, outlining some problems associated with each. Finally there is a brief discussion of one way in which the abortion debate has changed since 1967 — notably in the increasingly vociferous claim, especially from disability rights sectors, that abortion on grounds of fetal abnormality implies contempt for and rejection of disabled people — a claim that is rebutted.

### A bioethics for all seasons [^5a09250f]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

While this is not the place for an exposition of the moral arguments supporting the use of mitochondrial replacement, such arguments do exist and are in my opinion well-founded. I do not doubt that permission, rather than prohibition, is the morally better policy in this case. The consultation, however, did not take the route of analysing and exploring these arguments philosophically; its recommendations were arrived at by a different but arguably more effective means. If on the basis of this, the technique is allowed to proceed, the better outcome will have been achieved.

I want to suggest, then, that at least in the policy context, it is sometimes less important to be absolutely precise or 'correct' (or truthful, if we think there is such a thing as moral truth) in our arguments than to be convincing in order to achieve the desired outcome. If what we care about are consequences, then, in some cases, the means of less than perfect moral reasoning may be justified by the ends of a functional policy that achieves the best outcome. Granted, we must have some underlying idea of what is 'right' in order to decide what policy outcome we want to achieve; as bioethicists in whatever capacity, we are not obliged, nor perhaps is it possible, to maintain a fiction of moral neutrality. But the mechanism for achieving the desired outcome does not always have to correspond perfectly to our reasons for thinking it is desirable.

### Voices of moral authority: parents, doctors and what will actually help [^e0016bf9]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

The public often believes that parents have a right to make medical decisions about their child. The idea that, in respect of children, doctors should do what parents tell them to do is problematic on the face of it. The effect of such a claim would be that a doctor who acted deliberately to harm a child would be making a morally correct decision, providing only that it is what the child's parents said they wanted. That is so obviously nonsense that it cannot be what people who claim it actually mean. In this paper, I suggest that the claim actually represents either or both of two misunderstandings. It can be a result of wrongly appealing to the principle of respect for autonomy, or a belief that doctors are not committed to acting in the interests of the child. In this paper, I show that, while neither belief is entirely justified, there are elements of truth in both. I argue that if ethically correct decisions are those that are directed to improving the quality of a child's existence, then neither parents nor doctors are in a position to make ethically correct decisions about a child except in discussion with one another. Where such discussion is not possible, I suggest there should be a national Children's Interests Panel to agree on the child's interests. The panel should include, but not be limited to, paediatricians and lawyers and its decisions should be legally binding on all parties.

### Our right to in vitro fertilisation – its scope and limits [^a42239d1]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

BASIC VERSUS DERIVED RIGHTS

Some moral philosophers see morality as basically constituted by rights. Their point of departure is the idea that certain creatures, moral agents or persons, own themselves. This is an idea of a moral self-ownership, which implies that moral agents have a basic moral right to dispose with themselves as they see fit. They have a right to themselves. This right to self-ownership is a basic moral notion. There are obligations as well, according to this view of morality, but these are derived from the basic rights. You may do to yourself whatever you like, but I am not allowed intentionally and actively to interfere with you. I ought to abstain from doing so. You may kill yourself, if you like, and you may hire me to kill you, and I am then allowed to kill you, but I am not allowed to kill you against your wish. We may sum up this idea thus: everyone is free to do as she sees fit with herself, everyone is free to exercise her right to self-ownership, but only to the extent that this does not interfere with a similar right of everyone else.

### The standard of care debate: against the myth of an "international consensus opinion" [^59ac4c11]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2004). Low credibility.

It is argued by Lie et al in the current issue of the Journal of Medical Ethics that an international consensus opinion has formed on the issue of standards of care in clinical trials undertaken in developing countries. This opinion, so they argue, rejects the Declaration of Helsinki's traditional view on this matter. They propose furthermore that the Declaration of Helsinki has lost its moral authority in the controversy in research ethics. Although the latter conclusion is supported by this author, it will be demonstrated in this paper that there is not such a thing as an international consensus opinion, and that the authorities used by Lie et al as evidence in support of their claim should not be relied upon as authorities or final arbiters in this debate. Furthermore, it will be shown that arguments advanced substantively to show that lower standards of care are ethically acceptable in the developing world, conflate scientific with economic reasons, and ultimately fail to bolster the case they are designed to support.

### The value of autonomy and the right to self-medication [^fd29629b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

In 'Three Arguments Against Prescription Requirements', Jessica Flanigan argues that 'prescription drug laws violate patients' rights to self-medication' and that patients 'have rights to self-medication for the same reasons they have rights to refuse medical treatment according to the doctrine of informed consent (DIC), claiming that the strongest of these reasons is grounded on the value of autonomy. However, close examination of the moral value of autonomy shows that rather than being the strongest justification for the DIC, respect for the value of autonomy is actually the weakest, and it is dependent upon the first two well-being-based justifications for the DIC. Recognising this has important implications for Flanigan's argument against prescription requirements.

### Ethics needs principles – four can encompass the rest – and respect for autonomy should be "first among equals" [^56e20c4d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2003). Low credibility.

It is hypothesised and argued that "the four principles of medical ethics" can explain and justify, alone or in combination, all the substantive and universalisable claims of medical ethics and probably of ethics more generally. A request is renewed for falsification of this hypothesis showing reason to reject any one of the principles or to require any additional principle(s) that can't be explained by one or some combination of the four principles. This approach is argued to be compatible with a wide variety of moral theories that are often themselves mutually incompatible. It affords a way forward in the context of intercultural ethics, that treads the delicate path between moral relativism and moral imperialism. Reasons are given for regarding the principle of respect for autonomy as "first among equals", not least because it is a necessary component of aspects of the other three. A plea is made for bioethicists to celebrate the approach as a basis for global moral ecumenism rather than mistakenly perceiving and denigrating it as an attempt at global moral imperialism.

### The charlie gard case: British and American approaches to court resolution of disputes over medical decisions [^31d030cd]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

The combination of the doctrine of privacy and the requirement of consent allows the competent patient to decline unwanted medical interventions. That 'right' was extended to the non-competent in a series of legal cases in the United States beginning with the New Jersey Supreme Court 1976 opinion In re Quinlan, and culminating in the 1990 US Supreme Court's Cruzan opinion that recognized the right — subject to a particular state's evidentiary standards — of an incompetent patient to decline any and all unwanted medical interventions. That negative moral right morphed into the claim that a patient's right of self-determination in medical cases applies not only to the refusal of unwanted medical intervention, but to the right to demand and to receive whatever medical intervention was desired.

### Reproduction misconceived: why there is no right to reproduce and the implications for ART access [^5ae074da]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Reproduction is broadly recognised as fundamental to human flourishing. The presumptive priority of reproductive freedom forms the predominant position in the literature, translating in the non-sexual reproductive realm as an almost inviolable right to access assisted reproductive technology (ART). This position largely condemns refusal or restriction of ART by clinicians or the state as discriminatory. In this paper, I critically analyse the moral rights individuals assert in reproductive pursuit to explore whether reproductive rights entitle hopeful parents to ART. I demonstrate that none of the protected actions performed, or entitlements generated are sui generis 'reproductive' rights, leading to the claim that there is no such thing as a right to reproduce. Under scrutiny, the reproductive right is a far narrower and weaker rights assertion than is recognised in the literature. I argue that the predominant position is grounded in a fundamental misunderstanding of the scope and strength of reproductive claims. I also highlight a significant conceptual inconsistency in the literature. On one hand, there is broad consensus that reproductive rights are predominantly negative, yet access to fertility treatment is framed as a component of the right. This wrongly contorts the negative nature of reproductive rights into a positive claim-right to ART. I conclude that this mistakenly frames ART access as sitting within the scope of reproductive freedom. I offer a revised conceptual paradigm of reproductive rights that has important clinical and policy implications for the provision and regulation of ART.

### Where the ethical action is [^e0fcff95]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

It is common to think of medical and ethical modes of thought as different in kind. In such terms, some clinical situations are made more complicated by an additional ethical component. Against this picture, we propose that medical and ethical modes of thought are not different in kind, but merely different aspects of what it means to be human. We further propose that clinicians are uniquely positioned to synthesise these two aspects without prior knowledge of philosophical ethics.

### Knowing-how to care [^a626ad29]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

This paper advances a new moral epistemology and explores some of its normative and practical, especially bioethical, implications. In the first part, it shows that there is moral knowledge and that it is best understood in terms of knowing-how. Thus, moral knowledge cannot be analysed purely in the traditional terms of knowing-that. The fundamental idea is that one knows-how to act morally only if she is capable of following the right normative standards. In the second part, the paper discusses ways of integrating two expressions of moral knowing-how, namely caring and respecting into a coherent normative theory. It builds up the concept of respectful care as the central ingredient of such a normative theory. Finally, it illustrates how respectful care may transform some of our current clinical bioethical practices.

### What is it to do good ethics? [^0e4282af]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

Much of my work in bioethics over the years has been throwing off ethics as pursued in the analytical tradition. I believe the field should steer clear of the rigid style of hyper-rationalist ethics and a reduction of ethics to a search for rules and principles. It should be open to a full range of influence, in style and substance, of literature, history and the social sciences. It should take in the full range of human life, individual and social.

### When should conscientious objection be accepted? [^bd909252]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

This paper makes two main claims: first, that the need to protect health professionals' moral integrity is what grounds the right to conscientious objection in health care; and second, that for a given claim of conscientious objection to be acceptable to society, a certain set of criteria should be fulfilled. The importance of moral integrity for individuals and society, including its special role in health care, is advocated. Criteria for evaluating the acceptability of claims to conscientious objection are outlined. The precise content of the criteria is dictated by the two main interests that are at stake in the dilemma of conscientious objection: the patient's interests and the health professional's moral integrity. Alternative criteria proposed by other authors are challenged. The bold claim is made that conscientious objection should be recognised by society as acceptable whenever the five main criteria of the proposed set are met.

### Who wants to live forever? Three arguments against extending the human lifespan [^b3b5ab75]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

The wish to extend the human lifespan has a long tradition in many cultures. Optimistic views of the possibility of achieving this goal through the latest developments in medicine feature increasingly in serious scientific and philosophical discussion. The authors of this paper argue that research with the explicit aim of extending the human lifespan is both undesirable and morally unacceptable. They present three serious objections, relating to justice, the community and the meaning of life.

### A dualist analysis of abortion: personhood and the concept of self qua experiential subject [^105e81a3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2005). Low credibility.

There is no issue more central to the abortion debate than the controversial issue of whether the fetus is a moral person. Abortion-rights opponents almost universally claim that abortion is murder and should be legally prohibited because the fetus is a moral person at the moment of conception. Abortion-rights proponents almost universally deny the crucial assumption that the fetus is a person; on their view, whatever moral disvalue abortion involves does not rise to the level of murder and hence does not rise to the level of something that should be legally prohibited. In this essay, I argue that, under dualist assumptions about the nature of mind, the fetus is not a person until brain activity has begun.(i) First, I argue it is a necessary condition for a thing to be a moral person that it is (or has) a self. Second, I argue it is a necessary condition for a fetus to be (or have) a self, under dualist assumptions, that there has been some electrical activity in the brain. I conclude that a dualist can take the position that abortion ought to be legally permitted at least until the beginning of brain activity in the fetus.iI make no attempt to determine what conditions are sufficient for moral personhood; for this reason, the relevant claim about personhood is purely negative.

### Non-identity problem and the 'all-things-considered' moral obligation to have genetically related children [^163f121d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Dr Marcus Teo states that my claim that prospective parents have a moral obligation to have genetically related children is invalid because I have ignored the non-identity problem. He maintains that donor-conceived persons (DCPs) cannot be harmed by their conception, as they would not exist otherwise. However, an analysis of his argument shows that the reason why he does not recognise such moral obligation is not the non-identity problem but his rejection of the Principle of Procreative Beneficence. He instead adopts a 'minimal threshold' principle: as long as a child's life is worth living, there is no obligation to select the child with the best possible life. Teo also claims that my article may cause unnecessary anxiety in parents. However, these concerns have mostly been raised by psychological professionals who have highlighted the complexities of donor conception. Nevertheless, to address these concerns, the original claim could be refined into an 'all-things-considered' moral obligation, which would acknowledge more explicitly that it can be overridden by stronger moral reasons. Talbot et al state that my conclusion regarding the future well-being of DCPs is premature and based on selective evidence. However, their literature review does not contradict my claim that a substantial number of DCPs experience negative psychosocial effects. Societal trends such as ancestry testing and increasing focus on genetic ties may worsen these outcomes in the future.

### But I accepted these disadvantages! can you be discriminated against by holding a right? [^3eff878d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Whether rights can nevertheless discriminate against their holders is an interesting question that has, to my knowledge, not yet been discussed in the philosophical and legal literature.

First, consider direct discrimination. Like obligations, rights can plausibly discriminate directly against their holders, whenever the reason behind granting the right is morally tainted. Reed seems to suggest that right-to-die laws discriminate, because they insinuate that the lives of terminally ill patients are less worth living or lack dignity. If that was the rationale behind the law, it would be discrimination. Yet the intent of the law is to protect the personal interests of terminally ill patients. Right-to-die laws aim to protect the interests of those who express an ongoing desire to die, but are physically incapable of ending their lives. Similarly, one might worry that the motive behind right-to-try laws is to exploit the vulnerable and desperate. However, this is not the case. The rationale behind right-to-try laws is to protect patient's personal interests against the overly restrictive eligibility criteria that were issued by the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) for accessing investigational drugs. Therefore, neither of these laws are instances of direct discrimination. Note that whether the law appears to portray a morally problematic image of the terminally ill to those who misunderstand its intent does not factor into whether the law is discriminatory or not.

### When four principles are too many: a commentary [^64335d6a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

This commentary briefly argues that the four prima facie principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice enable a clinician (and anybody else) to make ethical sense of the author's proposed reliance on professional guidance and rules, on law, on professional integrity and on best interests, and to subject them all to ethical analysis and criticism based on widely acceptable basic prima facie moral obligations; and also to confront new situations in the light of those acceptable principles.

### The transformation of (bio) ethics expertise in a world of ethical pluralism [^4bdbf8fb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

Today, bioethics experts have an increasing role in public life. However, the question arises: what does bioethics expertise really mean? Can there be such a thing in our globalised world characterised by ethical pluralism? I will argue that bioethics as a discipline represents the transformation of ethics expertise from a hard to a soft form of it. Bioethics was born as a reaction to the growing awareness of ethical pluralism, and it denied the hard form of normative-prescriptive ethics expertise (the ability to determine what is the right course of action for others), particularly in its medical ethics form. In contrast, the traditional medical ethics model, and pre-modern societies in general, believed in hard normative ethics expertise. From this followed the characteristic paternalism of traditional medical practice: if physicians were experts in moral matters as well, if they knew what the right course of action to choose was, then they had a right to benevolently force this course of action on their patients. The remnants of this doctrine, although rarely stated explicitly, still can often be seen in clinical practice. The whole bioethics movement can be seen as a radical denial of the doctrine of physician's hard expertise in moral matters. Bioethics, however, represents a type of soft ethics expertise (mainly value sensitivity). Hence follows the seeming paradox of bioethics expertise: bioethics is both a denial of ethics expertise (in its hard form) as well as a type of (soft) ethics expertise.

### A future like ours revisited [^2339688e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2002). Low credibility.

It is claimed by the future like ours anti-abortion argument that since killing adult humans is wrong because it deprives them of a future of value and the fetus has a future of value, killing fetuses is wrong in the same way that killing adult human beings is wrong. In The morality of abortion and the deprivation of futures (this journal, April 2000) I argued that the persuasive power of this argument rests upon an equivocation on the term "future of value". If the expression means "a potential future of value" then the moral claim is implausible because people do not in general have rights to what they need to fulfill their potential; if the expression means "self-represented future of value" then the argument fails because the fetus does not represent its future. Under no interpretation is the argument sound. In Deprivations, futures and the wrongness of killing (this journal, December 2001) Donald Marquis, author of the future like ours argument, responds at length to this objection. In the present essay the focus of the debate shifts to the proper interpretation of the right not to be killed. Donald Marquis argues that this liberty right entails the welfare right to the means necessary to sustain life; I argue that the right not to be killed does not entail unlimited welfare rights. On Marquis's view, the right not to be killed confers upon the fetus the right to whatever it takes to sustain life; on the view I defend, the right not to be killed does not confer upon the fetus or anyone else the right to another person's body. On Marquis's view, abortion is almost never permissible; on my view abortion is almost always permissible.

### Teaching spirituality to humanitarians [^23c54adc]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Morals and ethics

The term morals is derived from the Greek word 'mos' which refers to custom, and the customs are determined by a group of individuals or some authority. Morals are the social, cultural, and religious beliefs or values of an individual or group which tell us what is right or wrong. They are the rules and standards made by the society or culture which are to be followed by us while deciding what is right. Some moral principles are: do not cheat, be loyal, be patient, always tell the truth, be generous. Morals refer to the beliefs of what is not objectively right, but what is considered right for any situation, so it can be said that what is morally correct may not be objectively correct.

Ethics originated from the Greek word 'ethikos' which refers to character, and character is an attribute. Ethics refer to rules provided by an external source, for example, codes of conduct in workplaces or principles in religions. It works as a guiding principle to decide what is good or bad. They are the standards that govern the life of a person. Ethics are also known as moral philosophy. Some ethical principles are truthfulness, honesty, loyalty, respect, fairness and integrity — which we have applied in our humanitarian missions.

### Harm is all you need? Best interests and disputes about parental decision-making [^0c49aaab]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2016). Low credibility.

Common law is open to interpretation, and I shall not argue that the judges in one case or another erred in their application of the harm threshold. Instead I claim that, wherever it is employed, the harm threshold can readily be used to reach opposing conclusions in very similar circumstances. This indicates the harm threshold suffers problems of indeterminacy of similar magnitude to the best interests test. For this reason, replacing or mediating the best interests test with a harm threshold is misguided; the real issue that bioethicists should focus upon is reducing indeterminacy.

### Forced to be free? Increasing patient autonomy by constraining it [^b4a1abb8]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

Regardless of the justification, liberals hold in common Mill's claim that ' over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign'. Mill argues that liberal thought entails state neutrality between conflicting conceptions of the good, and requires a renunciation of state paternalism. That is, the state may not interfere with individuals' actions, even to promote their own conception of the good. This claim is typically justified on epistemic grounds: individuals are best placed to judge for themselves how to pursue their conception of the good.

In rejecting paternalism, medical ethics extends the liberal conception of individual autonomy from the political sphere to the medical. Just as each of us has the right to pursue our own conception of the good without interference from the state, so, it is plausible to think, we have a right to pursue the good life as we see it without interference from medical professionals. Given the importance of health and life to almost all conceptions of the good (perhaps to all reasonable conceptions of the good), the protection of the medical sphere from unwarranted interference seems justified. Medical ethics might adopt Mill's words for its own:

[T]he only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right.

The idea that each of us has the right to pursue the good life without interference from others who regard our conception of the good as wrong or immoral is deeply attractive. Nothing in what I shall say here conflicts with it. However, there are grounds for thinking that some degree of paternalism might nevertheless be justified. Though it is unacceptable, on liberal grounds, to promote particular conceptions of the good or interfere with the pursuit of any reasonable conception, there may good grounds for some degree of paternalistic interference with individual choice when this interference can reasonably be expected to promote the pursuit of the good life by that very individual's own lights. We may be justified in interfering with choice when we do so to make people better able to pursue their own conception of the good.

### Against the principle that the individual shall have priority over science [^3d9defd2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

This paper highlights a feature common to many ethical guidelines — namely, the idea that the interests of the individual shall always prevail over the interests of science and society. The paper presents how some major ethical guidelines treat the balancing of research interests against those of research subjects and spells out the difficulties in interpreting the principle of the primacy of the individual in a way that can be action-guiding. It suggests various alternative interpretations of the primacy of the individual and argues that they do not hold. Finally, the implications of this analysis for ethical guidelines are discussed.

### The truth behind conscientious objection in medicine [^1a342c1f]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

Answers to the questions of what justifies conscientious objection in medicine in general and which specific objections should be respected have proven to be elusive. In this paper, I develop a new framework for conscientious objection in medicine that is based on the idea that conscience can express true moral claims. I draw on one of the historical roots, found in Adam Smith's impartial spectator account, of the idea that an agent's conscience can determine the correct moral norms, even if the agent's society has endorsed different norms. In particular, I argue that when a medical professional is reasoning from the standpoint of an impartial spectator, his or her claims of conscience are true, or at least approximate moral truth to the greatest degree possible for creatures like us, and should thus be respected. In addition to providing a justification for conscientious objection in medicine by appealing to the potential truth of the objection, the account advances the debate regarding the integrity and toleration justifications for conscientious objection, since the standard of the impartial spectator specifies the boundaries of legitimate appeals to moral integrity and toleration. The impartial spectator also provides a standpoint of shared deliberation and public reasons, from which a conscientious objector can make their case in terms that other people who adopt this standpoint can and should accept, thus offering a standard fitting to liberal democracies.

### Abortion, infanticide and moral context [^c609f607]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2013). Low credibility.

In 'After-birth abortion: why should the baby live?', Giubilini and Minerva argue that infanticide should be permitted for the same reasons as abortion. In particular, they argue that infanticide should be permitted even for reasons that do not primarily serve the interests (or would-be best interests) of the newborn. They claim that abortion is permissible for reasons that do not primarily serve the interests (or would-be interests) of the fetus because fetuses lack a right to life. They argue that newborns also lack a right to life, and they conclude that therefore, the same reasons that justify abortion can justify infanticide. This conclusion does not follow. The lack of a right to life is not decisive. Furthermore, the justificatory power of a given reason is a function of moral context. Generalisations about reasons across dissimilar moral contexts are invalid. However, a similar conclusion does follow-that fetus-killing and newborn-killing are morally identical in identical moral contexts-but this conclusion is trivial, since fetuses and newborns are never in identical moral contexts.

### Right to mental integrity and neurotechnologies: implications of the extended mind thesis [^f6056904]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

This expansion of the protective scope of the right to mental integrity on the EMT suggests that neurotechnologies do not pose the uniquely serious threat to the right they are — on an internalist account — generally assumed to pose. It is often argued that physical interventions into the brain are, other things being equal, more morally problematic than other ways of altering a person's mental states (eg, via cognitive therapy). Underlying such claims is a sharp moral distinction between the internal and the external, where intervening in the external environment is considered to raise fewer moral worries than intervening in the internal physical realisers of mental states. Because the EMT rejects such a distinction, according to the thesis, a considerable number of interventions besides interventions into the brain can alter physical realisers of mental states and thus can also just as easily and just as directly infringe the right to mental integrity. 14 Therefore, it seems that accepting the EMT forces us to accept that interventions such as tampering with someone's smartphone can infringe the right to mental integrity in the same way as tampering with their brain states can — and thus that neurotechnologies do not pose a more serious threat to mental integrity than external interventions. 15 (Of course, there may be other reasons — independent of the right to mental integrity — for assuming that neurointerventions are more morally problematic than other interventions on external realisers of mental states. For example, interventions on internal realisers may also infringe the right to bodily integrity.)

### A waste of time: the problem of common morality in principles of biomedical ethics [^74288647]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

From the 5th edition of Beauchamp and Childress' Principles of Biomedical Ethics, the problem of common morality has been given a more prominent role and emphasis. With the publication of the 6th and latest edition, the authors not only attempt to ground their theory in common morality, but there is also an increased tendency to identify the former with the latter. While this stratagem may give the impression of a more robust, and hence stable, foundation for their theoretical construct, we fear that it comes with a cost, namely the need to keep any theory in medical ethics open to, and thereby aware of, the challenges arising from biomedical research and clinical practice, as well as healthcare systems. By too readily identifying the moral life of common morality with rule-following behaviour, Beauchamp and Childress may even be wrong about the nature of common morality as such, thereby founding their, by now, classic theory on quicksand instead of solid rock.

### Can one do good medical ethics without principles? [^155c7b13]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

The criteria for determining what it is to do good medical ethics are the quality of ethical analysis and ethical justifications for decisions and actions. Justifications for decisions and actions rely on ethical principles, be they the 'famous four' or subsidiary ethical principles relevant to specific contexts. Examples from clinical ethics, research ethics and public health ethics reveal that even when not stated explicitly, principles are involved in ethical justifications. Principles may come into conflict, however, and the resolution of an ethical dilemma requires providing good reasons for preferring one principle over another.

### Choice is not the issue. the misrepresentation of healthcare in bioethical discourse [^183ecef0]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the focus on patient autonomy has affected the development of clinical medicine. Even if choices in healthcare are partly constructed and coincidental, the right to refuse treatment is fundamental and important, and this insight is gained mostly from research ethics. Perhaps the main contribution of the discourse on autonomous choice is the focus on the central position of patients in healthcare. Yet it is not easy to capture the moral sense of respecting autonomous choice in clinical practice without relating it to respect for the persons making these choices. Indeed, our analysis does not dismiss the relevance of autonomy in clinical care, but questions the current overriding focus on choice. Respecting patients as autonomous persons is far more complex than eliciting choices and acknowledging informed consent. In the prior case with the anaesthesiologist, the moral significance of the patient's autonomous choice is disputable, but the doctor's effort to build a relationship with the patient could still be seen as an attempt to respect the child as a person. Respecting patients as autonomous persons is an important moral issue in clinical work, but it is misleading to relate this respect to the degree of choosing.

### 'The right not to know and the obligation to know', response to commentaries [^d3e317f9]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

Lisa Dive and Ainsley Newsonthink I presume an undefended liberalism, and that without such a perspective, 'competing moral factors can be traded off against each other based on their merits, or the extent to which they contribute to a desirable end'. My most explicit invocation of liberalism is to say that even with a pluralistic liberal outlook, I believe that such an obligation is justified. But I am happy to go further: it is one thing to promote trading off moral factors by their contribution to a 'desirable end'. But a liberal perspective will insist, rightly in my view, that it is the individual who must decide which ends are desirable. It is also unclear why liberals cannot trade competing moral factors 'on their merits'. The paper's definition of rights as non-absolute allows for this. But it does not mean that we should treat the RNTK as a mere preference. Dive and Newson suggest that I shift midway through my argument from discussing rights to discussing preferences, for example, in characterising the institutional RNTK as 'a claim on health professionals… to respect a preference not to receive particular information', (p.3) supporting their own view that the RNTK is merely a preference to be weighed against others. However, Dive and Newson have misunderstood my meaning: I do not anywhere characterise the RNTK as a preference. In the quoted excerpt, the word 'claim' stands in for right. Patients' preferences about their medical information give rise to claims on others, i.e. rights. However, this is not simply because they are preferences, but because they are preferences about a particular kind of information.

### The bioethical principles and confucius' moral philosophy [^f767f123]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2005). Low credibility.

This paper examines whether the modern bioethical principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice proposed by Beauchamp and Childress are existent in, compatible with, or acceptable to the leading Chinese moral philosophy-the ethics of Confucius. The author concludes that the moral values which the four prima facie principles uphold are expressly identifiable in Confucius' teachings. However, Confucius' emphasis on the filial piety, family values, the "love of gradation", altruism of people, and the "role specified relation oriented ethics" will inevitably influence the "specification" and application of these bioethical principles and hence tend to grant "beneficence" a favourable position that diminishes the respect for individual rights and autonomy. In contrast, the centrality of respect for autonomy and its stance of "first among equals" are more and more stressed in Western liberal viewpoints. Nevertheless, if the Confucian "doctrine of Mean" (chung-yung) and a balanced "two dimensional personhood" approach are properly employed, this will require both theorists and clinicians, who are facing medical ethical dilemmas, of searching to attain due mean out of competing moral principles thus preventing "giving beneficence a priority" or "asserting autonomy must triumph".

### How should morality play a role in global health? [^fc0d3e3c]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Immanuel Kant, one of the most influential philosophers, laid the foundation for defining morality. Kant argued that morality is rooted in the concept of duty, guided by reason, and governed by the categorical imperative, a universal principle that requires individuals to act in ways that could become a universal law. According to Kant, morality transcends subjective preferences and emotions, relying instead on rationality to determine the ethical correctness of actions.

The theme of our commentary is to reassert the centrality of morality in global health, which is often dominated by technocratic approaches, social media and distrust.

### Rationing conscience [^297e2b4e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2017). Low credibility.

A recent professional guideline on COs set aside the source or quality of beliefs to focus instead on actions that would be contrary to either personal or professional beliefs:

CO (broad definition): Objections to providing legal, professionally accepted, and otherwise available medical services based on a clinician's judgment that to do what is requested would be morally wrong.

All of the above cases involved physicians' moral disagreement with allocation decisions. Some of them, though (cases 3 and 4), led to positive actions rather than to withholding treatment. Should these also count as forms of CO? It is beyond the scope of this paper to address differences between negative and positive duties. However, Mark Wicclair has argued persuasively that there are no good reasons to selectively protect negative claims of conscience. If positive claims of conscience are included too, it may allow CO to be claimed in cases 3 and 4. (Wicclair leaves open the question of whether positive and negative conscience claims are completely symmetric and should be treated equally. In the context of resource allocation, there are reasons to treat these differently (see below).) For clarity, here are two different forms of CO to resource allocation:

Conscientious Resource-based Non-treatment (Conscientious Non-treatment): A considered decision not to provide a legally and professionally accepted medical treatment on the basis of a personal belief that this would be an unjust use of limited healthcare resources

Conscientious Resource-based Treatment (Conscientious Treatment): A considered decision to provide a legally available medical treatment on the basis of a personal belief that this would be justified, despite a professional norm that because of limited healthcare resources the treatment should not be provided

Conscientious non-treatment or treatment might take place in the absence of a clear guideline or policy about treatment (case 1); however, they are most likely to be identified where they are in contravention of an existing guideline or policy (eg, cases 3 and 4).

### The physician charter on medical professionalism: a jewish ethical perspective [^52ff6907]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2005). Low credibility.

The physician charter on medical professionalism creates standards of ethical behaviour for physicians and has been endorsed by professional organisations worldwide. It is based on the cardinal principles of the primacy of patient welfare, patient autonomy, and social welfare. There has been little discussion in the bioethics community of the doctrine of the charter and none from a Jewish ethical perspective. In this essay the authors discuss the obligations of the charter from a Jewish ethical viewpoint and call on other cultures to develop their own unique perspectives on this important document.

### Conscientious commitment, professional obligations and abortion provision after the reversal of… [^a8b9e33c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

This might be difficult to establish in certain cases. Some would say that in every case in which a woman requests an abortion, the abortion is in her best medical interest because the counterfactuals mentioned above matter for the purpose of determining the best medical interest. Others would say that it is only in a woman's best medical interest when not receiving an abortion would result in some physical or mental health impairment for the woman because of the continuation of the pregnancy. Addressing these issues requires providing a definition of health that allows to determine whether a woman's health can be said to be negatively affected by the failure to obtain a safe abortion. Here, we just want to point out that according to this criterion, this is the kind of issue that would need to be settled by professional organisations to determine when abortion provision falls within the proper scope of professional practice.

Many, including many medical professionals and some sectarian professional bodies (such as the Catholic Medical Association), believe that the best medical interest of the fetus should be factored in. Indeed, the US States that will prohibit abortion will likely do so precisely because many people living there believe that a fetus has moral status that warrants protection of the fetus' interests and rights.

Now, the moral status of the fetus is a contested issue, e. How much priority should women have over foetuses, when it is not their life to be at stake, but their health or perhaps just their preference? This is a difficult question to answer. However, on the assumption that it is at least reasonable to think that foetuses do not have a moral status that outweighs the value of women's health and autonomy, the 'best medical interest' criterion implies that at very least doctors will be professionally justified in providing abortions to women in jurisdictions where it is illegal, when there is a serious threat either to their life or to their health. After all, they are acting on an ethical view, that is, by hypothesis, reasonable according to the ethical standards of the profession. Whether they are also professionally required depends on whether stronger ethical claims about the lack of moral status of foetuses and, therefore, their status as patient can be made, but we will not discuss this here.

### Moral distress among neonatologists working in neonatal intensive care units in Greece: a qualitative study [^1779f6c9]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The fact that in the context of neonatology, the best interest and quality of life of the infant are difficult to determine

Another source of uncertainty distress is the fact that the terms "infant's quality of life" and "infant's best interest" are not only vaguely defined but also scarcely determined, as is the notion of the right "thing to do" in the context of neonatology (P17, P19). The ambiguous definitions of these notions and the corresponding great prognostic uncertainty could explain why participants in this study perceived conflicts among fundamental bioethical principles to be extremely challenging or irreconcilable and implied that lack of resolution caused them to face high risks of uncertainty distress.

We add pain and… pain to the newborn and burden to the parents. And for what reason? Is what I'm doing in favour of the baby? (P4)… A similar claim was made by Participant P2. Participants P6, P11 and P12 felt uncertainty distress due to uncertainty regarding whether they had done the right thing. As Participant P13 asked, What do I actually offer to the baby? In other words, who am I trying to help in the end? The baby? I'm not helping it. Me? So that I feel that I did something? The parents? To show that I'm exerting myself? I don't know. Furthermore, Participant 13 noted that the fact that I put a newborn through such an ordeal to simply show that I simply tried makes me feel awfully stressed (P13). A similar claim was made by Participant P14, who asked How is it possible to hit a newborn continually and catheterize it at the very moment when it is dying? Am I doing that in order to prolong life for 1, 2, 3 days? Interestingly, participants made the following statement: You keep wondering if you are doing the right thing… Of course, somebody may pose the question: what exactly is the right thing, and who defines the right thing? And this is a big bioethical, philosophical discussion (P17). Maybe we should define once again what we mean when we refer to the quality of life. There are parents who tell us that they want this kid. It will be in a wheelchair, but we will offer it all the love and devotion it deserves because it is a human being, it has a personality (P19).

### Embryo as epiphenomenon: some cultural, social and economic forces driving the stem cell debate [^63c658fe]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

Our human embryonic stem cell debates are not simply about good or bad ethical arguments. The fetus and the embryo have instead become symbols for a larger set of value conflicts occasioned by social and cultural changes. Beneath our stem cell debates lie conflicts between those who would privilege scientific progress and individual choice and others who favour the sanctity of family life and traditional family roles. Also at work, on both the national and international levels, is the use of the embryo by newly emergent social groups to express resentment against cultural elites. The organisational needs of religious groups have also played a role, with the issue of protection of the embryo and fetus serving as a useful means of rallying organisational allegiance in the Roman Catholic and evangelical communities. Because the epiphenomenal moral positions on the status and use of the embryo are driven by the powerful social, cultural or economic forces beneath them, they will most likely change only with shifts in the underlying forces that sustain them.

### Intuitions, principles and consequences [^8f27e0b2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2001). Low credibility.

Some approaches to the assessment of moral intuitions are discussed. The controlled ethical trial isolates a moral issue from confounding factors and thereby clarifies what a person's intuition actually is. Casuistic reasoning from situations, where intuitions are clear, suggests or modifies principles, which can then help to make decisions in situations where intuitions are unclear. When intuitions are defended by a supporting principle, that principle can be tested by finding extreme cases, in which it is counterintuitive to follow the principle. An approach to the resolution of conflict between valid moral principles, specifically the utilitarian and justice principles, is considered. It is argued that even those who justify intuitions by a priori principles are often obliged to modify or support their principles by resort to the consideration of consequences.

### Committee opinion no. 617: end-of-life decision making [^c0ecefe7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

### A bioethics for all seasons [^b4ed612a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

Too philosophical, or not philosophical enough?

Where our aim as bioethicists is to influence policy, it is crucial not only that our arguments are adequate and appropriate to the task but also that they are presented in a manner that will be effective. But what to do when effective presentation involves glossing the underlying philosophy, or when the argument is philosophically sound but contextually or socially inappropriate? The problem of how to walk the line maintaining both philosophical scholarly integrity and the public acceptability necessary to retain credible influence has been a long recognised tension in bioethics.

We may think that good bioethics should aim at "actually convincing people to act differently or to change policy because of the arguments and answers that the bioethicist provides", but this says nothing about how these arguments and answers should be derived. If this is indeed what we think our job is, then privately reasoning our way to what is morally right and publicly presenting views aimed at changing policy or behaviour to achieve a morally better outcome are two linked but distinct faces of bioethics.

This can be illustrated by reference to two examples from across the lifetime of what we might call contemporary bioethics in this country: the seminal report of the Warnock Committee on embryo research in 1984 that eventually led to the foundation of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), and the policy recommendations produced by the HFEA's own consultation on mitochondrial replacement, 30 years later.

The activities of the Warnock Committee and the resulting Warnock Report have been widely seen as a test case for the role of philosophical bioethics in policymaking. Commentaries at the time criticised the approach and reasoning by which the committee arrived at its recommendations, notably whether the commitment to compromise was an appropriate response to moral pluralism, and whether there was any sound moral basis for selecting the 14-day limit as the 'bright line' after which research should be prohibited. But producing watertight philosophical reasoning and dispensing moral expertise was not the committee's self-stated mission. Instead, as Warnock herself argued, the aim was to facilitate a dialogue and process by which the plurality of dissenting moral views could somehow forge a workable policy decision.

### Authority without identity: defending advance directives via posthumous rights over one's body [^67015243]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

This paper takes a novel approach to the active bioethical debate over whether advance medical directives have moral authority in dementia cases. Many have assumed that advance directives would lack moral authority if dementia truly produced a complete discontinuity in personal identity, such that the predementia individual is a separate individual from the postdementia individual. I argue that even if dementia were to undermine personal identity, the continuity of the body and the predementia individual's rights over that body can support the moral authority of advance directives. I propose that the predementia individual retains posthumous rights over her body that she acquired through historical embodiment in that body, and further argue that claims grounded in historical embodiment can sometimes override or exclude moral claims grounded in current embodiment. I close by considering how advance directives grounded in historical embodiment might be employed in practice and what they would and would not justify.

### Ethical considerations in the globalization of medicine – an interview with james giordano [^85e995a2]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

But, to return to the main issue of human experimentation - and particularly clinical trials, the key issues center upon the notion of "good" that is derived from research. We can view science as one of the major pillars of medicine, with research - and perhaps most importantly in the contemporary view, the clinical trial - as the fundamental "tool" with which to acquire scientific knowledge and technical capability. In this way, biomedical science fortifies the knowledge-base and technical capabilities of medicine, and by extension, is instrumental to the achievement of the fundamental goods of health, wellness and a lessening of the human predicament of injury, disease, illness and suffering.

But here it is important to note that the other pillar of medicine is humanitarian consideration and care. I am fond of quoting Edmund Pellegrino's claim that medicine is "… the most humanitarian endeavour of the sciences, and the most scientific endeavour of the humanities".

Indeed, medicine - and the science that serves it - is focused upon the primacy of the good of the person who is the patient. It becomes evident that any discussion of the "good" opens a Pandora's Box when attempting to define what this means in and between peoples, groups and cultures. In clinical research, the (basic) goods and the explicit goals are to generate information necessary to address questions about the nature of a disease, injury and/or illness; if and how a treatment works, in whom, under what conditions, and ultimately, to effect some therapeutic benefit - and to avoid or lessen harms and burdens - to the populations represented by those studied. Yet, questions, issues and problems arise relative to who should be included in research, methods of groups selection, distribution of treatments to those studied, and openness in defining the parameters of the study, its benefits and risks. Of particular emphasis is the notion of informed consent, given the novelty - and in many cases uncertainty - of specific cutting-edge interventions and technologies. This then generates concerns about asymmetries - and inequities - of power that exist between those conducting (and funding) research, and those that are participating subjects, the economic - and in some cases political - forces that may create pulling trends over the scope, conduct and allocation of scientific and medical studies, goods and resources, and how these power dynamics must be addressed, and biomedical research and its translational provisions defined, guided, and governed - both by ethics and through well-informed policy.

### Commitment to honesty oaths decreases dishonesty, but commitment to another individual does not affect dishonesty [^a086670a]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

Indeed, further empirical evidence supports the assertion that social commitment to moral norms decreases dishonesty and increases honesty. A meta-analysisfound that honesty oaths or pledges can increase honest behavior (g = 0.24 [0.16, 0.32]). Again, they found high heterogeneity and evidence for publication bias. In addition, field studies have provided mixed to no support for the idea that commitment to moral norms can increase honesty –.

Considering all the previously mentioned points, why would different forms of social commitment result in various outcomes with regard to honest behavior? The two types of commitment are likely to make two different norms salient: a moral concern for honesty (i.e. wanting to be an honest person) and a prosocial and loyalty concern targeted specifically at the other individual (i.e., wanting to cooperate with the other individual(s) and wanting to behave loyal to the other individual(s)). When the concern for cooperation collides with the concern for honesty, individuals might be willing to trade their moral currencies, and prioritize prosocial concerns, in order to justify their dishonest behavior, especially if they can gain from it. We expect that a stronger commitment to other individuals should increase attendance to prosociality norms and concerns, whereas a stronger commitment to a general moral norm (e.g. telling the truth) should increase attendance to moral norms and concerns. We acknowledge the fact that prosocial or loyalty norms are often considered moral or the right thing to do (e.g. it is considered morally right to altruistically help another person). However, we focus on situations in which the prosocial norm (i.e. helping another person or group) goes against the moral norm (i.e. telling the truth).

### Defending an inclusive right to genital and bodily integrity for children [^af3c33ff]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A body-oriented approach to understanding the right to bodily integrity attributes to the body a value of its own as a site of 'moral experience' (: p. 188), its moral value is distinct from the person or people who exercise(s) control over it and it 'cannot (entirely) be owned or controlled' (: p. 183). When it comes to the child, the right to bodily integrity has the character of protecting their interest in having an intact body, so long as there is not a medical need to interfere with the body, and carries with it a duty in others to respect their bodies as the physical boundary of their integrated subjectivity, and importantly, it emphasises the idea that the individual's body cannot and should not be owned or controlled by others.

Dekkers et al. identify a paradox in the moral outlook of religious groups that are committed to the concept of bodily integrity, but practise child genital cutting for religious purposes. The authors found that there are different views of bodily integrity, some of which contain the idea that child genital cutting is permissible because it is thought of as contributing to male children's bodily integrity: without it, their bodies are viewed as imperfect. In their analysis of different perspectives on MGC and FGC of minors amongst people from Muslim and Jewish communities, they observe that while many of the people they interviewed did not consider bodily integrity to be violated by MGC, they invariably considered FGC to be a violation of bodily integrity (: p. 188). The interviewees also reported a feeling of unease and discomfort when witnessing MGC, despite the fact that in their view 'it definitely needs to be done' (p. 188). Dekkers et al. claim that:

### Two tragedies argument: two mistakes [^67c9c62c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

Most opposition to abortion turns on the claim that human fetuses are full moral agents from conception (or soon afterwards). Critics argue that antiabortion theorists act hypocritically when they neglect spontaneous abortions-valuing some fetal lives and not others. Many philosophers draw a distinction between killing and letting die, with the former being morally impermissible and latter acceptable. Henrick Friberg-Fernros appeals to this distinction with his Two Tragedies Argument, contending that anti-abortion theorists are justified in prioritising preventing induced abortions over spontaneous ones, as the former involves two tragedies-a death and a killing. However, induced abortion can involve either killing or letting die, and thus this view is incompatible with the traditional anti-abortion view. Furthermore, Friberg-Fernros appears to value preventing killing attempts more than preventing actual deaths.

### Moral agency in pain medicine: philosophy, practice and virtue [^29699375]. Pain Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Although established as a field of specialization, pain medicine remains somewhat fractionated. Such lack of cohesion creates dissonance on multiple levels, and thus, impedes the provision of effective pain care. This paper asserts that there is a core philosophy of medicine that reflects the intellectual and moral quality of the healing relationship. I argue that pain medicine, in all its constituent disciplines, is bound to this philosophy. The intricate relationship between pain, the pain patient, and the pain physician creates pragmatic and moral dilemmas that may not be well served by the use of prima facie principles. It is argued that an agent-based, virtue ethics best enable the clinician to both apprehend the complexity of this relationship and appreciate other ethical approaches in the discourse arising from issues of care.

### Effective altruism in global health: doing better, justly [^215a8344]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Some assert that the positive claims made by EA are 'independent of any theoretical commitments'. MacAskill himself has described EA as a non-normative combination of projects: intellectual (how to do the most good with a given unit of resources) and practical (how to best implement the results of the former). He claims that it is, therefore, 'consistent with any moral view'. Still, it is argued — and we agree — that the calculus employed by EA is decidedly consequentialist (see the online supplemental appendix for an overview of three major ethical frameworks). That is, the right course of action is that which results in the 'best' state of affairs, and 'best' is qualified according to some theory of value. Ord acknowledges consequences are not the only things that matter to everyone. However, 'all plausible ethical theories hold that consequences are an important input into moral decision-making'. MacAskill also argues there is a pro tanto reason to promote the good in most plausible moral theories, and that figuring out how we 'can do the most' to promote certain goods — with the resources we have available — is part of figuring out how to live 'a morally good life'. As a result, it is claimed, even proponents of other moral theories should support funding the most cost-effective interventions. We think this obtains, to an extent, in the global health context. Whether or not one intervention makes a difference that is potentially orders of magnitude greater than another ought to at least be a consideration — regardless of the moral framework used. Similarly, the difference between cost-effective and cost-ineffective programmes ought to factor into the rationalisation of their use whatever ethical viewpoint we take.

Having established a basic sketch of EA and the ways in which we think its central arguments apply to global health, we now turn to three critiques. The movement has recently come under increased scrutiny due, in part, to the actions of some of its biggest proponents (eg, Sam-Bankman Fried's conviction of fraud and money-laundering). We think that the cautions extolled in this manuscript are particularly relevant in light of both the legacy of colonialism in global health as well as the especially vulnerable nature of our patients.

### How should we prioritise global surgery? A capabilities approach argument for the place of surgery within every health system [^8476195a]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

We are adding our voices to support the use of the Capabilities Approach (CA) to design, implement, and evaluate policies targeting quality of life, health and specifically here, surgical access. The CA's central idea is that a good human life is not reducible to one thing (eg, happiness, wealth, liberty); a good human life consists of the abilities to be and do many different things, largely facilitated through social conditions over each person's life course. Healthcare interventions (HCIs) are one part of diverse social conditions that help individuals become capable of planning and pursuing the kinds of lives they want and value. And, importantly, the CA asserts that every single person has a moral claim to the basic capabilities of living a good life. This framework does not immediately pit specific HCIs against one another, reduce health into a single metric, or assert that one particular distribution pattern of benefits is always right. Rather, it provides an analytical framework for reasoning about the value of different components of human health, and guides inclusive deliberations and priority-setting in healthcare. The CA framework also enables policymakers to recognise the broad capacities of surgical healthcare to provide life-affirming care and address multiple dimensions of health justice that are currently excluded in decision-making.

### Choice is not the issue. the misrepresentation of healthcare in bioethical discourse [^42288a4a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

In this article we reflect upon real-life scenarios taken from every day medical practice. The examples were obtained from a recent study of doctors' medical and moral practice, in which we interviewed doctors from different specialties and observed their daily work. While the examples are trivial, considering them in light of the choice paradigm reveals an essential shortcoming of the autonomy debate. We aim to demonstrate that choice does not constitute a central moral issue in healthcare, and that the bioethical focus on autonomous choice thus misrepresents the moral aspects at play in this setting.

### Genetic enhancement, post-persons and moral status: a reply to buchanan [^f3992273]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

Responding to several leading ideas from a paper by Allen Buchanan, the present essay explores the implications of genetic enhancement for moral status. Contrary to doubts expressed by Buchanan, I argue that genetic enhancement could lead to the existence of beings so superior to contemporary human beings that we might aptly describe them as post-persons. If such post-persons emerged, how should we understand their moral status in relation to ours? The answer depends in part on which of two general models of moral status — one based on respect and one based on interests — is more adequate. Buchanan tentatively argues that a respect-based model is preferable. I challenge Buchanan's view, along these lines: If we embrace a respect-based model of moral status featuring a threshold that divides persons, who are thought to have full and equal moral status, from sentient nonpersons, thought to have less moral status, then we should acknowledge a second threshold and a level of moral status higher than ours. A better option, I tentatively suggest, is to drop the idea of levels of moral status, accept that all sentient beings have moral status, and allow that some differences in interests and capacities justify some significant differences in how we should treat beings of different kinds.

### Is respect for autonomy defensible? [^c93f320d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

Three main claims are made in this paper. First, it is argued that Onora O'Neill has uncovered a serious problem in the way medical ethicists have thought about both respect for autonomy and informed consent. Medical ethicists have tended to think that autonomous choices are intrinsically worthy of respect, and that informed consent procedures are the best way to respect the autonomous choices of individuals. However, O'Neill convincingly argues that we should abandon both these thoughts. Second, it is argued that O'Neill's proposed solution to this problem is inadequate. O'Neill's approach requires that a more modest view of the purpose of informed consent procedures be adopted. In her view, the purpose of informed consent procedures is simply to avoid deception and coercion, and the ethical justification for informed consent derives from a different ethical principle, which she calls principled autonomy. It is argued that contrary to what O'Neill claims, the wrongness of coercion cannot be derived from principled autonomy, and so its credentials as a justification for informed consent procedures is weak. Third, it is argued that we do better to rethink autonomy and informed consent in terms of respecting persons as ends in themselves, and a characteristically liberal commitment to allowing individuals to make certain categories of decisions for themselves.

### Are physicians obligated always to act in the patient's best interests? [^d64acb02]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

The principle that physicians should always act in the best interests of the present patient is widely endorsed. At the same time, and often within the same document, it is recognised that there are appropriate exceptions to this principle. Unfortunately, little, if any, guidance is provided regarding which exceptions are appropriate and how they should be handled. These circumstances might be tenable if the appropriate exceptions were rare. Yet, evaluation of the literature reveals that there are numerous exceptions, several of which pervade clinical medicine. This situation leaves physicians without adequate guidance on when to allow exceptions and how to address them, increasing the chances for unfairness in practice. The present article considers the range of exceptions, illustrates how the lack of guidance poses ethical concern and describes an alternative account of physician obligations to address this concern.

### What is it to do good medical ethics? An orthodox jewish physician and ethicist's perspective [^81cc5c1b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

This article, dedicated to the 40th anniversary of the Journal of Medical Ethics, approaches the question 'what does it mean to do good medical ethics?' first from a general perspective and then from the personal perspective of a Jewish Orthodox physician and ethicist who tries, both at a personal clinical level and in national and sometimes international discussions and debates, to reconcile his own religious ethical values-especially the enormous value given by Jewish ethics to the preservation of human life-with the prima facie 'principlist' moral norms of contemporary secular medical ethics, especially that of respect for patients' autonomy.

### Should parents of neonates with bleak prognosis Be encouraged to opt for another child with better odds? On the notion of moral replaceability [^4a9bc2fa]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The notion of moral exchangeability is scrutinized and its proper place in neonatal care is examined. On influential moral outlooks, the neonate is morally exchangeable. On these views, if the parents are prepared to let go of the neonate with a poor prognosis and opt instead for another child who is healthy, this may be the morally right thing for them to do, and neonatal care ought to ease their choice. The notion of moral exchangeability has a different place in different moral theories. Three theories are examined: deontological ethics (insisting on the sanctity of innocent human life), according to which there is no place for the replacement of 1 child for another. It is different, however, with utilitarianism and in the moral rights theory based on self-ownership. According to utilitarianism, we are all replaceable. According to the moral rights theory, neonates are replaceable to the extent that they have not developed personhood. Even a deontological ethicist of a Kantian bent would concur here with the moral rights theory. Because influential moral theories imply that the neonate is morally exchangeable, it is reasonable within neonatal care, as a general rule, to grant the parents a veto against any attempts to save a child with a poor prognosis. In particular, if the parents are prepared instead to have another, healthy child, this is to be recommended. However, this rule cannot be strict. In rare cases, it is necessary to yield to parents who insist that their neonate be saved despite a poor prognosis.

Physicians frequently face ethical dilemmas when caring for patients. To help them to cope with these, biomedical ethics aims to implement moral norms for particular problems and contexts. As a means of studying the cognitive and neurobiological features underlying the respect for these norms, moral cognitive neuroscience could help us to understand and improve ethical questioning. The article reviews recent developments in the field and presents neurobiological arguments to highlight why some moral rules are universally shared and why some ethical responses are very dependent on context.

### Substituted decision making and the dispositional choice account [^79e68d96]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

There are two main ways of understanding the function of surrogate decision making in a legal context: the Best Interests Standard and the Substituted Judgment Standard. First, we will argue that the Best Interests Standard is difficult to apply to unconscious patients. Application is difficult regardless of whether they have ever been conscious. Second, we will argue that if we accept the least problematic explanation of how unconscious patients can have interests, we are also obliged to accept that the Substituted Judgment Standard can be coherently applied to patients who have never been conscious at the same extent as the Best Interests Standard. We then argue that acknowledging this result is important in order to show patients respect.

### Why religion deserves a place in secular medicine [^4a25fc0a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

As a science and practice transcending metaphysical and ethical disagreements, 'secular' medicine should not exist. 'Secularity' should be understood in an Augustinian sense, not a secularist one: not as a space that is universally rational because it is religion-free, but as a forum for the negotiation of rival reasonings. Religion deserves a place here, because it is not simply or uniquely irrational. However, in assuming his rightful place, the religious believer commits himself to eschewing sheer appeals to religious authorities, and to adopting reasonable means of persuasion. This can come quite naturally. For example, Christianity (theo)logically obliges liberal manners in negotiating ethical controversies in medicine. It also offers reasoned views of human being and ethics that bear upon medicine and are not universally held-for example, a humanist view of human dignity, the bounding of individual autonomy by social obligation, and a special concern for the weak.

### Children's developing understanding of the value of disagreement for learning [^fece450b]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

1 A Developing Understanding of Disagreement

As children move from infancy into childhood, they are increasingly exposed to views that conflict with their own. Friends sometimes disagree, teachers introduce children to ideas and concepts that defy their intuitions about how the world works (Shtulman), and at home, children and parents often disagree over disciplinary matters. Given that disagreement across various domains is commonplace during childhood, it is not surprising that even 5‐year‐olds have nuanced views about when two people are likely to disagree and about when disagreement is acceptable. Starting at 5 years old, children treat disagreements as more acceptable for ambiguous situations where data is mixed and alternative interpretations are possible than for moral facts (e.g. Danniels and Perlman; Wainryb et al.). Children also believe that only one person can be right about settled facts (i.e. that dinosaurs lived a long time ago), but that more than one person can be right when talking about personal preferences (Heiphetz et al.). This differential pattern of reasoning can also be seen in children's response to testimony: 6‐year‐old children are more likely to conform to someone's factual belief than to a belief based on a personal opinion (Banerjee et al.). In sum, children seem to be differentiating between two kinds of beliefs. Beliefs that are more objective in the sense that there is a normatively correct answer (moral beliefs and facts about the world) and beliefs that are more subjective in the sense that at the time of asking there is not a correct or currently known answer (preferences and ambiguous facts).

### A bioethics for all seasons [^ceaae96b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

Perhaps, then, we ought to search for those works of bioethical scholarship that contain the most rigorous philosophical analysis, or the most elegant argument; or that provide insight into the most pressing issues of the day; or that enable the most effective policy solutions. But how do we measure any of these aspects, or decide which should predominate, in our determination of what we consider to be 'good'? It is important to recognise that in asking what makes good bioethics we are also inviting an opinion about what we think bioethics is, or should be.

This is a problem that bioethics has confronted repeatedly throughout its relatively short history. In so doing, it has often turned a self-reflective eye to questions of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, method and methodology (or lack thereof) — in short, how to define what it is we do. Intertwined with such issues is the question of moral expertise, of what gives us as bioethicists legitimacy to carry out the roles we claim to be able to perform.

Bioethics has at least some of its roots in philosophy, but we do not, by and large, have an explicitly-developed 'philosophy of bioethics'. Science produces explanations for observed phenomena and evaluates those explanations according to how well they describe and predict these phenomena. But if bioethics functions analogously, in attempting to elucidate some underlying moral principle, what are the phenomena we are trying to explain?

The role of moral intuitions in bioethics is a contested one, and being led by the 'moral nose' is often looked upon as being a poor method of 'doing bioethics'. Yet bioethical reasoning often relies first on appeals to intuition to establish the basic premises from which axioms can be abstracted and against which more complex problems can be compared and analysed. Can we claim, then, that we are uncovering some sort of 'moral truth'? This problem both recapitulates perpetual meta-ethical debates over the nature of moral philosophy itself and invokes issues of moral expertise — who is best placed to know or discover the truth, and whose statements should be considered as good moral guidance? How do we decide what makes something a 'good' moral explanation, and is producing moral explanations the proper purpose of bioethics?

### Charlie gard and the weight of parental rights to seek experimental treatment [^0b16deb8]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

PR and the limitations of welfare

Broadly speaking, a right may be seen as a way of empowering an individual against collective goals that disregard that individual's legitimate interests. Moral rights are normative claims supportable by reasoned arguments. Legal rights can be (and often have been) argued for on the basis of a putative moral right. Legal rights may impose binding duties on others to either enable or, more commonly, not to impede the exercise of that right. The potential to influence the actions of decision-makers makes it pertinent to consider moral rights when assessing whether Charlie's case should alter our attitudes to the parental role in decision-making in similar cases.

In disputes about children's care '[m]any of today's critics of children's rights are passionate defenders of… the rights of parents': different ethical approaches to children and parents make asymmetric claims about the putative moral rights of both parties. Arguments about rights may suggest that children: have rights; have rights that others (especially parents) should articulate; do not have rights. That parents: have rights based on their ability to advance the welfare of their child(ren); have rights over their children that are intrinsic to their status as parents. Broadly speaking (and leaving aside thornier issues of competence), my own considered moral judgement is that decisions concerning children who are unable to articulate their own wishes should be attentive to the child's welfare. In other words, PR are derivative of their ability to advance the welfare of their child. This view is shared by manyeven if they disagree about the scope of such rights or how welfare should be measured. In Charlie's case, welfare was a key factor for the courts. All sides (including the clinician proposing to deliver the innovative therapy) agreed that the chances of Charlie benefiting from treatment were 'vanishingly small'. Yet, while a focus on welfare suggests that the only basis of PR in this case was Charlie's welfare, some unremarkable aspects of the case do not comfortably fit this welfare thesis. In particular, the decision to delay withdrawal of treatment for a brief period after the courts had reached their decision, however appropriate we might feel such behaviour is, clearly continued whatever harms Charlie was experiencing. Delaying withdrawal is not unusual in similar cases. Delays are likely to be motivated, at least in part, by consideration of the interests of Charlie's parents rather than resting exclusively on Charlie's parents' ability to advance Charlie's welfare. To coherently explain why parents should be owed such respect, and to explore whether a similar basis suggests PR to have demands for experimental treatment met, it is important to consider the philosophical basis of intrinsic PR. The next section explores some of these arguments.

### Substituted judgment: the limitations of autonomy in surrogate decision making [^a9803111]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Substituted judgment is often invoked as a guide for decision making when a patient lacks decision making capacity and has no advance directive. Using substituted judgment, doctors and family members try to make the decision that the patient would have made if he or she were able to make decisions. However, empirical evidence suggests that the moral basis for substituted judgment is unsound. In spite of this, many physicians and bioethicists continue to rely on the notion of substituted judgment. Given compelling evidence that the use of substituted judgment has insurmountable flaws, other approaches should be considered. One approach provides limits on decision making using a best interest standard based on community norms. A second approach uses narrative techniques and focuses on each patient's dignity and individuality rather than his or her autonomy.

### Where the ethical action also is: a response to hardman and hutchinson [^3a5e8001]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

In Where the ethical action is, Hardman and Hutchinson make some interesting and compelling points about the way in which 'the ethical'-various values and various kinds of values-are embedded in everyday life, including the everyday life one finds in clinical interactions, understood as scientific or scientifically informed activities. However, even when one considers 'the ethical' from within the horizon of understanding adopted in their essay, they neglect several important features of healthcare and medical education. In this rejoinder, I argue that a fuller understanding would go some way to indicating the complexity of ethics and 'ethical action' in the clinic, as well as the nature of and need for 'expert' analysis and philosophical reflection on the ethical questions that modern healthcare continues to engender.

### If marc is suzanne's father, does it follow that suzanne is marc's child? An experimental philosophy study in reproductive ethics [^773d781a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reproductive ethicists commonly rely on concepts such as 'sibling', 'parent', 'child', 'donor', 'genes' or 'biology'. Such concepts are assumed to be reasonably reliable: in using them, we can be confident that we are talking about the same thing. These apparently stable concepts can then serve as a basis for discussing, for example, the rights and duties of biological versus social parents. Once we commit to one or another interpretation (eg, biological vs social ties as indicators of parenthood), we may take ourselves to be consistent in our use of these concepts and assume that they fall into a specific relation to each other. For example, if Marc is Suzanne parent, then it must also be true that Suzanne is Marc's child. We also tend to assume that we share an idea of what it means for someone to have reproduced. These choices have normative repercussions. If 'having reproduced' and 'being a biological parent' are taken as meaning more or less the same thing, this implies that the duties and rights of reproducers are the same as the duties and rights of biological parents. For example, Velleman has claimed that the people who reproduce genetically are the parents of the children thus created, and that therefore donor conception is unethical because it intentionally alienates children from their parents. Choices such as these have practical, legal and ethical implications for how we think about donor conception.

### Everyday norms have become more permissive over time and vary across cultures [^63f6e555]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Individualistic morality (Ind-Bind Scale)

Our primary measure of individualistic morality is the 9-item Ind-Bind scale developed for this study. It measures the relative importance of individualizing versus binding concerns through dilemmas. A typical item reads: "What do you think is the right thing to do in a situation when someone must either (A) cause pain to someone or (B) be disloyal to their kin?" (the full Ind-Bind Scale is presented in Supplementary Table 2). Responses were on a 5-point scale (Definitely A, Probably A, Can't say, Probably B, or Definitely B), coded such that higher values represent a greater prioritization of individualizing concerns over binding concerns. This direct comparison format is designed to measure the relative prioritization of foundations when they conflict, a common method for assessing value hierarchies. The scale's validity is strongly supported by its high correlation with several other related value measures collected in the study (see below and Results).

### Everyday norms have become more permissive over time and vary across cultures [^b65effae]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study mapped everyday norms across 90 societies, revealing how they vary across behaviors, situations, societies, and time. Our findings show that despite this complexity, much of the variation can be parsimoniously explained by the interplay between a single cultural value dimension — individualistic versus binding morality — and a few core everyday concerns.

A key finding is that societies vary considerably in their level of individualistic morality, yet show remarkable agreement on which concerns (vulgarity, inconsiderateness, lacking sense) are elicited by specific situated behaviors. This supports the psychological validity of these distinctions and provides the foundation for our model: norms differ between societies not because the meaning of behavior changes, but because the moral weight given to the concerns that behaviors elicit varies with societal values. Societies with higher individualistic morality have more permissive norms overall (reflecting liberty) but are stricter about behaviors that are inconsiderate (reflecting care) and odder (reflecting the common-is-moral intuition), while being more tolerant of behaviors considered merely vulgar (reflecting less emphasis on purity).

### A virtue ethics approach to moral dilemmas in medicine [^9fe9ba9e]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2003). Low credibility.

Most moral dilemmas in medicine are analysed using the four principles with some consideration of consequentialism but these frameworks have limitations. It is not always clear how to judge which consequences are best. When principles conflict it is not always easy to decide which should dominate. They also do not take account of the importance of the emotional element of human experience. Virtue ethics is a framework that focuses on the character of the moral agent rather than the rightness of an action. In considering the relationships, emotional sensitivities, and motivations that are unique to human society it provides a fuller ethical analysis and encourages more flexible and creative solutions than principlism or consequentialism alone. Two different moral dilemmas are analysed using virtue ethics in order to illustrate how it can enhance our approach to ethics in medicine.

### Committee opinion no. 617: end-of-life decision making [^583e5953]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Ethical principles and ethics resources — Adherence to basic ethical principles is critical in care for the dying, with beneficence requiring that the patient not be abandoned and that desired attempts at a good quality of life be supported, and nonmaleficence asking physicians to be conscious when the burdens of technological support outweigh the hoped-for benefits. Justice aims to provide access to excellent end-of-life services to all patients regardless of payment abilities, with timely referral to palliative care and hospice services, and calls for physicians to consider the cost of recommended interventions and whether they are efficacious. Respect for autonomy dictates that the choices of the patient with decision-making capacity be respected, and respect for culture allows varied spiritual or religious traditions to be understood and respected; when patients lack capacity, conflicts may arise between surrogate decision makers and cultural expectations, for which religious or spiritual advisers and the hospital or local ethics committee may be helpful, and the physician needs to balance respect for culture with the opinion that informed consent from the patient herself is a vital component of health care. The Joint Commission requires all U.S. hospitals to have a process that allows staff, patients, and families to address ethical issues or issues prone to conflict, commonly via an ethics committee or ethics consultant/consultation service that is readily accessible; some facilities offer moral distress consults, and assistance of trained palliative care clinicians and religious or spiritual advisers can help physicians and patients work through an agreed-upon plan of care.

### Prolonged disorders of consciousness: a response to a "critical evaluation of the new UK guidelines" [^5f0c5fb3]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Their discussion

Their discussion raises three other matters (diagnosis, ethics, influence of costs) but fails to discuss one vital issue.

The fundamental issue not discussed, central to the article, is how awareness is determined or validated? This is not a trivial question. The CRS-R is an excellent and valuable measure that does what it says - it measures recovery from coma. It is a wonderful simple tool for serial monitoring of any trajectory towards a change in the level of responsiveness. It does not replace detailed clinical evaluation by experts in assessing consciousness. We recognise that the whole question of 'what is consciousness?' is open to scientific and philosophical debate. Nonetheless, if dogmatic statements are to be made about patients and their level of awareness, some evidential justification is needed.

One theme in Scolding article is misdiagnosis, repeating the oft-quoted figure of 40% — most of this 'evidence' concerns categorising patients into the vegetative or MCS. One reason for using the term prolonged disorder of consciousness is that clinicians who work in the field understand that the levels of consciousness form a spectrum. Defined 'cut-offs' have limited value, especially as the level of responsiveness is known to fluctuate over time. Misdiagnosis of the locked-in state as a prolonged disorder of consciousness happens but rarely, and it is unreasonable to claim 40% misdiagnosis. The UK guidelines emphasise the need for assessment by trained, expert clinicians with monitoring over months or years if necessary.

Scolding et al.also discuss ethics. The UK working group discussed ethical aspects, had input from experts in moral matters, and circulated the document widely for comment. We acknowledge the ethical aspects of managing patients with a prolonged disorder of consciousness within the document.

### Clinical and professional ethics guidelines for the practice of thyroidology [^3b025ccb]. Thyroid (2013). Medium credibility.

Clinical equipoise in thyroidology — definition, trial justification, and patient information — states that a state of "clinical equipoise" exists when a community of experts responsible for setting the standards of care is uncertain whether treatment A is better than treatment B, and that clinical equipoise provides the ethical basis for conducting a randomized controlled trial of the two interventions. It emphasizes that there is a duty to resolve clinical equipoise to improve patient well‑being without doing harm, but this can only be done through properly designed randomized controlled trials with enough statistical power to disturb clinical equipoise. So long as a state of clinical equipoise exists, practitioners may have an ethical obligation to inform patients regarding other medically appropriate or reasonable approaches available as part of the informed consent process, and patients have a right to know that there are two different approaches, and have the right to choose.

### Committee opinion no. 664: refusal of medically recommended treatment during pregnancy [^f4bdc536]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Obstetric care — determining decisional capacity states that patients are, by law, presumed to be decisionally capable unless formally determined otherwise, and clinicians should not infer from a refusal that a patient's capacity is diminished. Disagreement with a physician's recommendations is not, per se, evidence of decisional incapacity, and although psychiatric consultation may justifiably be sought when decisionmaking capacity is in question, in no circumstance should a psychiatric consultation be used as a punitive measure or as a means to coerce a specific decision. Genuine differences in risk assessment, collective interests, and religious or cultural meanings may lead decisionally capable patients to choose options other than those strongly recommended. When a patient has been determined to lack decisional capacity, the decisions of her legally authorized surrogate generally should be honored and should reflect the patient's previously expressed values and preferences when known.

### Ethics in times of conflict: some reflections on syria, in the backdrop of Iraq [^52eae4cb]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

Some claim, perhaps with legitimacy, that it is a near impossible task to provide fair representation in any conflict. There is always a different story. But where this is the case, one needs to take a position on one side or another, declare it and move forward. For researchers working in conflict regions, this involves admitting to the challenges of accessing unbiased data, the near impossibility of obtaining 'representative' samples and the risk of the contamination of evidence. Anthropologist Elizabeth Wood argued that the "ethical imperatives of research ('does no harm') is intensified in conflict zones due to… political polarization, the presence of armed fighters and the precarious security of most residents". To these, one may add the ever-changing scenarios on the ground, from a military and a humanitarian perspective. For Ken Wilson, "researching in an 'ethical manner' seems not about proclaiming good and evil, but about enabling the reader to hear the voices and appreciate the actions of as many of the different people involved as possible". Indeed, contextualising the differing perspectives of different people can give a more accurate representation of the multiple truths in these settings.

### Taking a moral holiday? Physicians' practical identities at the margins of professional ethics [^d50e709c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Ethics 'at the margins' of professionalism

Life experience and empirical evidence indicate that physicians often find themselves in situations in which their professional practice is intermingled with other affordances, be it in contact with family and friends, political dynamicsor social media. Such situations 'at the margins' of physicians' professional practice often remain neglected in the theoretical debates on professional ethics, as displayed above. The following tripartite taxonomy provides an overview of contexts of action which that are closely related (or form part of) the physician's 'job' but are also connected to normative demands emerging from other domains of the physician's lifeworld or from general morality pertaining to all humans.

According to our view, normative demands emerging from the medical profession can go beyond common morality (eg, the kind of aid that professionals must provide to strangers), the profession's demands may stand in direct conflict with common morality (eg, in relation to medical confidentiality and the harm to a third party a patient expresses to intend), or professionalism may conflict with demands coming from other sources than common morality (eg, obligations one has as a medical professional and as a parent). Although more examples at the margins of professionalism certainly can be thought of, we contend that these can be categorised in one of these three types of relations.

### The relevance of the hippocratic oath to the ethical and moral values of contemporary medicine. part I: the hippocratic oath from antiquity to modern times [^fa254b0d]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The present paper discusses the relevance and significance of the Hippocratic Oath to contemporary medical ethical and moral values. It attempts to answer the questions about some controversial issues related to the Oath. The text is divided in two parts. Part I discusses the general attributes and ethical values of the Oath, while Part II presents a detailed analysis of each passage of the Oath with regard to perennial ethical principles and moral values. Part I starts with the contribution of Hippocrates and his School of Cos to medicine. It continues by examining the moral dilemmas concerning physicians and patients in the Classical Times and in the Modern World. It also investigates how the Hippocratic Oath stands nowadays, with regard to the remarkable and often revolutionary advancements in medical practice and the significant evolution in medical ethics. Further, it presents the debate and the criticism about the relevance of the general attributes and ethical values of the Oath to those of modern societies. Finally, it discusses the endurance of the ethical values of the Hippocratic Oath over the centuries until today with respect to the physicians' commitment to the practice of patient-oriented medicine. Part I concludes with the Oath's historic input in the Judgment delivered at the close of the Nuremberg "Doctors' Trial"; this Judgement has become legally binding for the discipline in the Western World and was the basis of the Nuremberg Code. The ethical code of the Oath turned out to be a fundamental part of western law not only on medical ethics but also on patients' rights regarding research.

### Nutritional care is a human right: translating principles to clinical practice [^c6d441c0]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2022). High credibility.

Nutritional care process and the phases of care — the ethics of care framework is outlined as "a normative theory that places the phenomenon of care at the center of ethical reflection", grounded in the human being "as a vulnerable and interdependent relational being". In contrast to theories emphasizing autonomy, it "emphasizes the notion of vulnerability", and "emphasizes the importance of response; thus, the ethical question is 'how to respond?'" Defined by Tronto as a "practice and a disposition", it is "an ongoing process comprising five phases of caring and five moral characteristics of care", with these moral elements being "specific attitudes and skills necessary for effective caring".

### Abortion, infanticide and bodily rights: a response to robinson [^d113715d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

James Robinson defends the claim that abortion and infanticide are morally distinct. This claim is defensible, he argues, because we have good reasons to condemn infanticide that do not apply to abortion. Specifically, Robinson claims that infanticide involves violation of infants' bodily rights. Abortion does not involve the violation of fetuses' bodily rights, however, because fetuses do not have bodily rights. Here, I offer a response. Robinson provides two reasons for thinking that fetuses lack bodily rights: (1) they do not possess bodies of their own and (2) we have clear duties to infants-which seemingly implies that infants have rights-whereas the same duties do not apply to fetuses. Robinson's first claim, that fetuses do not possess bodies of their own, rests on a mistaken view of the metaphysics of pregnancy (ie, the 'parthood view'). Further, Robinson assumes that to have bodily rights, one must be functionally independent from others' bodies. I argue that this is false. Second, I argue that the same duties listed by Robinson-which he claims apply to infants-apply to fetuses too. By Robinson's own lights, therefore, we should conclude that fetuses (like infants) have bodily rights. Alternatively, we would have to explain the wrongness of harming fetuses along some other lines (ie, in a way that does not posit fetal rights). This would be unjustifiably ad hoc. Hence, Robinson fails to provide compelling reasons to support the claim that abortion and infanticide are morally distinct.

### The evolution of professionalism in medicine and radiology [^242edb24]. Academic Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Professionalism and ethics are difficult to define, and it is often a case of "you know it when you see it". In recent years, there have been calls to renew the focus on professionalism and ethics and their teaching in the medical and allied professions, part precipitated by a perceived and probably real decline in doctors' professional values. Medical professionalism has evolved markedly in the last couple of centuries and continues to change today at a rapid pace, spurred by technological advances and generational change. The reasons to promote medical professionalism include regulatory requirements, aligning our professions' outcomes and behaviors, and the moral imperative that being professional is the right thing to do. Radiologists should emphasize, model, and teach professionalism to our colleagues, allied personnel, and trainees whenever opportunity permits. Medical students now receive teaching in professionalism and ethics throughout their training, and there is a need to continue training formally and informally during residency training. Faculty or those charged with teaching professionalism will need to first understand what constitutes medical professionalism, and here we attempt to define and outline what professionalism looks like in practice. The article concludes with a summary of the opportunities within radiology practice, with examples, for us to exhibit professional actions, values, and ideas.

### Framework for evaluation research on clinical ethical case interventions: the role of ethics consultants [^50a2875c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

This does not imply that there are no conflicting values in ethics. First, the criterion of explicit normativity refers to the definition of ethics as 'considering all relevant interests' compared with value perspectives that do not. And again, as with the first difference, the continuum is gradual. While in medical interventions different functional perspectives can be — and often are implicitly — weighed against each other, ECC mark the other end of a continuum between a singular functional perspective and the explicit consideration of a more universal perspective. Second, this does, however, not mean that there are no considerable differences about the idea of a non-partisan standard itself. Especially in pluralistic societies, a variety of different concepts of ethics can been set into place. This reflects the considerable differences which exist regarding the question what ethics is actually about, what its basic principles are (if there are any) or what its procedures of deliberation might be, suggesting, of course, different approaches to consider what ought to be done.

### Forced to be free? Increasing patient autonomy by constraining it [^67ddb6f8]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2014). Low credibility.

Informed consent and liberal individualism

In promoting informed consent to the central place it occupies in medical ethics, the discipline is in step with central currents in liberal political thought. Liberal thought is characterised, naturally enough, by its emphasis on the liberty of the individual. Normal adult human beings are conceived by liberals as having the right and the capacity to make choices that advance their own significant projects. The role of the state, with regard to this conception of the individual, is to promote and harmonise the choices of free individuals. The limits of each individual's liberty are defined by the rights of other individuals: each of us is free to choose how to live and how to act, subject to restrictions stemming from respect for other individual's identical rights.

For liberals, the primacy of individual liberty entails a respect for the private sphere. The role of the state is to allow each of us to pursue what Rawlscalls our 'conception of the good'; our notion of what kind of life is valuable (a religious life or a hedonistic life, a life of devotion to good works or to knowledge, a life centred around family and so on). Liberals believe that the state must be neutral with regard to conceptions of the good, neither favouring any nor restricting any (so long as they respect the rights of others to pursue their own conceptions of the good). Different liberals offer different justifications of this neutrality: perhaps we cannot confidently judge the worth of rival conceptions of the good, perhaps people have a moral right to be wrong, or perhaps a profusion of what Millcalled 'experiments in living' is instrumentally valuable insofar as it allows for the assessment of different conceptions.

### Therapeutic privilege: between the ethics of lying and the practice of truth [^230b13f0]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2010). Low credibility.

The 'right to the truth' involves disclosing all the pertinent facts to a patient so that an informed decision can be made. However, this concept of a 'right to the truth' entails certain ambiguities, especially since it is difficult to apply the concept in medical practice based mainly on current evidence-based data that are probabilistic in nature. Furthermore, in some situations, the doctor is confronted with a moral dilemma, caught between the necessity to inform the patient (principle of autonomy) and the desire to ensure the patient's well-being by minimising suffering (principle of beneficence). To comply with the principle of beneficence as well as the principle of non-maleficence 'to do no harm', the doctor may then feel obliged to turn to 'therapeutic privilege', using lies or deception to preserve the patient's hope, and psychological and moral integrity, as well as his self-image and dignity. There is no easy answer to such a moral dilemma. This article will propose a process that can fit into reflective practice, allowing the doctor to decide if the use of therapeutic privilege is justified when he is faced with these kinds of conflicting circumstances. We will present the conflict arising in practice in the context of the various theoretical orientations in ethics, and then we will suggest an approach for a 'practice of truth'. Last, we will situate this reflective method in the broader clinical context of medical practice viewed as a dialogic process.
